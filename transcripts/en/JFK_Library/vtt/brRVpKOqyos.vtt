00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.850
- Thank you, Steve, for your introduction.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.160
Your honor, distinguished
guests, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.970
I heard that there were
new citizens from Iran,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.060
Afghanistan, Egypt,
and others, and Turkey,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.884
so I'd like, in their language, to say

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:22.801
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.403
We're delighted you are citizens
of the Unites States now.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.390
My fellow immigrants,
citizens, and Americans:

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.890
I previously participated
in two similar events.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.384
The first being my own
naturalization ceremony

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:42.837
in Philadelphia where
our nation's independence

00:00:42.837 --> 00:00:46.490
and Constitution came into existence.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.017
Then, years later, I spoke
to a group of new citizens

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:54.170
at Monticello, in Virginia,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.180
where the author of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.210
Thomas Jefferson, built his home.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.480
Today, I'm honored to be in Boston,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.680
at the John F. Kennedy Library,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720
Designed by I. M. Pei,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.750
internationally known Chinese-American

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.650
architect who designed this building.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.010
Next to this harbor that has
welcomed so many immigrants

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.710
in the nineteenth century,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.163
including the ancestors of
the late John F. Kennedy.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.062
President Kennedy knew
firsthand that America was both

00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:33.350
and continues to be a
nation of immigrants.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.990
He wrote a book on the
subject, as you heard,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.890
entitled A Nation of Immigrants.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.730
Later, as the President
of the United States,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.930
he was a constant champion
of immigrants and refugees,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.270
never forgetting that he, too,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.850
came from a family of immigrants.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.090
He laid the foundation for
the Immigration Act of 1965,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.040
which placed the American
Dream within reach

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.067
of people from every nation on earth.

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:05.490
As was demonstrated a while ago.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.410
I was deeply fortunate
that the United States

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.680
welcomed a multitude of
international students

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.213
to receive their education in our country.

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:17.870
While studying at Stanford, I met my wife.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.630
We're married and living in London

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.500
the same year as John
F. Kennedy was elected.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.730
I will never forget that night.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.650
For hours, we followed
the election returns

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.470
from United States,
putting coins into a radio

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.470
to hear the latest dispatches
from Radio Luxembourg.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.650
Because the election was so close,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.080
we used up all of our change.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.170
We were broke, newlyweds,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.989
but everything felt so terribly exciting,

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.000
as if the future of the
world was up for grabs.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We were thrilled that such a
gifted young man and idealist

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.820
had been elected to the
nation's highest office,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.400
and we celebrated the fact
that the election demonstrated

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.390
that the United States
had overcome yet another

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.600
great obstacle, transcending
a century of prejudice.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.330
Let me explain.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.748
In the 1850s, a powerful
political movement

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:19.780
swept our country,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.960
urging politicians to
restrict immigration.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.210
Their party was called the
party of Know-Nothings.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.830
They particularly disliked
Catholics and the Irish.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.975
In other words, the very ancestors

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:37.860
of the President whose legacy
is preserved in this library.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.930
But, thank God, throughout our history,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.012
we have also had great leaders, idealists,

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:49.012
and patriots who rejected the
idea of a constricted America,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.020
defined by bloodiness, religion, and race.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.430
For example in 1858, none
other than Abraham Lincoln,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.650
our first Republican President,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.890
argued that America's
ideals were available

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.580
to all who understood
the principle set forth

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.900
in the Declaration of Independence:

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.777
namely, that "We hold these
truths to be self-evident,

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:17.370
"that all men are created equal."

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.010
All men.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.525
He reminded the newcomers to America

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:25.827
that they have, as Lincoln
put it, a right, and I quote,

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:29.553
"To claim it as though they
were blood of the blood,

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.557
"and flesh of the flesh
of the men who wrote

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:36.460
"the Declaration, and so they are."

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.940
End of the quite.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.770
The founders of our nation did not claim

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.540
that they had created
a more perfect union,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.340
but rather they had created
a framework and foundation

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.100
for a just society,
setting guiding principles

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.250
for future generations.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.490
That's not to say that the
ideals our country set forth

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.155
were always upheld.

00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:01.860
Because throughout our
history men and women

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.210
have fought bitterly, and
occasionally violently,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.170
over the promise of America, its laws,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.840
and its institutions, and
have sacrificed their lives

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.740
to preserve this county.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.050
Like you, America did not and does not

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.323
rest on its past laurels.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.460
It moves forward, knowing its
imperfections and limitations,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.200
yet always working to overcome them.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.193
Equality, justice, the supremacy of law,

00:05:33.193 --> 00:05:38.193
a representative government
predicated on true democracy,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.680
the respect for the intrinsic
worth of the individual

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.368
and the acknowledgment
of individual rights

00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:48.740
embedded in the Bill of Rights.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.738
Namely, these values must be taught,

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:56.200
discussed and remembered
time and time again.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.460
We have to know our
history, now your history,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.640
and the evolution of
our republic, our legal

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.990
and economic systems as well
as our cultural heritage.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.797
This year also marks 150th anniversary

00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:11.970
of the 14th amendment,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.380
one of the most noteworthy
additions to the Constitution,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.033
which bears a special significance
for those gathered here.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.557
It states, and I quote,

00:06:23.557 --> 00:06:28.557
"All persons born or
naturalized in the United States

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.510
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.210
are citizens of United States."

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.420
It is thanks to that
amendment, we are here today.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.790
The declaration that all
men are created equal

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.196
was a revolutionary idea
in 1776 and still is.

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:48.360
The emergence of United States

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.170
constituted a challenge to the world,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.640
because ours was a new nation,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.210
founded upon the highest
ideals of the enlightenment,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.740
believing in the potential of human beings

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.160
to build a free society in
which the rule of law prevails,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.643
and no one is above the law.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.869
President Kennedy understood that freedom

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.960
is not simply a right, however.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.190
With it comes responsibility.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.580
Today we celebrate your
citizenship, but also to ask you

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.480
to accept the solemn obligations
that citizenship brings.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.286
Today's a rite of passage
for each one of you.

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:30.370
You will soon be a part of
something bigger than yourself,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.909
namely, the United States of America.

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:37.909
That is what I felt when
I was about to be sworn in

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.210
as a citizen of the United States.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.030
Like you, I was full of
joy, trepidation, and hope.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.097
I remember tears in my eyes as I swore

00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:52.555
that I would support and
defend the Constitution

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.423
and the laws of United States of America.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:08:01.440
I felt as if I were getting married again,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.170
and once more vowing my
devotion, until death us do part.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.073
As a citizen of United States,

00:08:08.073 --> 00:08:10.690
I have tried to live up to the challenge

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.927
JFK so famously issued
to us, and you heard it,

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.867
and to the nation in
his inaugural address:

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:21.043
"Ask not what your country can do for you,

00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:23.820
"ask what you can do for your country."

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.653
So what can you,

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.098
this country's newest citizens,

00:08:31.098 --> 00:08:33.989
do for your adopted homeland?

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:37.492
Challenge us, help us to do better.

00:08:37.492 --> 00:08:40.490
As citizens of this
country we can, we must,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.450
participate in the work of our democracy.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.830
In the routine of our democracy.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.660
That means undertaking a
myriad of small actions,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.810
most of which do not take
place on election day.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.290
Read, learn, listen to
others, help your neighbors,

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.370
speak out against injustice, and vote.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.380
Study our nation's glorious
past as well as its trials,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.620
tribulations, and tragedies.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.800
By doing so, you fulfill

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.393
your rights and obligations as citizens.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.367
Thomas Jefferson once described America as

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:22.780
"crusade against ignorance."

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.500
He believed that a nation

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.260
could not be both ignorant and free.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.620
If that is true, and I believe it to be,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.740
then we must all seek knowledge,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.470
understanding, and tolerance.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.500
Today, our history is a
great source of comfort

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.960
and inspiration in the
complex and conflicted world.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.680
Studying it will help us
recognize the difference

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.800
between wisdom and ignorance,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.220
between light at the end of tunnel

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.423
and the dangers of an oncoming train.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.890
In my own quest for knowledge,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.620
I still feel amazed at my good fortune.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.270
I am first-generation American-Armenian,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.180
born in Tabriz, Iran.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.480
I came from a rich civilization

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.620
with 2,500 years of history and culture.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.010
But as I journeyed from
an empire to a republic,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.810
I began to understand the power of freedom

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.220
and the rule of law and
the protections provided

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.900
by our Constitution and Bill of Rights.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.290
In the process, I realized
that becoming an American

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.780
did not mean discarding my culture,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.520
my faith, and my identity.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.810
I came to be a part of America,
not apart from America.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.130
I was glad to be included in America.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.963
I want to conclude with a few
words from another address

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:45.653
that I gave during my
naturalization ceremony.

00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:48.817
And I said the following,

00:10:48.817 --> 00:10:51.607
"We know America is not perfect,

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:54.167
"but we see it as perfectible.

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:58.567
"For us, America is not just
a past; it's also a future.

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:02.887
"It is not just an actuality,
it's always a potentiality.

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:07.552
"America's greatness lies in
the fact that all its citizens,

00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:10.477
"both new and old, have
an opportunity to work

00:11:10.477 --> 00:11:15.320
"for that potentiality,
for its unfinished agenda."

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.120
Here in this beautiful location by the sea

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.966
that President Kennedy loved,

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:24.520
I am reminded of a
quotation often attributed

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.450
from a contemporary of his,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.633
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.. who said, and I quote,

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:34.837
"We came in different ships,

00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:38.080
"but we are all in the same boat now."

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.160
We're all in the same
boat. The boat of America.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.603
Again, my most sincere
congratulations today.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.130
I'm delighted and honored that
you're your country's legacy,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.660
from United States of America.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.140
Thank you for being
citizens, good luck to you.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.015
We're very proud of you.

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:56.750
(applauding)
