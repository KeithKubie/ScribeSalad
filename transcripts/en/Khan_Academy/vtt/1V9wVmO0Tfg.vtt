00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.860
Over many videos now,
we've been talking

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.770
about how every interstellar
object is moving away

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.620
from Earth.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.530
And we've also been talking
about how the further something

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.104
is away from Earth,
the faster it's moving.

00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:14.520
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.260
to put a little bit
of numbers behind it,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.700
or even better conceptualize
what we've been talking about.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.420
So one way to think about it
is that, if at an early stage

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.910
in the universe, I were
to pick some points.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.590
So that's one point, another
point, another point,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.570
another point.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.130
Let me just pick nine points
so that I have a proper grid.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.860
So this at an early
stage in the universe.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.380
If we fast forward a
few billion years--

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.690
and I'm clearly not drawing it
to scale-- all of these points

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560
have all moved away
from each other.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.180
So this point is over
here-- actually, let me

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.530
draw another column,
just to make it clear.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.200
So if we fast forward
a few billion years,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.920
the universe has expanded.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.040
And so everything has
moved away from everything.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.030
And let me color
code it a little bit.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600
Let me make this point magenta.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.070
So this point, the
magenta point is now here.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.730
This green point has now moved
away from the magenta point.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.650
And now this blue point
has now moved away

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.370
from the magenta point
in that direction.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.370
And we could keep going.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.710
This yellow point is
maybe over here now.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.820
I think you get
the general idea.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.850
And I'll just draw the
other yellow points.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.250
So they've all moved
away from each other.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.500
So there's no center here.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.290
Everything is just expanding
away from things next to it.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.130
And what you can see here is not
only did this thing expand away

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.230
from this, but this
thing expanded away

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.300
from this even further.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.500
Because it had this expansion,
plus this expansion.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.280
the apparent velocity with
which something is expanding

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.620
is going to be proportional
to how far it is.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.110
Because every point in between
is also expanding away.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.640
And just to review a little
bit of the visualization

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.370
of this-- one way
to think of this,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.017
if you think of the universe
as an infinite flat sheet.

00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:12.600
You can imagine that
we're just taking

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
a sheet of, I don't
know, some type of sheet

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.700
of stretchy material and
just stretching it out.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.310
We're just stretching it out.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.230
That's if we kind of imagine
a more infinite universe that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.710
just goes off in
every direction.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.100
We're just stretching
that infinite sheet out.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.894
So it has no boundaries, but
we're still stretching it out.

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.310
Another way to visualize it--
and this what we did earlier

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.820
on-- Is you can imagine that
the universe is the three

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.350
dimensional surface of a
four dimensional sphere.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.100
Or the three dimensional
surface of a hyper-sphere.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.790
So at an early stage
in the universe,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.245
the sphere looked like this.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.310
And these points here--
that magenta point

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.950
is right over here.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.990
The green point is
right over there.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.570
Then we add the
blue point up here.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.400
And then let me just draw the
rest of the yellow points.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.465
And the yellow points are here.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.215
They're all on the
surface of this sphere.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.220
Obviously I'm only dealing
with two dimensions right now

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.820
and it's nearly impossible,
or maybe impossible,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.980
to imagine a three
dimensional surface of a four

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.990
dimensional sphere.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.340
But the analogy holds.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.030
If this is a
surface the balloon,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.250
or the surface of a
bubble, if the bubble

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.160
were to expand over a few
billion years-- and once again,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.840
not drawn to scale.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.960
So now we have a
bigger bubble here.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.430
This part of the surface
is all going to expand.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.790
So once again, you
have your magenta.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.630
You have your blue dot.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.580
You have your green
dot right over here.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.860
And then let me just
draw the rest in yellow.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.750
So they will have all
expanded away from each other

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.980
on the surface of this sphere.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.050
And just to make it clear
that this is a sphere,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.197
let me draw some contour lines.

00:03:58.197 --> 00:03:59.280
So this is a contour line.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.654
Just to make it
clear that we are

00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:05.500
on the surface of
an actual sphere.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.550
Now with that out of
the way, let's think

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.324
about what is the apparent
velocity with which things

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:11.990
are moving away?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.855
And remember, we're going have
to say, not only how far things

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.480
are moving away, but we're going
to say how far they are moving

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.120
away from-- if the
observer is us--

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.400
depending on how far
they already are.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.860
So what we're going
to do-- we could say

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.750
is-- let me write this down.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.860
All objects moving
away from each other.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:56.270
And the apparent
relative velocity

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.560
is proportional to distance.

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:06.250
And what I've just
written down here--

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.624
and this is why
I wrote it down--

00:05:07.624 --> 00:05:10.060
this is a rephrasing of,
essentially, Hubble's Law.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.485
And he came up with
this by just observing

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.860
that when he looks-- especially
the further out he looks,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.580
the more redshifted objects are.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.750
And not only were they
moving faster and faster away

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.050
from Earth, but they seem to
be moving faster and faster

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.660
away from each other.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.080
So this is just a
restating of Hubble's Law.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.260
Or another way to say
it is, from any point,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.590
let's say from the
earth, the velocity

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.510
that something
appears to be moving

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.220
is going to be some
constant times the distance

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.630
that it is away
from the observer.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.580
In this case, we
are the observer.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.849
And we put this little
zero-- so this H here

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.015
is called Hubble's Constant.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.770
And it's a very
non-constant constant.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.230
Because this constant
will change depending

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.950
on where we are in the
evolution of the universe.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.880
So we put this little zero
here, this little sub 0 right

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.130
over here, to show that this
is Hubble's Constant right now.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.940
And when we talk
about distance, we're

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.825
talking about the proper
distance right now.

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:26.620
And this has to
be very important

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.790
because that proper
distance is constantly

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.640
changing as the
universe expands.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.484
So the now will
actually change slightly

00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:35.900
from the beginning of this
video to the end of this video.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.217
But we could roughly say in kind
of our current period of time.

00:06:40.217 --> 00:06:41.800
And when we say
proper distance, we're

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.810
talking about if you
actually had rulers.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.110
And if you were to just lay
them down instantaneously--

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.010
obviously we can't do
something like that.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.077
But we can imagine doing
something like that.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:51.660
So that's what we're
talking about it.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.320
So just to give a sense of,
or do a little bit of math

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:04.331
of how fast things are
actually moving apart-- let

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:05.830
me actually write
it someplace where

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.410
I have more space--
the current Hubble

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:16.860
Constant is 70.6
plus or minus 3.1.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.200
So we have observed
some variation here.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.250
There is some error to
our actual measurements.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.310
Kilometers per second
per megaparsec.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.770
And remember, a parsec is
roughly 3.2, 3.3 light years.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.100
So another way to
think about it is,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.000
if this is where we are
in the universe right now.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.890
And if this object
right over here--

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:55.680
if this distance right over here
is one megaparsec, so 1 million

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.770
parsecs.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.470
Or 3.26 million light
years from Earth.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.080
So just so we have
a sense, this is

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.380
roughly 3.26 million
light years from Earth.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.510
Then this object will
appear to be moving away.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.100
Although it's not
moving in space,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.600
just the space that it's in
is stretching in such a way

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:25.960
that it looks to be moving
at, based on its redshift,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.260
70.6 kilometers per
second away from us.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.179
So this is a huge velocity.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.419
70.6 kilometers per second.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.120
So this is a pretty
fast velocity.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.160
But you have to remember,
this is over one megaparsec.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.525
The Andromeda galaxy is
not even a megaparsec away.

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.960
It is about 2.5
million light years.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.314
So it's about 0.7 or
0.8 of a megaparsec.

00:08:55.314 --> 00:08:56.730
So if you look at
a point in space

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.440
a little bit further than
the Andromeda galaxy,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.520
it will look to be,
right now, receding

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.652
at about 70.6
kilometers per second.

00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:06.610
But what if you were to
go twice that distance?

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.721
If you were to look at something
that's almost 7 light years

00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.220
away?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.810
2 megaparsecs away?

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:18.600
So if you were to look
at this object over here,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.880
how fast would that be receding?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.630
Well, if you just
look at it over here,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.860
it's 2 megaparsecs away.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.190
So it's going to be twice this.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.140
You're just going to
multiply its distance-- 2

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.080
megaparsecs times this.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.970
The megaparsecs cancel out.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:38.889
So 70.6 times 2 is-- it's
going to look to be moving,

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:39.930
It's not moving in space.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.010
Remember, space is
just stretching.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.220
So its velocity, It's apparent
velocity, will be 70.6 times 2.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.700
So that's 141.2
kilometers per second.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.040
And one question you
say, well how did Hubble

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.080
know-- you can observe the
redshift of objects moving away

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.690
from us.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.606
But how did he know that
they were moving away

00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:01.390
from each other?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.640
Well, if you were look at
the redshift of this object,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.469
and say, wow, that's moving away
is 70.6 kilometers per second.

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:08.510
And then you were to look
at the redshift of this

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.176
and say, wow, that's
moving away from us

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:13.430
at 141.2 kilometers per second.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.310
Then you also know that these
two objects are moving away

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.150
from each other at 70.6
kilometers per second.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.400
And we could keep doing this
over different distances.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.870
But hopefully this gives you
a little bit bigger sense

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.370
of things.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.994
And just remember, even though
I said this is a huge distance--

00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:35.420
a megaparsec is further than
it is to the Andromeda galaxy.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.720
The Andromeda galaxy is the
nearest large galaxy to us.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.220
There are some
smaller galaxies that

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.290
are closer to us that
are kind of satellite

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.580
galaxies around the Milky Way.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.690
But the Andromeda is the
nearest large galaxy to us.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.300
And we also know that we're
talking about hundreds

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.710
of billions of galaxies in
just the observable universe.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.910
So very quickly, as
you go near the edge

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.810
of the observable
universe, these velocities,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.920
the apparent distance at which
things move are moving away

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.136
from us, start to become
pretty significant.
