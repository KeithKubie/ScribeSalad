00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.420
Are you a victim of the overchoice effect?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.760
From clothes to phones to retirement plans,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.780
people today have an incredible amount of options to choose from.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.380
This is supposed to be a good thing, right?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.780
The more options there are, the easier it should be to find our perfect phone, jeans, or whatever else.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.560
In reality, studies have shown that having too many choices can actually have pretty negative consequences.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.740
This is called the overchoice effect.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.220
In 1974, the American Marketing Association published an article, first demonstrating this effect.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.440
Researchers, Jacoby, Speller, and Kohn, had subjects choose between a variety of laundry detergents.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.560
In the end, they found that when they presented subjects with more types of laundry detergent

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.120
and more information about the detergents, subjects ended up choosing worse products.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.000
An article published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed a similar study.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.160
Researchers, Iyengar and Lepper, provided subjects with a variety of jams.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.820
They discovered that, while more choices seemed appealing, customers were actually less likely to buy something the more options there were.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.320
And those that did buy something were less satisfied with their choice.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120
A capitalist society isn't looking too hot now, is it?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.400
For some reason, when people have more options they make worse decisions and feel dissatisfied with their choices.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.980
According to the psychologist, Barry Schwartz, the reason people feel worse when they have more options is that they are trying to pick the best option.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.540
Moreover, people will always feel like they had chosen, or could have chosen something better.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.900
Happily, the overchoice effect can be avoided.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.420
An article found that the overchoice effect can be reduced by other variables, like time.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.860
For instance, subjects who have more time to assess their choices don't experience dissatisfaction after making their choices.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.440
The Journal of Cognitive Psychology published an article expanding this research in 2016.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.400
They discovered that most other research on the overchoice effect only looked at adults, thus excluding other age groups.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.040
So they ran a study that looked at how the overchoice effect worked on children, teenagers, adults, and elders by means of the cookie study.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.600
At a restaurant in Italy, researchers set up different arrangements of cookies.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.280
A small display with fewer choices, and a large display with more choices.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.980
They randomly asked restaurant goers if they would like to participate.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.220
After the subjects were chosen, they were randomly assigned to the small display or the large display,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.580
where they had to choose a cookie, take a survey about how they felt about their choice, eat the cookie,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.820
and then take another survey about how satisfied they felt.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.060
The study found that while teenagers and adults both experienced the negative feelings associated with the overchoice effect,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.680
children and elders did not.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.800
The researchers concluded that this was probably because of their different approaches to making their decisions.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.500
Children usually have very strong opinions about their preferences and know exactly what they like.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.940
Elders tend to make choices that are 'good enough' and not 'the best.'

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.940
Adults and teenagers often try to pick what they think is the best option overall, which is why they become disappointed in the end.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.180
So, are you a victim of the overchoice effect?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.780
Do you try to pick the best option and feel
 unsatisfied when it's not perfect?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.960
If you do, try taking a different approach.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.400
It can help you more to pick up what's 'good enough' like elders do, or what appeals to you most individually.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.560
In the end, it's your choice.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.700
Comment below how you've managed to overcome the overchoice effect.
