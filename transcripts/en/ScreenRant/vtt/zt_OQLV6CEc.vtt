00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.850
Sometimes drugs and alcohol are referred to
as “social lubricant”.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.650
Meaning that in an awkward situation,it can
give us the boost we need to get through it.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.340
In the face of something scary, a little liquid
courage can make all the difference.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.869
Whatever you want to call it, everyone needs
a vice.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.240
Nobody puts themselves into more awkward situations
than an actor.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.859
And despite their often flawless appearance,
deep down, they get just as nervous as we

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:28.859
do.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.300
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Incredible Actors
Who Performed Under The Influence.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.150
Jennifer Lawrence
It’s easy to understand why actors are apprehensive

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.450
to appear in sex scenes.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.000
Going to bed with someone for the first time
is awkward, never mind in front of a room

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.140
full of cameras.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.790
And Jennifer Lawrence discovered this first
hand while filming the upcoming Passengers

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
with Chris Pratt.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.560
The actress was guilt-ridden at the thought
of fooling around with Pratt- who is a very

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.770
married man.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.500
Even though everyone, including Pratt’s
wife Anna Faris, understands that it’s all

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.700
fake, Lawrence couldn’t shake the nerves.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.080
And admitted to getting really drunk so she
could film the sequence.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.220
Audiences have long-wondered about the ethics
of Hollywood relationships, and as always,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.900
Lawrence’s down to earth personality gave
us a glimpse into how it’s done.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Plus, we can’t think of anyone we’d rather
fake-kiss more than Chris Pratt.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.780
Daniel Radcliffe
One well-documented pitfall of being a child

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.189
actor is that every teenage decision they
make happens in front of millions.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.921
Nobody wants to be remembered for the stupid
things they did while growing up, and it can

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.840
be impossible to learn tough life lessons
in private.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.619
As Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe began his
career at an early age.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.850
After experiencing success with the first
few films, he started to do what every teenager

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.140
does: party.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.909
But his relationship with alcohol got a out
of hand, and he’d occasionally come in to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789
work still drunk from the night before.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.479
The actor has acknowledged the experience,
saying that his habits at the time were unhealthy.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.299
And has been giving talks about it ever since.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.369
Anna Kendrick/Olivia Wilde
99% of the alcohol you see people drinking

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.450
on screen is fake.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390
It’s replaced with water or juice.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.399
As long as it looks the part, and the performer
can actually drink it, then that’s all that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.399
matters.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.319
But writer and director Joe Swanberg took
a different approach while filming his 2013

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.539
comedy Drinking Buddies.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.650
All of the beers on screen were real.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.079
Considering the movie’s title, and that
it’s set in a brewery, you can be sure the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.090
cast drank more than a few cold ones over
the course of filming.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.720
Olivia Wilde and Anna Kendrick were particularly
vocal about their positive experience on set,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.370
and admit to being more than a little tipsy
during a few scenes.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.170
Margot Robbie
When Margot Robbie sent in her audition for

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.439
The Wolf Of Wall Street, her managers told
her not to get her hopes up.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.130
Sure, the character had some nude scenes,
but the actress was a relative unknown.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.970
Plus, Scorsese doesn’t take casting lightly.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.349
So when the actress actually landed the role,
she was taken aback.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.430
Worried about a sex scene with mega star Leonardo
DiCaprio, Robbie turned to the liquid courage.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.090
She downed three shots of tequila in rapid
succession, and headed into the shoot with

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.090
more confidence.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.480
Plus, why should Leo’s character get to
have all the fun?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.340
The actress’ candidness about the situation
was refreshing, and reminds us all that even

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.659
the most beautiful people get nervous.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.049
Brad Pitt/Edward Norton
Filming a movie involves long hours, hard

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.849
work, and lots of manpower.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.360
Every production needs the opportunity to
blow off steam.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.660
But one night while everyone was relaxing,
Fight Club director David Fincher kept working.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.160
Fans of the movie will recognize the scene
where Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are drunkenly

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.750
hitting a couple of golf balls around.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.890
But they might not know that this part of
the movie was never in the screenplay.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.269
It was filmed by the director as the two actors
were having a drink (or six) to end the day.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.800
They were drunk for real, and repeating the
lines Fincher was reciting to them off screen.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.349
Everyone loves how it turned out, except for
the catering company who's truck was pelted

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.530
by golf balls.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.620
Shia LaBeouf
From Disney channel star to weird viral video

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.489
sensation, Shia LaBeouf has had his ups and
downs.

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.650
But some think the self-described “method
actor” went too far while working on 2012’s

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.650
Lawless.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.570
The movie tells the story of three men who
run a distillery during prohibition, and get

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.939
into some trouble with the law.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.090
Because of his method acting, LaBeouf insisted
on drinking moonshine in between takes for

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.739
a more realistic effect.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.330
The actor insists he never got too rowdy on
set, but one of his co-stars says otherwise.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.720
When asked about him during interviews, actress
Mia Wasikowska handled the whole thing pretty

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.890
politely.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.359
Even though it’s obvious from her answers
that they didn’t exactly see eye-to-eye.

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.260
And the moonshine might have had something
to do with that.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.110
Martin Sheen
Apocalypse Now is an incredibly well-known

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.110
movie.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.079
And the tumultuous conditions surrounding
it’s production are also notorious.

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.049
Crazy weather, mental breakdowns, and delay
after delay made it one of the most troubled

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.049
in history.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.470
Usually when things go wrong on set, it’s
worse for the crew than the actors.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.169
But in this case, everyone was in the same
boat.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.889
After months of living in those conditions,
actor Martin Sheen earned himself a drink.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.960
A scene taking place in a hotel room shows
him breaking down and punching a mirror.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.940
And according to director Francis Ford Coppola,
it was all real.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.250
Sheen was intoxicated the whole scene and
really did punch a real mirror.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.710
Which he payed for later with a messed up
thumb.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.370
Kevin Spacey
American Beauty is a movie about figuring

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.600
out who you want to be, and then being that
person.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.460
It follows the stories of one family, and
explores how our connections to each other

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.490
can erode or evolve over time.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.460
Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man at a crossroads.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.530
His performance is powerful, but it didn’t
start out that way.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.889
Director Sam Mendes said in an interview that
the key ingredient in getting Spacey to embody

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.740
Lester was to get him high.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.720
The director says that such a methodical and
calculated approach toward the character just

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720
didn’t work.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.930
And since Spacey is a details man, the only
way to bridge the gap was with a joint.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.169
The jazz cigarette he and Wes Bentley share
is a real one, and the movie is better for

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.169
it.

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.449
Jack Nicholson
Easy Rider is an ode to the great American

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.710
road trip, and focuses on two men who take
their motorcycles, and the audience, on an

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.710
adventure.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.919
Since its release in 1969, there’s been
a myth circulating about one of the films

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.060
stars, Jack Nicholson.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.630
The legend goes that during filming, he smoked
155 joints.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.871
And while the actor denies the number was
that high, he admits that he and everyone

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.069
else were all very baked during some portions.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:43.780
For example, while filming the campfire scene.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.870
Nicholson says he started that day trying
to act stoned, but ended it very stoned and

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.870
trying to look sober.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.569
And trying to keep it together while under
the influence is hard, even for Oscar-winners.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.669
Carrie Fisher
The seventies were a time where you could

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.900
throw a party and legitimately have no idea
who would show up.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.620
The stars partied hard.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.349
And when Carrie Fisher was shooting Star Wars,
so did she.

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.840
The actress has talked about working a full
day, then partying all night.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.919
And one night, The Rolling Stones showed up.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.400
As she tells it, Fisher called co-star Harrison
Ford to come join the fun, and he was happy

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
oblige.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.280
The two actors spent the night drinking and
stumbled into work the next morning.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.530
They didn’t get any sleep the night before
so they were not exactly in good condition.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.330
But they made it through the shoot, and lived
to tell the tale.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.580
What do you think?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.840
Did we miss any other incredible actors who
performed under the influence?
