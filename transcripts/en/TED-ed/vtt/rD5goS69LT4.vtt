00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.075
There's a play so powerful 
that an old superstition says

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:16.036
its name should never 
even be uttered in a theater,

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:21.676
a play that begins with witchcraft
and ends with a bloody severed head,

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:26.167
a play filled with riddles, prophesies,
nightmare visions,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.968
and lots of brutal murder,

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:34.537
a play by William Shakespeare sometimes
referred to as the "Scottish Play"

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:38.018
or the "Tragedy of Macbeth."

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:41.697
First performed at the Globe Theater
in London in 1606,

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:44.933
"Macbeth" is 
Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.194
It is also one of his most action-packed.

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:51.515
In five acts, he recounts a story
of a Scottish nobleman

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.381
who steals the throne,

00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:55.635
presides over a reign of terror,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.810
and then meets a bloody end.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.317
Along the way, it asks important questions
about ambition,

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:03.266
power,

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.311
and violence

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:08.721
that spoke directly to the politics
of Shakespeare's time

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.922
and continue to echo in our own.

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:17.212
England in the early 17th century 
was politically precarious.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:21.971
Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603
without producing an heir,

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:23.458
and in a surprise move,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:29.352
her advisors passed the crown
to James Stewart, King of Scotland.

00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:32.502
Two years later, James was subject
to an assassination attempt

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:35.632
called the Gunpowder Plot.

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:37.963
Questions of what made 
for a legitimate king

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:41.243
were on everyone's lips.

00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:44.593
So Shakespeare must have known
he had potent material

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:47.152
when he conflated and adapted the stories

00:01:47.152 --> 00:01:51.353
of a murderous 11th century 
Scottish King named Macbeth

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.432
and those of several 
other Scottish nobles.

00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:58.793
He found their annals
in Hollinshed's "Chronicles,"

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:03.325
a popular 16th century history
of Britain and Ireland.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.583
Shakespeare would also have known
he needed to tell his story

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:09.354
in a way that would 
immediately grab the attention

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:13.254
of his diverse and rowdy audience.

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:16.055
The Globe welcomed 
all sections of society.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.263
Wealthier patrons watched the stage
from covered balconies

00:02:19.263 --> 00:02:22.336
while poorer people paid a penny
to take in the show

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:25.715
from an open-air section called the pit.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:30.924
Talking, jeering, and cheering
was common during performances.

00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:36.545
There are even accounts of audiences
throwing furniture when plays were flops.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:40.015
So "Macbeth" opens with a literal bang.

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:42.946
Thunder cracks and three witches appear.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:44.466
They announce they're searching

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:48.345
for a Scottish nobleman 
and war hero named Macbeth,

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:54.126
then fly off while chanting a curse
that predicts a world gone mad.

00:02:54.126 --> 00:03:01.576
"Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air."

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:05.403
As seen later, they find Macbeth
and his fellow nobleman Banquo.

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:14.054
"All hail Macbeth," they prophesize,
"that shalt be king hereafter!"

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:16.745
"King?" Macbeth wonders.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:20.674
Just what would he have to do 
to gain the crown?

00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:23.215
Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:27.550
soon chart a course of murder, 
lies, and betrayal.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.991
In the ensuing bloodbath,

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.768
Shakespeare provides viewers with some
of the most memorable passages

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:35.172
in English literature.

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:40.565
"Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"
Lady Macbeth cries when she believes

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:44.675
she can't wipe her victim's blood 
off her hands.

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:49.266
Her obsession with guilt is one
of many themes that runs through the play,

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:52.676
along with the universal tendency
to abuse power,

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:56.280
the endless cycles of violence 
and betrayal,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.316
the defying political conflict.

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:01.521
As is typical with Shakespeare's language,

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:04.186
a number of phrases 
that got their start in the play

00:04:04.186 --> 00:04:08.886
have been repeated so many times
that they now feel commonplace.

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:12.014
They include "the milk of human kindness,"

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:14.257
"what's done is done,"

00:04:14.257 --> 00:04:16.520
and the famous witches' spell,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.177
"Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire burn, and caldron bubble."

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:28.579
But Shakespeare saves the juiciest
bit of all for Macbeth himself.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:32.998
Towards the end of the play,
Macbeth reflects on the universality of death

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.879
and the futility of life.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.187
"Out, out, brief candle!" he laments.

00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:42.401
"Life's but a walking shadow,

00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:47.207
a poor player that struts 
and frets his hour upon the stage

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.739
and then is heard no more.

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:54.437
It is a tale told by an idiot, 
full of sound and fury

00:04:54.437 --> 00:04:57.699
signifying nothing."

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.977
Life may be a tale told my an idiot,
but "Macbeth" is not.

00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:06.709
Shakespeare's language and characters
have entered our cultural consciousness

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.818
to a rare extent.

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:12.189
Directors often use the story
to shed light on abuses of power,

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.120
ranging from the American mafia

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.229
to dictators across the globe.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.610
The play has been adapted 
to film many times,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.870
including Akira Kurosawa's 
"Throne of Blood,"

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.201
which takes place in feudal Japan,

00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:28.569
and a modernized version 
called "Scotland, PA,"

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.531
in which Macbeth and his rivals

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:34.450
are managers of competing 
fast food restaurants.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.190
No matter the presentation,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.890
questions of morality,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.141
politics,

00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:42.612
and power are still relevant today,

00:05:42.612 --> 00:05:46.290
and so, it seems, 
is Shakespeare's "Macbeth."
