00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.510
The final issue is incorporating
direct into the physician's workflow.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.840
Earlier I showed you this and
mentioned the share button,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.400
as well as automated import of
the data into the recipient's EMR.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.920
These are examples of how HIT would
ideally be more finely tuned to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980
support efficient workflow.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.550
Absent them, the sending physician might
have to export the patient chart from

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.380
their EMR, start up their email program,
find the exported chart

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.830
in whatever folder it was placed, attach
it, address the email, and send it.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.260
That's pretty much the way you would
send an attachment using email.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.660
All of that, except for

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.650
addressing email by selecting the
intended recipient, could be automated.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.000
At the receiving end, a similar but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.250
essentially reverse
process could be avoided.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.610
Moreover, were the attached
patient summary in XML,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.330
as we suggested earlier, it could
be parsed, so that, for example,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.770
Marla's blood pressure, pulse, heart
rate, blood sugar level, and so on,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.290
could into the appropriate fields
in the recipients EMR, saving still

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.270
more time and eliminating potential
sources of transcription error.
