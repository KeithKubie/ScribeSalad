00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.746
Up to this point, we've learned many ways to solve quadratic equations. In this

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:08.036
lesson, we'll use those same techniques to solve problems involving area and

00:00:08.036 --> 00:00:12.738
perimeter. Now, remember area is the amount of space in square units that a

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:16.573
closed plane figure takes up, whereas the perimeter is the distance measured

00:00:16.573 --> 00:00:22.670
around the object in units. We could be measuring in feet, in miles or even in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.620
inches. As a quick review, what are the equations for the area and the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.852
perimeter for these two rectangles? Write the expression for the area here, and

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:36.090
write the expression for the perimeter here. Also, be sure you use the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.000
variables w and l in each of the expressions. Good luck.
