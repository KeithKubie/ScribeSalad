00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.420
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.643
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:14.016
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.820
- Welcome to our
Conversation with History.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.880
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.170
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
Our guest today is Sidney Altman,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
who is the Sterling Professor
of Molecular, Cellular,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.320
and Developmental Biology and
Chemistry at Yale University.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.857
He received the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1989

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.270
and is the 2010 Hitchcock
Professor at Berkeley.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.300
Professor Altman, welcome to the campus.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.640
- It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.410
- Montreal.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.000
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.993
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.420
- That's a difficult question

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.973
in terms of shaping my
thinking about the world.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.420
I think they were very
focused on education

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.410
as the path to improvement.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.580
They were essentially
penniless immigrants to Canada

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.623
and they felt that education
was the path to the future.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.883
In terms of, let's say,
social interactions,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.600
I grew up essentially in
an immigrant community

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.560
with values that had been talked about

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.833
in many different contexts.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.010
It was a Jewish community

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.900
and we had all the appropriate
social and cultural values

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.923
of that community.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.930
- And books were very important?

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.305
Reading?

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:11.380
Did they open a world up to you?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.877
- Yes, they certainly did,

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:16.070
and reading was extremely important to me.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.550
As soon as I learned how to read,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.433
which was a fairly young age,
I was obsessed with reading.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.780
Occasionally, we went to
the local public library

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.410
to pick up books.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.603
My mother and I went.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.020
And there was no inhibition to doing that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.460
or to acquiring more books.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.600
There weren't too many
books in our house actually.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.880
My mother's father was
a rabbinical scholar

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.880
and he taught that in a
parochial school in Montreal

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.500
until, I don't know, he
was perhaps in his 60s

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.863
when he stopped doing that.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.800
And anything that I
wanted in terms of books,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.750
if it was not expensive,
we usually managed to get

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.873
one way or the other.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.449
So that went on for the rest of my life

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.250
and reading is still my
main hobby, I would say.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340
- And were you reading about science

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.900
or were there other
things that turned you on

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.530
to the possibilities of being a scientist?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.713
- I wasn't reading about science.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.373
I was reading anything
I could get my hands on.

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:32.116
The culture that I was
being brought up in,

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:34.550
and I'm not talking
about the Jewish culture,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.150
was, of course, a new one for our family,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.750
and my parents were
working in that culture,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.903
but I had to learn about it, too.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.850
There were some aspects
of science involved

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.850
and I remember reading
at one time a book that,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.600
maybe I was five years
old when I was given it,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.290
about various famous people

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.800
and there were a few scientists there

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.773
and then the prominent one, of
course, was Albert Einstein.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.880
And then I think we had
some encyclopedias around.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.400
When I was a little older,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.300
my brother was three
years older than I was,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.560
so perhaps when I was seven or eight,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.970
we got a set of the Book of Knowledge,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.300
which you may be familiar with, maybe not.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.820
And I just read through
it from time to time

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.070
and maybe picked up some
things about science.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.100
In fact, I know I picked up
some things about science,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.980
and there were thoughts of my own

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.603
about what goes on in nature,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.870
and I would say it was
when I was perhaps 12 or 13

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.870
when I began to read in a
little more focused fashion

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.340
about science.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.770
- And did you have any teachers
before you went to college

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.770
who really sorta turned you on to science

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.680
beyond what you had been reading?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.136
- Absolutely not.

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:06.937
(Harry laughs)

00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:07.770
- [Harry] Okay.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.660
- My teachers were regular,
unremarkable teachers.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.420
- And what about events in the world?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.615
'Cause you must've been about seven when--

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:18.448
- [Sidney] Six.

00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:19.693
- Six when the war ended,

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:22.020
and talk a little about that,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.860
because did that have an effect,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.020
even as a young person, what
you could pick up in the papers

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.800
about what science had
done with the atomic bomb?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.633
- Absolutely.

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:35.060
There were, let's say, two
events which were important

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.993
in terms of increasing
my interest in science,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.610
and one of them was the
ending of the war in Japan

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.610
and the atomic bomb, and I
clearly remember pictures

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.520
in the Sunday newspaper
that came out very shortly

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.280
after the bomb was exploded of
a picture of a bomb explosion

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.580
and it probably was a
picture of what happened

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.623
at the test site in New Mexico,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.650
but there was a lot written about the bomb

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.150
and the function that scientists played

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.180
in developing atomic weapons

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.180
and principally how it related
to Albert Einstein's work.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.730
So I figure that was important

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.113
and I figured nuclear
physics was important,

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.400
and I should say the war
was a very important event

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.850
or series of events in my life

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.840
because my parents, my father listened

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.690
to the radio every day, to the news,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.640
and I was there and there was
a lot of discussion of the war

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.220
in our house.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.690
And then when I was 12
or 13, I was given a book

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.310
which was a very good and interesting book

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.820
and still exists, I believe.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.470
It certainly exists in libraries,

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:57.090
and I'm not sure if it is
in print or not right now.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.230
It was called Explaining
the Atom by Selig Hecht,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.600
who was, I later found out,
a professor at Columbia.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.780
Maybe it said it on the book,

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.530
but I didn't realize it 'til later.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.060
And that was explaining what
the properties of an atom were,

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.010
what the structures were,
what the periodic table was,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.848
and to some extent,

00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:26.510
I think it said something
about the making of the bomb,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.420
but it was written for lay people

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.240
and I found it perfectly understandable

00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.050
and I found it quite exciting, too,

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.543
especially the description
of the periodic table.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.320
- And then what led you as
a Canadian to think about

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.910
going outside Canada to do
your undergraduate work?

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.480
- Well, in fact,
virtually everybody I knew

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.290
did their undergraduate
work at McGill in Montreal,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.290
and nobody left home to go to university,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.240
nobody that I knew anyway,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.783
because to go to the
States cost a lot of money.

00:08:04.754 --> 00:08:08.590
In fact, I never even thought
of going to the States.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.240
But a friend of mine in
high school wanted to study

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.010
aeronautical engineering,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.550
and they didn't offer it at McGill,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.040
and he said, well, I'm
applying to an American school.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.690
Why don't you just keep me
company and apply with me?

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.360
And the first step in that application

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.230
was take the SAT exams,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.403
which we normally didn't do in Canada.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.750
So we sort of registered
to take the SAT exams

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.150
and one Saturday afternoon,
we went down to McGill

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.963
where there was a room reserved for that.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.030
Excuse me.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.393
And we took the exam.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.660
And later I found out that I
got into, as it turned out, MIT

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.223
and he didn't, which
was unfortunate for him,

00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:54.090
and that was the only
school we applied to,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.170
and I knew very little about it

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.820
until we ordered whatever
material they were sending out

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.209
and I read about it

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:05.793
and it sounded like a
pretty exciting place.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:11.890
So in our family, we
reached another crisis

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.550
when the letter came admitting me,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.540
because it was clear I
was going to go to McGill

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.250
at no cost whatsoever,
and the question is,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.940
could we afford to send
me, essentially, to MIT?

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.020
At that time, MIT didn't
give any scholarship aid

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.950
to foreign students,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.223
and we were definitely
foreigners in Canada.

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:41.598
So for, essentially, the only
time that I can remember,

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.930
my parents sat down and
had a serious discussion

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.523
about what should be done,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.280
and my father ultimately
agreed that I should go

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.423
and I should do my best
to win a scholarship.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.863
So I went.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.980
- And how different was
America from Canada back then?

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.100
And what was MIT like
as a place for somebody

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.630
who had led a relatively
sheltered existence in Canada?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.673
- Well, I think, first of all,

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:25.350
I have to separate the two questions.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.163
One is MIT, the other
is Canada and the US.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.510
Although I grew up in a certain community,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.393
I don't think I led a sheltered life.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.773
It was a different time and
Montreal was a big city.

00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:43.290
I believe there were over a
million people in the city

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.980
at that time, or very close to a million.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.543
Now it's much larger.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.300
And you could travel everywhere.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.870
As a child, you got on
a bus or a streetcar,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.140
the streetcars in the
streets at that time,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.230
and literally you could
travel all over the city

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.010
and you told your parents
where you were gonna go

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.960
and approximately what
time you were gonna be back

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.410
and that was no problem at all.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.410
So I saw a good part of what
was going on in the city

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.820
and certainly when I was in high school,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.820
I did my best to appreciate
what was going on in the city,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.163
and especially with respect
to the French culture.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.630
Although I was in essentially
an English speaking family

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.630
growing up, we learned French
at a very early age in school,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.280
and I was interested in that.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.040
I took part as much as
I could in the culture

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.362
and in street fights along the way.

00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:48.000
(Harry laughs)

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
- Which I guess was useful

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.197
when you became a scientist later.

00:11:51.197 --> 00:11:52.680
(laughs)

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.883
- Actually, you're more than correct.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.860
- Stand for what you think is important.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.320
- Stand and figure out

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.683
how to get the advantage in some ways.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.780
So it wasn't as if, I'm
speaking out of turn right now,

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.850
it wasn't as if I approached
my scientific career

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.940
as one long fight of one kind or another,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.217
but there were situations
where there were various events

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.575
that impinged on me

00:12:24.575 --> 00:12:29.070
that arose my supposed fighting instincts,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.620
and we can talk about that later.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.720
So that's one aspect.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.540
Now with respect to coming to the States,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.950
life was pretty similar
in Canada and that States.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.580
However, there were differences
in our education, too.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.370
I would say that I learned
things in high school

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.083
which they paid no attention to,

00:12:49.448 --> 00:12:50.281
and this had to do with matters

00:12:50.281 --> 00:12:51.910
outside of the United States.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.470
They knew nothing about, essentially,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.110
what was going on outside
of the United States.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.300
- The students at MI--

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.364
- Yes, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:04.100
- And they knew things in high school,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.760
they went a little further
than I did in high school,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.170
and I had to catch up there,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.460
but I also was a year younger
than the other students.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.460
We only had 11 grades of
school in Quebec at that time.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.480
I found MIT to be, almost
from the first day,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.183
a very exciting place,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.530
and initially, it was
because of the students.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:34.530
Every student I met was very
smart in many different ways

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.573
and some of them were slightly
crazy in a good sense.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.500
One could lead one's life

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.883
with a tremendous amount of humor there.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.620
So day to day, there was a lot happening

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.750
and it was very stimulating.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.110
And, of course, then
there were the teachers

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.880
who were quite good, so
that was no problem at all,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.143
and as time went on,

00:14:06.552 --> 00:14:08.420
and one made more
contact with the faculty,

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.340
it was apparent that
you could learn a lot.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.680
- And you majored in physics?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.680
But then toward the
end, the last semester,

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.630
you took a course in
biology and microbiology?

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.463
- No.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.350
In the last semester of your senior year,

00:14:37.455 --> 00:14:38.320
you knew you were gonna graduate.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.650
You had enough credits and all that,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.990
and so you could sort of fool around

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.970
and do whatever you want.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.150
There was a new course

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.610
and it was called, I think, biophysics

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.042
or something like that.

00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:51.980
It was taught by Cyrus Levinthal,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.110
who had recently come to MIT,

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.143
and it was a very elementary
survey of modern biology.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.980
Up to that point, there was
no real modern biology at MIT.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.270
It was sort of a
classical biology subject.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.479
- And this would be what year?

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:12.396
- That would be the spring of 1960.

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:19.693
So this told you something
about DNA and RNA,

00:15:21.178 --> 00:15:24.803
and process of information
transferent cells,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.440
and it was a short course.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.510
It wasn't too deep,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.010
but I did learn something
about biology from that.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.010
Well, molecular biology, put it that way.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:42.010
- And then, so physics was
an important foundation,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.630
but I guess the MIT
education and your background

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.803
prepared you to sorta look at
new and different pathways.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.660
- Well, I can't say that I
wouldn't have done that anyway,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.150
but MIT certainly enhanced
that considerably,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.990
and I think what you
graduated with from MIT

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.700
was an idea that the
whole world was out there

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.860
and you could go out and
challenge it in any way.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.920
And to some extent,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.880
that led to a little bit
of overconfidence, I think,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.340
which is probably not appropriate,

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.170
but it made you do things that
you wouldn't ordinarily do.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.600
- Let's talk now about being a scientist.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.323
You made some references to that earlier.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.340
The first question that comes to mind,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.240
what do you think are the
skills and the knowledge base

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.240
that you need to be fluent
and to then make these choices

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.423
about which direction you wanna go?

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.420
- Well, I can tell you a little bit

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.300
about what was important to me,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.363
and some of it comes from MIT.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.710
I think that one thing you learned at MIT

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.690
and perhaps one had a reservoir from that

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:10.590
that was sort of untapped, was
the feeling that you had to

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.470
look carefully at everything
happening in the world

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.830
around you and especially
in whatever science

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.440
you were doing,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.810
and treat it with a certain amount

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.683
of deliberate, hard judgment.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.530
Also, another thing that I
learned was to be careful

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.833
about taking data.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.190
You took data and you
looked at it carefully

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.680
and you didn't throw any of it away

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.053
and it could all be useful.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.560
I think, as a graduate
student, I learned more

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.560
about being very hard-nosed
about looking at the problems

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.520
you were interested in,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.363
and that I took from my PhD supervisor,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.300
who insisted on that.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.300
- And who was that?

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.900
I mean, was he influential in pushing you

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.460
in the direction you finally went?

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.293
- [Sidney] No.

00:18:03.293 --> 00:18:04.330
- No?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.364
- No, the direction I finally went in

00:18:06.364 --> 00:18:11.364
resulted from a serendipitous
number of happenings,

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.290
but the person who I wound
up doing my thesis actually

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.000
in Colorado, in a small
department of biophysics

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.653
at the medical school in Denver,

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:30.930
and the person who was my
supervisor is Leonard Lerman,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.963
and he was a student of
Linus Pauling's at CalTech.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:40.030
So he was a pretty serious
guy in terms of science.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.363
He was, still is, an excellent scientist.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.840
I don't know what you want from me,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.570
where I should continue from there.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.570
- Well, it's intriguing the
extent to which you move across

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.503
these fields, and I'm curious as to,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.290
does this suggest that a
basis in all of these sciences

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.710
become important as the sciences converge?

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.740
Or is it really up to
the individual to draw on

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.590
what his background is in
terms of what he's studied?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.460
- I think it's up to
the individual, really.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.080
But, in fact, I went to Columbia

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.040
in graduate school in physics

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.143
and I didn't like it at all.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.770
And that became apparent
in my second year,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.593
where I quit after the first semester.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.730
I had a great time and I
thought I did a good job

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.773
on my senior thesis at MIT,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.150
and I wanted to be an
experimental scientist,

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.510
and there was just no opportunity
to do that at Columbia,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.420
nothing that I was aware of, anyway,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.000
and it seemed to me that would
have to wait for three years

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.760
and take courses in the
meantime and pass exams

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.080
before I got to that point,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.740
and I got a little upset
by that and I quit,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.490
probably before they'd kick me out,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.640
and I went home and tried to get involved

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.470
in the world of writing in different ways,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.540
and then somebody who had
been one of my professors

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.670
at Columbia remembered I
could write and called me up

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.770
and got me a job as a science writer

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.923
for a new institute in Boulder, Colorado.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.930
And he indicated that I could attend

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.490
the summer institute in physics there,

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.743
so I went out there,

00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:44.090
and I had a job.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.240
I attended the summer
institute in physics.

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:49.346
I took courses in physics.

00:20:49.346 --> 00:20:52.530
It was all very refreshing, I should say,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.480
and by that, I mean the whole atmosphere

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.690
towards going to school
was completely different

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.623
from the East.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.203
Students seemed relaxed and happy.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.770
So I did those things
and during the summer,

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.620
I met George Gamow at a party.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.690
He was a very famous physicist.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.530
I don't know if you know the name.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.210
He wrote several books that
were sorta science fiction.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.080
They were the Mr. Tompkins books

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.943
and The Fantastic Voyage, a
movie which was very successful,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.490
was essentially plagiarized
from one of Gamow's books

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.130
and he was fighting it
in court at that time

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.260
and he won that battle.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.690
Anyway, he was a very
interesting and exciting person.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.010
He was a Russian emigre,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.010
constantly in fear that
the NKVD was after him,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.003
and he was a confirmed alcoholic.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.690
I learned partly all of this

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:51.910
because I became friendly

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.383
with his son and daughter-in-law
while I was there.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.660
And I met Gamow at a party

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.660
and I had perhaps knew at some point

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.790
that he made some contribution

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.023
to understanding something about DNA,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.300
and, in fact, he had
contributed an interesting idea.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.030
So we were just talking at the party,

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.190
and he suggested that if I was
interested in these things,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.880
I should contact the department
of biophysics in Denver

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.650
and just go down to speak
to them, which I did,

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.920
and on that afternoon,
I met Leonard Lerman

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.637
and by the time we'd finished talking,

00:22:31.637 --> 00:22:34.883
we'd more or less decided that
I would become his student.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.293
- Which then led you on
the path that you took.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.270
- I should say that these
essentially were my decisions.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.560
- Right, right.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.560
So it was finding in your
environment the things

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.833
that interested you.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.370
- The appropriate environment
for learning something,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.410
which I felt I did not have at Columbia,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.163
and in this small department,
I felt it was there,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.430
and then pursuing something
that seemed was interesting.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.090
- Now what about the
character of a scientist?

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:18.910
What are the virtues, the qualities?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.500
You made reference to that earlier.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.500
Let's talk a little about that,
that make the problem solver

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.433
that you are strengthened in this process.

00:23:32.684 --> 00:23:35.370
- Well, I would say that
there a some common properties

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:40.370
that one can refer to, which
must exist in most scientists.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.330
But aside from that,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.720
scientists are just the same, general part

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.420
of the population as any other
sample of the population is,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.370
and it took me a little
while to realize that.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:56.240
I thought science was a
little bit above the rest

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.300
of the population in terms of its respect

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.366
for good and evil and honesty.

00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:03.199
(Harry laughs)

00:24:03.199 --> 00:24:04.310
And I learned that wasn't true.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.020
But the fact is, what you
just described is real.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.270
You have to be a problem solver.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:15.050
You have to have discipline and control

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.080
and perseverance, and
all with capital letters.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.930
- And curiosity, I guess?

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.233
- Yes, certainly.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.493
Some people are guided
more or less by that.

00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:32.930
- Let's talk now about the work

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.230
that won you the Nobel Prize.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.873
You were a co-recipient of the prize.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.770
What problem were you dealing with

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.770
and what were you looking
for that led to that work?

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.680
- Perhaps the most important
part of all of that

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.700
was accidental.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.943
I wasn't looking for what I found,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.630
and so I can dismiss various
schools of philosophy,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.483
popular schools of philosophy
just by that statement.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.560
I did not have a genuine, logistical path

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.000
that led me one way or another.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I was working on a purification
of a certain enzyme

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.350
which I discovered because
of other work I had done

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.303
when I was a postdoc in England,

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.430
and we were trying to further
the purification along

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.363
when I went to Yale as
an assistant professor,

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.780
and our first unexpected finding

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.693
was that the enzyme had an RNA substrate,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.680
excuse me, an RNA subunit
as one of its components,

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.700
and that in itself was highly unusual

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.137
and it took a certain amount
of experimental diligence

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.590
to prove that, mostly supplied

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.083
by one of my graduate students, Ben Stark.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.960
And then it took even more of my care

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:21.460
to survive the assaults
of various colleagues

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.110
in the general community to
try and get it published.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.160
- Let's explain that a little.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.287
So you were working with RNA.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.760
Is that correct?

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.760
And help our audience, recall
to them what RNA is, yeah.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.820
- Well, I think most
people have some inkling

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.330
of what DNA is.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.560
That is, DNA is the material in your cells

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.120
which contain genetic information,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.840
and DNA generally appears

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.530
as a double-stranded helical
structure, very long,

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.920
and there are monomeric
subunits in the structure,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.640
and the sequence of the
monomeric subunits indicates

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.180
what the information is that's carried.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.283
RNA is not a double-stranded structure.

00:27:11.283 --> 00:27:14.040
It's a single-stranded molecule

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.770
that looks very much like DNA,

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.880
but is chemically
different in certain ways.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.793
But it has the same capacity
to carry information.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.630
And I was looking at a certain
species of RNA at that time

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.910
and the enzyme I found was capable

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.910
of cutting that piece of RNA
in a very specific place.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.750
So it was interesting
from the point of view

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:45.430
of understanding how this
RNA got used by the cell,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.693
the one that's what we call
a substrate for the enzyme,

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.790
and, of course, there
was some further interest

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.070
in understanding this new
enzyme which we found.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:00.130
- And what I would like to clarify

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.260
is the conventional wisdom at the time

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.260
was that RNA was only a
carrier of information.

00:28:10.062 --> 00:28:12.920
That was its function.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.480
- Absolutely.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.480
- And to go against that notion
was revolutionary in a way.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.100
- Well, first of all,
we showed, as I said,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.670
that the enzyme, Ribonuclease P,

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.640
which is what I was working
on, had an RNA subunit.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.640
So that, in a sense, was the
first distinction that we drew.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.830
So it meant that the
RNA had some function,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.150
seemingly had some function
other than information.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.610
But that's all we knew at that time.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.580
Then about six years later or
so, six or seven years later,

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.080
we showed in our lab, one of my postdocs,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.103
who was an absolutely brilliant woman,

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.880
showed that the RNA actually had

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.040
some catalytic function of its own,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.970
and that means that the RNA by itself

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.350
could carry out this reaction
over and over and over

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.870
without changing the RNA in any way.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.340
So that essentially
defined what a catalyst is.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.340
Just as you might define
chemically a catalyst as lead,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.070
when you added it to
gasoline in the old days

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:31.070
before lead was outlawed, the
lead increased the combustion

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.100
of gasoline drastically.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.390
So in this case, the RNA of
the enzyme was very active

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.783
in cleaving another piece of RNA.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.810
So that was the truly revolutionary move,

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:56.140
and that really upset a
notion that had been in place

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.363
for perhaps 150 years.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.563
Well, not 150, maybe 120 years,

00:30:02.563 --> 00:30:05.420
that was first annunciated by Pasteur

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.853
when he was the first person
to describe what an enzyme was,

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.370
to isolate enzymes.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.383
- Now going back to your
earlier work as a postdoc,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.770
'cause I read about that experiment

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.572
and it sounded interesting.

00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:26.572
You were the first one to
isolate an RNA by tracking it

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.233
across a gel.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.010
That was a very understandable experiment

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.260
and it seems like it was an important step

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.340
in what you later wound up showing.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.517
- Well, other people had isolated RNA,

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.033
very stable RNAs that we
knew were inside cells.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.810
But I succeeded in isolating
a pure species of a tRNA

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.733
that was radioactively labeled.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:59.180
I won't go into the labeling
procedure or why we did it,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.940
but we were able to
label the RNA with P32,

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.930
which is a common radioactive
isotope in use at that time.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.903
Still is in various ways.

00:31:11.738 --> 00:31:13.640
And all you had to do was
put whatever mixture you had

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.600
on a gel, which is essentially jello,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.600
of different composition and nature,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.340
and then you could put electrodes
at either end of the gel,

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.550
positive and negative, and run
an electric field on a gel,

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.720
and you knew what the charge of RNA was.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.283
It has a negative charge.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.520
And the RNA would run through the gel

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.930
and at a certain time,

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.083
you would turn off the electric field,

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.180
put a piece of saran wrap over the gel,

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.973
and on top of that, put a
photographic film in a dark room,

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.040
and wait a little while,
and develop the film,

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.483
and you would see a dark band
where the RNA was on the gel.

00:32:04.159 --> 00:32:09.159
And so we, I should say,
I succeeded in doing that,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.170
and some of my colleagues in the lab

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.583
were quite interested in this.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.070
Well, that was circumstantial evidence

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:23.620
that we actually had isolated
a single species of RNA.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.210
The next stage was to
extract that RNA from the gel

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:32.210
and if you put some
perforations in the gel

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.350
and in the film at the same time,

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.030
you could put the film on the gel

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.090
and you could cut out that
dark band from the gel,

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.630
depending upon where it was on the film,

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.360
and you could extract the RNA from that.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:50.050
And then you could do what is
called fingerprinting the RNA,

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.033
which is essentially a technique
invented by Fred Sanger,

00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:58.060
to characterize

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.430
the pieces of RNA that you isolated,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.650
and fingerprint means that you had

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.800
a unique identification of that RNA.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.490
And so several of my colleagues
were anxiously awaiting

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.640
this fingerprinting to know
exactly what was going on

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.880
and I had to avoid them
because I didn't want them

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.123
hovering over me when I did this.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.670
And I developed the gel

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:30.640
and it showed what I hoped it would show,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.530
and there were three or four of us

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.890
who were pretty excited by that.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.633
- And before we talk about
that moment of excitement,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.420
I wanna emphasize for our audience,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.890
so the presumption before was that

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.760
whatever catalytic
activity RNA was engaged in

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.960
was the result of a
protein that had carried,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.960
and this process, you, over
time, were able to isolate it

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.390
and demonstrate, no, that it was the RNA

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.680
that was the catalyst.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.817
- Yes, we took this piece of
RNA that I just described,

00:34:11.817 --> 00:34:14.067
which was a tRNA precursor,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.660
and we made crude extract of E. Coli.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.620
E. coli is a small bacteria
that grows in your gut,

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.780
completely harmless unless
it's in your bloodstream,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.620
and you just broke it
open in various ways,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.450
and you exposed this
to this tRNA precursor

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.290
and ran that on a gel.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.580
And instead of getting one
band in a certain position,

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.070
I got two bands because it
had been cut in one place.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.700
So the two bands indicated
there was an activity there,

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.450
which was the enzyme that cut the gel.

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:48.310
So then we purified the activity

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.380
and ultimately as you
purify it, you wanna get it

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:56.120
to the point where you
have, in principle, only one

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.320
or maybe a couple of bands of protein,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.180
because that's what we
thought was responsible

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.660
for the activity.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.430
But when we ultimately purified it,

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.270
we found one band of
protein and one band of RNA

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.993
and subsequently we show the
RNA was the actual catalyst.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:18.150
- So then what was your feeling like?

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.140
What were you feeling when you realized

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.553
aha, it did this by itself to simplify?

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.850
- It put in place a
lot of questions we had

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.780
about the problem we were working on.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.260
We had various ideas that we published

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.850
at one time or another
about what was happening,

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.993
and this indicated that we
finally understood the problem.

00:35:49.787 --> 00:35:51.750
It's as if you were banging
your head against the wall

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.190
and suddenly, you didn't
have to bang your head

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.000
against the wall 'cause you understood it,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.340
and so that was very satisfying.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.340
And from then on, a series
of experiments was suggested

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.730
that we just carried out
over the next few years,

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.730
but they weren't intellectually
demanding experiments.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.100
We knew exactly what had to happen.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.003
But that one moment where we understood

00:36:17.003 --> 00:36:21.630
that the RNA was a catalyst
was the principal excitement

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
in terms of some
confirmation of what we felt.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:33.210
But the fact was, it was
sort of an anticlimax

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.800
because it was a very difficult process

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.440
to go through the
previous five or six years

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.350
when essentially we were pummeled

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.430
from virtually every direction
about even the statement

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.253
that RNA was part of the enzyme.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.640
And that relaxed somewhat
when other people found

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.160
other particles that had RNA in them,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.320
that weren't catalytic,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320
but they had RNA in them,

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.850
and someone else tried to
disprove our experiment

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.090
by trying it in another bacterium,

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.830
but, in fact, he showed
that we were right.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.870
So I felt no pressure on that.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:20.750
But the final fact that
we showed that the RNA

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.243
was the catalyst was the,
as I said, anticlimactic.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.650
- And presumably during
this number of years

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.130
where what you were doing
was being questioned,

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.090
your street smarts from
Canada came into play,

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.483
as you resisted or continued on your work,

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.850
despite the criticism.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.210
- Yes, I think that's true.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.633
I can't say it was a happy time.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.960
But I was damn sure that
none of the guys out there,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.510
and I just edited the
language I was gonna use,

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.320
none of the guys out there

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.960
was going to beat me down over this

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.810
'cause I knew what I did was correct.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:07.420
And one of my first
postdoctoral mentors, Meselson,

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.723
who was at Harvard, I met him
at a meeting during this time,

00:38:14.227 --> 00:38:16.020
and he said, what was new?

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.080
And I told him what was new,

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.900
and I said, it's been very difficult

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.150
because nobody believes this,

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:26.150
and he's another extremely self-confident,

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.050
extremely intelligent person,

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.427
also a student of Linus Pauling's.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.550
He said, well, did you do all

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.350
the necessary control experiments?

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.100
Are you sure this has worked?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.910
You've done it many times?

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.880
I said, we've done everything
possible we could think of.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.450
It always gives the same result.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.670
We're sure that it's the case.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.800
He said, well, there's no problem at all.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.930
That's what nature is telling you.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.340
And then he said, and
somebody else will repeat it

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.830
and then everything will be fine.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.800
And I thought afterwards
that it was easy for him

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.850
to say that because I knew that he was

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:09.770
a very self-confident
and self-assured person,

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.840
and I said, well, maybe I'll
believe the same at some point.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.263
But he was absolutely right.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.143
- I read a quote from you.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:26.080
You were talking about
creativity or this process,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.010
and you made an interesting point,

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.390
which I would like for you to restate,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.980
which is that not only
did you solve your problem

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.980
of banging your head against the wall,

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.980
but also that it solved the
problems of other people

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.650
who were working in this area.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.290
I mean, in other words, that
somehow you opened up doors

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.693
that then made greater sense
of a number of other problems.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.560
- Well, that's certainly possible

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.100
and I should say that Tom Cech
at the University of Colorado

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.423
was working on a
completely separate system,

00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:07.340
and about a year before
we published our data

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.160
on the RNA as a catalyst,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.403
he came out with a very similar
experiment in his system,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:20.030
so that there was a feeling
now that what we had published

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.173
was probably true

00:40:22.173 --> 00:40:25.460
because Cech had a similar, not identical,

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.053
but a similar kind of result,

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:33.070
and one thing I did say was
that it would be obvious

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.180
that many more different kinds
of RNA would now be found

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.820
because you just had to
know how to look for them

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.430
in a certain way.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.890
It had been that people
only looked for RNAs

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.890
that were very stable and
present in large amounts in cells

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.210
like ribosomal RNA, which is
involved in making protein,

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.833
and transfer RNA, also
involved in making protein.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.580
But if there was concrete evidence

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.773
that there was RNA inside the cell,

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.830
although in very small amounts,

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.040
and you knew how to look for it,

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040
people would find it

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.720
and that would really open
up the field enormously.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.130
And, in fact, that is
exactly what happened.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.930
- Now the implications of this discovery,

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:21.500
let's talk about two of them.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.440
First, this has important implications

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.130
for the treatment of disease.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.460
How does that work?

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.423
- Okay, that is a
subsequent finding we had,

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.273
and it may turn out to be useful.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.130
What we found is that, usually
when you find an enzyme,

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:50.610
you try and find out exactly how

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.850
it recognizes the
molecules that it acts on.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.500
What are the features of the structure

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.250
that it acts on that are important?

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:04.310
And we did that, and we show
that there's a small portion

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.383
of these molecules that was
recognized by the enzyme.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.970
And then we understood,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:16.220
a brilliant Australian
postdoc did this is my lab,

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:21.220
how you could reconstruct
that small segment of RNA,

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.440
two pieces of RNA,

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.030
that look just like what
this enzyme recognized,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.150
and if the enzyme saw this,

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.483
it would cut one of the pieces of RNA.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.210
The RNA could be any RNA inside the cell,

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.730
but you have to put
another small piece of RNA

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.140
that complexed with it in a specific way,

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.150
and then the enzyme would
see that and cut it.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.310
And the enzyme was inside all cells.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.763
It's an essential enzyme.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.210
So we did some experiments over the years

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:57.210
in which we did put in
pieces of RNA into cells

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.560
to target other RNAs that were
either dangerous to the cells

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.480
or essential to the cells,

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.493
and we found that this always worked.

00:43:09.428 --> 00:43:12.790
The host Ribonuclease P
always cut the target RNA

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.093
under these conditions.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.723
So you could say under those conditions,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.010
I should say, you could
say that in principle,

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:28.010
we have a universal therapy,
which is a very large statement

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.423
unlikely to be entirely true.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:36.700
But in fact, you can design
this particular system

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.610
to work under any conditions you like,

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.630
and we've shown it's
true in mammalian cells

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.493
as well as many bacteria.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:49.750
The problem is getting that
extra piece of RNA inside cells,

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.170
and we know how to do it pretty well

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.883
inside bacteria at the moment,

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.930
and the question is, will
anybody pay attention to this?

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:05.090
Will anybody with money want
to invest into starting up

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:07.003
a biotechnology company?

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.303
Excuse me.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.630
So that's where we are.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.280
- And then the second
area, which you touched on

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.873
in your lecture, is that your discovery

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.900
sort of begins to help us grapple

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.020
with the problem with the
origin of life, basically,

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.610
that it's put a new
factor into the equation

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:39.610
to understand that RNA may
have been a key element

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.480
in creating life.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.090
- Yes.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:52.090
I myself did not put that forward.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.939
Other people put it forward

00:44:54.939 --> 00:44:57.653
and Tom Cech certainly
put it forward also,

00:44:59.184 --> 00:45:04.184
but in 1967, Francis Crick and
Leslie Orgel and Carl Woese

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.560
published, in separate papers,
that if we're thinking about

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.450
the origin of life, it's a big puzzle

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.280
because nobody believed
that protein was present

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.320
at the origin of life,

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.463
because you can't transmit
information to proteins.

00:45:24.207 --> 00:45:25.763
I won't go into that at the moment.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.910
And they each mentioned specifically

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.710
that there has been no enzymatic function

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.030
ever shown for RNA,

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.740
therefore we can forget
about RNA at the moment.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.070
But if RNA had some enzymatic functions,

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.713
it would open up the whole picture.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.580
So that because of Cech's discovery,

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:51.580
and essentially my discovery,
this created a big splash

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.360
in terms of what people thought
about the origin of life,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:01.080
and then there were suggestions made

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.500
that if you had RNA present
which has information,

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.283
it could transmit that information,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.313
providing another piece of
RNA could replicate the RNA.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.410
And if you had RNA that could proceed

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:17.650
in terms of carrying
out metabolic functions

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:18.823
inside the cell,

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.560
then you could have a
primitive cell with RNA,

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.560
and that's logically correct,
but it makes an assumption

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.653
that scientists frequently make.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:34.260
That is to say, if you have
one example that works,

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.920
then you expand that to
have all kinds of examples

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.920
of that particular feature,
and you can say this will work.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.330
See, the idea is if you
had catalytic function

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:48.400
that broke pieces of RNA,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.210
then, oh, you can say quite readily

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.720
that RNA can have all kinds
of enzymatic functions

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.610
or metabolic functions, and
we can go on from there.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.973
And that essentially has been
what people have talked about.

00:47:02.932 --> 00:47:06.320
- Your work really points

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.360
to the importance of basic research.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.323
'Cause your discovery,

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.920
which in a way, you weren't looking for,

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.000
I think you're saying,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.003
but you knew where to look as it emerged,

00:47:23.947 --> 00:47:28.120
really is probably, and is said to be,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.293
as revolutionary as the
discovery of DNA itself.

00:47:34.427 --> 00:47:36.807
- I don't agree with
that, but that's okay.

00:47:36.807 --> 00:47:38.387
- Okay.

00:47:38.387 --> 00:47:43.054
So I think it's important for
our audience to understand

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.403
the importance of basic research.

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:52.090
- You're absolutely right about that.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.650
I wouldn't rate my discovery

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.440
equal to some of the
other great discoveries,

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.810
but that's a separate issue.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.860
But you're absolutely
right about basic research.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.870
I believe extremely strongly

00:48:05.789 --> 00:48:09.660
that individuals carrying
out research without

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.453
any specific idea about the
utility of this research,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.600
that has no bearing on what
you're trying to find out,

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.530
or how you're gonna try and find out it.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.980
The real bearing is just
to solve another problem.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.570
It's to add something
to our bank of knowledge

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.573
as we do what we have to do,

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.800
and I believe, as I indicated previously,

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.450
that individuals and perhaps small groups

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:45.343
are the best possible
arrangement for this,

00:48:46.868 --> 00:48:49.320
and not only that, it's
absolutely essential

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.063
for our government to
support basic research.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.370
There are some aspects of science

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.370
where large groups are necessary,

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.300
for example, high energy particle physics,

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.720
where you have to have large groups

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.140
to build large accelerators.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.146
That's a separate issue,

00:49:08.146 --> 00:49:11.490
but the fact is, the
government has to believe

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.640
that this is something
that is worth doing.

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:19.710
Now if you're an economist,
and excuse me for saying it,

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:25.740
as my son is, you can show quite readily

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.507
that the future wealth
of the country depends

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.640
to a large extent on basic
research in the sciences

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.010
and in technology.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.010
And what we're doing
today is a major factor

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.800
in the future prosperity of this country,

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.950
and that isn't gonna happen
in the next few years.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:55.571
It might happen in 10 years
from now or 20 years from now.

00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:56.600
- [Harry] That is, the payoff from that.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.960
- That's right, the payoff will
be 10 or 20 years from now.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.780
Unfortunately, politicians
have a very short lifetime

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.370
and what they see,

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:07.700
but in fact, Congress is
a large body of people,

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.610
and there are some people who recognize

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.940
that this payoff is worthwhile.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:16.722
So I would make a strong case
for supporting basic research.

00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:21.722
- And are you concerned that
now the US is losing sight

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.273
of that principle?

00:50:29.273 --> 00:50:32.360
Going back to the start of your career,

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.900
the victory in World War
II, the role of science,

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.900
the government really embraced
the idea of basic science,

00:50:43.842 --> 00:50:45.642
and there was public support for it.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.880
- Well, I think that the view
of science and technology

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.690
has changed somewhat.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:55.230
We're still investing
very heavily in science,

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:59.300
although our leads, in
comparison to other countries,

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.253
is diminishing to some extent,

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.690
and I don't wanna speak for
all of sciences right now.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.960
If you press me, I will offer things

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.880
that may or may not be true.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.990
I don't know.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.970
But in the biological sciences,
there's been a big push

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.573
on what is called translational research.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.580
Translational research is research

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.710
that can be immediately applied

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.480
in terms of clinical therapies.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.380
Now obviously, we want
to do that ultimately.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.890
We want some of what
we're doing to be relevant

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:37.250
to the health sciences in a real fashion,

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.560
and unfortunately, too
many Congressmen feel

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.433
that's most important,

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:46.190
but I think it's a mistake
to characterize our research

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:49.720
as translational research,
and not to give money

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.100
if it's not translational research.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.410
That, in my view, is a very bad idea,

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:57.640
and that's the idea which is prevalent now

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.600
at the National Institutes of Health,

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.870
where the statement is being
made if you're doing something

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.810
that's relevant to translational research,

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.010
the odds of you getting
money are very high.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:14.997
So I think we have to be
careful about how these efforts

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:22.010
are managed and focused in different ways.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:28.540
- In your career, you also
served as Dean of Yale College,

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.030
and I'd like to talk a little about that,

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:32.600
'cause the other piece of this,

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.820
beyond funding basic research, is training

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.320
the next generation of
scientists on the one hand,

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.410
but also graduating undergraduates

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:48.410
who are familiar with science
and can be informed citizens.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.600
Talk about what you learned
in that period as a dean

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.533
and what you tried to do.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:00.180
- Well, I was Dean of Yale
College from 1985 to 1989.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.160
So it's some time ago.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.310
And maybe the world
has changed since then.

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:10.290
But prior to the time I was
dean, I was chair of a committee

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.583
at Yale College that
reviewed the curriculum,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.023
the whole curriculum.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:22.550
One of the things we found out
was that 30% of the students

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:27.263
at Yale never took any science
at Yale, zero, nothing.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:32.470
Another perhaps equal
percentage took one course,

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.850
but very few courses.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:38.230
So that meant that in terms of science,

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:41.233
the students were being,
in my view, short-changed.

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.873
So we reorganized the curriculum,

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:52.220
we recommended that the
curriculum be reorganized

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.400
so that students take a
science course at least.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.400
When I became dean, there
was a very intelligent person

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.450
who served as the associate dean

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:11.130
in terms of academic functions.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.610
His name was Martin Griffin,

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:16.460
and unfortunately he
died three years hence

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:17.723
after I became dean,

00:54:19.134 --> 00:54:21.780
and we decided if we wanted
to do anything about science,

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.070
we would have to review
again a whole curriculum,

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:25.620
and we did that.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:30.350
Ultimately we came up with
a plan that all students,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.800
let's say, students not
studying science or engineering,

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.300
all students would have to
take at least three courses

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.563
in science before they graduated,

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.670
and presumably three courses in one area,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.590
so they'd get more

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:47.590
than a very rough
familiarity with something.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:50.410
And that passed in the faculty.

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:53.590
And, of course, the deal was
that if you were in science

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.650
and engineering, you had to
take at least three courses

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.340
in the humanities, at least three courses

00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.850
in the social sciences, et cetera.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.010
So it was all balanced very nicely,

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:06.160
but, in fact, it then became
the case that all students

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.670
had to take at least
three courses in science,

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.840
and you could not use AP
credit from high school

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.640
or anything else you did in
high school to satisfy that.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:18.920
I don't know that that's
still required today,

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.590
but it might be.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:24.110
- And then one final question,
how would you advise students

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.573
to prepare for the future,

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.690
especially if they want to be scientists?

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:35.720
- My advice generally is to find something

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.133
you're interested in,
science or otherwise,

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.630
and study it seriously and carefully,

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.383
and the final two words are work hard.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.040
Work hard is extremely important.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.920
- Professor Altman, on
that note of encouragement,

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.320
I wanna thank you for taking your time

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.420
from your busy schedule
while you're on the campus

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.400
to be on our program.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.260
I think it was a very
informative discussion.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.093
- Thank you.

00:56:02.093 --> 00:56:04.610
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:06.913
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:07.796 --> 00:56:11.379
(upbeat electronic music)
