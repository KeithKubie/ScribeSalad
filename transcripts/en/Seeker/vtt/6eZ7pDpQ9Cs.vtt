00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.060
Why do we have one of some things, and two
of other things? The logistics alone are enough

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.559
to cripple even a pro like me!

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.860
Happy Monday DNews lovers, thanks for watching!
Y'all really are the best. Every Monday we

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.810
answer one of YOUR questions from the comments
and this week, someone named "Dern Sure" wants

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.460
to know why we have two of certain organs,
like, Kidneys, lungs, testes, but not multiple

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.230
hearts, livers or brains? Scientists debate
the answer to this, but it really comes down

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.290
to how we were locked into our evolutionary
path.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.940
550 million years ago, the acoel 
was the first bilateral organism. Bilateralism

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.160
is the tendency of some lifeforms to be symmetrical.
Today, many organisms -- especially vertebrates

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.980
-- have inherited bilateral symmetry. If you
drew a line down the middle of most primates,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.450
birds, fish, crustaceans, amphibians, and
MANY others… you'd see a mirror image (or

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.239
close to it). Though we don't know EXACTLY
why, there are definitely some hypotheses.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.530
Like, scientists speculate a bilateral body
can move more easily because the appendages

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
are mirrored, or perhaps it's easier to support
a central nervous system with a central spinal

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.930
cord. It's just one of those things we don't
know. But, I mean, we've held onto the concept

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.729
for more than 500 million years, so there
must be a good reason for its evolution.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.390
300 million years ago, some animals moved
from the sea to the land, toting their evolutionary

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.409
advantages with them. Which might explain
why most land animals are bilaterally symmetrical.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.950
But let's not get specist. Undersea animals
might have continued to evolve, eschewing

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.850
bilateralism. Starfish and many undersea animals
developed radial symmetry, and others, like

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.479
sponges, aren't symmetrical at all! So, it's
not entirely universal!

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.750
I know that's not the answer YET, but we're
getting there. Evolutionary anthropologists

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.960
guess that we have two limbs, two lungs and
two kidneys because we needed them for some

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.280
reason! They're NOT spare parts, but instead,
the dual organs gave ancestral organisms an

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.930
advantage in some way. For example, you can
SEE with one eye and sure enough, one eye

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.090
evolved first, but two eyes are required for
depth perception. Organisms who developed

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.569
bilateral eyes were better able to focus on
prey; or to see the predators coming. But

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.660
what about kidneys? A study in Nephrology,
Dialysis, Transplantation looked at how people

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.200
did after getting a kidney removed, and surprisingly
found they did better for around 16 years,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.440
but like, 24, years later, had declines in
renal function. They're not spares, but we

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.230
still live if they're damaged. We just won’t
be at 100%, and the brain does too as well

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.550
as a number of our other organs.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.910
So, why one heart and two of a lot of other
stuff? Well, humans start as an egg, and begin

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.739
to divide. At some point in our embryonic
stage, we're literally a blob with a tube

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.390
down the middle that becomes the digestive
system. Along that center line the vital organs

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.970
(liver, lungs, heart, pancreas) begin as tiny
buds. The liver and brain each form from single

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.170
buds; the lungs, however, come from two, just
like the kidneys, which develop buds on complete

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.890
opposite sides of the centerline. Interestingly,
the heart is right in the middle… and according

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.330
to the book, "Heart Development, Volume 342,"
amphibian bilateral hearts form as two bilaterally

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.709
symmetrical buds next to each other which
eventually merge into one heart! But, if they're

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.440
artificially interrupted, they'll form two
independent hearts! It would be unethical

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.209
to do this with humans, of course, time lords
on the other hand………

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.569
Okay, so… if we take into account symmetry
and evolutionary advantage. It would seem

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.590
to me, having two brains would be more trouble
than it's worth, considering how resource

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.629
heavy they are, right? We have two of some
things because we've been symmetrical for

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.110
over 500 million years, and though we COULD
have two hearts, we simply, don't.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.569
I hope we enlightened you, Dern Sure. Like
I said, we answer viewer questions all the

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:58.629
time and we might’ve answered yours in the
past. Questions like, Am I crazy if I talk

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:14.180
to myself?
