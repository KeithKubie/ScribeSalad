00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now that you know the basics of simple harmonic motion,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
how to construct springs and masses or a pendulum with a certain period,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and how to describe that motion mathematically,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you could more or less design a good clock all by yourself.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, in a real pendulum clock we need to answer the question of

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
how do we convert this periodic swinging into the ticking of a clock?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What we do is we take this gear mechanism here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we allow this to rotate somehow.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we attach our pendulum to this thing, which is called an escapement.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, this gear mechanism would love to just unwind.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In fact, if the escapement wasn't here it would just unravel immediately.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As you can see, if the pendulum swings to the left this moves out of the way,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which allows it to move forward by 1 tick.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
As it swings to the right, this one moves out of the way--tick, tock.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Basically, that's how a pendulum clock works.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, there are some problems. We have to deal with friction.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This isn't going to run forever on its own,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but we'll do a problem set problem about that.
