00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.030
- [Instructor] Riki Lindhome
and Kate Micucci, Micucci,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.840
stars of HBO's Garfunkel and Oates,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.320
are both a musical comedian.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.160
Okay so we're talking about two people,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.070
Riki Lindhome or Lindhome
and Katie Micucci.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.670
We're talking about two people.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.300
Then we say these two
people, Riki and Kate, are.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.070
So, we agree with the
subject and the verb.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.650
This is the plural form of is.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.620
So are both, so you have two people are,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.390
can two people both be a musical comedian?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.690
This right over here
is one musical comedian

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.960
right over here, a musical comedian.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.150
No, they're both, if we're
talking about both of them,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.830
we're talking about that they
both are musical comedians.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.990
So they are both musical comedians.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.260
Get rid of the a and add an s at the end.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.580
So this is that choice right over here.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.640
So the key is, the subject,
we're talking about two people,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.730
but then we're saying that
they are a musical comedian.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.130
But no, they would be
both musical comedians.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.800
You wanna have a plural right
over here, musical comedians.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.390
So you definitely wanna change it.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.900
And these other two choices are wrong

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.720
because these are both
singular, a comedian,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.460
a comedian who plays music.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.990
In either case, they're singular.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.633
You want plural, musical comedians.
