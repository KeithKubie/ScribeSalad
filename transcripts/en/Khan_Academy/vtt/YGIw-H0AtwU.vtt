00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:02.081
Sal Khan: This is Sal
Khan of the Khan Academy

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.672
and I got these questions
from the Brazilian magazine,

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:08.537
Superinteresante, and I
don't speak Portuguese

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.929
that well but I assume it
means "super interesting"

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.936
so I hope I can meet their standards

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:14.830
and be at least somewhat interesting.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.538
Then sent me these
questions and I'm just going

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:18.104
to give my best attempt to answer it.

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:20.336
Question number 1, and
actually, let me use

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:23.072
my pen tool Sal style
or Khan Academy style,

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:24.751
to mark what question I'm on right now.

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.333
Let's start with question number 1.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.416
Do you see Khan Academy
as a modern compliment

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.737
to traditional education
or a resource that can be

00:00:32.737 --> 00:00:34.672
adapted without any other tool?

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:37.000
Would that be the death of textbooks?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.340
First, let's take the first part

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.475
because the second part's
a little controversial.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.403
Do you see Khan Academy
as a modern compliment

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:44.114
to traditional education?

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:45.829
Yes, I do.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.470
I think the ideal use
case for the Khan Academy

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.136
is someone has an amazing teacher,

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:54.751
and ideally amazing peers as well,

00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.543
and they can go to a physical environment

00:00:57.543 --> 00:00:59.404
and they can work with
their amazing teacher

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.869
and amazing peers, and what
happens from our material

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.557
is that they can watch
it at their own pace,

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:06.224
do the exercises at their own pace,

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.395
and they would get data on themselves

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:11.001
and their awesome teacher
and peers will get data.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.803
Then they can use that
data to organize classrooom

00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:15.861
time in a more interactive
way so that everyone

00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:19.063
can really focus on helping
addressing everyone's problems.

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:21.731
At least in our minds, it
really liberates the teacher

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.062
to form lasting bonds and really mentor

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.629
and work with and solve the problems

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.594
that the students are
having with that material,

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.327
and it allows the students
to teach each other.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:37.731
The second part of it, would
that be the death of textbooks?

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:40.230
This is an interesting question.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.459
I guess it depends what you
view textbooks as being for.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.526
Right now I think in most
classes textbooks play two roles.

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:51.065
One role is to introduce
you to the material

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:54.337
with the idea that, in a
lot of classes I've been in,

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:55.328
the professor would say,

00:01:55.328 --> 00:01:57.392
"Hey, why don't you go home,
do some of the reading,

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.664
"that will be covered in lecture."

00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:03.125
For that use case, I
think on-demand video,

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.478
whether it's Khan Academy
or other on-demand video,

00:02:05.478 --> 00:02:09.141
is better than a lot of the texts

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:14.099
that can or cannot be
read by a lot of students.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.655
It's much easier to get
it through on-demand video

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:17.846
than trying to parse through that text,

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.922
especially when you're
unfamiliar with the concept.

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:23.914
The other thing that a
textbook is for is practice.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:25.581
That's where a textbook
is really different

00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.252
than a traditional book is that it has

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:30.947
these practice problems in it.

00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:34.125
What Khan Academy has is
practice problems as well,

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.987
but we're collecting data on them.

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:37.794
The teacher, the student
knows how they did,

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:39.127
how long it took them,

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:43.124
what they're having weakness
in or what they're strong in,

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:45.196
and the student gets instant feedback.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.195
They know what they're understanding,

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:48.691
they know what they're not understanding.

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:52.111
They also get steps that we at least hope

00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:54.722
explain to the student where
they might have messed up;

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:55.920
maybe they made a careless mistake

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.331
or maybe got the conceptual error

00:02:58.331 --> 00:02:59.611
that they might have had trouble

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.197
and of course it's all tied to the videos.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:03.920
Most textbooks right now
don't give that level

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.852
of data to the student or to the teacher

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.067
or the parents or anyone else,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.115
and they don't even
give that much feedback.

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:11.814
They might have the answers
to half the questions

00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:12.751
in the back of the book.

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:13.919
Some have a little bit more than that,

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.491
but not much more.

00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:18.318
In those roles, we think
that on-demand video

00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:21.069
with self-paced software
with feedback and data

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.253
can do a lot of those,
and it's even better

00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:27.320
when it's free and it
doesn't weigh ten pounds.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.860
With that said, I don't think textbooks

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.123
are going to completely disappear.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:33.064
I think they're going to be
really useful as a reference.

00:03:33.064 --> 00:03:35.055
I have a bunch of textbooks
that I'm staring at

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:36.860
right now on my shelf and I treasure them.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.383
I think they'll be a
really useful reference.

00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:43.693
It's not clear whether
you're going to have

00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:45.277
generations and generations of students

00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:48.259
having to buy the new
version of the textbook

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.465
every few years, especially for subjects

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:54.634
that are not changing on a regular basis.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:58.123
It's also clear physical textbooks

00:03:58.123 --> 00:04:01.113
are probably not going
to be the mainstream.

00:04:01.113 --> 00:04:02.714
There's already a lot of
people doing e-textbooks,

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:04.917
but I assume that this
question is addressing

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.412
e and physical textbooks.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.984
Question number 2:

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:09.929
If children study at home

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.663
and only go to school to do exercises,

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:13.916
teachers' presence may
become less important.

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:16.248
Would they have some
kind of a consultant role

00:04:16.248 --> 00:04:18.664
instead of being someone
who explains the concepts?

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:21.787
I'll address the first part,
if children study at home

00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:23.252
and only go to school to do exercises,

00:04:23.252 --> 00:04:25.790
teachers' presence may
become less important.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.124
This is something that I'll
disagree strongly with.

00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:32.663
Imagine, if we were
doing it the other way,

00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:36.187
imagine if the world was
a world where when kids

00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:38.510
went to class, they had deep interactions

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.718
with their peers and, more importantly

00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:43.188
or equally importantly, with the teacher,

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:44.413
where they went to a class,

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:45.510
the teacher knew who they were,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.409
the teacher knew everything
about the student,

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.385
interacting with the student,
mentoring the student,

00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:52.062
the teacher knew exactly
what the tripping points

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.725
were for the student,
how to phrase information

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.655
specifically for that student,

00:04:57.655 --> 00:04:59.814
knowing what that student's context is,

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:03.393
and then all of a sudden I
were to go into that classroom

00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:05.148
and say, no, teacher,
you have to stop doing

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:07.191
this mentorship, this direct
one-on-one instruction

00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.794
with students, and what I
want you to do is not have

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:11.150
these conversations with students anymore,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.929
and what I want you to do is
go to the front of the room

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:15.398
and I want you to give these lectures

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.395
that are essentially these one pace,

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:18.732
one size fits all lecture.

00:05:18.732 --> 00:05:21.869
Really it'll be essentially
the same lecture that every

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:23.350
teacher in the country's giving

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.188
and that you've given years before.

00:05:25.188 --> 00:05:28.100
That would be making the
teacher less important

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.475
because you would have
taken them as a human being,

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.201
as someone who understands what's going on

00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:33.605
with the student, kind of the doctor

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:35.205
for the student's knowledge,
and then you would be

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:36.936
turning them into a broadcast mechanism.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.398
We're doing the exact opposite.

00:05:39.398 --> 00:05:41.017
Right now, unfortunately,
a lot of teachers

00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:42.207
want to be that mentor.

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.742
A lot of the teachers
want to use class time

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:46.138
for interaction and
creativity, but right now

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:49.142
they have to move the entire
class at the same pace,

00:05:49.142 --> 00:05:51.395
and they have to give that lecture,

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:55.206
many times with very little
interaction with the students.

00:05:55.206 --> 00:05:57.102
What we're saying is, no, that can happen

00:05:57.102 --> 00:05:59.691
at the student's own time and
at the student's own pace,

00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.842
and then the teacher just
becomes, every minute of time

00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:05.499
with the teacher just
becomes this valuable nugget.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.378
Several of the classes
that we're piloting,

00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:10.756
one of the teachers is making a point

00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:12.648
to spend 15 minutes one-on-one

00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:14.117
with every student per week, at least.

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:16.722
I can remember years that I went by

00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:19.592
never getting 15 minutes
one-on-one with the teacher.

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:20.847
That happens to many, many students.

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:22.583
We think, if anything,
it's making the teachers

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.982
far more important.

00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:25.915
They're forming bonds.

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:27.922
They have to have a better grasp of all

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:29.728
of the information now
because you have students

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:30.943
working at their own pace.

00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:33.609
It's really taking them up the value chain

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:34.991
because they're no longer giving

00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.468
the same lecture year in and year out.

00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:39.460
Then the second part of the question,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.397
would they have some
kind of a consultant role

00:06:41.397 --> 00:06:43.704
instead of being someone
who explains the concepts?

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:45.394
What I would say is that they're still

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:46.714
explaining the concepts, but they're

00:06:46.714 --> 00:06:49.270
explaining the concepts
given all of the information

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.940
that they now have about the student.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.296
Given the fact that
that student has already

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:56.702
maybe watched our videos,
has already done exercises,

00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:58.858
the teacher can now act on the data

00:06:58.858 --> 00:07:03.595
coming from those videos
and those exercises.

00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:06.725
Once again, I think the teacher
has moved up the value chain.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:08.460
They're now more valuable for that student

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.460
than they were as a pure lecturer.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.398
Question number 3:

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:14.295
When children have the freedom to study

00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:16.587
by themselves, at home,
surrounded by other appeals

00:07:16.587 --> 00:07:17.724
such as internet, social medial

00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:20.061
and also the possibility
to just ignore the lessons,

00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:24.330
isn't it too much confidence
in their passion for learning?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.191
Don't you think some
discipline is necessary

00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:29.190
to make them study instead
of doing anything else?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.901
There's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.060
Right now in a traditional classroom,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.993
you have mostly lecture going on,

00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:37.398
maybe with a little bit of other things,

00:07:37.398 --> 00:07:39.641
and then all of the problem solving,

00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:42.066
all of the homework, happens at home.

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:45.133
I agree, some students might not have

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:46.270
the motivation to do it at home,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.864
and we see a lot of kids
skipping the homework.

00:07:47.864 --> 00:07:49.434
Even the ones that do have the motivation

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:50.350
might not have the help.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.407
So in my mind, where the
real learning happens

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.767
is actually when you're trying
to do the problem solving.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.807
What's happening right
now is a lot of students

00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:00.731
are skipping out on the problem solving,

00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.866
on doing the homework,

00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:03.465
either because of distractions

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:06.460
or because they have no one to help them.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.268
Then they all go to a room together

00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:10.350
where they're in the same room,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.069
but they're all passively
listening to a lecture.

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:15.706
We think if you had to drop one thing

00:08:15.706 --> 00:08:19.533
from that equation, make sure
the problem solving occurs.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.644
Make sure that the teacher
sees students do problems.

00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:25.666
Don't put that out for homework where

00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:27.348
it may or may not happen.

00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:29.765
If you had to, and we
wouldn't advocate this,

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:31.249
but we think if you had to pick

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:32.850
between doing homework and lecture,

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.129
which one do you skip, frankly
the lecture is, I think,

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.387
the one that's more optional.

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:37.852
In fact some students, and we've seen this

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:39.323
in some of our pilots,
you show them enough

00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:41.792
examples or their peer can
teach them how to do something,

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.876
they don't necessarily even
need to see the lecture.

00:08:43.876 --> 00:08:45.926
If they see a few examples
of it, that's enough.

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.852
Maybe they'll go back
and watch the lecture

00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:51.653
for more depth or for more
intuition on the subject.

00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:55.594
With that said, on top
of that, we don't want

00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:57.792
to just completely let it
up to the student's judgment

00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:00.627
and have the teacher guessing
when they come to class

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:02.159
the next day whether or not the student's

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.379
watched lectures or did
some of the problems.

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:06.322
That's why we're so focused on the data.

00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:08.056
That's why we're so focused on right now

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.418
the teacher does get
a real-time dashboard.

00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:12.788
In a traditional classroom, the teacher

00:09:12.788 --> 00:09:14.001
just sees who turned in their homework

00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:15.587
or who did the homework,
and who knows if they

00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:16.717
copied it from another student.

00:09:16.717 --> 00:09:18.250
They don't know how long
it took the students

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.089
to do the homework, whether
they got it right or wrong.

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:22.531
They don't know what time of
day they did the homework.

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.834
Now, the teacher will know everything.

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:26.930
Now the teacher knows what
videos the student watched.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.530
Where did they even pause the videos?

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.130
What videos did they have to repeat?

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.511
They'll see the spread of where
every student in the class is.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:38.076
They'll see what problems
the kid actually did,

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:41.137
how long it took them, when
they did those problems.

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:43.002
Early on when I was doing
this, I saw one of my cousins

00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.875
was doing all of their
problems at 2 in the morning.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.668
That, by itself, was
probably more information,

00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:48.152
that they were awake at 2 in the morning,

00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:49.335
then the fact that they were even getting

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:50.271
some of those problems wrong.

00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:51.744
That's something that a human being

00:09:51.744 --> 00:09:53.905
can then intervene in.

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:56.180
Going back to the too much confidence, no.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.861
Now we're arming everyone
with a lot more data,

00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:01.431
so it's de-risking just
putting it all on the student

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:02.526
to do everything at home.

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:04.491
Question number 4:

00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:07.139
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.292
And the possibility to learn in your own

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:12.391
wouldn't contribute to
isolate shy and misfit kids?

00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:14.256
Once again, complete opposite.

00:10:14.256 --> 00:10:16.207
Some people might be
surprised to hear this.

00:10:16.207 --> 00:10:17.716
I was actually very, very shy,

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:19.714
especially in elementary
and to some degree

00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:22.717
in middle school, and I
felt very, very isolated

00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:23.623
in my classrooms.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.206
When I was in a classroom with 30 kids,

00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:28.271
even when I had a question, I
was afraid to raise my hand.

00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:30.458
I think this is true of
many, many, many kids.

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:32.080
You don't want to embarrass
yourself raising ...

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.789
It's usually the most outgoing kids

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:35.407
who are willing to raise their hand,

00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:37.076
usually the two or three
most outgoing kids.

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:39.338
I was never willing to do that.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:40.667
If I didn't understand something,

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:42.436
I would just put it on myself to go home

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:43.837
and try to struggle with it somehow.

00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:46.250
I had my sister who often
helped me with things.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.452
But I felt very isolated.

00:10:47.452 --> 00:10:52.315
Also, because I was shy,
there would be 30 kids

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:53.582
in the room, but I really only knew

00:10:53.582 --> 00:10:56.318
maybe 5 of them well, maybe
because they sat near me.

00:10:56.318 --> 00:10:58.062
I would sit in class, and
this is even true in college.

00:10:58.062 --> 00:10:59.663
I used to sit in classes in college

00:10:59.663 --> 00:11:01.571
where there was 100 people in the room,

00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:02.649
and I only knew 2 of them.

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.479
I would sit in that room
for the whole semester

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.883
and I would never get to meet any of them

00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:08.721
the way that a traditional model works.

00:11:08.721 --> 00:11:10.719
And, frankly, the professor
never knew who I was.

00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:13.654
That even happened in
some of my elementary

00:11:13.654 --> 00:11:15.855
and middle school and high
school, where I don't really

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.855
think the teacher knew who I was.

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:19.852
What we're saying is the exact opposite.

00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:22.299
What we're saying is now
you're using the class time

00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:24.390
for the students to actually
interact with each other.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.855
If you look at these
pilots that we're running

00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:29.327
in Los Altos, you have all of the students

00:11:29.327 --> 00:11:31.137
interacting with all of the students.

00:11:31.137 --> 00:11:32.720
You don't have these little cliques

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.057
where certain kids only hang out

00:11:34.057 --> 00:11:35.470
with other kids and ignore the rest;

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.928
you have them all helping each other.

00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:39.852
It actually gives an
outlet for the shy kids,

00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:42.055
maybe the shy kids who
perform a little bit

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:46.139
better academically, to
actually gain confidence

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.523
by teaching their peers, their peers start

00:11:48.523 --> 00:11:50.188
to respect them more, not just as this

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:51.968
shy kid who happens to do good at school,

00:11:51.968 --> 00:11:53.699
but, wow, that kid helped me.

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:56.108
We're seeing way more interaction.

00:11:56.108 --> 00:11:58.254
There's no kid who's just
hiding during the lecture

00:11:58.254 --> 00:11:59.998
and just pretending to
understand the information.

00:11:59.998 --> 00:12:00.995
Everyone is interacting.

00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:02.230
The teachers are interacting
with the students.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.716
The students are
interacting with each other.

00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:05.254
So we think it's the exact opposite.

00:12:05.254 --> 00:12:06.998
We think we're taking the isolation that

00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:09.389
they shy kids are feeling right now

00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:11.325
and we're having them actually interact

00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:14.143
with each other in a human
experience in the classroom.

00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:15.520
Question number 5:

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.725
Do you believe that some
old fashion thinkers

00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:20.122
just don't accept an education system

00:12:20.122 --> 00:12:24.416
that is supposed to be cool?

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:27.049
Not 100% sure how to answer that question.

00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:29.099
I guess the assumption here is that what

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.192
we're proposing is cool.

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:31.821
I think it is.

00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:34.250
I think any time there's change,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.178
there will always be resistance,

00:12:37.178 --> 00:12:38.712
and I think that's a healthy thing.

00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:40.582
People should actively question things.

00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:42.317
No one should adopt something just

00:12:42.317 --> 00:12:45.774
because it's supposed to be cool

00:12:45.774 --> 00:12:47.000
or just because it sounds cool.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.851
You shouldn't just accept
it because it sounds cool,

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.121
and you also shouldn't just
reject it because it sounds cool.

00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:54.245
The reality is that you really
should see whether it's working,

00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:55.715
and you should see whether it's working

00:12:55.715 --> 00:12:57.249
on multiple levels subjectively.

00:12:57.249 --> 00:12:59.172
How are the teachers and
the students liking it?

00:12:59.172 --> 00:13:00.665
How is the energy level?

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:02.187
You should also look at it objectively.

00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:05.179
How is their performance changing?

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:07.851
There definitely are knee-jerk
reactions against new things

00:13:07.851 --> 00:13:09.452
and there are knee-jerk
reactions for new things.

00:13:09.452 --> 00:13:13.004
Neither of those are the
best ways to approach it.

00:13:13.004 --> 00:13:14.457
You really should just have an open mind

00:13:14.457 --> 00:13:18.575
to anything and see if it really works.

00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:20.182
Question number 6:

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:22.179
How has the acceptance to Khan Academy,

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:23.961
I would assume, been in the United States?

00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:26.514
Has Bill Gates' support helped to open

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.652
some conservative doors?

00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:30.783
We're still in the early days.

00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:34.052
Khan Academy, once again, it started as

00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:35.115
a very grassroots things.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.311
I started it for my cousins.

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.846
It was adopted not because of a governor

00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:41.721
or the president told people to adopt it,

00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:42.787
or a superintendent did.

00:13:42.787 --> 00:13:45.263
It was adopted because
students chose to use it,

00:13:45.263 --> 00:13:47.259
students on their own,
students who happened

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.317
to bump into it on the
internet found it useful.

00:13:49.317 --> 00:13:50.776
So it was a very grassroots thing.

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:52.918
Only later, once we had
significant traction

00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:55.050
and I had been doing this for 5 or 6 years

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.003
did it start to get on the radar of some

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.806
fairly prominent people,
many of those who have

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.141
supported us now, including Bill Gates

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:05.971
and Google and others.

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:06.913
In terms of the acceptance

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.186
of the Khan Academy in the U.S.,

00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:12.445
the people who have chosen to
adopt it naturally like it.

00:14:12.445 --> 00:14:14.163
They have made the decision to use it.

00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:15.317
We haven't forced it on anyone else.

00:14:15.317 --> 00:14:16.664
I think that's a really important thing

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:18.853
because I think when anyone
forces anything on anyone

00:14:18.853 --> 00:14:20.848
they tend to not like it.

00:14:20.848 --> 00:14:22.997
So far the acceptance has been very good

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:25.914
and we've had really
fascinating experiences

00:14:25.914 --> 00:14:27.784
and tremendous results with
the pilots that's chose

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.918
to adopt it if we talk
about the formal setting.

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:31.451
If you're thinking about
the informal setting,

00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:32.994
the students who are just
using it independently,

00:14:32.994 --> 00:14:34.990
I encourage anyone to
go to our YouTube page

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:41.115
or our Facebook page and
just read the commentary

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:43.914
from students, and even
ask them questions,

00:14:43.914 --> 00:14:46.582
contact them, and see how it's helped them

00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:48.993
and I think you'll see,
at least we like to think,

00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:51.916
it's profoundly effecting
a lot of students

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:53.744
in the U.S., and the world, frankly.

00:14:53.744 --> 00:14:55.854
The question has Bill
Gates' support helped

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.409
to open some conservative doors?

00:14:57.409 --> 00:14:59.555
You know, I think that's a mixed answer.

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:01.611
I think it's definitely given validation

00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:02.665
within certain circles.

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.803
I think people in Silicone
Valley really respect

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:08.202
that Google is behind us,
Bill Gates is behind us.

00:15:08.202 --> 00:15:10.466
These are obviously groups and people

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.000
who are obviously intelligent,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.469
who've obviously been successful,

00:15:13.469 --> 00:15:15.283
who obviously understand
what a math and science

00:15:15.283 --> 00:15:19.817
education is for, who are
almost the examples of ...

00:15:19.817 --> 00:15:22.211
The people at Google understand there's

00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:24.333
no better application of math and science

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:25.302
than what Google has done

00:15:25.302 --> 00:15:26.128
or what Bill Gates has done

00:15:26.128 --> 00:15:27.961
or what other people in
Silicone Valley have done.

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:30.125
That's definitely validation.

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:31.760
Whether it opens conservative doors or not

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.865
is not clear because I
think Bill Gates has also

00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:36.344
been doing other things.

00:15:36.344 --> 00:15:38.749
He's very active in the Charter movement.

00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:42.481
He's been pushing for other things.

00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:45.079
There are some people
who react against that

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:50.137
and they might be tempted
to throw us in the same bag.

00:15:50.137 --> 00:15:53.327
Us, personally, we try not
to take an opinion on that.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:58.098
We want to be useful for
anyone, in any organization.

00:15:58.098 --> 00:15:59.981
We're not taking a political stance there

00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:02.389
but I think because Bill Gates really is

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:04.676
one of our biggest supporters,

00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:07.588
some groups are more receptive to it

00:16:07.588 --> 00:16:09.653
and some groups are less receptive to it.

00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:13.582
Overall, I definitely think
it's been a huge positive

00:16:13.582 --> 00:16:15.123
because I think the
parents and the students

00:16:15.123 --> 00:16:20.126
view it as a huge plus when
someone whom they respect

00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:22.208
think so highly of it and uses it himself

00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:25.062
and uses it for his kids.

00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:27.703
Question number 7:

00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:29.542
Has Khan Academy ever been contacted

00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:31.392
by some Brazilian school or company

00:16:31.392 --> 00:16:34.591
interested in adopting its methods?

00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:36.795
I can't say no totally.

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.598
We've had a lot of contact
with people from Brazil

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.763
and we are actively
translating the video content

00:16:40.763 --> 00:16:44.529
to Portuguese, so we've
had contact with Brazil.

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:46.393
We're not doing any
formal pilots in Brazil.

00:16:46.393 --> 00:16:49.271
I wouldn't be surprised if
some students or teachers

00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:50.685
are using it independently.

00:16:50.685 --> 00:16:52.269
In fact, I'm sure some students are.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:54.860
Teachers can use what
we're doing in Los Altos

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.401
on their own, but we don't have any formal

00:16:56.401 --> 00:16:58.737
pilots in Brazil right now.

00:16:58.737 --> 00:17:01.114
Question number 8:

00:17:01.114 --> 00:17:03.910
Besides the positive testimonies
from Los Altos' teachers,

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.528
do you have some numbers
that could measure

00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:08.383
how Khan Academy has
helped students to develop?

00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:10.068
Some numbers that could help us compare

00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:13.087
traditional education to
your system's performance.

00:17:13.087 --> 00:17:16.258
The simple answer is,
yes, we do have numbers.

00:17:16.258 --> 00:17:19.525
This is why Los Altos has decided to go

00:17:19.525 --> 00:17:22.716
district-wide with this
in the 5th and 6th grade.

00:17:22.716 --> 00:17:24.053
Actually, let me pause the video

00:17:24.053 --> 00:17:25.756
and let me get you some of those numbers.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.125
Hold on one second.

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:29.528
You asked for data, so
here's data that I got.

00:17:29.528 --> 00:17:32.581
We have other data, but
this one piece of data

00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:33.796
is probably the most compelling

00:17:33.796 --> 00:17:35.557
that really convinced Los Altos.

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:36.664
It's not a rigorous study.

00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:38.993
We're going to be doing more
rigorous studies this year

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:42.134
with larger data sets and
in a more controlled way,

00:17:42.134 --> 00:17:44.067
but we obviously had all of the anecdotal

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:46.895
higher energy in the classroom,
kids were more engaged,

00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:49.148
the teachers loved it, but
we wanted to see real data.

00:17:49.148 --> 00:17:52.004
This is actually what we saw
out of the 7th grade pilot.

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.725
I want to be clear,
these 7th grade classes

00:17:53.725 --> 00:17:56.561
were considered developmental classes,

00:17:56.561 --> 00:17:59.228
kids that weren't tracked
with the normal students;

00:17:59.228 --> 00:18:01.531
they were held back, they weren't
performing at grade level.

00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:03.403
This shows how they performed

00:18:03.403 --> 00:18:08.825
at their district
standardized exam in 2010.

00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:11.821
You can see that the best students here,

00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:14.937
you had 23 that were proficient,

00:18:14.937 --> 00:18:16.740
then you had 47 that were basic,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.601
23 that were below basic,

00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:21.468
and then you had 6 that
were far below basic.

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.757
Don't get this light blue confused

00:18:22.757 --> 00:18:23.839
with this dark blue over here

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:25.187
because they're saying
very different things.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.389
This is far below, so
this right over here,

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:31.183
they're not doing well,
far below basic, this 6.

00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:33.638
The same students,
after doing Khan Academy

00:18:33.638 --> 00:18:35.058
for about 6 or 7 months,

00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:37.367
and once again it's hard
to separate how much ...

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:39.820
Courtney Caldwell, who's the teacher here

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.804
is just an off the charts awesome teacher

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:45.421
so it might be due to her
as well, what we've seen.

00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:47.589
She herself expressed
that the energy level

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:49.255
that she saw in the class is very unusual

00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:52.128
for especially a class that is at this

00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:53.688
developmental stage.

00:18:53.688 --> 00:18:57.042
These are the results from
this year's standardized exams.

00:18:57.042 --> 00:19:00.329
There's no longer any
students in this group

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:02.072
that are far below basic.

00:19:02.072 --> 00:19:04.493
In fact, there are now 6
kids that are advanced.

00:19:04.493 --> 00:19:06.931
Just to be clear, these
are kids that have, now,

00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:10.495
leapfrogged their peers who
are not placed in this class.

00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:13.457
Normally when you're
tracked into a slower class,

00:19:13.457 --> 00:19:15.255
that's usually the end
of your math career.

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:16.943
You're usually just going
to drift further and further

00:19:16.943 --> 00:19:18.068
behind the other students.

00:19:18.068 --> 00:19:21.740
These students after half
a year actually did better

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.398
than many students who weren't
placed into the slower class.

00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:26.316
Then you have many, many more students

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:27.523
who are now proficient.

00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:30.334
The basic, you still have 47, but you have

00:19:30.334 --> 00:19:31.810
so many more who are
proficient or advanced.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.731
Then you have no students
that are far below basic.

00:19:34.731 --> 00:19:37.602
In 12% of the pilot, students
moved from below basic

00:19:37.602 --> 00:19:43.735
to proficient, and 6% moved
from far below basic to basic.

00:19:43.735 --> 00:19:49.398
There's a general trend where
people just moved forward.

00:19:49.398 --> 00:19:50.643
This was a big one.

00:19:50.643 --> 00:19:51.819
We have other data and we're hoping to get

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:54.094
a lot more data this year.

00:19:54.094 --> 00:19:55.586
Once again, not a rigorous
study, so not something

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:57.453
that we can publish in
a scientific journal,

00:19:57.453 --> 00:19:59.454
but that, with all of
the anecdotal evidence,

00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:01.584
made Los Altos feel pretty good

00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:02.787
and made us feel pretty good.

00:20:02.787 --> 00:20:05.723
We don't consider this a done deal.

00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:07.885
We consider ourselves, we're just in

00:20:07.885 --> 00:20:09.150
the first inning and we have to constantly

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.390
improve this thing so that we can get

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.720
even better results next year,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.033
and then the year after that.

00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:14.333
Question number 9:

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:17.255
Do you believe children
should have the opportunity

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:18.847
to use other new technologies in school,

00:20:18.847 --> 00:20:21.722
such as mobile phones,
iPods, and podcasts?

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:23.163
I think it's like everything.

00:20:23.163 --> 00:20:27.516
If it's used in a proper
context, yes, if it's helpful.

00:20:27.516 --> 00:20:28.996
If it's not helpful, maybe no.

00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:31.331
We should have an open mind about

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.059
what helpful is or what it isn't

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:36.410
and just try things out
and adjust accordingly.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.849
Question 10:

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:39.745
Are films the new books?

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.789
Do you think that a
culture focused on images

00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:46.678
has contributed to the
notion that books are boring?

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:49.356
Films, on some level, they are,

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:51.531
even before Khan Academy shows up,

00:20:51.531 --> 00:20:55.193
films have always been a form of book.

00:20:55.193 --> 00:20:57.492
People still like to read the
book and then watch the film.

00:20:57.492 --> 00:21:00.194
The books give you more
depth, give you more nuance,

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:01.722
but the films are still fun.

00:21:01.722 --> 00:21:04.190
I don't think it's a
culture focused on images

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.662
that has contributed to the
notion that books are boring.

00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:09.324
I think there are books that
are amazing and fascinating,

00:21:09.324 --> 00:21:11.527
and some of my best experiences in life

00:21:11.527 --> 00:21:13.446
are from reading some
of those amazing books,

00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:15.387
but there are books that are boring.

00:21:15.387 --> 00:21:18.720
It doesn't hurt if we can find a medium

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.925
that is less boring.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.438
I think it really depends
from case to case.

00:21:22.438 --> 00:21:23.848
And I don't think it's
just this generation.

00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:25.228
I think if you'd taken any generation

00:21:25.228 --> 00:21:27.063
and if you'd given them
something that's less boring

00:21:27.063 --> 00:21:29.402
or a better way or a more intuitive way

00:21:29.402 --> 00:21:31.339
or a more approachable way
to understand something,

00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:35.339
they would have found
it equally compelling.
