Hey it's me Destin.
So a lot of you may not know, because you're new to

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
Smarter Every Day, but I have a sister who lives in West Africa as a peace corps volunteer

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.090
and I went and helped her teach math and science. Every once in a while I like to upload a video

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.120
because I learned a lot. Hope you enjoy.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.170

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:30.060
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.320
Morning. You would not believe

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.410
how useful frisbees are. We had a frisbee we were going to play with the kids,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.440
and we asked for some food in the morning and this lady

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.480
served Stevo his cassava and beans

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.520
in a frisbee. She thought you brought your own plate didn't she?

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.540
[laughs]
So we're just

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.570
rolling with it.
Fish and rice?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.600
This is cassava and beans.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.610
OK this morning we used your frisbee as a plate to eat cassava and beans,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.640
what are we using it for today?
- Surgical prep.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.660
(Destin) What?
-Surgical Prep.
-What do you mean?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.710
- I mean it's got antiseptic soap in it with water and we're using it to wash hands before we touch

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.780
a wounded area.
-Oh. That's wonderful.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.870
(Destin) So what you're saying is a frisbee is one of the most versatile things in the world?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.890
- Absolutely
- I mean we don't have to say it, you can see it.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.000
(Destin) Let me zoom in on your hat there... yeah

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.010
- A little pitch for ultimate frisbee huh?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.060
(Destin) This is a pitch for ultimate frisbee in third world countries. [laugh]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.060
(Stevo) It's about more than just sport.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.110
(Destin) Yeah it's about helping people. Happy people.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.140
Dedi you happy? You happy?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.150
(Sister) Tell me when you're ready.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.220
-That's such a dad thing to do.
[Destin] How else were we gonna get that done?
- I know.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.270
I'm just glad it was you and I didn't have to do it.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
(Destin) Feel better?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.420
Good. I'm sure that sucker helps too.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.540
(Sister) The lolly pop is sweet?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.570
[laughs]
(Destin) is sweet?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.610
Lolly pop help small small? Yes.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.640
OK squeeze little.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.660
(Sister) My face is stuck like this.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.210
(Destin) Hey dog you're not sterile.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.730
We're thinking frisbee can take off here in Africa if we could just train somebody to do it.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.780
So we've already showed you the several uses for frisbees, so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.790
here we're trying to train our first West African

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.040
ultimate frisbee member.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.530
Almost.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.970
Keep trying.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.000
Send him deep.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.030
[laughs]
