00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.349
[archive audio] Helen Sharman becoming the
first Brit in space. She blasted off with

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.320
two Soviet cosmonaut repair men on a mission
designed chiefly to repair the ageing Mir

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.900
space station, that has been orbiting the
globe for five years now.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.760
[Helen Sharman] This is my Sokol space
suit. Only used for the emergency situation

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.660
that the air would actually leak out of the
spacecraft. We wear it for the dangerous

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.680
times: the launch, the docking, and then the
landing again.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.260
It's got to be strong so that if it does inflate
with air or oxygen and you've got nothing

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.379
around you, it's to stop it just blowing up
like a balloon and exploding. So it's strengthened

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.270
with wires in various places, which generally
means it's not the most comfortable thing

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.859
to stand up in, because it's designed to actually
sit inside your seat, with you hunched up

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.670
like this.
-There's a great assortment of bits and pieces:

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.840
valves, knobs, cables. Do you want to take
us through what all these do?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.340
-The big blue valve on the front is really
useful: If you do inflate the space suit and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.380
then you have to do some manoeuvre, which
might be difficult to do because you've inflated,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.410
you can decrease the pressure, you check this
little valve on the suit's arm to see what

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.910
pressure you've decreased it to. From memory
that goes to about 0.26 of an atmosphere,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.330
but that's not really very much oxygen to
breathe, so you can do that only for a short

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.630
time before you then need to rest again. You
then use the blue valve on the front to increase

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.720
the pressure back up to 0.4 of an atmosphere,
and that's enough for you to breathe and survive.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.569
You can do that repeatedly until you've got
the manoeuvre done.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.709
-When you are in it and trying to work, how
easy is it?

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.720
-It's uncomfortable. Typically, astronauts
lose about 2 litres of sweat just during the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.310
launch phase because, as you can see, where
are you going to lose heat from? If you can

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.660
open your helmet you can get a bit of ventilation
on your head. There are ventilation holes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.599
just underneath the rim of the helmet that
will enable air to come up past your face,

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.140
that not only keep you cool but stop your
helmet from misting up as well.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:28.760
-You're onboard Mir for the first time: can
you tell me remember what was going through

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.280
your mind?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.170
-Once you've docked and made sure you're not
leaking air from the seal, you can then open

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.090
the hatch and float inside. It's lovely to
be able to float into these long thing modules,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:54.760
and just go all the way down. And then this
wonderful way that you can just stretch out.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.170
You get used to weightlessness so easily.
Within seconds you forget what it's like to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:12.550
stand and feel the pressure of the floor beneath
your feet. And you adopt naturally a different

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.569
way of moving; you tend to hold things between
your knees or feet and then manoeuvre through

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.390
the space station with your arms, which is
of course the reverse of on earth, where you'd

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.630
walk with your feet and hold things with your
hands. You just naturally do that.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:38.130
When I look back now, it was very much a personal
thing. I remember my colleagues, I remember

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.459
some of those details like just floating by
a window and all coming together in the evening

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:54.640
and talking and looking out. It's those personal
times you remember. We did a job of work,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.520
but as with any job when you look back over
what you've done in the last year, do you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.150
really remember that report you wrote for
your boss? Actually you remember your colleagues

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:36.440
and your interactions with them mostly.
