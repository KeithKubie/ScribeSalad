00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
In our earlier examples of comparing different versions against one another,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.950
we just conveniently had those old working versions sitting around.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.020
In that case we manually saved off old versions under different file names.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.140
I personally used to do this all the time with school essays, math papers, and

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.030
LaTeX and so on.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.770
This is one very primitive form of version control.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.380
How else might you get old version of your files?

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.460
It's likely that you've actually interacted with some systems that do some form

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.100
of version control for you.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.720
Have you ever used Dropbox?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
Dropbox actually periodically saves versions of your files.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.940
After you've edited a file, you can right-click and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.140
choose View Previous Versions.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.390
And then in the browser, you can check some of the old versions.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.500
Note that by default Dropbox only saves these version for 30 days.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.260
Do you use Google Docs?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.220
There's a little link up at the top that says, All Changes Saved in Drive.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.280
If you click on that you get a side panel of all the old revisions made by

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.490
anyone who's ever worked on the Doc.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.250
And you can restore to any point in time.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.030
What about Wikipedia?

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.230
If you go to any Wikipedia article, say maybe the one on version control,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.560
you'll see a View History tab that you can click on to see all the old versions.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.780
You can click through to see an entire old version or

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.335
you can compare any two versions against one another.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:12.220
Let's take some time now for another reflection
