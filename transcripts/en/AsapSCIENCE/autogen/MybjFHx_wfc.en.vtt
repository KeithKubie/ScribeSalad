00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.810
 You may have heard about the intelligence of celebrities 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.860
 But how is IQ measured and how can it be stacked? 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.200
 One of the most common tests involves recognizing emotions in people's faces 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.599
 For example, what is this expression? 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.699
 Do you think it is a sign of embarrassment, sadness, amusement or shyness? 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.490
 If you guessed it is an embarrassment sign you are right! 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.560
 This test is used to help measure your ability to empathize and communicate effectively with others 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.760
 So let's look at the most common intelligence test - the IQ test, also known 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.020
 In the name of IQ 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.820
 It is a standardized test that evaluates verbal and nonverbal abilities 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.660
 Study the sequence of this geometric pattern at the moment 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.890
 Now of these six squares, which tiles will you choose to complete the pattern? 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.560
 I'll give you a few seconds, but pause the video if you need more time 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.100
 If you choose form number five, then you are right! 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.860
 Basically, each row contains a diamond, square and triangle 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500
 In addition to a solid bar and padded bar and empty bar 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.979
 Since this bottom row contains a triangle and a diamond, we know the following square, as it has 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820
 Tape is empty and padded, so we know we need a solid tape 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.509
 The direction of the tape is the same on each line 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.170
 Although IQ tests are common, there are other ways to test whether you are smart 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.340
 There is now a prominent theory of "multiple intelligences," such as rhythmic musical intelligence 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.440
 To test your audio! 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.240
 Which of these songs sounds "out of range" for you? 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.080
 The first tune? 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.560
 The second tone? 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
 Or the third tune? 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.880
 If you guessed in the third section, this means that you have a good sense about the vocal layers 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.179
 Although it is not fully understood, you can be deaf-mouthed and still have a perfect hearing though 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.540
 How your brain interprets sounds that are hard to interpret 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940
 Now, what about your optical intelligence? 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.120
 I'll show you a picture of these six shapes for ten seconds 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:15.620
 Try to remember it as best you can! 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.359
 Well now which of these three models have you seen already? 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.180
 If you guessed the "C" you are right! 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.680
 This task requires the use of Ziggernes objects - fictional objects that do not exist in real life 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.070
 In order to test you accurately 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.040
 If you are well on the Zegrens mission you may have higher optical intelligence and it is not 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 Same IQ 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.989
 But this may mean that you will excel in tasks such as matching fingerprints, and interpreting medical x-rays 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
 Or tracking aircraft on radar screens 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.931
 Not all intelligence, for example, can be measured by physical intelligence 

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:54.030
 Being able to handle things skillfully is difficult to break up 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.860
 The study of children aged four years in one of the ballet classes could not effectively assess the rhythm because some 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.510
 He has taken lessons before or has been dancing at home creating a prior knowledge 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.060
 Many intelligence tests also require a combination of many types of intelligence, so it is difficult 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.299
 Study only one type 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.540
 What this research confirms is that there are many ways to be intelligent 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.560
 It is not just about testing intelligence 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560
