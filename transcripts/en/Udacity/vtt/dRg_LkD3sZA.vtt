00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] Within a class of 5 properties,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the class must cover the 5 houses but in any order.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How many ways can we make that assignment?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In other words, here's 5 houses, here's 5 properties in a property group,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and here's 1 possible assignment.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
How many different assignments are there of assigning these properties

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and matching them up with the houses?

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Are there just 5 ways, 5 squared ways, 2 to the 5th ways, or 5 factorial ways?
