let's talk about slopes of linear

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260
let's talk about slopes of linear
 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.480
let's talk about slopes of linear
functions a function is increasing if

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490
functions a function is increasing if
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.609
functions a function is increasing if
it's graph moves upward from left to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
it's graph moves upward from left to
 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.670
it's graph moves upward from left to
right okay so this I'm sure you've seen

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680
right okay so this I'm sure you've seen
 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.839
right okay so this I'm sure you've seen
before the input the output when you

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849
before the input the output when you
 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.970
before the input the output when you
draw the graph that is the set of all

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980
draw the graph that is the set of all
 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.080
draw the graph that is the set of all
points that satisfy that rule if that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090
points that satisfy that rule if that
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.440
points that satisfy that rule if that
line is increasing then we call it an

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450
line is increasing then we call it an
 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.720
line is increasing then we call it an
increasing function this is a linear

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730
increasing function this is a linear
 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.360
increasing function this is a linear
function insofar as it has a positive it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370
function insofar as it has a positive it
 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.830
function insofar as it has a positive it
has a constant slope throughout all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
has a constant slope throughout all
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.840
has a constant slope throughout all
values of X you could formally define an

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
values of X you could formally define an
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.410
values of X you could formally define an
increasing function f of X such that for

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420
increasing function f of X such that for
 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.390
increasing function f of X such that for
any two x's for any X one that's greater

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400
any two x's for any X one that's greater
 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.070
any two x's for any X one that's greater
than x2 F of x1 is also greater than f

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080
than x2 F of x1 is also greater than f
 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.710
than x2 F of x1 is also greater than f
of x2 similarly you could define a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
of x2 similarly you could define a
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
of x2 similarly you could define a
decreasing function in the same way you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090
decreasing function in the same way you
 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.770
decreasing function in the same way you
would simply reverse the inequality

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
would simply reverse the inequality
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.680
would simply reverse the inequality
function is decreasing if for any x1

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690
function is decreasing if for any x1
 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.480
function is decreasing if for any x1
greater than X 2 f of x1 is less than f

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490
greater than X 2 f of x1 is less than f
 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.580
greater than X 2 f of x1 is less than f
of X 2 okay so as you increase X f of X

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590
of X 2 okay so as you increase X f of X
 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.740
of X 2 okay so as you increase X f of X
goes down so this is a very common

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750
goes down so this is a very common
 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.270
goes down so this is a very common

policy you're often looking at variables

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140
policy you're often looking at variables
 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.740
policy you're often looking at variables
to try to determine whether they have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
to try to determine whether they have
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.630
to try to determine whether they have
whether the function that relates those

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640
whether the function that relates those
 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.000
whether the function that relates those
two variables is increasing or

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010
two variables is increasing or
 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.630

paired variables and you might plot them

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
paired variables and you might plot them
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.410
paired variables and you might plot them
on a graph and you might want to figure

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
on a graph and you might want to figure
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.530
on a graph and you might want to figure
out whether it has an increasing slope

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540
out whether it has an increasing slope
 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.199
out whether it has an increasing slope
or a decreasing slope or has no slope at

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
or a decreasing slope or has no slope at
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.050
or a decreasing slope or has no slope at
all and that's precisely what ordinary

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
all and that's precisely what ordinary
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.880
all and that's precisely what ordinary
least-squares regression is all about

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890
least-squares regression is all about
 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.050
least-squares regression is all about
right okay okay so what's a linear

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
right okay okay so what's a linear
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.210
right okay okay so what's a linear
function it's one where the graph is a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
function it's one where the graph is a
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.250
function it's one where the graph is a
straight line in other words its slope

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
straight line in other words its slope
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.240
straight line in other words its slope
is constant how do I write down the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250
is constant how do I write down the
 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.160
is constant how do I write down the
equation of a linear function this you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
equation of a linear function this you
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.310
equation of a linear function this you
must all remember you may have different

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
must all remember you may have different
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.229

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160
so y equals B plus MX is the way I
 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.670
so y equals B plus MX is the way I
learnt it but you may have seen y equals

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
learnt it but you may have seen y equals
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.520
learnt it but you may have seen y equals
BX plus C or something like that okay

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
BX plus C or something like that okay
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:56.940
BX plus C or something like that okay

as the y-intercept okay let's just draw

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
as the y-intercept okay let's just draw
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.680
as the y-intercept okay let's just draw
a quick

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690
 
 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.470
 
in the Cartesian plane if I were to draw

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480
in the Cartesian plane if I were to draw
 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:45.150
in the Cartesian plane if I were to draw
this as the straight line what quantity

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160
this as the straight line what quantity
 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.830

is this B right that's the y-intercept

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840
is this B right that's the y-intercept
 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.270
is this B right that's the y-intercept
okay and if if you don't remember that

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
okay and if if you don't remember that
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.690
okay and if if you don't remember that
just keep in mind that the y-intercept

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700
just keep in mind that the y-intercept
 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.520
just keep in mind that the y-intercept
is of course the point at which X is

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530
is of course the point at which X is
 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.930
is of course the point at which X is
equal to 0 anytime you're on the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940
equal to 0 anytime you're on the
 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.080
equal to 0 anytime you're on the
y-intercept X is equal to 0 so you would

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090
y-intercept X is equal to 0 so you would
 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.020
y-intercept X is equal to 0 so you would
substitute 0 in here and so Y would be

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030
substitute 0 in here and so Y would be
 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.780
substitute 0 in here and so Y would be
equal to B what about this point here

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790
equal to B what about this point here
 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.480
equal to B what about this point here
what what what about this distance here

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
what what what about this distance here
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.740
what what what about this distance here
sorry this is U so you're actually right

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750
sorry this is U so you're actually right
 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.090
sorry this is U so you're actually right
this is the x-intercept and what what is

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100
this is the x-intercept and what what is
 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.120
this is the x-intercept and what what is
the quantity that I'm looking for so

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130
the quantity that I'm looking for so
 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.160
the quantity that I'm looking for so
you'll have to do a little bit of

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170
you'll have to do a little bit of
 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.200
you'll have to do a little bit of
algebra ok so let's just take a step to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210
algebra ok so let's just take a step to
 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:55.050
algebra ok so let's just take a step to
do that ok so so let's let's do that a

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060
do that ok so so let's let's do that a
 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.290
do that ok so so let's let's do that a
little bit more slowly y is equal to MX

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300
little bit more slowly y is equal to MX
 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.020
little bit more slowly y is equal to MX
plus B this holds everywhere on the line

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030
plus B this holds everywhere on the line
 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.730
plus B this holds everywhere on the line
we are looking for a point on the x

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740
we are looking for a point on the x
 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.180
we are looking for a point on the x
intercept which means the Y value is of

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
intercept which means the Y value is of
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.830
intercept which means the Y value is of
course equal to 0 so we are looking for

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840
course equal to 0 so we are looking for
 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.450
course equal to 0 so we are looking for
the point the sub set of all these

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460
the point the sub set of all these
 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.980
the point the sub set of all these
points where Y itself is equal to 0 so

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990
points where Y itself is equal to 0 so
 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.890
points where Y itself is equal to 0 so
we want the value of x where Y is equal

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900
we want the value of x where Y is equal
 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.159
we want the value of x where Y is equal
to 0 so that's MX

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169
 
 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:45.900
 
so X is equal to minus B over m okay

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910
so X is equal to minus B over m okay
 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:53.230
so X is equal to minus B over m okay
okay so just keep that in mind and I

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240
okay so just keep that in mind and I
 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.700
okay so just keep that in mind and I
think that's exactly what we just did

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710
think that's exactly what we just did
 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.800
think that's exactly what we just did
okay

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810
okay
 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.230
okay
okay now the slope of course is also

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240
okay now the slope of course is also
 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.440
okay now the slope of course is also

known as the rise over the run you'll
find this very useful on Thursday when

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240
find this very useful on Thursday when
 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.409
find this very useful on Thursday when
we start talking about calculus for

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419
we start talking about calculus for
 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.840
we start talking about calculus for
linear functions the slope is a simple

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850
linear functions the slope is a simple
 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.129
linear functions the slope is a simple
concept it's a fixed number the

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139
concept it's a fixed number the
 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.730
concept it's a fixed number the
coefficient of x in this case M it

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740
coefficient of x in this case M it
 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.430
coefficient of x in this case M it
indicates two things both steepness and

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440
indicates two things both steepness and
 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.779
indicates two things both steepness and
direction right so if the slope M is a

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:34.789
direction right so if the slope M is a
 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:38.770
direction right so if the slope M is a
large number has large magnitude then it

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:38.780
large number has large magnitude then it
 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.540
large number has large magnitude then it
is a very steep function okay you could

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550
is a very steep function okay you could
 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:55.750
is a very steep function okay you could
think of it in terms of grade this is a

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:55.760
think of it in terms of grade this is a
 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.830
think of it in terms of grade this is a
very steep function that is M is very

00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840
very steep function that is M is very
 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.940
very steep function that is M is very
large this is a relatively shallow

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:03.950
large this is a relatively shallow
 

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:10.450
large this is a relatively shallow
function M is relatively small so M low

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:10.460
function M is relatively small so M low
 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:21.779
function M is relatively small so M low
M high this is a this is a very steep

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:21.789
M high this is a this is a very steep
 

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.150
M high this is a this is a very steep
function with a negative M so this would

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.160
function with a negative M so this would
 

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:34.199
function with a negative M so this would
be minus M H and this would be minus M L

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:34.209
be minus M H and this would be minus M L
 

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:40.480
be minus M H and this would be minus M L
okay a relatively shallow declining

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490
okay a relatively shallow declining
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.180
okay a relatively shallow declining
function

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.190
 
 

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:52.730
 
okay we use the concept of slope to

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740
okay we use the concept of slope to
 

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.690
okay we use the concept of slope to
define linear functions as opposed to

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700
define linear functions as opposed to
 

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.540
define linear functions as opposed to
nonlinear functions any function that

00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.550
nonlinear functions any function that
 

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.640
nonlinear functions any function that
has a constant slope is a linear

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:01.650
has a constant slope is a linear
 

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.020
has a constant slope is a linear
function any function whose slope

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.030
function any function whose slope
 

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.060
function any function whose slope
changes for different values of X is a

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.070
changes for different values of X is a
 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:19.010
changes for different values of X is a
nonlinear function okay so this is a

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.020
nonlinear function okay so this is a
 

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.250
nonlinear function okay so this is a
nonlinear function here it is steeply

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260
nonlinear function here it is steeply
 

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.300
nonlinear function here it is steeply
downward sloping here it's gradually

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.310
downward sloping here it's gradually
 

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.240
downward sloping here it's gradually
downward sloping here it's flat

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.250
downward sloping here it's flat
 

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.910
downward sloping here it's flat
here it's steeply upward sloping so its

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920
here it's steeply upward sloping so its
 

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.870
here it's steeply upward sloping so its
slope changes it is a nonlinear function

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880
slope changes it is a nonlinear function
 

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.100
slope changes it is a nonlinear function
so let's talk about equations of those

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.110
so let's talk about equations of those
 

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.960
so let's talk about equations of those
linear functions we'll stay in the world

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:44.970
linear functions we'll stay in the world
 

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.980
linear functions we'll stay in the world
of linear functions for a little while

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
 
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.740
 
suppose you know only the slope of a

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.710
suppose you know only the slope of a
linear function can you derive its

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
linear function can you derive its
 

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.570
linear function can you derive its

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.690
equation I have a bad habit of asking
questions and putting the answers on the

questions and putting the answers on the
 

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.850

class you you are required to sign up

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
class you you are required to sign up
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.530
class you you are required to sign up
for a class where you're going to be on

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540
for a class where you're going to be on
 

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.350
for a class where you're going to be on
the hot seat and you have to answer

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360
the hot seat and you have to answer
 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.120
the hot seat and you have to answer
questions on the readings for that class

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.130
questions on the readings for that class
 

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.970
questions on the readings for that class
and to everybody else but often the

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:19.980
and to everybody else but often the
 

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.800

but but sometimes people are so stunned

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680
but but sometimes people are so stunned
 

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.710
but but sometimes people are so stunned
that they're asked that they still don't

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720
that they're asked that they still don't
 

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:36.650
that they're asked that they still don't
answer okay so of course the slope if

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660
answer okay so of course the slope if
 

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.210

you just know the slope of a linear

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220
you just know the slope of a linear
 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.730
you just know the slope of a linear
function you cannot construct its

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740
function you cannot construct its
 

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.820
function you cannot construct its
equation why

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:44.830
 
 

00:10:44.830 --> 00:11:03.030
 
yes rich okay okay so that's a good

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040
yes rich okay okay so that's a good
 

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.500
yes rich okay okay so that's a good
question

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.510
question
 

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.150
question
if you know the slope and let's say as a

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160
if you know the slope and let's say as a
 

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.780
if you know the slope and let's say as a
result you know two points on the line

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:12.790
result you know two points on the line
 

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.009
result you know two points on the line
why could you not know the equation is

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:17.019
why could you not know the equation is
 

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:20.400
why could you not know the equation is
there a flaw in what I just said what's

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.410
there a flaw in what I just said what's
 

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.949
there a flaw in what I just said what's
the flaw you don't know two points on

00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:25.959
the flaw you don't know two points on
 

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:27.420
the flaw you don't know two points on
the line because you know the slope

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:27.430
the line because you know the slope
 

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.130
the line because you know the slope
right and look and let's take a look at

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:29.140
right and look and let's take a look at
 

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:39.300
right and look and let's take a look at
the picture okay so suppose Richard you

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.310
the picture okay so suppose Richard you
 

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.280
the picture okay so suppose Richard you
tell me that the slope is equal to one

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.290
tell me that the slope is equal to one
 

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.360
tell me that the slope is equal to one
okay that means it has a 45 degree angle

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.370
okay that means it has a 45 degree angle
 

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.699
okay that means it has a 45 degree angle
to the origin that means that I know

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:50.709
to the origin that means that I know
 

00:11:50.709 --> 00:12:02.600
to the origin that means that I know
that M is equal to one

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.610
 
 

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:08.100
 
right so they so I know I know

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.110
right so they so I know I know
 

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.579
right so they so I know I know
the class of equations that it falls

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:11.589
the class of equations that it falls
 

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:18.030
the class of equations that it falls
into but not the exact one okay but it's

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040
into but not the exact one okay but it's
 

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.110
into but not the exact one okay but it's
a good question because you see

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120
a good question because you see
 

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.819
a good question because you see
econometrics and statistics in general

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:26.829
econometrics and statistics in general
 

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:30.930
econometrics and statistics in general
is about establishing lines from unknown

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:30.940
is about establishing lines from unknown
 

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.720
is about establishing lines from unknown
information and there are often times

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:33.730
information and there are often times
 

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.319
information and there are often times
when you know only the slope

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:36.329
when you know only the slope
 

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:39.809
when you know only the slope
it shouldn't paralyze you knowing the

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:39.819
it shouldn't paralyze you knowing the
 

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.780
it shouldn't paralyze you knowing the
slope still means you know quite a lot

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:41.790
slope still means you know quite a lot
 

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.340
slope still means you know quite a lot
okay for example you know you don't know

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
okay for example you know you don't know
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.769
okay for example you know you don't know
the equation of that line but you know

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:49.779
the equation of that line but you know
 

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:55.470
the equation of that line but you know
the equation two and two one unknown

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480
the equation two and two one unknown
 

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.990
the equation two and two one unknown
that is the constant okay so there are

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000
that is the constant okay so there are
 

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.850
that is the constant okay so there are
some things that even this will tell you

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860
some things that even this will tell you
 

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.179
some things that even this will tell you
for example this tells you that is

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:06.189
for example this tells you that is
 

00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:08.910
for example this tells you that is
knowing that your functional

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920
knowing that your functional
 

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.699
knowing that your functional
relationship is described by any one of

00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:11.709
relationship is described by any one of
 

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:16.530
relationship is described by any one of
these three lines tells you that if you

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:16.540
these three lines tells you that if you
 

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.800
these three lines tells you that if you
were to increase X by a certain amount

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:19.810
were to increase X by a certain amount
 

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.429
were to increase X by a certain amount
you would know what the likely impact on

00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:23.439
you would know what the likely impact on
 

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:25.829
you would know what the likely impact on
Y would be that's the very definition of

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839
Y would be that's the very definition of
 

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.710
Y would be that's the very definition of
slope right there rise over the run so

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720
slope right there rise over the run so
 

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.769
slope right there rise over the run so
knowing the slope and not knowing the

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:31.779
knowing the slope and not knowing the
 

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:34.620
knowing the slope and not knowing the
intercept might still tell you a lot

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:34.630
intercept might still tell you a lot
 

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.960
intercept might still tell you a lot
about a relationship so so get used to

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:39.970
about a relationship so so get used to
 

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.269
about a relationship so so get used to
this type of questioning that Richard

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279
this type of questioning that Richard
 

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:46.670
this type of questioning that Richard
just did because it should it should

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680
just did because it should it should
 

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.480
just did because it should it should
allow you to engage with your exact

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:51.490
allow you to engage with your exact
 

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.980
allow you to engage with your exact
level of knowledge without you know

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:55.990
level of knowledge without you know
 

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.900
level of knowledge without you know
without shutting you down or without

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:57.910
without shutting you down or without
 

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.790
without shutting you down or without
silencing you if you don't have

00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800
silencing you if you don't have
 

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.429
silencing you if you don't have
everything that the cookbook recipe

00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:02.439
everything that the cookbook recipe
 

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:07.829
everything that the cookbook recipe
needed you to have now if you only know

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839
needed you to have now if you only know
 

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.670
needed you to have now if you only know
the y-intercept of a linear function

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680
the y-intercept of a linear function
 

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.790
the y-intercept of a linear function
again you would not be able to give me

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800
again you would not be able to give me
 

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.380
again you would not be able to give me
the equation

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:15.390
the equation
 

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.990
the equation
and the picture is going to be a little

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000
and the picture is going to be a little
 

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.290
and the picture is going to be a little
bit different okay okay can someone tell

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300
bit different okay okay can someone tell
 

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.220
bit different okay okay can someone tell
me if you know the y-intercept of a

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.230
me if you know the y-intercept of a
 

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.889
me if you know the y-intercept of a
linear function so that means I know B

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899
linear function so that means I know B
 

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:36.650
linear function so that means I know B
but I don't know M so suppose that that

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660
but I don't know M so suppose that that
 

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:43.690
but I don't know M so suppose that that
B is here so I know that it crosses here

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:43.700
B is here so I know that it crosses here
 

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.130
B is here so I know that it crosses here
what are some of the different lines

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.140
what are some of the different lines
 

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.930
what are some of the different lines
that would satisfy that sorry what's

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940
that would satisfy that sorry what's
 

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.329
that would satisfy that sorry what's
your name

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:52.339
your name
 

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:56.000
your name
Monika a whole wheel of potential lines

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.010
Monika a whole wheel of potential lines
 

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.610
Monika a whole wheel of potential lines
right so it would might look like that

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620
right so it would might look like that
 

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:03.620
right so it would might look like that
sorry my drawing is terrible here okay

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:03.630
sorry my drawing is terrible here okay
 

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.280
sorry my drawing is terrible here okay
so any of these so actually what's very

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.290
so any of these so actually what's very
 

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:14.650
so any of these so actually what's very
interesting is that what character is

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:14.660
interesting is that what character is
 

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.850
interesting is that what character is
your knowledge if you just know the

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:18.860
your knowledge if you just know the
 

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.340
your knowledge if you just know the
y-intercept its it's a firm up or a

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:22.350
y-intercept its it's a firm up or a
 

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.259
y-intercept its it's a firm up or a
character than if you just knew the

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:24.269
character than if you just knew the
 

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:27.980
character than if you just knew the
slope because if you're look trying to

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:27.990
slope because if you're look trying to
 

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.060
slope because if you're look trying to
look at the relationship between x and y

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.070
look at the relationship between x and y
 

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.439
look at the relationship between x and y
knowing the slope can actually tell you

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:33.449
knowing the slope can actually tell you
 

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:34.939
knowing the slope can actually tell you
quite a bit and in fact it's quite

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:34.949
quite a bit and in fact it's quite
 

00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:39.050
quite a bit and in fact it's quite
routine in statistical analysis to not

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060
routine in statistical analysis to not
 

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.170
routine in statistical analysis to not
know what the what the intercept is but

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180
know what the what the intercept is but
 

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.110
know what the what the intercept is but
to know just the slope but knowing not

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120
to know just the slope but knowing not
 

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.210
to know just the slope but knowing not
knowing the slope means you virtually

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220
knowing the slope means you virtually
 

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.189
knowing the slope means you virtually
know nothing because it's highly

00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199
know nothing because it's highly
 

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:50.600
know nothing because it's highly
unlikely that you're going to be

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:50.610
unlikely that you're going to be
 

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.889
unlikely that you're going to be
interested in the one case where X is

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899
interested in the one case where X is
 

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:58.100
interested in the one case where X is
equal to zero and that's all you can

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.110
equal to zero and that's all you can
 

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.250
equal to zero and that's all you can
talk about if you just know that the the

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260
talk about if you just know that the the
 

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:09.199
talk about if you just know that the the
y-intercept right okay okay now so in

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:09.209
y-intercept right okay okay now so in
 

00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:11.150
y-intercept right okay okay now so in
order to derive the equation either you

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160
order to derive the equation either you
 

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.670
order to derive the equation either you
have to know both the slope and the

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680
have to know both the slope and the
 

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.759
have to know both the slope and the
y-intercept or as Richard pointed out if

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:16.769
y-intercept or as Richard pointed out if
 

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:19.819
y-intercept or as Richard pointed out if
you knew two points on the line you

00:16:19.819 --> 00:16:19.829
you knew two points on the line you
 

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:23.420
you knew two points on the line you
could construct the slope and you could

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.430
could construct the slope and you could
 

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.990
could construct the slope and you could
also construct the y-intercept

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000
also construct the y-intercept
 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.920
also construct the y-intercept
okay and so let's let's do a problem

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:30.930
okay and so let's let's do a problem
 

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:52.560
okay and so let's let's do a problem
like that

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:52.570
 
 

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.930
 
okay so we have to find the equation of

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:54.940
okay so we have to find the equation of
 

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.530
okay so we have to find the equation of
the line which has a slope of 4 and a

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:58.540
the line which has a slope of 4 and a
 

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.580
the line which has a slope of 4 and a
set of coordinates 3 - 2 right and I'd

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:02.590
set of coordinates 3 - 2 right and I'd
 

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.220
set of coordinates 3 - 2 right and I'd
like to try to do that graphically

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.230
like to try to do that graphically
 

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.620
like to try to do that graphically
initially so that you get a sense of the

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:07.630
initially so that you get a sense of the
 

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.500
initially so that you get a sense of the
intuition and then we'll we'll look at

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:10.510
intuition and then we'll we'll look at
 

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:21.330
intuition and then we'll we'll look at
how that's done algebraically ok ok so I

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:21.340
how that's done algebraically ok ok so I
 

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.280
how that's done algebraically ok ok so I
think this is the Greek way of solving

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.290
think this is the Greek way of solving
 

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.570
think this is the Greek way of solving
the problem that is geometrically and

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:27.580
the problem that is geometrically and
 

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.120
the problem that is geometrically and
then we'll do it the Arab way of solving

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.130
then we'll do it the Arab way of solving
 

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:36.960
then we'll do it the Arab way of solving
the problem which is algebraically ok so

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:36.970
the problem which is algebraically ok so
 

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.260
the problem which is algebraically ok so
it has a slope of 4 so we know that it

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.270
it has a slope of 4 so we know that it
 

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.940
it has a slope of 4 so we know that it
is a relatively steep slope could be any

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:44.950
is a relatively steep slope could be any
 

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.960
is a relatively steep slope could be any
one of these lines and we know that one

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:48.970
one of these lines and we know that one
 

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:57.180
one of these lines and we know that one
of the points on the line is 3 - 2 3 - 2

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.190
of the points on the line is 3 - 2 3 - 2
 

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:04.310
of the points on the line is 3 - 2 3 - 2
is something like that this is 3 and

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320
is something like that this is 3 and
 

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.620
is something like that this is 3 and
this is 2

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:09.630
 
 

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.490
 
ok so we're really looking for a line

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:14.500
ok so we're really looking for a line
 

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:22.380
ok so we're really looking for a line
like this so I know that 3 might this is

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:22.390
like this so I know that 3 might this is
 

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:31.350
like this so I know that 3 might this is
3 - 2 useful piece of information would

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360
3 - 2 useful piece of information would
 

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.040
3 - 2 useful piece of information would
be to know what B is right

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.050
be to know what B is right
 

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:40.020
be to know what B is right
B is probably down here so how might I

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.030
B is probably down here so how might I
 

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:48.390
B is probably down here so how might I
find out that B from this yes what's

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400
find out that B from this yes what's
 

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.870
find out that B from this yes what's
your name Sarah okay that's just from so

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880
your name Sarah okay that's just from so
 

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.990
your name Sarah okay that's just from so
let's let's go let's just get used to

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000
let's let's go let's just get used to
 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.390
let's let's go let's just get used to
that it's something you should

00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400
that it's something you should
 

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.220
that it's something you should
internalize ok I don't know this is

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.230
internalize ok I don't know this is
 

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.340
internalize ok I don't know this is
going to stay up

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.350
 
 

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:10.110
 
the slope is the rise over the run so

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120
the slope is the rise over the run so
 

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.210
the slope is the rise over the run so
suppose that the rise is equal to the

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.220
suppose that the rise is equal to the
 

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.600
suppose that the rise is equal to the
run the slope would then be 1 over 1

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:15.610
run the slope would then be 1 over 1
 

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:21.330
run the slope would then be 1 over 1
which is 1 and so that would have a

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:21.340
which is 1 and so that would have a
 

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.530
which is 1 and so that would have a
45-degree angle and here the slope is

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:26.540
45-degree angle and here the slope is
 

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:33.070
45-degree angle and here the slope is
equal to 1 if the slope was 1 in 10

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080
equal to 1 if the slope was 1 in 10
 

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.350
equal to 1 if the slope was 1 in 10
the rides was 1 for every run of 10

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360
the rides was 1 for every run of 10
 

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.120
the rides was 1 for every run of 10
you'd only have a small rise for a long

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.130
you'd only have a small rise for a long
 

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.650
you'd only have a small rise for a long
run so this would be the slope so here

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:44.660
run so this would be the slope so here
 

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:53.410
run so this would be the slope so here
the slope is 1 in 10 similarly a slope

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:53.420
the slope is 1 in 10 similarly a slope
 

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.560
the slope is 1 in 10 similarly a slope
of 4 would mean a rise of 4 for a run of

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:56.570
of 4 would mean a rise of 4 for a run of
 

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.780
of 4 would mean a rise of 4 for a run of
you see so that's why it would look like

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:58.790
you see so that's why it would look like
 

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.999
you see so that's why it would look like
that ok

00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:05.009
 
 

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:11.219
 
okay so we're looking for this intercept

00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:11.229
okay so we're looking for this intercept
 

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:16.619
okay so we're looking for this intercept
I know the slope is 4 I know this point

00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:16.629
I know the slope is 4 I know this point
 

00:20:16.629 --> 00:20:22.109
I know the slope is 4 I know this point
is 3 so how would I find out this point

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:22.119
is 3 so how would I find out this point
 

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:34.889
is 3 so how would I find out this point
just thinking geometrically yes perfect

00:20:34.889 --> 00:20:34.899
just thinking geometrically yes perfect
 

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:39.570
just thinking geometrically yes perfect
okay everybody see that okay she's a

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:39.580
okay everybody see that okay she's a
 

00:20:39.580 --> 00:21:20.539
okay everybody see that okay she's a
fast she's a fast think so

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:20.549
fast she's a fast think so
 

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:26.759
fast she's a fast think so
graphically it's very helpful and in in

00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:26.769
graphically it's very helpful and in in
 

00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:29.909
graphically it's very helpful and in in
certain kinds well pretty much in in all

00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919
certain kinds well pretty much in in all
 

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.749
certain kinds well pretty much in in all
sorts of problems it's always helpful to

00:21:33.749 --> 00:21:33.759
sorts of problems it's always helpful to
 

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:36.329
sorts of problems it's always helpful to
understand the equations graphically

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:36.339
understand the equations graphically
 

00:21:36.339 --> 00:21:39.409
understand the equations graphically
okay and to know where you are

00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419
okay and to know where you are
 

00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:45.499
okay and to know where you are
okay so I know that this point the the

00:21:45.499 --> 00:21:45.509
okay so I know that this point the the
 

00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:52.919
okay so I know that this point the the
y-intercept is minus 14 0 I know the

00:21:52.919 --> 00:21:52.929
y-intercept is minus 14 0 I know the
 

00:21:52.929 --> 00:22:00.539
y-intercept is minus 14 0 I know the
slope I'm sorry 0 minus 14 so B is

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:00.549
slope I'm sorry 0 minus 14 so B is
 

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:05.039
slope I'm sorry 0 minus 14 so B is
actually minus 14 so I know that Y is

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:05.049
actually minus 14 so I know that Y is
 

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:11.519
actually minus 14 so I know that Y is
equal to MX plus B which is 4x minus 14

00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:11.529
equal to MX plus B which is 4x minus 14
 

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:15.299
equal to MX plus B which is 4x minus 14
and you could do a quick check to see if

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:15.309
and you could do a quick check to see if
 

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:17.070
and you could do a quick check to see if
this point what

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080
this point what
 

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:23.250
this point what
make sense three times four is 12 minus

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.260
make sense three times four is 12 minus
 

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:33.650
make sense three times four is 12 minus
14 is minus 2 okay okay so and

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:33.660
14 is minus 2 okay okay so and
 

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.750
14 is minus 2 okay okay so and
presumably that's what we did okay this

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760
presumably that's what we did okay this
 

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.080
presumably that's what we did okay this
is this is the algebraic way of doing it

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.090
 
 

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:48.030
 
which is really just the expression of

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.040
which is really just the expression of
 

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.140
which is really just the expression of
what we did okay so we've got we know

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.150
what we did okay so we've got we know
 

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.070
what we did okay so we've got we know
that the equation follows this form MX

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080
that the equation follows this form MX
 

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.480
that the equation follows this form MX
plus B we know that M is 4 we're looking

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:00.490
plus B we know that M is 4 we're looking
 

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:06.080
plus B we know that M is 4 we're looking
for B and we let x1 we let this point

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.090
for B and we let x1 we let this point
 

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:17.910
for B and we let x1 we let this point
3-2 be x1 y1 and then we know that x1 y1

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:17.920
3-2 be x1 y1 and then we know that x1 y1
 

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.680
3-2 be x1 y1 and then we know that x1 y1
is on the line we let the wine to set B

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:22.690
is on the line we let the wine to set B
 

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.850
is on the line we let the wine to set B
x2 y2 which is the point here we're

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:26.860
x2 y2 which is the point here we're
 

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.260
x2 y2 which is the point here we're
trying to look for that point okay we

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:31.270
trying to look for that point okay we
 

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.870
trying to look for that point okay we
use the fact that the rise over the run

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880
use the fact that the rise over the run
 

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:42.600
use the fact that the rise over the run
is 4 that's the rise over the run the

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:42.610
is 4 that's the rise over the run the
 

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.690
is 4 that's the rise over the run the
change in X is in the denominator the

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:45.700
change in X is in the denominator the
 

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.790
change in X is in the denominator the
change in Y is in the numerator and we

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:50.800
change in Y is in the numerator and we
 

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.390
change in Y is in the numerator and we
simply solve for X x1 we know that x2 is

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400
simply solve for X x1 we know that x2 is
 

00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:01.620
simply solve for X x1 we know that x2 is
0 because we're on the intercept ok and

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:01.630
0 because we're on the intercept ok and
 

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.640
0 because we're on the intercept ok and
then we solve so algebra this is algebra

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:05.650
then we solve so algebra this is algebra
 

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.190
then we solve so algebra this is algebra
of course algebra comes from an Arabic

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200
of course algebra comes from an Arabic
 

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.300
of course algebra comes from an Arabic
word which means completion is about the

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.310
word which means completion is about the
 

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.470
word which means completion is about the
process of looking for an unknown so

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480
process of looking for an unknown so
 

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:25.560
process of looking for an unknown so
there's always unknown in algebra which

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:25.570
there's always unknown in algebra which
 

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.230
there's always unknown in algebra which
you're trying to find okay in this case

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240
you're trying to find okay in this case
 

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.480
you're trying to find okay in this case
the unknown that we

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.490
the unknown that we
 

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:38.880
the unknown that we
completed was the minus 14 okay okay so

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:38.890
completed was the minus 14 okay okay so
 

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.480
completed was the minus 14 okay okay so
here's another problem find the equation

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:42.490
here's another problem find the equation
 

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.070
here's another problem find the equation
the line which passes through now two

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080
the line which passes through now two
 

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:52.430
the line which passes through now two
points so here we have a problem like

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440
points so here we have a problem like
 

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.430
points so here we have a problem like
the one Richard suggested we have two

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440
the one Richard suggested we have two
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.500
the one Richard suggested we have two
points we don't know the slope but of

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.510
points we don't know the slope but of
 

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:10.290
points we don't know the slope but of
course anytime you have two points you

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:10.300
course anytime you have two points you
 

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:18.560
course anytime you have two points you
can find the slope right there was a

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:18.570
 
 

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.919
 
long time ago there's a there still is a

00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:22.929
long time ago there's a there still is a
 

00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:25.560
long time ago there's a there still is a
restaurant on Amsterdam called Amsterdam

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:25.570
restaurant on Amsterdam called Amsterdam
 

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.760
restaurant on Amsterdam called Amsterdam
cafe it's been much renovated since I

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:29.770
cafe it's been much renovated since I
 

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.220
cafe it's been much renovated since I
used to go there as a as an undergrad

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.230
used to go there as a as an undergrad
 

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.940
used to go there as a as an undergrad
but there was a very mathematical waiter

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:35.950
but there was a very mathematical waiter
 

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.650
but there was a very mathematical waiter
there that's the sort of thing you find

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:37.660
there that's the sort of thing you find
 

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.810
there that's the sort of thing you find
in New York right mathematical waiters

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:39.820
in New York right mathematical waiters
 

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.760
in New York right mathematical waiters
and architect taxi drivers and so he is

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:44.770
and architect taxi drivers and so he is
 

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.010
and architect taxi drivers and so he is
so at some point I think a friend of

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.020
so at some point I think a friend of
 

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.870
so at some point I think a friend of
mine and I went in and we had one drink

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880
mine and I went in and we had one drink
 

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.730
mine and I went in and we had one drink
and we were debating whether to have

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:53.740
and we were debating whether to have
 

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.950
and we were debating whether to have
another one or not and the guy showed up

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960
another one or not and the guy showed up
 

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.860
another one or not and the guy showed up
the waiters came by and he said well if

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:58.870
the waiters came by and he said well if
 

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.870
the waiters came by and he said well if
you have one drink it's a point but if

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880
you have one drink it's a point but if
 

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.919
you have one drink it's a point but if
you have two drinks it's a line so so

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:07.929
you have two drinks it's a line so so
 

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:10.950
you have two drinks it's a line so so
that was a way to sell sell another

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960
that was a way to sell sell another
 

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.520
that was a way to sell sell another
drink and once you've had two you can

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:14.530
drink and once you've had two you can
 

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.230
drink and once you've had two you can
have an infinite number of drinks and

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240
have an infinite number of drinks and
 

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:23.850
have an infinite number of drinks and
not feel bad about it okay so now so

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:23.860
not feel bad about it okay so now so
 

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.850
not feel bad about it okay so now so
let's let's let's find the slope here

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:28.860
 
 

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:36.180
 
minus 2 3 and 3/8 so let's so I haven't

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.190
minus 2 3 and 3/8 so let's so I haven't
 

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:50.639
minus 2 3 and 3/8 so let's so I haven't
quite drawn this right

00:26:50.639 --> 00:26:50.649
 
 

00:26:50.649 --> 00:27:05.000
 
okay

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:05.010
 
 

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:10.370
 
okay so I simply want to construct the

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380
okay so I simply want to construct the
 

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.360
okay so I simply want to construct the
slope and of course it's going to be the

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.370
slope and of course it's going to be the
 

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:21.380
slope and of course it's going to be the
rise over the run and at this point you

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.390
rise over the run and at this point you
 

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.600
rise over the run and at this point you
probably at this point you're all

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.610
probably at this point you're all
 

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.240
probably at this point you're all
experts at this of course so what's the

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.250
experts at this of course so what's the
 

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:32.450
experts at this of course so what's the
rise it's the change in Y so 8 minus 3

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460
rise it's the change in Y so 8 minus 3
 

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:46.270
rise it's the change in Y so 8 minus 3
right and what's the run is 5 right

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:46.280
 
 

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:53.390
 
everybody ok ok so that's M and you

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.400
everybody ok ok so that's M and you
 

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.330
everybody ok ok so that's M and you
could you could certainly just work out

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:58.340
could you could certainly just work out
 

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:10.669
could you could certainly just work out
what this is to get B okay okay so yeah
