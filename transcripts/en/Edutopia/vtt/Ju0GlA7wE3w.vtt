00:00:00.876 --> 00:00:03.956
&gt;&gt;Alec: With my peers, it's
really hard for me to apologize.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.726
So I was wondering if
you guys have any tips.

00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:07.806
&gt;&gt;Linda: A really important aspect

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.806
of learning is developing
agency and responsibility.

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:14.976
That also requires being resourceful.

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:20.436
It requires being metacognitive,
being able to reflect on where you are

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.786
and what you need to do to move forward.

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:26.126
And we see all of that in
the student-led conference.

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:36.876
&gt;&gt;Lynnel: So often in anything
that you do in education, in life,

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:40.566
students always feel like, oh, adults
are always saying their opinion,

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:42.566
I don't have a voice,
I never have any say.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.286
So part of what we do

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:48.406
with the student-led
meetings is they get a chance

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.966
to say what their concerns
are, how they see things.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:52.366
&gt;&gt;Alec: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:54.706
&gt;&gt;Dan: Alec led his own meeting today.

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:59.866
And we bring in all teachers, me,
parents, to say here are some strengths

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.846
of mine and here are some
challenges that I need help with.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:10.966
&gt;&gt;Alec: With my schoolwork and
tests and stuff, it's pretty good,

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.346
but when it comes to
homework, it's really bad.

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:15.716
&gt;&gt;Alec: It allows all of us
to get all on the same page.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.856
Homework really hurt
my grades this quarter,

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:20.906
so that's something I
really need to improve.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:26.466
&gt;&gt;Linda: In student-led conferences,
we see students learning these skills

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:33.276
of how to articulate their needs, make
plans to improve, get help from others,

00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:37.056
and own the goals that
they set for themselves.

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:38.346
&gt;&gt;Alec: The second I get home,

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:40.546
I don't feel like doing
anything else involving school.

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.436
So I was actually going to ask you
guys if you guys had any ideas.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:46.936
&gt;&gt;Linda: Social-emotional
competencies have to do with the ways

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:51.376
that we recognize our
emotions and manage them,

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:54.776
the ways in which we interact
interpersonally with others,

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:59.896
the ways in which we organize
ourselves to get things done.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:03.396
&gt;&gt;Alec: For me, it's actually being
able to sit down and get it done.

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:05.316
Because once I sit down to get
it done, it's going to get done.

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.576
Getting started is the
hardest part for me.

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:10.136
&gt;&gt;Student: Just staying
after and doing homework

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:11.706
with your friends before
you go home is a good idea.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:15.806
&gt;&gt;Linda: Interestingly, the social and
emotional competencies are as important

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:19.186
as the intellectual skills
that we try to teach in school,

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:23.386
and they predict more of how
you do in school and in life

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.966
than particular lessons that
get taught academically.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:32.736
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: I think it's about him
having to set goals for himself

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.846
and for us to give him the
best tools to work with so

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:36.926
that he can accomplish those goals.

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:39.476
&gt;&gt;Chad: And then, you be able
to see yourself in a new light,

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.386
which only gives you
more of that confidence.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:47.696
&gt;&gt;Chad: The fact that he has eight or
nine, ten, adults for these meetings

00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:49.836
to actually get on the
same page and say, look.

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:51.626
We recognize you're here.

00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:53.046
We see where you've come from.

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:56.096
And we want you to tell
us where you want to go.

00:02:56.246 --> 00:03:01.556
And just having that
collaboration is-- it's wonderful.

00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:04.276
&gt;&gt;Linda: When schools and
parents are working in sync

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:07.406
around a shared understanding
of a child's development,

00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:13.016
you get a much more robust
set of responses and supports.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:13.086
&gt;&gt;Alec: Yeah.

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:16.706
I just wanted to thank Mr. St.
Louis real quick, and all of you,

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.026
for being such good teachers.

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:21.636
I think I improved more just 
because I got a personal 

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.246
relationship with all of you.
