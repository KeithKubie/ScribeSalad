because our population today is 1.2

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:05.790
because our population today is 1.2
 

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.510
because our population today is 1.2
billion it's growing very fast and in

about 33 years by 2050 Africa will
 

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.350
about 33 years by 2050 Africa will
account for one fourth or the world

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360
account for one fourth or the world
 

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.580
account for one fourth or the world
population and it will have the youngest

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:24.590
population and it will have the youngest
 

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.140
population and it will have the youngest
population in the continent in the world

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.150
population in the continent in the world
 

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.330
population in the continent in the world
so this is clearly a major challenge for

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:34.340
so this is clearly a major challenge for
 

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.680
so this is clearly a major challenge for
governments but for the people of

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.690
governments but for the people of
 

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.960
governments but for the people of
African for the world I would say and

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:38.970
African for the world I would say and
 

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.310
African for the world I would say and
also it's a good opportunity because

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320
also it's a good opportunity because
 

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.310
also it's a good opportunity because
obviously with a young population it

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320
obviously with a young population it
 

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.590
obviously with a young population it
means having a strong manpower and also

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600
means having a strong manpower and also
 

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.790
means having a strong manpower and also
a chances of accelerating technology and

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800
a chances of accelerating technology and
 

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.480
a chances of accelerating technology and
innovation

00:14:59.480 --> 00:14:59.490
innovation
 

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.860

and Africa of course 20 years ago was

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:03.870
and Africa of course 20 years ago was
 

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.090
and Africa of course 20 years ago was
seen as the hopeless continent that

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100
seen as the hopeless continent that
 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.930
seen as the hopeless continent that
economists today obviously this has

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940
economists today obviously this has
 

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.440
economists today obviously this has
changed it was about 10 years ago

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.450
changed it was about 10 years ago
 

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.550
changed it was about 10 years ago
Africa's rising and now aspiring Africa

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560
Africa's rising and now aspiring Africa
 

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.680
Africa's rising and now aspiring Africa
because the progress has been quite

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:21.690
because the progress has been quite
 

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.730
because the progress has been quite
impressive

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740
impressive
 

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.300
impressive
and obviously this is due to a lot of

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:28.310
and obviously this is due to a lot of
 

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.130
and obviously this is due to a lot of
things that you know I will not insist

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.140
things that you know I will not insist
 

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.110
things that you know I will not insist
on them because of the abundant natural

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120
on them because of the abundant natural
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.470
on them because of the abundant natural
resources of the continent and that we

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480
resources of the continent and that we
 

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.240
resources of the continent and that we
have achieved also the strongest growth

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.250
have achieved also the strongest growth
 

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.380
have achieved also the strongest growth
rate in the world over the past the past

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.390
rate in the world over the past the past
 

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.270
rate in the world over the past the past
ten years or so the past three years

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:50.280
ten years or so the past three years
 

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.990
ten years or so the past three years
have been very difficult but clearly

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000
have been very difficult but clearly
 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.480
have been very difficult but clearly
we've been much above the growth rates

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:56.490
we've been much above the growth rates
 

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.810
we've been much above the growth rates
of the OECD countries and this is a

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:01.820
of the OECD countries and this is a
 

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.250
of the OECD countries and this is a
challenge I was saying because at this

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260
challenge I was saying because at this
 

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.770
challenge I was saying because at this
pace in terms of population growth by

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:08.780
pace in terms of population growth by
 

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.500
pace in terms of population growth by
2050 Nigeria will be the third most

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:14.510
2050 Nigeria will be the third most
 

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:20.240
2050 Nigeria will be the third most
populated country ahead of after China

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.250
populated country ahead of after China
 

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.060
populated country ahead of after China
and India and ahead of the United States

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.070
and India and ahead of the United States
 

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:28.130
and India and ahead of the United States
in terms of population and I think if my

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.140
in terms of population and I think if my
 

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:35.630
in terms of population and I think if my
recollection is right Ethiopia and Congo

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:35.640
recollection is right Ethiopia and Congo
 

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.050
recollection is right Ethiopia and Congo
Kinshasa will be among the ten most

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060
Kinshasa will be among the ten most
 

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.370
Kinshasa will be among the ten most
populated countries in in the world so

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380
populated countries in in the world so
 

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.450
populated countries in in the world so
this shows how much potential there is

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:46.460
this shows how much potential there is
 

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.840
this shows how much potential there is
in terms of demography and obviously

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:50.850
in terms of demography and obviously
 

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.830
in terms of demography and obviously
this would require that the governments

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:54.840
this would require that the governments
 

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.700
this would require that the governments
work hard well develop policies which

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:58.710
work hard well develop policies which
 

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.410
work hard well develop policies which
can create jobs and also absorb the

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420
can create jobs and also absorb the
 

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.380
can create jobs and also absorb the
young population and to avoid some of

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.390
young population and to avoid some of
 

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.210
young population and to avoid some of
the problems that we've been talking

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220
the problems that we've been talking
 

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.930
the problems that we've been talking
about today actually at the UN a

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:10.940
about today actually at the UN a
 

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.919
about today actually at the UN a
question about my

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:12.929
question about my
 

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:16.509
question about my
raishin of a younger through the Sahara

00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:16.519
raishin of a younger through the Sahara
 

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:18.769
raishin of a younger through the Sahara
dying in the Mediterranean

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:18.779
dying in the Mediterranean
 

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:21.799
dying in the Mediterranean
because they're not allowed to reach to

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:21.809
because they're not allowed to reach to
 

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:25.819
because they're not allowed to reach to
reach Europe and obviously this

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:25.829
reach Europe and obviously this
 

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:31.669
reach Europe and obviously this
challenge we can try to do to do have

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679
challenge we can try to do to do have
 

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:35.840
challenge we can try to do to do have
Senate it's not easy but I think it's

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:35.850
Senate it's not easy but I think it's
 

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.279
Senate it's not easy but I think it's
our responsibility and if we don't have

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:40.289
our responsibility and if we don't have
 

00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:44.779
our responsibility and if we don't have
the right policies I think clearly it

00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:44.789
the right policies I think clearly it
 

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.820
the right policies I think clearly it
will be a problem not only for Africa

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:46.830
will be a problem not only for Africa
 

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.239
will be a problem not only for Africa
but for the world at large as I said

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:50.249
but for the world at large as I said
 

00:17:50.249 --> 00:17:53.930
but for the world at large as I said
getting the question of migration as an

getting the question of migration as an

example and today we had lunch with
 

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:02.060
example and today we had lunch with

President Trump we were not many just
 

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.639
President Trump we were not many just
nine head of states and we'd have some

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:04.649
nine head of states and we'd have some
 

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:07.700
nine head of states and we'd have some
of the issues we discussed with him to

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:07.710
of the issues we discussed with him to
 

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.299
of the issues we discussed with him to
get a bit more precision on his vision

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:11.309
get a bit more precision on his vision
 

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:15.919
get a bit more precision on his vision
for Africa and the policies of the

for Africa and the policies of the

United States in the years to come now I
 

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.779
United States in the years to come now I
think to make sure that we continue to

think to make sure that we continue to
 

00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:26.859
think to make sure that we continue to
make progress we need to ensure

necessary for for the country and in
fact the World Bank considered that we

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:45.690
fact the World Bank considered that we
 

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.609
fact the World Bank considered that we
were among for two consecutive years

00:27:48.609 --> 00:27:48.619
were among for two consecutive years
 

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:50.549

World Bank doing business reports and
these good base good performance was

00:28:07.259 --> 00:28:07.269
these good base good performance was
 

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:10.460
these good base good performance was
also due to various investment codes

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:10.470
also due to various investment codes
 

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.460
also due to various investment codes
which we improved the mining code the

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:14.470
which we improved the mining code the
 

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.369
which we improved the mining code the
petroleum codes the general investment

00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:17.379
petroleum codes the general investment
 

00:28:17.379 --> 00:28:20.759
petroleum codes the general investment
code and so forth and as a result the

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:20.769
code and so forth and as a result the
 

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:24.930
code and so forth and as a result the
ratio of investment to GDP which was

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:24.940
ratio of investment to GDP which was
 

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:31.379
ratio of investment to GDP which was
about 9 percent in 2011 was 20 percent

00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:31.389
about 9 percent in 2011 was 20 percent
 

00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:35.340
about 9 percent in 2011 was 20 percent
in 2016 so it more than doubled this of

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.350
in 2016 so it more than doubled this of
 

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.879
in 2016 so it more than doubled this of
course explains why the growth rate had

00:28:38.879 --> 00:28:38.889
course explains why the growth rate had
 

00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:42.210
course explains why the growth rate had
been so high and at the same time we put

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.220
been so high and at the same time we put
 

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.330
been so high and at the same time we put
a lot of emphasis on social expenditure

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:45.340
a lot of emphasis on social expenditure
 

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.139
a lot of emphasis on social expenditure
health and education which allowed the

00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:49.149
health and education which allowed the
 

00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:52.889
health and education which allowed the
rate of poverty leading the poverty to

00:28:52.889 --> 00:28:52.899
rate of poverty leading the poverty to
 

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:56.039
rate of poverty leading the poverty to
drop substantially during this period

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:56.049
drop substantially during this period
 

00:28:56.049 --> 00:29:00.649
drop substantially during this period
and of course we met good progress on

00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659
and of course we met good progress on
 

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:03.869
and of course we met good progress on
employment especially youth employment

00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:03.879
employment especially youth employment
 

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:07.470
employment especially youth employment
and we're very proud of that and in

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480
and we're very proud of that and in
 

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.909
and we're very proud of that and in
terms of social expenditure we now make

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919
terms of social expenditure we now make
 

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:16.109
terms of social expenditure we now make
sure that 1/3 of a budget is devoted to

00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:16.119

social expenditures in health and
 

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.649
social expenditures in health and
education because obviously we have so

education because obviously we have so
 

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:26.460
education because obviously we have so
much emphasis to private investment but

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.470
much emphasis to private investment but
 

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.239

about 20 hours today so this is clearly

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440
about 20 hours today so this is clearly
 

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.840
about 20 hours today so this is clearly
a major development and so in terms of

have any water for the population so we

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:54.520
have any water for the population so we
 

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.030
have any water for the population so we
were able to improve this and we built a

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:57.040
were able to improve this and we built a
 

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.120

00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:59.980
well
one is the COAS and the other static

00:49:59.980 --> 00:49:59.990
one is the COAS and the other static
 

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:03.529
one is the COAS and the other static
because clearly there is political win

00:50:03.529 --> 00:50:03.539
because clearly there is political win
 

00:50:03.539 --> 00:50:08.089
because clearly there is political win
and also the countries have goods to

00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099
and also the countries have goods to
 

00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:11.329
and also the countries have goods to
trade with each other and I think that

00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339
trade with each other and I think that
 

00:50:11.339 --> 00:50:16.190
trade with each other and I think that
is also a good environment where you

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200
is also a good environment where you
 

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.579
is also a good environment where you
from Zimbabwe but globally a good

00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:19.589
from Zimbabwe but globally a good
 

00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:23.029
from Zimbabwe but globally a good
democratic environment in most of the

00:50:23.029 --> 00:50:23.039
democratic environment in most of the
 

00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:27.140
democratic environment in most of the
countries and I think all this helps in

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.150
countries and I think all this helps in
 

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.980
countries and I think all this helps in
terms of setting rules abiding by them

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:30.990
terms of setting rules abiding by them
 

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:35.509
terms of setting rules abiding by them
and so forth so it's not easy I would

00:50:35.509 --> 00:50:35.519
and so forth so it's not easy I would
 

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:39.740
and so forth so it's not easy I would
say because sometimes when people see

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:39.750
say because sometimes when people see
 

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.900
say because sometimes when people see
that one of the country code bar for

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:41.910
that one of the country code bar for
 

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.870
that one of the country code bar for
example has been making a lot of

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880
example has been making a lot of
 

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.140

progress and want to export goods to
 

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.259
progress and want to export goods to
some other countries it requires that we

00:50:51.259 --> 00:50:51.269
some other countries it requires that we
 

00:50:51.269 --> 00:50:54.920
some other countries it requires that we
send our ministers to convince our

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:54.930
send our ministers to convince our
 

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.910

our community rules and nationals from
 

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.880
our community rules and nationals from
other countries can come and work easily

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:07.890
other countries can come and work easily
 

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:10.430
other countries can come and work easily
in Cote d'Ivoire but I've lived there

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440

is very difficult for a variance to work

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680
is very difficult for a variance to work
 

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.400
is very difficult for a variance to work
in the other countries so you have to

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:19.410
in the other countries so you have to
 

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:25.960
in the other countries so you have to
have well to get the environment both in

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:25.970
have well to get the environment both in
 

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.289

so but it's not an easy and easy thing
 

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.980
so but it's not an easy and easy thing
to do in West Africa

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:45.990

engines of reality integration it can

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:34.970
engines of reality integration it can
 

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.300
engines of reality integration it can
work and Cote d'Ivoire has been an

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:37.310
work and Cote d'Ivoire has been an
 

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.930
work and Cote d'Ivoire has been an
engine for integration by absorbing the

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:40.940
engine for integration by absorbing the
 

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.630
engine for integration by absorbing the
population of other countries now you

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640
population of other countries now you
 

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.460
population of other countries now you
said what's the best thing about Cote

in the economic field
 

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:20.530
in the economic field
and what is clearly saying that some of

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:20.540
and what is clearly saying that some of
 

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.000
and what is clearly saying that some of
the political problems that we inherited

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.010
the political problems that we inherited
 

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:28.330

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:33.400
was of his doing and I agree I agree
fully because we for 40 kids we had a

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:33.410
fully because we for 40 kids we had a
 

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:36.820
fully because we for 40 kids we had a
one-party system and so forth and I

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:36.830
one-party system and so forth and I
 

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.859
one-party system and so forth and I
think the lesson I would draw from that

00:53:38.859 --> 00:53:38.869
think the lesson I would draw from that
 

00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:43.180
think the lesson I would draw from that
is that it's important to have democracy

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.190
is that it's important to have democracy
 

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:48.390
is that it's important to have democracy
and fair elections and make sure that

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400
and fair elections and make sure that
 

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.160
and fair elections and make sure that
people have an equal access to the

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:54.170
people have an equal access to the
 

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.470
people have an equal access to the
wealth of the country to the problems of

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480
wealth of the country to the problems of
 

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.230
wealth of the country to the problems of
the country the method equal access to

00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240
the country the method equal access to
 

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.359
the country the method equal access to
making the contribution to the country

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:01.369
making the contribution to the country
 

00:54:01.369 --> 00:54:05.440
making the contribution to the country
so clearly way and I think this is the

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:05.450
so clearly way and I think this is the
 

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:08.410
so clearly way and I think this is the
idea of the new constitution but we have

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:08.420
idea of the new constitution but we have
 

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.130
idea of the new constitution but we have
set up to make sure that it forces in a

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:12.140
set up to make sure that it forces in a
 

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.250
set up to make sure that it forces in a
way political integration and at the

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:15.260
way political integration and at the
 

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:18.700
way political integration and at the
same time it gives an opportunity for

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:18.710
same time it gives an opportunity for
 

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:21.790
same time it gives an opportunity for
everyone to compete and if a competition

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:21.800
everyone to compete and if a competition
 

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.599
everyone to compete and if a competition
is fair people will decide and I think

00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:25.609
is fair people will decide and I think
 

00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:27.730
is fair people will decide and I think
it's important that someone does not

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:27.740
it's important that someone does not
 

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.680
it's important that someone does not
take one person for as a ruler of the

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:32.690
take one person for as a ruler of the
 

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:41.380
take one person for as a ruler of the
country and as Anoka mentioned well that
