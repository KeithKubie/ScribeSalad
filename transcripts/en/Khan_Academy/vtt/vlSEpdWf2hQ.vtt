00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Voiceover] We're told, use
the interactive graph below

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.009
to sketch a graph of y
is equal to negative two,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.109
times three to the x, plus five.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.861
And so this is clearly
an exponential function

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.522
right over here.

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.200
Let's think about the behavior as x is,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.742
when x is very negative,

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:17.693
or when x is very positive.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:21.420
When x is very negative, three
to a very negative number

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.730
like let's say you had three
to the negative 3rd power,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.958
that would be 1/27th, or three
to the negative 4th power,

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.694
that would be 1/81st.

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:34.375
So this is going to get smaller,
and smaller, and smaller.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.753
It's going to approach zero
as x becomes more negative.

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.398
And since this is approaching zero,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.952
this whole thing right over
here is going to approach zero.

00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.076
And so this whole expression is,

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:48.074
if this first part is approaching zero,

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:50.616
then this whole expression
is going to approach five.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.417
So we're going to have
a horizontal asymptote

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.899
that we're going to approach
as we go to the left.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.080
As x gets more and more negative,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.575
we're going to approach positive five.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.037
And then as x gets larger,
and larger, and larger,

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:06.673
three to the x is growing exponentially.

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:08.656
But then we're multiplying
it times negative two,

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.932
so it's going to become more,
and more, and more negative.

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.591
And then we add a five.

00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.957
And so what we have here,
well this looks like a line.

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:19.012
We want to graph an exponential.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.598
So let's go pick the
exponential in terms of x.

00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:23.771
There you have it.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.619
And so we can move three things.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.528
We can move this point,
it doesn't even need

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:28.689
to just be the y-intercept,

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.940
although that's a convenient
thing to figure it out.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.840
We can move this point here.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.860
And we can move the asymptote.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.578
And maybe the asymptote's
the first interesting thing.

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.384
We said as x becomes
more, and more, and more,

00:01:40.384 --> 00:01:43.095
and more negative, y is
going to approach five.

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.337
So let me put this up here.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:46.858
So that's our asymptote.

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:48.237
It doesn't look like it quite yet,

00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:50.491
but when we try out some values for x

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.536
and the corresponding y's,

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:53.369
and we move these points accordingly,

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.272
hopefully our exponential
is going to look right.

00:01:56.272 --> 00:01:58.381
So let's think about, let's
pick some convenient x's.

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.448
So let's think about
when x is equal to zero.

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:04.045
If x is equal to zero, three
to the zeroth power is one.

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.461
Negative two times one is negative two,

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:09.142
plus three is three.

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:12.427
So when x is equal to zero, y is three.

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:15.407
And let's think about
when x is equal to one,

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.864
and I'm just picking that
'cause it's easy to compute.

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:21.845
Three to the first power is
three, times negative two

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:26.056
is negative six, plus
five is negative one.

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:30.166
So when x is one, y is negative one.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.104
And so let's see, does
this, is this consistent

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:33.846
with what we just described?

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:37.178
When x is very negative,
we should be approaching,

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:39.488
we should be approaching positive five,

00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:40.567
and that looks like the case.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.925
As we move to the left, we're
getting closer, and closer,

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:45.490
and closer to five, in fact,
it looks like they overlap,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.514
but it's really, we're
just getting closer,

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:49.579
and closer, and closer 'cause this term,

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.972
this term right over
here is getting smaller,

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:52.675
and smaller, and smaller
as x becomes more,

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:54.148
and more, and more negative.

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:56.773
But then as x becomes
more and more positive,

00:02:56.773 --> 00:02:58.687
this term becomes really negative

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:00.684
'cause we're multiplying
it times a negative two,

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:02.588
and we see that it
becomes really negative,

00:03:02.588 --> 00:03:05.492
so I feel pretty good about
what we've just graphed.

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:07.313
We've graphed the horizontal
asymptote, it makes sense,

00:03:07.313 --> 00:03:09.484
and we've picked two
points that sit on this,

00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:11.341
on the graph of this exponential.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.072
So I can check my answer,
and we got it right.
