00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.310
AMIR HERMELIN: Hello, everyone,
and welcome to our session,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.650
Seeing Inside Your Service.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.510
My name is Amir
Hermelin, and I'm

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240
a product manager for Google.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.390
And with me is Asaph Zemach, an
engineering manager for Google.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.270
And we're here to talk
about the exciting things

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.320
we're doing and planning
for monitoring and logging.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.300
Before I start, I'd like to
thank you all for attending,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.700
for coming to our conference,
showing your support,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.600
being loyal Google Cloud
users, so we really

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.540
rely on your support
and feedback.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.250
So thank you.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.300
Before we start, a show
of hands-- how many of you

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.440
actively monitor your services?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.680
Please raise your hands.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.180
OK, great.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.900
You're in the right place.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.441
Keep them up.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:02.840
Keep them up.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.730
How many of you like it
when you're firefighting,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.150
and you're sifting
through the information,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.544
trying to drill down and find
the relevant information?

00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:13.210
OK, that's good.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.410
That's good.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.500
And how many of you love it
when you're woken up at 3:00 AM

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.320
to do that?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.450
OK, you two-- you're
our lucky winners.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.490
Now, the rest of you--
oh, where's my clicker?

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:32.610
Here's what we're going
to be talking about.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
So quick look at
the agenda-- we'll

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.870
start with what we've learned
over the years and our plans

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.070
and vision for logging
and monitoring.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.720
Then, we'll talk a little
about our new Logs Viewer.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.970
You may have seen it at
this morning's keynote,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.830
and our logs ingestion pipeline.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.180
We'll then go over
our new time series

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.620
API, which is the first of many
upcoming APIs in this area.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.960
And we'll conclude with a quick
demo-- putting it all together.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.980
So monitoring at Google--
as you're probably aware,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.060
at Google, we run
many, many services.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.870
And we've been doing so over
the years-- small services,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.480
large services, from
really experimental

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.550
alpha-type services run by two,
three person teams, all the way

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.300
up to Google Search
and tens of thousands

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.190
of queries per
second services that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.590
are managed by distributed
teams all over the globe.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.750
And internally, we've
built very, very

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.400
capable and sophisticated
monitoring systems

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.490
for keeping these services up.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.440
And over the years, we've
learned many lessons.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.920
Some were harder to
learn than others.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.920
But we think most of the things
we've learned apply equally

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.740
to large and small services,
no matter what you're running.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.360
So some of the things that
we've learned over the years--

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.590
first of all, what you want
to do with your service

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.814
is you want to catch
problems early,

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.700
before these problems are
visible to your users.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.210
Because when your
service is down,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.960
or when your users have a hard
time accessing your service,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.640
that means downtime.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.870
You might lose revenue,
you might lose mind share,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.960
you might lose users, and it
might be all over Twitter-land.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.840
So you don't want to
get to that point.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.490
You want to catch
problems early.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.160
You want to be extra careful.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.750
And so you go on.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.060
You add alerts.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.160
You add dashboards.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.750
You have logs and all
sorts of indicators

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.680
to make you aware of
problems before they occur.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.460
But that introduces
another thing.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.990
That introduces noise.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.520
That introduces a lot of
information-- whoops-- a lot

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.760
of information that
really desensitizes you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.450
from the real issues that occur,
the real things that you should

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.940
focus on.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.800
And so what we've
learned is that you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.180
should focus on an
alert only on symptoms--

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.579
so focus on how will
things affect your users.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.480
Will these things
affect the users?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.260
Is this a real problem?

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.540
When will my users start sensing
it, and if you're firefighting,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.560
where should I start?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.850
I should start with
the things that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.370
matter to my users, that
are visible to my users.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.630
So that's what we've
learned over the years.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.690
But of course, what we've
learned and what we've done

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.860
is not enough.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.200
We went out and asked
you and other Cloud users

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.340
what they would like get from
their monitoring systems.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.330
And so here's what
we're hearing from you.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.350
Lots of you are telling
us that you've had alerts,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.810
but you had too many of them.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.000
They were noisy,
and you ended up

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.880
ignoring them-- maybe
partially, maybe in full.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.830
How many of you
can relate to that?

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.490
OK, good-- well, it's not good.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.400
But yeah, I see some
people in the audience

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.630
who know what I'm talking about.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.200
A relevant thing--
maybe you've heard

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.180
or you remember in the past few
months, some credit card fraud

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.580
occurrences that happened
at large online retailers.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.890
Now, in most-- probably
in all these cases,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.010
from what I understand--
the problem was

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.180
not that they didn't
have indicators.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.180
They actually had many logs.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.730
They had many alerts.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.590
They had many indicators.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.350
They might have had
too many that they've

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.440
ignored some of them, that
they had a hard time sifting

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.660
through the rest of
them, and by the time

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.740
they found out
about the problem,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.360
lots of credit card
information was stolen.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.010
It became public,
a huge problem,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.260
and these things sometimes
takes years to mend.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.570
So that's being too noisy.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.750
Now, too many of
you have told us

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.670
that our existing Log
Viewer for App Engine

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.210
is just not enough to
find the relevant logs.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.940
You have many logs.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.990
You have a lot of log volume,
and you'd like something better

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.820
to help you sift
through them and get

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.290
to the relevant information.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.410
How many of you think that?

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.960
OK, good.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.870
OK, you're in the
right place then.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:36.690
I am too.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.810
So most of you are
telling us that you

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.120
know you need a better
monitoring solution.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.970
You know you need
better monitoring

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.190
and alerts for things that
are running in production,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.510
but you just don't have
the time to spend on it.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.640
You want to ship new features,
and you don't have the time

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.600
to become experts at monitoring.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.680
And it's not just
learning the system,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.130
but learning how to monitor.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.440
And then absolutely no one--
except these two gentlemen

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.890
over there-- tell us that they
love to be woken up at 3 AM--

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.720
definitely if it's for
the wrong reasons, right?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.590
Sometimes there are
the right reasons,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.330
but if it's something that is
not urgent or could have been

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.140
handled automatically,
nobody likes that.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.440
And unless you're a
parent to a toddler,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.960
you don't really need to
wake up at those times.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:32.000
So what you're telling us that
our monitoring solution needs

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.220
to need to be-- it needs to
be actionable, so everything

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.920
results in an action.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.260
So alerts or dashboards are the
things that remove the noise

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.040
and help you focus
on the right things.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.210
It needs to be scalable.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.250
So even small teams can
manage huge services.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.660
It needs to be easy to use,
so a great out-of-the-box

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.840
experience, and easy to iterate
upon until you get to the right

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.850
setup, the right
dashboards, alerts,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.630
and logs that you're surfacing.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.840
And it needs to be smart.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.350
So if it does wake
you up at 3:00 AM,

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.565
you know you need to get out
of bed, and in your pajamas,

00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:15.600
either grab your laptop or
get to work and fix something.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.980
So where are we
going with all this?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.920
So we took what we've learned
and our existing systems

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.410
and what you've been
telling us, and here's

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.650
what we want to do with
our monitoring systems.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.090
Dashboards, alerts,
and logs-- we

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.789
want to surface only the
relevant information, right?

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.789
So you can understand
better what's happening

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.030
and how is it
affecting your users.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.690
We want to minimize
false-positives,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.310
so you can react faster
and not ignore real issues

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.390
before they occur or
during firefighting.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.980
And we want to help you
automatically detect

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.060
issues and find relevant events
and relevant information that

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.280
helps you running your services
and production so that even

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.870
small teams can scale up
and monitor and manage

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.100
huge services.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:18.920
So we want to help you be
insightful and react fast.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.880
And I want to remind
you of something

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.070
that Bobby said this
morning-- the CTO of Snapchat.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.315
He mentioned that they have a
relatively small team running

00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:30.410
a huge service, right?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.820
They have tens of
millions-- or probably

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.490
hundreds-- millions of users and
many, many queries per second.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.640
And he said that most
of the time they spend

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.010
is on rolling out and iterating
on new features and very

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.346
little time on
managing the platform.

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:50.970
And that's what we
want to help you do.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.350
We want to help you scale
monitoring so that we manage

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.050
your monitoring for
you, and you can

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.450
focus on getting
features out the door.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.810
OK?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.840
And with that, I'll
hand it over to Asaph.

00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:11.495
ASAPH ZEMACH: OK.

00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:12.960
Am I on?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.690
OK, so the first thing I
want to introduce today

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.150
is our new Logs
Viewer and pipeline.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.610
So here, we show the schematic
of the new logs pipeline

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.350
that we're introducing today.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.456
This pipeline is today
hooked up to App Engine,

00:10:27.456 --> 00:10:31.390
and we'll be hooking it
up to our other services

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.850
over the coming weeks.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.570
And what the nice thing
about this pipeline is it's

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.520
a transport mechanism for logs
going from one Google service

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.140
to a number of Google endpoints.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.306
The first of these endpoints
is the new Logs Viewer.

00:10:44.306 --> 00:10:49.486
You've seen it demoed today
in Brad's keynote address.

00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:51.760
And additional endpoints
that we're introducing today

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.220
are Google Cloud Storage.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.001
So if, for example, you
have your App Engine logs,

00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:58.000
and you want to do some
kind of batch processing

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.541
on top of that, you
want to run maybe

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:01.971
Hadoop on top of
that, you can enable,

00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:04.346
you can opt in to this option
of having your logs show up

00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:05.346
in Google Cloud Storage.

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:08.330
And what it'll do-- it will take
these logs, we'll buffer them,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.610
and we'll produce hourly files
inside Google Cloud Storage,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.350
and those are good
for batch processing.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.410
Additional options for you
is to opt into BigQuery.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.361
So for example, you can have
your logs-- your request logs,

00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:22.860
as they're coming
out of App Engine,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.270
flow through the
new logs pipeline

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.960
into BigQuery through
the new streaming

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.750
API that was announced today,
and have those available

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.370
for doing SQL queries
on top of them

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.470
for business intelligence
applications.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.110
So that's the new logs pipeline.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.910
And the Logs Viewer
is available today.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.420
The Cloud Storage
and BigQuery options

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.800
are available to
Trusted Testers,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.810
and Amir will give information
at the end of this presentation

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.910
of how to contact us and get to
be part of that Trusted Tester.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.660
So this is the new Logs Viewer.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.780
This is just a screenshot.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.422
I will not be doing a demo of
it since Brad's has already

00:11:58.422 --> 00:12:00.130
done it-- has gone
over all the features.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.700
I do want to just go over
some of the improvements

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.210
we're introducing.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.500
So the first of these
is infinite scroll.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.130
It makes it a lot easier for
you to move around in a log,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.810
to find a log you're
interested in,

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.018
to scroll up, to scroll down.

00:12:12.018 --> 00:12:14.730
It works really well with
a mouse wheel, for example.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.155
There's no more of the page
backwards, page forwards.

00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:19.720
We think it's going to
be a lot more convenient.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.640
The second thing is
automatic searches.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.980
So this is probably the
number one feature request

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.571
we've had from the
old Logs Viewer.

00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:30.070
I don't know if
anybody has ever run

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.403
into this-- when you do a
search, and nothing comes out,

00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:34.232
and you have to page
forward to find it.

00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:36.732
So raise your hand if you've
ever encountered this behavior?

00:12:36.732 --> 00:12:38.290
Yeah, I thought so.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.140
So this problem's now fixed.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.730
Now, the new Logs Viewer
doesn't exhibit this behavior,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.390
so I think that will make
a lot of people happier.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.100
If we're already
talking about searches,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.891
we've introduced an
improvement in searches

00:12:48.891 --> 00:12:50.680
so now you can do a
search both on labels

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.376
and regular expressions
from the same search box.

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.750
So that's a lot
more convenient--

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.124
and have suggestions
as you type,

00:12:56.124 --> 00:12:57.910
so if you're trying
to find, for example,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.950
something where the results
code is 500 and also contains

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.610
the word "success," as you
start typing results code,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.100
we'll help you
fill in that label.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.110
So it makes the Logs
Viewer a lot easier to use.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.660
So switching over from
talking over the Logs Viewer,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.410
I want to introduce
one of our new APIs--

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.480
so the first of the monitoring
APIs we're making available,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.000
and there'll be
many more coming.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.880
So what is the monitoring API
that we're introducing today?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.070
So we have a monitoring
system built inside Google

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.890
that what it does
is it periodically

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.847
samples important
system counters.

00:13:31.847 --> 00:13:34.305
So right now, it's connected
through App Engine and Compute

00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:35.220
Engine.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.787
And we collect--
as these systems

00:13:37.787 --> 00:13:39.870
are running, as they're
running your applications,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.930
our monitoring system samples
various counters-- for example,

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.560
how many requests you've made,
what the latency of the request

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.075
was, how much CPU you're using.

00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:48.704
And we're collecting all those.

00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:51.120
We're passing those through a
pipeline of monitoring data,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.310
and we're storing it
in a monitoring store.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.480
And now today, we're
introducing an API which

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.910
allows you to access that
monitoring information

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.930
and get metrics-- a
time series of data--

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.000
so for example, the history
of all the result codes

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.730
you have in your App
Engine application,

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.580
or the history of your CPU
utilization in GC over time.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.560
So one place where this time
series information is used

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.664
is you've seen all the nice
graphs in the Cloud Console.

00:14:18.664 --> 00:14:21.080
Well, those are based off of
that time series information,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.530
and that's one common
usage for that.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.899
So this is a list of the metrics
we're making available today.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.815
You see, we have a list
of App Engine metrics.

00:14:28.815 --> 00:14:30.860
We have a list of
Compute Engine metrics,

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.590
and we can go into
them in more detail,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.810
and we'll be introducing
much more later.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.300
So what does a
request look like?

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.670
I'll go into this
in some detail.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.950
So it's a standard REST request.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.950
The first part of it is the URL.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:49.061
Google APIs Cloud Monitoring
is where this API lives.

00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:50.310
Then comes the version number.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.860
So this is version v2
beta 1, so it's still

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.790
a fairly early
version of this API.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.957
Then you tell us which
project you're interested in.

00:14:57.957 --> 00:14:59.539
Then you tell us
what you want to get.

00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:01.590
In this case, you're trying
to get a time series.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.090
Then you're telling
us which service

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.590
you want to get the
time series for.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.490
In this case, it's Compute.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.020
There's an analogous
service for App Engine.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.506
And similarly,
there's [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:10.506 --> 00:15:11.380
instance information.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.620
You're telling us which
metric you want to get.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.300
In this case, you're telling
us you want the usage time.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.060
And the response you get
for this is-- essentially,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.285
it's a JSON object.

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:23.240
It tells you what
information you're getting.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.180
There's some metadata.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.740
For example, it tells you
what your project information,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.781
the metric name, some
label information,

00:15:28.781 --> 00:15:30.780
then followed by series
of points-- essentially,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.020
a start, an end
time, and a value.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.110
So it's a very classic
time-series information,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.290
very simple to use.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.894
And with that, I will
want to go to a demo.

00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:41.060
So what are we going to see?

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.800
So earlier in the presentation
that Brad did here,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.440
he showed the CloudMemeBackEnd.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:54.910
So we had an application where
someone was using an Android

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.960
application to talk
to something running

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.350
in the front-end in App Engine.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.099
And that was talking
to a back-end running

00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:00.870
in Compute Engine.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.490
And there was a MongoDB
element in there.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.876
So all these things
were running,

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:07.250
and as they were
running, we were

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.125
in the background
collecting metrics for them

00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:12.510
and putting them in the
Google Cloud metric store.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.000
And now, we'll see how
we can access that.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.280
So can we switch to the demo?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.230
Excellent.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:23.980
OK, so first, I will
go to my directory

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.780
to see I'm in the right place.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.730
And now, I'm going to
log in using OAuth.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.827
So the monitoring data
that we have is protected.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:35.910
It's your monitoring data.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.470
So it's not available using
standard cURL commands.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.700
They have to be
OAuth-enabled cURL commands,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.830
so your monitoring data can
only be accessed by you and not

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.850
by anybody else.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.140
So here we used the
OAuth cURL command

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.680
that's available off
of code.google.com.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.710
I log in.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.820
It asks me to
allow access to it.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.190
I allow the access.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.370
And now, we create--
gives me an OAuth token.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.680
The OAuth token is
stored on my machine.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.550
It's good for about
an hour, and now, I

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:13.490
can issue an OAuth cURL command
to get my monitoring data.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.284
So this is the Java
OAuth cURL command.

00:17:18.284 --> 00:17:19.825
As you can see, it's
a fetch command,

00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:22.190
so we're doing the OAuth fetch.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.240
And we're getting the Google
APIs, as I showed earlier.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.020
Memedroidbackend is the name
of the project on the computer,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.590
in Google Cloud console.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.390
And then we get
the exact instance.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.010
And there it is.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.830
It's all working.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.540
You can see it tells us what we
got-- the kind of information,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.300
some metadata, and
again, points, points,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.780
points all the way down--
just time series information,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.420
exactly as you would expect.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.461
AMIR HERMELIN: Thank you.

00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:52.430
Thank you, Asaph.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.205
Let's give a hand for
Asaph and his team.

00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:58.660
ASAPH ZEMACH: Thank you.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.535
AMIR HERMELIN: His team
has been working hard

00:18:00.535 --> 00:18:03.550
to get you these features
and the upcoming features.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.130
Some of the things
that we're working on

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:11.660
is extending the APIs, bringing
you dashboards and alerts,

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.660
and working on other
logs functionality

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:22.660
to make the monitoring and
logging experience much better,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.350
easily managed, and take
your time off of that

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.770
and so you can focus
on shipping features.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.950
So a little bit
about-- again, what

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.140
we've covered today, right?

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.540
We spoke about our vision,
the things that we've learned.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.040
We want to bring our systems,
our power, our scale,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.360
our monitoring systems to you,
but in a simple and intuitive

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.720
way, so you can get
started quickly.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.360
We showed you our new Logs
Viewer and our logs ingestion

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.000
pipeline-- which is, by
the way, in Trusted Tester,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.530
and I'll tell you how can take
part in that in a little bit.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.250
And we went through our time
series API-- which is, again,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.750
is the first of upcoming APIs--
to give you programmatic access

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.920
to your data, to help you build
on top of what we're offering.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.690
So you can extend
what we're offering

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.390
and do other things that we
might not have available today.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.430
And we took you through a demo.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.980
And I'll remind you that
what didn't work is plot,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.400
which is not our stuff, but
the rest of it, I assure you,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.036
is working well, and it
is in Trusted Tester --

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.630
our monitoring API.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.850
So we thank you.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.810
And one important
thing is we really,

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:44.330
really appreciate your comments,
suggestions, and feedback.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.850
If you have something
you want to tell us,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.660
or if you want to be part
of our Trusted Tester--

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.050
these are several Trusted Tester
programs-- the email is here.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.520
I don't know if you can see it.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.402
It's
 monitoring-and-logs-feedback@google.com,

00:19:58.402 --> 00:19:59.790
with dashes.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.792
So
 monitoring-and-logs-feedback@google.com,

00:20:03.792 --> 00:20:04.930
with dashes.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.450
And also, we'll be
here after we're

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.640
done to answer any questions.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.336
Do we have time
for a little Q&amp;A?

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:14.290
Yeah.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.510
OK, so any questions?

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.820
And please, speak up.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.300
MALE SPEAKER: No, we have a mic.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.710
AMIR HERMELIN: Oh, OK.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.440
We have a mic.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.940
Awesome.

00:20:22.925 --> 00:20:24.550
AUDIENCE: Was one of
the items that you

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.140
were able to monitor the
rights to the data store?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.206
AMIR HERMELIN: Sorry?

00:20:29.206 --> 00:20:31.580
AUDIENCE: Were you able to
monitor the rights to the data

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.460
store?

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.370
ASAPH ZEMACH: Yes, so there's
a long list of metrics

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.450
that we showed available.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.550
There is rights from
GC, rights to the disk,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.190
and there's rights
to networking.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.840
So there's both networking and
disk access metrics for GC--

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.652
well, for the Compute Engine.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:58.920
For the App Engine,
I think it's mostly

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:09.457
around the-- we have-- can you
bring up the list of slides?

00:21:09.457 --> 00:21:10.290
AMIR HERMELIN: Yeah.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.030
ASAPH ZEMACH: So instead of me
trying to remember it by heart,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.430
we can just bring it up.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.020
We can just bring it up.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.950
AMIR HERMELIN: By the way,
we're adding to this list.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.866
ASAPH ZEMACH: OK, yes.

00:21:16.866 --> 00:21:19.040
So we have responses.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.152
We have quota denials,
usage, page speed,

00:21:21.152 --> 00:21:22.860
received and sent
bytes over the network.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.030
So that's what we
have available today.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.410
So that's the list of stuff
we have available now.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.875
And note, part of the reason
why we're doing Trusted Tester

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:30.790
is exactly to get
feedback to say, well,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.540
you know, it really
would be useful for me

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.804
to get data store bytes--
so we can add that.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.420
AMIR HERMELIN: Any
other questions?

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.890
Yes?

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.910
AUDIENCE: So you showed the
metrics from the App Engine

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.100
and Compute Engine going
into your metrics store.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.535
Will you be able to
send external metrics

00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:56.980
to the metric store
from an external source?

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.009
AMIR HERMELIN: So by external
source, you mean your own apps?

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:00.675
Or do you mean--

00:22:00.675 --> 00:22:02.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
outside of Google.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:08.980
AMIR HERMELIN: Yes, so we
will have a metric ingestion

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.974
API for your
user-defined metrics.

00:22:12.974 --> 00:22:15.390
That is future, so I don't
want to talk about it too much.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.060
But it will integrate with
the rest of the system

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.880
to be first-class citizens.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.350
So all the wonderful things
that we're working on

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.150
for our metrics will also be
available for your metrics.

00:22:29.138 --> 00:22:30.253
Yes?

00:22:30.253 --> 00:22:31.877
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any similar plans

00:22:31.877 --> 00:22:33.672
around Google Cloud Storage?

00:22:33.672 --> 00:22:35.130
AMIR HERMELIN: So
the question was,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.680
do we have any similar plans
around Google Cloud Storage,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.250
and the answer is yes.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.170
And there was a thumbs up.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.524
Next question?

00:22:45.524 --> 00:22:47.290
Ah, OK.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.820
I think we're also
running out of time

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.700
and-- oh, one last question.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.210
OK.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.700
AUDIENCE: Can you show
again the email address,

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.990
because I was trying to--

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.440
AMIR HERMELIN: Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.950
Of course, of course, of course.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.520
Monitoring-and-logs-feedback@google.com,
 with dashes.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.830
Or amirh@google.com if
you can't remember that.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:13.350
AMIR HERMELIN: What's that?

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:18.589
AUDIENCE: I get an error
when I send an email to that.

00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:20.380
ASAPH ZEMACH: He says
he gets an error when

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.200
he sends an email to that.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.074
AMIR HERMELIN: Oh,OK.

00:23:22.074 --> 00:23:25.260
Hmm-- give us--

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.654
AUDIENCE: Oh,
sorry. [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:26.654 --> 00:23:27.820
AMIR HERMELIN: Oh, it works?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.990
OK.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.680
Enough things not working
for this session, right?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.280
All right, thank you, everybody.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.387
And please let us
know what you think.

00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:37.720
We'd love to hear your feedback.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.270
Thank you.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.770
Thank you.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:44.218
[APPLAUSE]
