00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.980
- Yeah, the public thought
Kennedy looked great.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.581
Under the lights in those days,

00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.274
a blue shirt really is
better than a white shirt.

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:11.928
It helps if you speak
in complete sentences

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.848
and look at the cameras.
(audience laughing)

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:15.992
No question, people reacted to that.

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:18.857
And yes, Nixon looked
like he'd been sleeping

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:20.648
under a highway for a week--

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:23.276
(audience laughing)

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:25.943
But the numbers said, "So what,"

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.316
because the trial heats, the horse race,

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.483
didn't budge a millimeter.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.541
Between the first and the second one

00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.071
and between the first and the fourth,

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.654
the needle hardly moved at all.

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.843
And we also looked into another,

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:48.757
it's an example of something
that gets repeated for 60 years

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.110
and people think it's
repeated because it's true,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.267
namely that Nixon was
fantastic on the radio

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:56.673
and Kennedy was fantastic on television

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:57.916
and that's really what happened.

00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.438
There was absolutely no evidence

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:01.828
to support that contention at all.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.768
There was a survey, an audience survey,

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:06.255
done by Sindlinger's people,

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:09.482
but it wasn't published
until after the election,

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:11.976
and some indication
you have to discount it

00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:16.225
because the radio listeners
tended to be more rural by 1960

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:18.855
and thus more conservative.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:20.703
Nixon was very good in the debates.

00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:21.685
Point, counterpoint.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:22.971
The country was divided.

00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:24.554
Change, continuity.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.912
Take some risks for
peace, Cold War strength.

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:31.938
Right down the middle.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:35.381
We made an analogy in the general election

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:38.285
to a couple of guys on a teeter-totter.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.076
And in the course of those
three or four months,

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:43.873
the thing would move
an inch or two one way

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:45.371
and that's about it,

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.433
and the debates need to be
reexamined in that context,

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:53.600
I think, because they are
not the key to the election.
