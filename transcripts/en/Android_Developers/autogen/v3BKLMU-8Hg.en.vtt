a lot of effort and we found it
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.390
a lot of effort and we found it
virtually impossible to keep the

fit that well in the car it looks a
 

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.879
fit that well in the car it looks a
little bit out of place and so we've

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:16.889
little bit out of place and so we've
 

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:18.500
little bit out of place and so we've
been thinking about that a lot and we we

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.510
been thinking about that a lot and we we
 

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.170
been thinking about that a lot and we we
set out to refine the design language we

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180
set out to refine the design language we
 

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.819
set out to refine the design language we
wanted to make something that felt were

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:22.829
wanted to make something that felt were
 

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:24.740
wanted to make something that felt were
seamlessly integrated into the car and

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:24.750
seamlessly integrated into the car and
 

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.110
seamlessly integrated into the car and
so we drew a lot of our inspiration from

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120
so we drew a lot of our inspiration from
 

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.019
so we drew a lot of our inspiration from

drivers attention on the road and we

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100
drivers attention on the road and we
 

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.160
drivers attention on the road and we
took that inspiration and we combined it

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.170
took that inspiration and we combined it
 

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.379
took that inspiration and we combined it
with the best of material design to

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399
material design we took the gray values
 

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.640
material design we took the gray values
that existed today and we expanded them

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:04.650
that existed today and we expanded them
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.309

and something that looks much more
 

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.740
and something that looks much more
sophisticated we even refined the

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:15.750
sophisticated we even refined the
 

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.199

also designed to be much more scalable

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:55.710
also designed to be much more scalable
 

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.480
also designed to be much more scalable
and designed so that it can fit into the

wider and larger and taller screens that
 

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.460
wider and larger and taller screens that
are coming into cars today so the idea

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:04.470
are coming into cars today so the idea
 

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.200
are coming into cars today so the idea
is you can plug your phone into any car

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.210
is you can plug your phone into any car

has to be learned and doesn't feel as
 

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.840
has to be learned and doesn't feel as
intuitive as it could and so we asked

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:53.850
intuitive as it could and so we asked
 

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.299
intuitive as it could and so we asked
ourselves how can we improve that how

00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:56.309
ourselves how can we improve that how
 

00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:58.130
ourselves how can we improve that how
can we help people get started faster on

can we help people get started faster on
 

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.290
can we help people get started faster on
their drive how can we simplify the

kinds of key tasks that people do while
 

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.490
kinds of key tasks that people do while
driving how do we provide the right

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500
driving how do we provide the right
 

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.620
driving how do we provide the right
information at a glance and make it

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.630
information at a glance and make it
 

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.060
information at a glance and make it
easier for people to access their

easier for people to access their
 

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.880
easier for people to access their
content in their apps and create a more

innovation so let's take a closer look
 

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.850
innovation so let's take a closer look
first of all we've completely redesigned

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860
first of all we've completely redesigned
 

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.799
first of all we've completely redesigned
the navigation bar to make it easier to

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:09.809
the navigation bar to make it easier to
 

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:12.499
