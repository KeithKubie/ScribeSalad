Narrator:
INSTALLING A POOL ABOVE GROUND

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.334
COSTS MUCH LESS
THAN INSTALLING ONE IN GROUND.

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:11.634
THIS IS BECAUSE THERE'S
NO EXCAVATION REQUIRED.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.868
YOU CAN BUILD AN ELEVATED DECK
AROUND THE TOP

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.767
TO GIVE IT
AN IN-GROUND APPEARANCE,

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.467
OR YOU CAN SIMPLY CLIMB
UP A LADDER AND JUMP RIGHT IN.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.133
NO HOLE TO DIG,
NO UNDERGROUND PIPES TO INSTALL.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.133
JUST A DAY OR SO
OF ON-SITE PREP AND ASSEMBLY,

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.334
AND YOU CAN TAKE
TO YOUR ABOVE-GROUND POOL

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:35.133
LIKE A DUCK TO WATER.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:39.834
AT THE FACTORY,
A COMPUTER-GUIDED MACHINE

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:43.901
CUTS VINYL PANELS FOR THE POOL'S
WATER-RETAINING INSIDE SURFACE.

00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:47.100
THE VINYL COMES IN A WIDE CHOICE
OF PRINTED DESIGNS.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.868
IT'S TEAR-RESISTANT,
U.V.-RESISTANT,

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:53.367
AND IS TREATED
WITH AN ANTIFUNGAL COATING.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.400
THE WALL PANEL IS RECTANGULAR,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.234
AND THE FLOOR PANELS ARE CURVED
TO FIT THE POOL'S PERIMETER.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.200
THE WALL PANELS GO THROUGH
A WELDER THAT FUSES A BEAD

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.133
TO THE TOP EDGE.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.467
A BEAD IS A FLEXIBLE,
U-SHAPED, THERMOPLASTIC STRIP

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.801
THAT IS USED TO ATTACH
THE POOL WALL TO THE LINER.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.434
A HOT WELDING TOOL
SLIGHTLY MELTS BOTH THE BEAD

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:21.400
AND THE LINER EDGE,
SO WHEN THEY COOL AND SOLIDIFY,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.133
THEY'RE BONDED.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.767
THE LINER IS READY
TO BE ASSEMBLED.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.100
WORKERS USE
A MANUAL WELDING MACHINE

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.300
THAT GENERATES HEAT
WITH RADIO FREQUENCIES.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.868
THEY OVERLAP THE EDGES
OF ADJOINING PANELS,

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:40.400
THEN FUSE THEM TOGETHER.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.767
AFTER CONNECTING
THE FLOOR PANELS TO EACH OTHER,

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:48.400
WORKERS COMPLETE THE LINER BY
JOINING THE WALL TO THE FLOOR.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.667
A QUALITY-CONTROL INSPECTOR
CHECKS EVERY SOLDERED SEAM

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.534
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SOLID.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.634
MEANWHILE, WORKERS MANUFACTURE

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:01.901
THE POOL'S
STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS.

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.067
THEY FEED A CONTINUOUS STRIP
OF PAINTED, GALVANIZED STEEL

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:07.534
THROUGH A ROLL FORMER.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:10.534
THE STRIP IS SHAPED
TO A SPECIFIC PROFILE.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:14.934
A PUNCH PRESS
CUTS THE COMPONENTS

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.501
TO THE REQUIRED LENGTH
AND SHAPE.

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:21.033
FOUR DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL
COMPONENTS ARE MADE THIS WAY --

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:24.467
THE PIECES THAT FORM THE TOP
AND BOTTOM TRACKS OF THE POOL,

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.434
THE VERTICAL POSTS
THAT SUPPORT THE POOL WALL,

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:32.167
AND THE LEDGES RUNNING
ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:36.033
THE WALL IS ALSO MADE
OF PAINTED GALVANIZED STEEL.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.234
A ROLLER IMPRESSES A CORRUGATED
PATTERN TO GIVE THE WALL

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.701
MORE VERTICAL STRENGTH.

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:43.567
THEN, A PRESS
PUNCHES OUT OPENINGS

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:47.501
FOR THE POOL'S WATER INLET
AND FILTER.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.067
AFTER FOLDING EACH END
OF THE WALL OVER ITSELF

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:51.701
TO FORM A STRONG EDGE,

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:55.267
THEY PUNCH HOLES FOR THE BOLTS
THAT WILL JOIN THE EDGES.

00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:00.167
A STAMPING DIE
PROGRESSIVELY SHAPES STRIPS

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:02.868
OF GALVANIZED STEEL
INTO CONNECTORS.

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:04.968
THE CONNECTORS
JOIN THE VERTICAL POSTS

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:09.467
TO THE STRUCTURE'S BOTTOM TRACK
AND TOP RAIL.

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:10.734
AN INJECTION MOLDER

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:15.801
MAKES THE PLASTIC COVERS
THAT WILL HIDE THOSE CONNECTORS.

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.601
WORKERS THEN BOX THE LINER

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:19.634
AND STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
FOR TRANSPORT

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:21.467
TO THE INSTALLATION SITE.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:27.901
ON-SITE, THEY LAY CRUSHED STONE
AROUND THE PERIMETER

00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.033
TO SUPPORT THE BOTTOM TRACK
UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.267
NEXT, THEY UNROLL THE POOL WALL

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:42.267
AND PLACE IT
IN THE BOTTOM TRACK.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:55.200
THEY PLACE A VERTICAL POST
OVER EACH BOTTOM CONNECTOR

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.267
AND SECURE IT WITH SCREWS.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.767
INSIDE THE POOL WALL,

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:04.868
THEY LAY DOWN A BASE OF SAND
AND COMPACT IT.

00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:09.300
THEN, THEY
LAY DOWN LANDSCAPING FABRIC.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.267
THEY CUT A HOLE
FOR A CENTRAL BOTTOM DRAIN.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.000
THEN, THEY BEGIN SPREADING
OUT THE LINER.

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.734
THEY HOOK THE BEAD
OVER THE TOP EDGE OF THE WALL,

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:29.934
THEN LOCK IT IN PLACE
WITH THE TOP RAIL.

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:31.934
ONCE THE LINER
IS FULLY ATTACHED,

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:36.400
THEY SUCTION OUT THE AIR TO DRAW
IT TIGHT AGAINST THE WALL.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.234
THEY SEAL THE LINER
TO THE BOTTOM DRAIN.

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:43.267
THEY HIDE THE TOP RAIL
UNDER THE LEDGE

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:46.000
AND THE CONNECTIONS
UNDER PLASTIC CAPS.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:52.734
THEY RUN PIPES TO CONNECT THE
FILTRATION SYSTEM AND SKIMMER.

00:04:54.801 --> 00:04:57.200
THEN, WITH AN ORDINARY
GARDEN HOSE,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.801
THEY FILL THE POOL WITH WATER.
