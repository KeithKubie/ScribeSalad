00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.019
No matter how well-paid or world famous movie
stars and award winning directors may be,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.910
they're still human - which means they make
as many mistakes as anyone.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.660
Usually those mistakes are left on the cutting
room floor, or offered to fans on blooper

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.220
reels for a look behind the scenes, and a
laugh.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.080
But sometimes those same outtakes can wind
up in the spotlight instead - the result of

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.009
an editor and director who either never noticed,
or decided it was just too good to take out.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.110
But we'll let you be the judge.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.320
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Outtakes That
Made It To The Big Screen.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.570
Star Wars

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.539
Just about every movie fan has seen the Star
Wars Saga at least once, but there's a good

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.120
chance even die hard fans have overlooked
one of the biggest mistakes in the franchises

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
first movie.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.120
When Luke Skywalker succeeds in destroying
the Death Star, he gets a hero's welcome back

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.429
at the Rebel base.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.300
Princess Leia is so relieved, she screams
out Luke's name, but it isn't "Leia" that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.819
actor Mark Hamill calls out in response.

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:06.080
The actors have tried to cover up the gaff,
but it's hard to miss Hamill calling his co-star

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.580
Carrie Fisher by her first name.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.299
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.260
With a cast as talented as Marvel's gang of
space outlaws, some improv is to be expected.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.190
But actual accidents, like star Chris Pratt
dropping an all-powerful orb of universal

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.910
destruction are a different story.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.500
Director James Gunn has confirmed that Chris
Pratt really did drop the orb by accident,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.610
but stayed in character and finished the shot,
meaning it could be still be used in the finished

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.750
cut.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.000
Proving once and for all that it's nearly
impossible to find where the actor's clumsy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
personality ends, and Peter Quill begins.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.110
Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate
Events

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.860
The movie version of this novel series lived
up to its name, but even in this series of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.450
unfortunate events, one happy accident made
it through editing, thanks to Jim Carrey's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.740
famously quick thinking.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.080
When the movie's child stars meet their villainous
uncle, he proves his career as an actor isn't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.409
limited to the stage, asking them for a second
take.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.771
But the line wasn't in the script - Carrey
actually wanted to try his line again, but

00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.450
stayed in character when asking his costars.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.470
Since the strange moment fit the movie's tone,
the director decided to leave it in.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.360
North by Northwest

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.450
Considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's
best, and most parodied movies, there's one

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.640
part of North by Northwest that all involved
would rather forget.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.281
When the Star Cary Grant winds up taking a
trip in the back of a police car, the actors

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.360
rely on old fashioned tricks to make the ride
seem more realistic to the audience.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.730
When the driver takes a hard left, Grant slides
to the right like he's supposed to – while

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.480
the other policeman misses the cue completely,
meaning Grant needs to give him a push, and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.030
leaving audiences to wonder how the obviously
blown take was the version Hitchcock left

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.890
in the final cut.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.410
Cabin in the Woods

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.180
One of the biggest laughs of this horror comedy
comes when one torture technician gets to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.170
see a kill from his favourite mobster up close.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.170
Too close.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.620
The scene was intended to be truly grotesque,
as the Merman prop was rigged to pump out

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.840
thick streams of blood as it consumed its
victim.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.420
With the effect working perfectly, the crew
decided they might as well let the blood tank

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.740
empty out before stopping the camera.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.520
But it was only when the tank started to run
dry that the flowing blood turned into erratic

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.060
spraying, and every crew member began uncontrollably
laughing.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.290
The tone changed immediately, and the director
decided the joke was too good to leave out,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.120
swapping gore for a gag, and proving that
behind-the-scenes luck can still result in

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.130
movie magic.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.130
Serenity

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.150
The heroes of Joss Whedon's Firefly were up
against an entire planetary alliance in this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.910
big screen finale to the TV show, taking a
suicide mission into enemy territory to get

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.989
a life or death message to the public.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.610
But when the truth came out, even the crew's
main enemy decides they shouldn't be punished.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.209
Unfortunately, the director had planned to
skip over the enemy soldiers standing down

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.020
entirely - which meant he never filmed the
scene.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.709
Getting creative, Whedon used footage of the
end of the shot, when he shouted "cut!" and

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.770
the actors simply lowered their weapons.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.709
It did the trick, but they weren't alone:
look closely, and you'll see the crew member

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.300
lowering their camera straight through the
frame.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.540
The Wizard of Oz

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.440
The villain of this classic movie met her
end by melting in water, but the actress got

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.790
it much, much worse.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.190
When the Wicked Witch of the West makes her
first exit from Munchkinland, she does so

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.419
in a puff of red smoke, and a burst of fire.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.160
It's a memorable effect, but a pretty flawed
one: not only can the trapdoor letting out

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.400
smoke clearly be seen opening from the floor's
set, but it begins to pour out before the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.190
Witch even hits her mark.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.850
So why was it left in the movie?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.570
In a later take, actress Margaret Hamilton
was severely burned when the fire erupted

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.810
early, taking her out of action for almost
two months.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.440
When the actress returned, she refused any
more fire stunts, so the studio was forced

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.920
to use a rehearsal take in the final cut,
obvious errors, mistimed smoke and all.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.660
Days of Thunder

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.710
Even actors can get starstruck when working
alongside mega stars like Tom Cruise, and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.250
his game was proving a problem even early
in his career.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.690
Playing the part of NASCAR driver Cole Trickle
in Days of Thunder, a head injury led to a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.520
love affair with his characters doctor.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.550
When the couple spent the weekend with Cole's
former rival Rowdy Burns, introductions are

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.220
made with Rowdy's wife Jenny.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.610
But she doesn't need to be told who her husband's
famous friend is ("Hi Tom" "Hey Jenny").

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.160
Somehow, her flub - and Cruise ignoring her
mistake - wound up in the finished movie.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.510
Spy Kids

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.340
It's still hard to believe that director Robert
Rodriguez is responsible for mature action

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.570
movies like Desperado AND the family friendly
movie series Spy Kids.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.290
But it turns out that filming fewer action-packed
scenes isn't necessarily that much easier.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.860
When Rodriguez was capturing an early shot
of actress Carla Gugino in front of a set

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.950
of mirrors, he made an unexpected cameo alongside
her reflection.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.670
What should have led to a blown take and a
good laugh was left intact, with Rodriguez

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.320
apparently deciding his blunder was too funny
to edit out.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
Terminator 2

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.080
Arnold Schwarzenegger may be more acclaimed
for his action skills than his comedy chops

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.990
these days, but in the role of The Terminator,
the actor could do no wrong.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.210
He even tried a little improv.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.900
When his battle with the more powerful T-1000
in the movie’s sequel left him severely

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.000
damaged and losing limbs, he still managed
to come to John Connor’s rescue.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.229
In the script, the Terminator had no line
to speak after saving John, with James Cameron

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.300
simply saying that he emerges “looking like
he needs a vacation.”

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.699
After filming the scene several times, Arnold
decided to give the director a laugh, turning

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.160
his description into an actual line.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.510
It got a laugh, but Cameron decided it actually
fit the character perfectly, and made sure

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.130
that was the take he went with.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.650
