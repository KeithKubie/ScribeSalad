DANIEL BARRETO: Haystack
TV started in 2013

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.500
as a startup coming out of
Stanford StartX Accelerator.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.390
We were frustrated with
how news was getting out,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.080
because every time
we turn on the TV,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.610
we had to watch the same
news as everybody else.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.740
Our elevator pitch
here at Haystack TV

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.520
is that we enable
people to watch

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.310
the news that they care about.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.570
One of the decisions we had
to make at the beginning

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.400
was what platform to start with.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.010
As a small startup,
we needed a platform

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.659
that would allow us
to iterate quickly.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.927
We got that with Android.

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:35.510
ISH HARSHAWAT: The
team at Haystack TV

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.926
really loves working
with Android.

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:40.140
The documentation is really
clear and easy to use.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.642
It can be a lot of fun
to program for Android.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.350
DANIEL BARRETO: Our
users wanted to watch

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.940
the news in their living
rooms, in their TVs.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.490
And there wasn't a platform
out there for them to do that.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.780
ISH HARSHAWAT: A lot of
the smart TVs to date

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630
have been pretty
proprietary closed

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.560
systems that have been hard for
developers like us to access.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.140
With Android TV, we were
able to finally open

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.220
the door into the living room.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.790
Even though a developer can
easily take their mobile app

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.090
and throw it on Android TV,
what works really well we found,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.700
was to actually design an
Android TV first experience.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.240
Developing for Android
TV was super fast.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.780
We literally did it two weeks.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.530
DANIEL BARRETO: We've
seen amazing results

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.960
after integrating with
Android TV and Chromecast.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.390
Originally, our
mobile users were

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.740
spending an average
of 40 minutes

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.860
per week watching the news.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.580
Now we've actually doubled that.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.020
Our growth trajectory is
really strong right now.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.230
We've managed to grow
at 40% month over month

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.100
since we started.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.490
And a big part of that is
the integration with the TVs.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.445
It's a new beta testing
feature that Android released.

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:49.250
It allowed us to reach our
early beta and alpha testers.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.990
And it also allowed us to
integrate with Google+,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.110
so that we can reach different
communities of early adopters.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800
That was extremely
powerful for us.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.440
A small startup like ours is
now able to make a big impact

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.960
with just six people, reaching
out to millions of users.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.910
And a lot of it is thanks
to the tools and platform

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.360
that we have with Google.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.278
