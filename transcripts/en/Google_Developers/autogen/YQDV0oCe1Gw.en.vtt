think the four words were um I love it
he's<00:04:22.070><c> it</c><00:04:22.220><c> forwards</c><00:04:22.670><c> where</c><00:04:22.940><c> there</c><00:04:23.510><c> is</c><00:04:23.720><c> no</c><00:04:24.350><c> cloud</c>

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 align:start position:0%
he's it forwards where there is no cloud
 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.300 align:start position:0%
he's it forwards where there is no cloud
wait<00:04:25.780><c> okay</c><00:04:26.780><c> okay</c><00:04:27.230><c> listen</c><00:04:27.380><c> this</c><00:04:27.920><c> is</c><00:04:28.040><c> ten</c><00:04:28.160><c> years</c>

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 align:start position:0%

ago<00:04:28.510><c> yeah</c><00:04:29.510><c> bat</c><00:04:29.960><c> ok</c><00:04:30.230><c> about</c><00:04:30.320><c> that</c><00:04:30.440><c> so</c><00:04:31.510><c> where</c><00:04:32.510><c> is</c>

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
ago yeah bat ok about that so where is
 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.150 align:start position:0%
ago yeah bat ok about that so where is
he<00:04:32.630><c> coming</c><00:04:32.870><c> from</c><00:04:32.960><c> with</c><00:04:33.080><c> that</c><00:04:33.110><c> so</c><00:04:33.560><c> where</c><00:04:34.010><c> he</c><00:04:34.130><c> was</c>

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
he coming from with that so where he was
 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.380 align:start position:0%
he coming from with that so where he was
coming<00:04:34.310><c> from</c><00:04:34.520><c> when</c><00:04:34.700><c> he</c><00:04:34.730><c> was</c><00:04:34.850><c> exactly</c><00:04:35.180><c> right</c>

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 align:start position:0%
coming from when he was exactly right
 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.330 align:start position:0%
coming from when he was exactly right
was<00:04:35.870><c> because</c><00:04:36.230><c> if</c><00:04:36.410><c> you</c><00:04:36.500><c> think</c><00:04:36.530><c> about</c><00:04:36.830><c> the</c>

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 align:start position:0%
was because if you think about the
 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
was because if you think about the
complexity<00:04:38.210><c> of</c><00:04:38.240><c> running</c><00:04:38.780><c> an</c><00:04:38.870><c> application</c>

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
complexity of running an application
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.230 align:start position:0%
complexity of running an application
like<00:04:39.470><c> this</c><00:04:39.830><c> ok</c><00:04:40.250><c> security</c><00:04:41.240><c> and</c><00:04:42.100><c> manageability</c>

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
like this ok security and manageability
 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
like this ok security and manageability
like<00:04:44.240><c> I</c><00:04:44.360><c> same</c><00:04:44.540><c> virus</c><00:04:44.750><c> scanning</c><00:04:45.200><c> even</c><00:04:45.500><c> like</c><00:04:45.620><c> the</c>

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 align:start position:0%
like I same virus scanning even like the
 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.650 align:start position:0%
like I same virus scanning even like the
number<00:04:46.250><c> of</c><00:04:46.340><c> servers</c><00:04:46.730><c> that</c><00:04:47.030><c> you</c><00:04:47.150><c> need</c><00:04:47.270><c> to</c><00:04:47.390><c> run</c>

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 align:start position:0%
number of servers that you need to run
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.090 align:start position:0%
number of servers that you need to run
this<00:04:47.690><c> thing</c><00:04:48.110><c> we</c><00:04:48.620><c> had</c><00:04:48.710><c> actually</c><00:04:48.860><c> do</c><00:04:49.070><c> a</c>

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 align:start position:0%
this thing we had actually do a
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.470 align:start position:0%
this thing we had actually do a
calculation<00:04:49.370><c> that</c><00:04:49.820><c> would</c><00:04:50.030><c> look</c><00:04:50.240><c> at</c><00:04:50.390><c> our</c>

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
calculation that would look at our
 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.210 align:start position:0%
calculation that would look at our
traffic<00:04:50.750><c> and</c><00:04:51.200><c> then</c><00:04:51.680><c> would</c><00:04:51.800><c> say</c><00:04:51.919><c> this</c><00:04:52.070><c> was</c>

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 align:start position:0%
traffic and then would say this was
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.530 align:start position:0%
traffic and then would say this was
going<00:04:52.310><c> to</c><00:04:52.370><c> be</c><00:04:52.430><c> a</c><00:04:52.520><c> java</c><00:04:52.760><c> application</c><00:04:52.880><c> running</c>

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 align:start position:0%
going to be a java application running
 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.900 align:start position:0%
going to be a java application running
on<00:04:53.690><c> a</c><00:04:53.750><c> weblogic</c><00:04:54.110><c> app</c><00:04:54.620><c> server</c><00:04:54.919><c> i</c><00:04:55.190><c> would</c><00:04:55.550><c> say</c><00:04:55.669><c> ok</c>

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 align:start position:0%
on a weblogic app server i would say ok
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
on a weblogic app server i would say ok
we<00:04:56.090><c> looked</c><00:04:56.570><c> at</c><00:04:56.720><c> our</c><00:04:56.810><c> the</c><00:04:57.169><c> traffic</c><00:04:57.620><c> that</c><00:04:57.740><c> would</c>

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 align:start position:0%
we looked at our the traffic that would
 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.290 align:start position:0%
we looked at our the traffic that would
have<00:04:58.040><c> and</c><00:04:58.250><c> looked</c><00:04:58.430><c> at</c><00:04:58.550><c> the</c><00:04:58.640><c> number</c><00:04:58.850><c> of</c><00:04:58.940><c> users</c>

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 align:start position:0%
have and looked at the number of users
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.630 align:start position:0%
have and looked at the number of users
would<00:04:59.780><c> figure</c><00:05:00.020><c> out</c><00:05:00.140><c> how</c><00:05:00.470><c> many</c><00:05:00.710><c> you</c><00:05:01.340><c> know</c><00:05:01.460><c> like</c>

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
would figure out how many you know like
 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.460 align:start position:0%
would figure out how many you know like
based<00:05:01.820><c> on</c><00:05:01.970><c> the</c><00:05:02.060><c> cpu</c><00:05:02.510><c> based</c><00:05:02.870><c> on</c><00:05:03.050><c> the</c><00:05:03.140><c> networking</c>

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 align:start position:0%
based on the cpu based on the networking
 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.050 align:start position:0%
based on the cpu based on the networking
activity<00:05:04.010><c> so</c><00:05:04.130><c> he's</c><00:05:04.310><c> thinking</c><00:05:04.460><c> just</c><00:05:04.850><c> like</c>

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 align:start position:0%
activity so he's thinking just like
 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730 align:start position:0%
activity so he's thinking just like
straight<00:05:05.480><c> logistics</c><00:05:06.080><c> like</c><00:05:06.290><c> how</c><00:05:06.410><c> do</c><00:05:06.470><c> you</c><00:05:06.560><c> get</c>

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 align:start position:0%
straight logistics like how do you get
 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.140 align:start position:0%
straight logistics like how do you get
the<00:05:06.830><c> hardware</c><00:05:07.160><c> you</c><00:05:07.220><c> need</c><00:05:07.250><c> to</c><00:05:07.460><c> do</c><00:05:07.580><c> that</c><00:05:07.790><c> like</c>

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
the hardware you need to do that like
 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.460 align:start position:0%
the hardware you need to do that like
what<00:05:08.360><c> networking</c><00:05:08.690><c> infrastructure</c><00:05:08.930><c> do</c><00:05:09.380><c> you</c>

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 align:start position:0%
what networking infrastructure do you
 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.620 align:start position:0%
what networking infrastructure do you
need<00:05:09.680><c> like</c><00:05:10.100><c> out</c><00:05:10.610><c> of</c><00:05:10.700><c> the</c><00:05:10.760><c> switches</c><00:05:11.000><c> workload</c>

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 align:start position:0%
need like out of the switches workload
 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.300 align:start position:0%
need like out of the switches workload
balancing<00:05:11.840><c> how</c><00:05:12.440><c> much</c><00:05:12.590><c> storage</c><00:05:12.770><c> do</c><00:05:13.040><c> we</c><00:05:13.130><c> need</c>

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 align:start position:0%
balancing how much storage do we need
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.860 align:start position:0%
balancing how much storage do we need
yeah<00:05:13.730><c> you</c><00:05:13.880><c> can't</c><00:05:14.090><c> just</c><00:05:14.210><c> hand</c><00:05:14.360><c> wave</c><00:05:14.510><c> that</c><00:05:14.690><c> away</c>

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't just hand wave that away
 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.690 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't just hand wave that away
and<00:05:14.900><c> like</c><00:05:15.470><c> I</c><00:05:15.620><c> draw</c><00:05:15.830><c> I</c><00:05:16.010><c> did</c><00:05:16.160><c> behind</c><00:05:16.370><c> a</c><00:05:16.430><c> fluffy</c>

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 align:start position:0%
and like I draw I did behind a fluffy
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.340 align:start position:0%
and like I draw I did behind a fluffy
cloud<00:05:16.910><c> gosh</c><00:05:17.300><c> ok</c><00:05:17.900><c> well</c><00:05:18.020><c> how</c><00:05:18.080><c> does</c><00:05:18.169><c> that</c><00:05:18.290><c> change</c>

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 align:start position:0%
cloud gosh ok well how does that change
 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.210 align:start position:0%
cloud gosh ok well how does that change
now<00:05:18.800><c> like</c><00:05:19.090><c> listen</c><00:05:20.090><c> so</c><00:05:20.960><c> that's</c><00:05:21.590><c> not</c><00:05:21.770><c> really</c>

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 align:start position:0%
now like listen so that's not really
 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.469 align:start position:0%
now like listen so that's not really
what<00:05:22.340><c> we</c><00:05:22.400><c> think</c><00:05:22.610><c> of</c><00:05:22.700><c> as</c><00:05:22.790><c> cloud</c><00:05:23.030><c> now</c><00:05:23.210><c> but</c><00:05:23.390><c> it</c>

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
cloud and it essentially is that entire
 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.589 align:start position:0%
cloud and it essentially is that entire
system<00:07:59.629><c> that</c><00:08:00.139><c> we</c><00:08:00.259><c> built</c><00:08:00.499><c> like</c><00:08:01.099><c> just</c><00:08:01.879><c> ravey</c><00:08:02.479><c> you</c>

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
system that we built like just ravey you
 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:06.610 align:start position:0%
system that we built like just ravey you
as<00:08:02.779><c> a</c><00:08:02.839><c> service</c><00:08:03.289><c> as</c><00:08:03.439><c> a</c><00:08:03.469><c> service</c><00:08:03.800><c> right</c><00:08:04.069><c> so</c><00:08:05.229><c> so</c><00:08:06.229><c> if</c>

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620 align:start position:0%
as a service as a service right so so if
 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.389 align:start position:0%
as a service as a service right so so if
I<00:08:06.830><c> was</c><00:08:07.099><c> in</c><00:08:07.279><c> that</c><00:08:07.309><c> yeah</c><00:08:08.270><c> i</c><00:08:08.479><c> think</c><00:08:08.830><c> the</c><00:08:09.830><c> entire</c>

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
I was in that yeah i think the entire
 

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.339 align:start position:0%
I was in that yeah i think the entire
product<00:08:10.789><c> doesn't</c><00:08:10.999><c> even</c><00:08:11.689><c> need</c><00:08:11.959><c> to</c><00:08:12.020><c> be</c><00:08:12.110><c> built</c>

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:12.349 align:start position:0%
product doesn't even need to be built
 

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:15.489 align:start position:0%
product doesn't even need to be built
like<00:08:12.740><c> in</c><00:08:13.399><c> that</c><00:08:13.639><c> way</c><00:08:13.759><c> so</c><00:08:13.819><c> i</c><00:08:14.240><c> would</c><00:08:15.080><c> save</c><00:08:15.259><c> a</c><00:08:15.289><c> huge</c>

00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:15.499 align:start position:0%
like in that way so i would save a huge
 

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.499 align:start position:0%
like in that way so i would save a huge
amount<00:08:15.559><c> of</c><00:08:15.740><c> time</c><00:08:15.860><c> so</c><00:08:16.459><c> you</c><00:08:16.849><c> could</c><00:08:17.029><c> have</c><00:08:17.180><c> really</c>

00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:17.509 align:start position:0%
amount of time so you could have really
 

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:18.939 align:start position:0%
amount of time so you could have really
focused<00:08:17.749><c> on</c><00:08:18.139><c> building</c><00:08:18.439><c> out</c><00:08:18.680><c> the</c><00:08:18.770><c> user</c>

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:18.949 align:start position:0%
focused on building out the user
 

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
focused on building out the user
experience<00:08:19.550><c> exactly</c><00:08:19.819><c> instead</c><00:08:20.599><c> of</c><00:08:20.629><c> the</c>

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:22.580 align:start position:0%
plumbing in the infrastructure yep and
 

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.860 align:start position:0%
plumbing in the infrastructure yep and
you<00:08:22.909><c> know</c><00:08:22.999><c> what</c><00:08:23.149><c> we</c><00:08:23.209><c> wanted</c><00:08:23.389><c> to</c><00:08:23.449><c> build</c><00:08:23.569><c> on</c><00:08:23.749><c> top</c>

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:23.870 align:start position:0%
you know what we wanted to build on top
 

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.529 align:start position:0%
you know what we wanted to build on top
of<00:08:24.050><c> that</c><00:08:24.139><c> good</c><00:08:24.649><c> it</c><00:08:25.009><c> was</c><00:08:25.159><c> all</c><00:08:25.279><c> just</c><00:08:25.539><c> necessary</c>

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:26.539 align:start position:0%
of that good it was all just necessary
 

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.059 align:start position:0%
of that good it was all just necessary
foundation<00:08:26.719><c> to</c><00:08:27.259><c> get</c><00:08:27.409><c> to</c><00:08:27.529><c> what</c><00:08:27.680><c> we</c><00:08:27.800><c> were</c><00:08:27.889><c> trying</c>

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:28.069 align:start position:0%

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:28.930 align:start position:0%
foundation to get to what we were trying
to<00:08:28.189><c> do</c><00:08:28.370><c> you</c>

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:28.940 align:start position:0%
to do you
 

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
to do you
and<00:08:29.090><c> so</c><00:08:29.870><c> with</c><00:08:30.260><c> ya</c><00:08:30.410><c> there</c><00:08:30.860><c> are</c><00:08:30.920><c> only</c><00:08:30.980><c> so</c><00:08:31.220><c> many</c>

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.250 align:start position:0%
and so with ya there are only so many
 

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.190 align:start position:0%
and so with ya there are only so many
hours<00:08:31.430><c> in</c><00:08:31.640><c> the</c><00:08:31.760><c> day</c><00:08:31.820><c> and</c><00:08:32.150><c> so</c><00:08:32.990><c> if</c><00:08:33.080><c> you're</c>

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
hours in the day and so if you're
 

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
hours in the day and so if you're
spending<00:08:33.650><c> all</c><00:08:33.770><c> that</c><00:08:33.800><c> time</c><00:08:33.979><c> and</c><00:08:34.250><c> all</c><00:08:34.520><c> those</c>

i<00:09:14.690><c> think</c><00:09:14.810><c> we've</c><00:09:15.590><c> gotten</c><00:09:15.830><c> to</c><00:09:15.980><c> the</c><00:09:16.040><c> point</c><00:09:16.250><c> where</c>

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think we've gotten to the point where
 

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.410 align:start position:0%
i think we've gotten to the point where
you<00:09:17.480><c> can</c><00:09:17.780><c> create</c><00:09:18.380><c> a</c><00:09:18.710><c> a</c><00:09:19.010><c> model</c><00:09:19.880><c> of</c><00:09:20.060><c> the</c><00:09:20.120><c> hardware</c>

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:20.420 align:start position:0%
you can create a a model of the hardware
 

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.850 align:start position:0%
you can create a a model of the hardware
we<00:09:20.660><c> used</c><00:09:20.810><c> to</c><00:09:20.870><c> have</c><00:09:21.020><c> to</c><00:09:21.320><c> run</c><00:09:21.470><c> all</c><00:09:21.500><c> these</c><00:09:21.650><c> things</c>

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:21.860 align:start position:0%
we used to have to run all these things
 

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
we used to have to run all these things
so<00:09:21.980><c> you've</c><00:09:22.100><c> got</c><00:09:22.130><c> your</c><00:09:22.250><c> servers</c><00:09:22.610><c> and</c><00:09:22.640><c> you</c><00:09:22.790><c> got</c>

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
so you've got your servers and you got
 

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
so you've got your servers and you got
your<00:09:22.940><c> networks</c><00:09:23.240><c> and</c><00:09:23.330><c> switches</c><00:09:23.750><c> and</c><00:09:23.960><c> and</c>

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
data center in do by hand there's an API
for<00:09:27.620><c> and</c><00:09:28.010><c> that</c><00:09:28.310><c> is</c><00:09:28.720><c> super</c><00:09:29.720><c> useful</c><00:09:29.960><c> incredibly</c>

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:30.530 align:start position:0%
for and that is super useful incredibly
 

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
for and that is super useful incredibly

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700 align:start position:0%
before and you know speaks is like but I
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.890 align:start position:0%
before and you know speaks is like but I
don't<00:09:37.910><c> think</c><00:09:38.000><c> we're</c><00:09:38.180><c> done</c><00:09:38.330><c> there</c><00:09:38.510><c> right</c><00:09:38.720><c> like</c>

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:38.900 align:start position:0%
don't think we're done there right like
 

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.020 align:start position:0%
don't think we're done there right like
this<00:09:39.110><c> is</c><00:09:39.260><c> the</c><00:09:39.440><c> this</c><00:09:39.980><c> is</c><00:09:40.040><c> the</c><00:09:40.190><c> next</c><00:09:40.400><c> step</c><00:09:40.550><c> of</c>

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the next step of
 

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.150 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the next step of
figuring<00:09:41.570><c> out</c><00:09:41.720><c> okay</c><00:09:42.380><c> now</c><00:09:42.530><c> that</c><00:09:42.830><c> these</c><00:09:43.010><c> are</c>

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
figuring out okay now that these are
 

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.770 align:start position:0%
figuring out okay now that these are
these<00:09:43.700><c> things</c><00:09:43.730><c> that</c><00:09:43.940><c> used</c><00:09:44.150><c> to</c><00:09:44.180><c> be</c><00:09:44.300><c> physical</c><00:09:44.690><c> or</c>

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:44.780 align:start position:0%
these things that used to be physical or
 

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
these things that used to be physical or
abstract<00:09:45.170><c> concepts</c><00:09:45.710><c> yeah</c><00:09:46.010><c> are</c><00:09:46.220><c> they</c><00:09:46.700><c> the</c>

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:46.850 align:start position:0%
abstract concepts yeah are they the
 

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.580 align:start position:0%
abstract concepts yeah are they the
right<00:09:47.000><c> abstractions</c><00:09:47.600><c> we</c><00:09:47.780><c> want</c><00:09:48.050><c> for</c><00:09:48.350><c> billing</c>

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.590 align:start position:0%

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:50.900 align:start position:0%
software in the future mmm and I think
 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.260 align:start position:0%
software in the future mmm and I think
you<00:09:51.830><c> know</c><00:09:51.860><c> I</c><00:09:51.950><c> think</c><00:09:51.980><c> we</c><00:09:52.550><c> can</c><00:09:52.670><c> do</c><00:09:52.790><c> better</c><00:09:52.910><c> right</c>

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:53.270 align:start position:0%
you know I think we can do better right
 

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.060 align:start position:0%
you know I think we can do better right
oh<00:09:53.450><c> absolutely</c><00:09:53.840><c> and</c><00:09:54.350><c> you</c><00:09:54.680><c> know</c><00:09:54.770><c> so</c><00:09:54.920><c> there's</c>

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.070 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely and you know so there's
 

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely and you know so there's
things<00:09:55.760><c> that</c><00:09:55.880><c> are</c><00:09:56.000><c> really</c><00:09:56.120><c> exciting</c><00:09:56.540><c> right</c>

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:56.690 align:start position:0%
things that are really exciting right
 

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.850 align:start position:0%
things that are really exciting right
now<00:09:56.810><c> you</c><00:09:56.870><c> know</c><00:09:57.080><c> so</c><00:09:57.170><c> App</c><00:09:57.290><c> Engine</c><00:09:57.590><c> is</c><00:09:57.650><c> really</c>

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:57.860 align:start position:0%
now you know so App Engine is really
 

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.010 align:start position:0%
now you know so App Engine is really
interesting<00:09:58.220><c> in</c><00:09:58.310><c> that</c><00:09:58.340><c> space</c><00:09:58.670><c> I</c><00:09:58.970><c> think</c><00:09:59.810><c> docker</c>

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.020 align:start position:0%
interesting in that space I think docker
 

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.140 align:start position:0%
interesting in that space I think docker
is<00:10:00.260><c> super</c><00:10:00.560><c> exciting</c><00:10:00.800><c> as</c><00:10:01.760><c> a</c><00:10:01.790><c> bunch</c><00:10:01.940><c> of</c><00:10:02.030><c> stuff</c>

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
is super exciting as a bunch of stuff
 

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
is super exciting as a bunch of stuff
going<00:10:02.270><c> on</c><00:10:02.420><c> there</c><00:10:02.600><c> so</c><00:10:02.780><c> cloud</c><00:10:03.650><c> is</c><00:10:03.830><c> a</c><00:10:03.980><c> whole</c><00:10:04.100><c> super</c>

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370 align:start position:0%
going on there so cloud is a whole super
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.940 align:start position:0%
going on there so cloud is a whole super

this algorithm that i've been working on
 

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.710 align:start position:0%
this algorithm that i've been working on
for<00:13:16.279><c> years</c><00:13:16.610><c> where</c><00:13:17.209><c> it's</c><00:13:17.360><c> like</c><00:13:17.509><c> i</c><00:13:17.660><c> do</c>

predictive analysis of the stock market
okay<00:13:19.910><c> so</c><00:13:20.120><c> take</c><00:13:20.329><c> a</c><00:13:20.360><c> look</c><00:13:20.629><c> at</c><00:13:20.810><c> like</c><00:13:21.019><c> the</c><00:13:21.139><c> history</c>

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.290 align:start position:0%
okay so take a look at like the history
 

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.990 align:start position:0%
okay so take a look at like the history

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
of a stock price and then take a guess
 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
of a stock price and then take a guess
from<00:13:23.240><c> there</c><00:13:23.480><c> what</c><00:13:23.720><c> it's</c><00:13:23.839><c> going</c><00:13:23.990><c> to</c><00:13:24.079><c> be</c><00:13:24.170><c> at</c><00:13:24.379><c> and</c>

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
from there what it's going to be at and
 

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.230 align:start position:0%
from there what it's going to be at and
I<00:13:25.160><c> thought</c><00:13:25.310><c> okay</c><00:13:25.639><c> here's</c><00:13:25.850><c> a</c><00:13:25.910><c> great</c><00:13:26.209><c> example</c>

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
I thought okay here's a great example
 

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
I thought okay here's a great example
for<00:13:26.959><c> me</c><00:13:27.470><c> too</c><00:13:27.620><c> and</c><00:13:27.889><c> I</c><00:13:27.980><c> had</c><00:13:28.189><c> originally</c><00:13:28.399><c> written</c>

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:30.709 align:start position:0%
