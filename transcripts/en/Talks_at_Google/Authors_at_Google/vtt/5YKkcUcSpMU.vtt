RAY KURTZWEIL:
Thanks for coming.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.220
I got a good turnout,
standing room only.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.540
I've known Jose for many
years and most notably

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.160
starting from the beginning,
which is about seven years ago,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.996
we started organizing
Singularity University.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.480
That was started
seven years ago.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.060
Larry Page and Megan Smith
worked with Peter Diamandis,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.935
and myself, and Jose to
start this university.

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:32.060
It's about a mile from here.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.770
And it teaches
many of the things

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010
that Jose will be
talking about today.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.020
He has been on the
faculty and has helped

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.300
develop the concept
and the organization,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.410
heads up our relationship
with Latin America.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.440
And for that matter, I think
your sister-in-law heads up

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.940
Google Latin America, at
least the Spanish part of it.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.598
Can you hear me?

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:02.080
Yup.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.010
Jose has a Master of Science
in mechanical engineering

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.555
from MIT, Ph.D. from the
Universidad Simon Bolivar.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.290
He's been a strategy consultant
with Booz-Allen, an adviser

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.695
to many leading corporations
in Latin America.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.542
He's been an invited professor
at MIT and other leading

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:23.083
universities.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.730
He's written more
than 10 books, which

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.270
I think is more
than I've written.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.110
He has an opinion column
that appears regularly

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.320
in BBCC, CCN, "New York Times,"
and other media outlets.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.452
He has filmed documentaries
with the Discovery

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:40.785
Channel and the History Channel.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.840
Jose is going to share his
ideas on our exponential future.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.770
His talk is titled "The
Future of Technology

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.280
and the Technology
of the Future."

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.726
So welcome to Jose.

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:55.722
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.950
JOSE CORDEIRO: Good
afternoon and it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.700
is a pleasure for me to be
here to talk about the future.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.290
I love the future
because we're going

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.169
to live the rest of our
lives in the future.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.780
So I am in many
different organizations

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.035
around the planet,
traveling constantly.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.930
One of the things
that I do the most

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.763
is working with The
Millennium Project, that

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:23.870
began as the futuristic part of
the United Nations University.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.270
But now it's an independent NGO.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.080
And every year, we
compile information

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.730
about the global grand
challenges of the planet.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.910
And we publish it
in a yearly book,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.500
which this is the latest
edition, "2013-- 2014, State

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.280
of the Future."

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.560
This is a copy for
you here in Google.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.970
I hope you enjoy it.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.580
This has an incredible wealth
of information about the future.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.196
And also we just
published a book

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:49.820
about the future of
Latin America, that

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.920
has been recommended by four
presidents in Latin America,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.520
from the president of
Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.300
to the former president of
Brazil, Fernando Henrique

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.990
Cardoso, and other people.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.870
And we talk about four different
scenarios for Latin America.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.725
One of those scenarios is the
singularity in Latin America.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:09.100
So if you are
interested in that,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.670
I also have a copy for
you here in Google,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.710
in electronic format,
if you still use CDs,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.070
so that you can read the
book and the four scenarios.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.690
Number one, "Manana es hoy."

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.630
It's about the singularity
in Latin America.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.350
I presented this at the
World Economic Forum, Davos,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.770
for Latin America.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.880
And then I was on a TV program
in CNN with Donald Trump.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.370
So I'm very honored
to be talking

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.670
about the future of Latin
America and the singularity

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.000
in Latin America in the
next 20 to 30 years.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.940
But the reason why
I'm also here is

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.100
to talk a little more about
exponential technologies.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.860
And I have been involved
with Singularity University

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.540
since the first class.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.505
And I just want to give you a
quick overview of the fantastic

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:57.880
things we believe
are going to be

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.560
happening in the next few years.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.180
Many of you probably already
saw, a couple of years

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.870
ago, when Ray Kurtzweil is
featured in "TIME" magazine.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.060
The whole article is about Ray.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.650
And about the year
2045 and above

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.290
the technological singularity.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.000
And if you look, the
beautiful subtitle

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.329
is "The Year Man
Becomes Immortal."

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.410
But for the ladies, you
will be immortal too.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.600
OK, don't worry.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Both men and women
will become immortal.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.270
But actually, Singularity
University is not a university.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.770
And it is not about
the singularity.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.220
So the name is
kind of interesting

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.360
because it really is about
a exponential technologies

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.130
to improve the
conditions of the world.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.480
I am myself from the
developing world.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.500
I grew up in Latin America.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.440
So I have experienced
what poverty is

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.840
and how things can
change quickly.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.280
So we are very happy
that among the founders

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.830
effectively is Larry Page.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.430
But anyway, we have
many other companies

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.430
supporting Singularity
University.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.600
The summer program basically
is structured in three parts.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.460
The first part,
the participants--

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.950
we don't call them
the students--

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.900
the participants learn
about the technologies.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.540
In the second part, we have
convergence and site visits.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.880
And then the participants
begin working on film projects,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.560
about how to use these
new technologies,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.620
exponential technologies, to
improve the human condition.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.830
How to improve health, energy,
security, water, environment,

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.450
all the problems of humanity
in the next few years.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.330
In fact, the goal is that the
students, or participants,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.150
have to finish with a project
to impact the world positively

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.730
in 10 years, at least
for 1 billion people.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.750
So it is a big challenge, 1
billion people in 10 years.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.770
Some of the start-ups
that have originated out

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.110
of Singularity University
are incredible companies

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.410
like-- actually, I just
want to name Made in Space,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.840
because tomorrow history will be
written, and not just on Earth,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840
in space.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.980
Made in Space is taking
3D printers tomorrow

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.240
to the International
Space Station.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.950
This is the first
time humans will

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.050
print something outside
of our tiny planet.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.520
This is the beginning
of colonization

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.880
of the world, the
universe, and beyond.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.530
And it is done by Singularity
University students.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.897
So we are really, really proud.

00:06:26.897 --> 00:06:28.730
But we have many other
incredible companies,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.250
Matternet.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.420
Matternet right now
is working in Bhutan.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.870
In Bhutan, using drones to
transport food and medicines

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.390
in a country that has almost
no roads or no infrastructure.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.130
Or other companies,
like Modern Meadow,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.060
that is working on
a cultured meat.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.970
Some people like to
call it in vitro meat.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.780
But we prefer cultured meat.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.372
So what is a singularity?

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:55.580
Because I haven't told you
yet what is a singularity?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.510
Well, the father
of the singularity

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.410
is right here, Ray Kurzweil.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.120
And his famous book, "The
Singularity is Near,"

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.060
is recommended by Bill Gates
as the best book in the world.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.060
Actually, I don't think
that that is right,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.560
because the best book
in the world is--

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.080
"The State of the
Future," that we

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.740
published with The
Millennium Project.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.254
But Bill Gates
hasn't read this yet.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.320
Nonetheless, why
is "The Singularity

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.010
is Near" so important?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.620
Because Ray wrote,
about 10 years ago,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.300
about these incredible changes.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.850
And forget about Moore's law.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.390
Moore's law is only
one little part

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.300
of what Ray calls the law of
accelerating returns, which

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.790
was beyond, before,
and after Moore's law.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.480
So we are living in
incredible times.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.370
If these trends continues,
in the next 20 to 30 years

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.990
we will have computers that
have many more transistors

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.870
that our brains have neurons.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.440
And I will talk a little
bit about that later.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.630
You probably remember
these old technologies,

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.065
for some of you who
are old enough-- Ray.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.120
The punch cards,
the IBM punch cards,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.210
these were used
40 two years ago.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.870
OK, this was 1 k memory, 1 k.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.790
This is 10 times
100, 1,000, 1 k.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.010
But these memories,
once you wrote on them,

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.650
you couldn't erase.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.720
So electromagnetic
magnetic were invented.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.760
This is 8 inches
and it is also 1 k.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.080
But this 1 k is
better than this 1 k

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.550
because this you could erase.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.030
You could change.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.299
In Spanish, we say 1 k and 1 k.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.474
How much is 1 k plus 1 k?

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.530
It is 1 kk, 1 kk.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.710
40 years ago, we
had 1 kk of memory.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.420
And then, obviously,
we moved to this.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.980
Some of you might
remember this, 512 kks.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.660
Then we moved to this, 1.4 mega.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.834
And I just came
back from Asia and I

00:08:56.834 --> 00:08:58.000
bought this beautiful thing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.210
This has 128 gigabytes, $20--
128 gigabytes, $20 in China.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.320
So imagine what has
happened for 10 years?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.560
We went from kk
to 128 gigabytes.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.040
What do you think is going to
happen in the next 30 years?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.370
You are going to remember
me, here, 30 years.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.150
And you will remember kk.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.370
But this will be kk.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.630
We are going to
have devices that

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.280
have more transistors that we
have neurons in our brains,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.020
in the next few years.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.030
But anyway, I just wanted
to remind you of the history

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.240
that we have gone through.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.860
This is happening
in all technologies,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.860
including biotechnology.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.360
At Singularity University,
the participants

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.505
in the summer programs get
their genome sequenced.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.746
There are maybe
devices like this.

00:09:46.746 --> 00:09:49.540
This is a gene chip
to sequence a genome.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.995
And it allows you
to know what you

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:55.150
are made of, what
diseases you will have.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.860
For example, what
is the probability

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.540
that I will psoriasis,
diabetes, prostate cancer,

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.530
and many other things I don't
want to show-- Alzheimer's,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.560
Parkinson, and so on?

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.930
One of my personal traits-- the
color of my eyes-- all of this

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.640
is written in our genes.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.450
So soon-- I guess many of
you have already done this

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.170
because this has existed for
about almost 10 years, some

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.200
of these technologies.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.100
But soon, all of
us will have this.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.180
And we'll understand
this because we don't yet

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.790
understand the genome.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.450
And soon you will know what
is the color of your eyes,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.660
if you didn't know it.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.420
And what you will die of--
so that you do not die of it.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.920
OK.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.050
Because the beautiful is
that medicine will change.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.410
Medicine now is about art.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.310
And soon it will
be a good science.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.190
Another thing you
will discover, if you

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.720
have done the 23andMe or other
similar mechanism like this,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.430
is, for example, where
do you come from?

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.950
Where did your
ancestors come from?

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.980
And this is my parents,
my father 500 years ago.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.400
You can see he comes from
Spain, all the way to Asia,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.690
to Mongolia.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.320
And you will see famous
people related to my father,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.200
like Genghis Khan.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.650
Now, I will show you my maternal
line, also 500 years ago.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.940
And so she comes also from
Spain, all the way to Siberia.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.465
And famous people related to
my mother, Marie Antoinette.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.830
So I come from a very
aristocratic family,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.730
between Genghis Khan
and Marie Antoinette.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:33.350
With this, you will be able to
construct your geological tree.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.040
And you would know
for the first time

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.120
if your father is
really your father.

00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:39.890
But more interesting
than looking

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.980
backwards is looking forwards.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.370
And in the future, we
will design our children.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.150
This is an experiment
that I did with one

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.810
of my students, Sharon James.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.230
This is a theoretical
experiment, OK,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.580
to find out how our
children could be.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.280
What is the probability
for different conditions,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.430
different traits,
different diseases?

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.210
And then pick those that you
want or that you do not want.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.610
Obviously, this was incredibly
expensive at the beginning.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.650
The first genome began
to be sequenced in 1990.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.050
The Human Genome
Project began in 1990

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.540
and it finished in 2003.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.510
It took 13 years.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.790
And it cost the US
government $1 billion,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.680
plus $2 other billion from other
governments, Europe, Japan,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.630
and so on.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.230
$3 billion, 13
years, one genome.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.380
Today, you can sequence
the full genome

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.880
for slightly over $1,000 today.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.966
And if you do the partial
sequence, like 23andMe,

00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:41.466
it is $99.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.450
We expect that by 2025, at
the latest, it will cost $10.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.730
And it will take only
one minute to do.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.970
If you remember
this, remember kk?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.080
Well, what is happening
in biotechnology

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.840
is more incredible, from $1
billion to $10; from 13 years,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.280
to one minute.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.281
This is incredible.

00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:06.030
And this is happening
in all technologies.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.880
Also, even in economics.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.480
If we look at how
development is changing,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.180
countries are growing
faster and faster.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.640
The first nation that
doubled its income per capita

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.790
was the United Kingdom, during
the Industrial Revolution.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.930
And it took the UK
between 1780 and 1838.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.990
That is 58 years to be the
first nation in human history

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.030
that doubled its
income per capita.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.710
Today, China is doing
that every seven years.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.180
This is absolutely incredible.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.270
If you look at this
throughout the centuries,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.880
the last millennium,
humanity didn't really

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.640
grow until the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.790
late in the 18th century.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.020
By the 19th century,
the GDP per capita,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.480
cumulative of the planet,
grew 100% in the century.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.380
Last century, in the 20th
century, it grew almost 400%.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.930
If this rate continues,
and I believe it will,

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:04.050
we'll probably grow 2000%,
3000%, 4000% this century.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.160
We have seen nothing yet
of what is going to happen.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.070
Additionally, the population is
finally becoming more stable,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.650
if we look long term,
from the 18th century.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.180
And look, that this
is a linear scale.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.570
Now, I want to show you the
same change for GDP per capita.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.356
Because the GDP, the income,
is growing exponentially.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:30.180
From the 18th century, when
humanity had a relatively low

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.360
income-- all of humanity was
around $1,000 per capita,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.000
per year, that was until
the Industrial Revolution--

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.290
it began growing.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.870
And then it reached $10,000.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.150
Soon it will reach $100,000.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.415
And look that there is
the catching up affect

00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:48.800
of the poorer countries
growing faster.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.085
So we are truly living
in incredible times.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300
So things are changing
exponentially faster, becoming

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.920
smaller, cheaper, and better.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.390
This is an example that Peter
Diamandis, the co-founder

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.970
of Singularity University,
likes to talk about--

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:09.360
and Ray-- about comparing
linear and exponential steps.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.140
If you give 30 linear steps, you
advanced 30 meters, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.550
5, 6, 7.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.270
If you take exponential
steps, after 30 steps,

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.000
you go around the
planet 26 times.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.560
And this is something
that we cannot comprehend.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.230
Our brains cannot understand
easily exponential change.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.205
But technology is
changing exponentially.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.250
So to talk about the future, we
have a very famous philosopher

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.690
in Latin America, Mafalda.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.690
"Malfalda" is very well known
as the most popular cartoon.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.890
And then she was asked
once, what is the future?

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.500
And she said,
well, the future is

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.783
no longer what it used to be.

00:15:51.783 --> 00:15:52.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.900
So we need to add
value to everything.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.290
In Latin America, for example,
some countries produce coffee.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.390
Does anyone know who this is?

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.310
AUDIENCE: Juan Valdez.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.810
JOSE CORDEIRO: Juan
Valdez, exactly.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:04.830
Juan Valdez.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.280
In Columbia, this is the
symbol of Colombian coffee.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.760
Columbia usually sells, in
the best years, $2 billion

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.910
of coffee.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.770
Does anyone know
how much Starbucks

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.980
sells-- over $10 billion.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.150
So we have to add value in
Latin America and everywhere.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.400
I'll give you another example.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.936
Because I am a big, big
fan of Mickey Mouse.

00:16:27.936 --> 00:16:29.560
If you don't believe
me, I'll show you.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.060
I truly like Mickey Mouse.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.960
And I'll tell you why.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.720
We have to go from
manufacturing to mindfacturing.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.530
This little Mickey
Mouse hat is made

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.940
of petroleum, Venezuelan
petroleum, the country where

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.040
I grew up.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.740
Now, if you go to Disney World
and you buy a Mickey Mouse

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.760
hat, how many dollars do you
think that this hat is worth?

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.856
How many dollars?

00:16:50.856 --> 00:16:51.670
AUDIENCE: $20.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.461
JOSE CORDEIRO: $20.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.170
JOSE CORDEIRO: Actually,
it's about $10.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.831
But I'll sell it to you for $20.

00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:01.793
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.859
And it is totally
made of oil, OK.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.512
Now, do you know much is a
barrel of oil today, about?

00:17:09.512 --> 00:17:10.300
AUDIENCE: $100.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.540
JOSE CORDEIRO: $100.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.324
And how many Mickey
Mouse hats do you

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.990
think you can make
from a barrel of oil?

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.270
A thousand probably, or more.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.810
So a thousand Mickey Mouse
hats, times $10 per hat,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.240
makes $10,000 in hats.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.400
And the barrel of oil is $100.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.540
So what is the value?

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.440
The value is not in
the raw materials,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.690
not even in the manufacturing.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.760
It's in mindfracturing,
in the mindfacturing.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.850
So this is very important
concept I believe,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.250
"mindfacturing."

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.180
So we futurists, we
talk about four ways

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.720
to look into the future.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.080
The worst one is to be
passive, like an ostrich, that

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.330
hides its head, doesn't want to
know what is going to happen.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.310
The second way is
to be reactive, OK,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.720
like a firefighter when
there is a problem.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.790
The third way is
to be preactive.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.480
When you buy
insurance, for example,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.900
to be prepared for something.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.390
But the best way
is to be proactive,

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.260
to create the future
that you want,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.160
to build the future
that you want.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.320
So I hope that you
are proactive here

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.140
and that there are
no ostriches here.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.850
But if there are
ostriches, at least

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.914
they should be
technological ostriches.

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:22.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.570
A few years ago-- a few years
ago, six, seven years ago,

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.850
I went to visit Sir Arthur
C. Clarke, before he died,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.330
in Sri Lanka.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.060
And he's very famous
among futurists.

00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:38.890
Sir Arthur C. Clarke,
he's very famous,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.200
not just because of "A
Space Odyssey 2001."

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.655
He's very famous because of
the three laws of the future.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.710
I'll read them to you.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.540
The first law-- when a
distinguished, famous scientist

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.400
says that something is
possible, he's probably right.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.250
But when he says
it is impossible,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.360
he is probably wrong.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.210
Second law of the future--
the only way of discovering

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.779
the limits of the
possible is to venture

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:05.320
pass the limits,
into the impossible.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.660
And the third law--
any sufficiently

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.420
advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.670
So now I am going
to talk about magic.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.780
Because the technologies of
the future have to be magical.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.380
And if they don't
look like magic,

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.838
it's because they
are not advanced.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.730
30 years ago, we just began
using personal computers.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.240
Actually, I remember when I
did my master's thesis at MIT.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.590
I actually used a prehistoric
technology called "typewriter"

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.480
for my first thesis at MIT.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.310
Imagine a typewriter, that
prehistoric technology.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.740
20 years ago, mobile telephone
were becoming popular.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.210
10 years ago, Google was still
growing up, a small start-up.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.760
So what is going to happen
in the next 10, 20, 30 years?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.790
We are going to have
incredible technologies.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.085
One of them is the
control of aging.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.450
Actually, we have
some of the faculty

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.090
of Singularity University
that say that aging

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.930
is a disease, but
a curable disease.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.650
And we will cure disease within
in the next 20 to 30 years.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.630
In fact, I believe we are going
to see physical mortality soon,

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.230
what I call the death of death.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.310
Actually to put
this into reference,

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.560
we already have cells
which are immortal,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.500
which are the germinal cells.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.927
Germinal cells do not age.

00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:35.010
That doesn't mean that
they are actually immortal.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.320
Because if someone
kills them, they die.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.900
But they do not age.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.070
The same as bacteria.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.322
Bacteria do not age.

00:20:43.322 --> 00:20:44.530
Again, they are not immortal.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.696
You might kill the bacteria.

00:20:45.696 --> 00:20:48.517
But they do not age, which
is the important concept.

00:20:48.517 --> 00:20:50.100
And then we have
another type of cells

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.940
which are pretty bad, which
are the cancer cells, that also

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.710
discover how to become immortal,
or at least how not to age.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.640
So we know this is
possible because we

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.184
have good cells that not age
and bad cells that do not age.

00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:04.850
Now, there are many
companies and groups

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.980
working in this enterprise.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.710
The Methuselah Foundation has
tried for the last 10 years

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.849
to try to extend the
longevity of mice.

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:14.390
And it's very
important and very easy

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.320
to do experiments with
mice because they only

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.700
live 1 year and 1/2.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.640
You cannot do experiments
with humans because we die

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.840
in the middle of the road.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.540
But with a little
mouse that only

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.920
lasts for a year and a half,
we can extend their lives

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.280
and see the results.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.130
As of now, we have
some mice that

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.990
live three times their
expected lifetime.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.520
That is mice that live
4 and 1/2 and 5 years.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.060
We have Drosophila
melanogaster, the fruit

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.920
flies, that four times
their regular lifespans.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.620
We have some worms
that actually live

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.440
six times their normal lifespan.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.520
And this isn't crazy.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.360
This has been done
in the last 10 years.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.640
So imagine what we are going
to do in the next 10 years?

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.720
In fact, while the SENS Research
Foundation, by Aubrey de Grey,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.390
is working extensively
in all of this, and so

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:04.310
is a Russia billionaire,
Dimitry Itskov.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.770
He's working on the
2045 Avatar Project

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.450
about virtual mortality.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.170
But many other companies,
including Google.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.150
I imagine you all saw this.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.150
And Calico announced last
week-- California Life Company,

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.525
from Goggle--
announced that they

00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:24.710
are going to make an investment
of $1 and 1/2 billion.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.470
That's a lot of money.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.090
OK.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.110
And I trust Google.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.200
So I know they are doing
something interesting

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.590
and something right.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.450
But not just Google,
other companies.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.350
One of the co-founders of
Singularity University, Peter

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:42.530
Diamandis, is working with
Craig Venter and other people

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.420
in Human Longevity,
Inc. In fact, they

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.980
stole some people from Google
to work in this company, that

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.230
is also working towards
indefinite lifespans.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.540
And just four days
ago, a new prize

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.550
was announced, the
Palo Alto Longevity

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.785
Prize for Immortality.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.016
This is really just beginning.

00:23:04.016 --> 00:23:05.640
All of these that I
showed you happened

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.790
in one year, all
these companies.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.630
I have actually done
two TV programs, one

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.500
in Latin American, in Spanish;
one for History Channel;

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.070
and one for Discovery Channel,
about all these technologies

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.537
and what we are going to see.

00:23:18.537 --> 00:23:20.120
But now let me tell
you about the four

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.630
technologies of the future.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.350
This was a study done by the
National Science Foundation

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.740
10 years ago with the
Department of Commerce.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.280
They decided that the
four main technologies

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.980
that will change
humanity, and that

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.100
will change humans--
humans also--

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.430
are nano, bio, info, and cogno.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.500
Let me show you quickly
these technologies.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.610
This is a very interesting
way to the put the nano, that

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.910
studies atoms; bio, that studies
cells; info, that studies

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.930
bits and bytes; cogno, neurons.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.350
If we look into these further,
the top two, nano and bio,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.120
are the hardware of life.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.160
And if we look below,
info and cogno,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.020
are the software of life.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.320
And now I will tell you
what is the complexity

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.910
of the human hardware and
of the human software.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.900
So which complexity
level we have

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.367
to reach in order to have
immortality of the hardware

00:24:16.367 --> 00:24:17.700
and immortality of the software?

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.390
Nanotechnology, again,
studying atoms, molecules.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.710
And every time go smaller,
and smaller, and smaller.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.900
Beginning actually
even with 3D printers.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.165
I love 3D printers.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.600
And also, again,
because tomorrow history

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.800
will be written,
when Made In Space

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.760
begins printing in the
International Space Station.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.440
Anyway, this is s big printer.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.190
Now, printers can do smaller,
and smaller, and smaller

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.750
things.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.080
But again, we can also
go from the bottom up.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.040
We can go atom,
by atom, by atom.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.590
For example, this is an engine
made of different atoms.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.730
Different colors are different
elements-- oxygen, sodium,

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.370
calcium, and so
on, and so forth.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.540
And this is a design of the
smallest possible rotating

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.290
engine in this shape.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.360
So with nanotechnology,
we will have

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.950
actually an
incredible world where

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.660
there will be no
waste, no waste.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.280
In fact, "waste"
is a word that we

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.990
have to eliminate from language.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.180
There is no waste.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.750
There is only raw material, in
the wrong place-- raw material

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.640
in the wrong place.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.340
And with nanotechnology, we
will reprocess all materials.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.690
And we will have
incredible, clean cities

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.940
which are very advanced.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.520
The second technology,
biotechnology.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.850
Which I like to describe
as living nanotechnology--

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.575
nanotechnology, but alive.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.390
Many experiments have been
done in the last few years.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.150
10 years ago, a
Taiwanese company

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.350
began creating these
glowfish, which

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:58.200
are transgenic fish-- the zebra
fish with the fluorescent gene

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.020
of the Medusa from
the Caribbean.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.700
And you can have these zebra
fish in five different colors,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.470
really beautiful.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.940
Actually last year-- or two
years ago-- one of our students

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.170
at Singularity
University created

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.770
this company, Glowing Plants.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:20.100
Which is a plant that has also
the gene of bioluminescence

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.660
from the firefly.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.930
He was looking for $65,000.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.910
And at the end of the process,
he had $300,000, $400,000.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.810
He almost got half
a million dollars

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.200
for these glowing plants.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.700
OK.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.160
Obviously, he advertised they
might be marijuana plants.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.870
And some people like
growing marijuana.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.456
But actually--

00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:44.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.100
--actually, these
are tomato plants.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.940
Some people like tomato too.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.530
Anyway, this is incredible,
one of the students

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.630
of Singularity University
working on that.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:58.440
Also, one of our faculty at
Singularity University, Stewart

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.240
Brand, he's working
on de-extinction,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.720
to bring back the
species that have died,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.810
that have disappeared.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.270
One of the easiest cases
actually are the mammoth.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.280
There are many frozen
mammoths in Siberia.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.290
So many that the
Russian government

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.180
is working with
several scientists

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.610
from the USA, from
Japan, and Korea,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.580
to bring them back to life.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.540
And they even created
a Pleistocene park.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.730
Not Jurassic Park,
but a Pleistocene park

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.340
in northern Siberia.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.200
So probably we will have
mammoths back to life

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.605
in the next few
years, in Russia.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.780
And cloning, cloning is
an important technology.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.900
But not for reproduction.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.890
For reproduction is
better the typical system.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.830
Cloning will be used,
not for reproduction,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.600
but for therapeutic reasons, to
create organs, to fix organs.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.390
And this is a very
interesting technology.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.320
That in Singapore, Lee Kuan
Yew, the father of Singapore,

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.540
created a city called
Biopolis, where

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.240
they are doing all
kinds of experiments

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.570
on biotechnology and cloning.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.120
But many other countries
are doing that, like Russia.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.590
And the problem with
Russia is you never

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.090
know what the
Russians are thinking.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.470
So you have to be careful
about the Russians

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.455
and cloning in Russia.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.940
But another incredible country
working on this is India.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.830
And I love India.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.690
I have been many times to India.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.460
And if you know the Indian
gods, they are very strange.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.690
They have gods that
have three heads, gods

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.470
that have eight arms.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.600
However, think how useful it
could be to have three heads?

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.740
One head is working,
one head is having fun,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.510
and the third head is
sleeping, all at the same time.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.460
Or having eight arms--
wouldn't this be wonderful?

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.140
I know that you laugh.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.967
But if you come from
India, this is normal

00:28:50.967 --> 00:28:53.050
because your gods have
three heads and eight arms.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.270
So I want you to come out
of your Western model,

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.580
for some of you, and to
think about other religions.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.870
Because also in India,
they believe in rebirth.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.500
They believe in reincarnation.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.660
And what is the closest thing
in biology to reincarnation,

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.740
cloning.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.280
OK, so India is advancing very
fast on cloning technologies.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.890
And now let me tell you the
first of the two numbers

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.810
that I want you
to memorize, which

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.610
is the complexity of
the human hardware.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.310
And later I will tell
you the complexity

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.280
of the human software.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.330
Scientists, 10 years ago,
created an artificial virus.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.680
But a virus is very
small, has very few genes,

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.350
and a small number of
base pairs of nucleotides.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.190
If you remember biology, A
goes with T and C goes with--

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.690
AUDIENCE: G.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.310
JOSE CORDEIRO: --G.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.480
So basically, an artificial
virus was created 10 years ago.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.030
Two years ago, another
scientist-- actually,

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.395
Craig Venter-- created
an artificial bacteria.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.230
But bacteria are
obviously bigger.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.620
And in order to prove that
he created the bacteria,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.300
the scientists
even put the email

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.115
of the team that
created the bacteria.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.530
But still, a bacteria is small.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.910
However, how long will it take
until we can create something

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.380
like a human being?

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.560
And that is number one.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.970
3 gigabytes, that
is the complexity

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.900
of the human
hardware, 3 gigabytes.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.740
Even the most
complex people here

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.660
has no more than 3 gigabytes.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.080
Even Ray has only 3 gigabytes.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.650
Here, I have a pen drive--

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.830
RAY KURTZWEIL: There's
massive redundancy in that.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.890
JOSE CORDEIRO: On top.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.445
Thank you.

00:30:35.445 --> 00:30:38.210
RAY KURTZWEIL: And like
ALUs are [INAUDIBLE],

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.797
like a thousand times.

00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:40.880
JOSE CORDEIRO: Absolutely.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.544
RAY KURTZWEIL:
The natural amount

00:30:41.544 --> 00:30:43.868
of data, if you just
compress out the redundancy,

00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:46.109
is about 50 million bytes.

00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:47.900
JOSE CORDEIRO: So you
see how small we are?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.090
And this pen drive
has 128 gigabytes.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.340
So how many people
can I fit here?

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.120
Divide 128 gigabytes
by 3 gigabytes

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.300
and add the redundancy
factor that Ray mentioned.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.850
And here you can fit 42
people and a little cat.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:08.840
OK.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.320
Now I will move into the
complexity of the processing

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.030
software.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.240
For that, we wanted to-- well,
again, remember, we humans,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.960
we are basically four
letters, A, T, C, G.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.710
The third technology,
info technology.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.920
According to the advances in
computers and the processing

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.850
power, we are basically
reaching the complexity

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.400
of a spider, a lizard.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.220
And then in 20,
30, years, we will

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.350
reach the complexity of
a monkey, of a human.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.960
And everything
will be connected,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.920
just like in
telecommunications, becoming

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.750
smaller and more powerful.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.470
And soon we will get
into the fifth generation

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.820
of telecommunications.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.530
So much, that I was traveling
in Scandinavia a few months ago

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.480
and I saw this advertisement
about telecommunications,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.710
where they say that the children
will actually be born already

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.000
with internet connected.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.290
And the first thing they will
ask is for more bandwidth.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.010
They need more bandwidth.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.730
Because we are going to connect
everybody with everybody.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:15.640
We will probably create a
global brain, a global network,

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.940
into what is called "the
internet of things."

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.120
Everything will be
connected with everything,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.100
the internet of things.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.470
And people, computers,
cars-- especially

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.280
if they drive themselves,
the self-driving cars.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.270
Also BMW.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:39.950
And now, that by 2025, all other
cars will be fully automatic,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.310
fully self-driving cars.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.790
They don't want humans.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.930
We are very bad driving.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.800
So they don't want
humans driving cars.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.220
And we will connect
ourselves with internet

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.340
in different ways.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.390
Google Glass is one
of those new ways.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.980
Internet to our eyes and our
eyes to internet, for example.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.720
But what I find
truly fascinating

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.570
was the announcement
made in April, last year,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.680
by Eric Schmidt, about
connecting the whole planet

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.600
with free internet.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.670
This is beautiful.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.740
This will change the world.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.940
It will change the world.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.606
But then obviously,
other companies they

00:33:16.606 --> 00:33:17.770
will stay behind.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.540
And Mark Zuckerberg
announced a few months later

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.910
that Facebook had a
different program.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.780
But also with the
objective, by 2020,

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.090
to connect the whole planet,
in the middle of the Sahara,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.150
in the middle of the Pacific
Ocean, in the North Pole.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:37.770
But later still, another group,
called Outernet, as opposed

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.285
to internet,
Outernet, because they

00:33:39.285 --> 00:33:40.660
are working with
microsatellites.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.410
I don't know if their
microsatellites,

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.660
or if the drones, or if
the balloons will win.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.210
What I do know is
that before 2020, we

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.080
will have free internet
in the whole planet,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.270
in the whole planet.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.880
This is the most
incredible thing

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.201
to democratize knowledge,
to democratize access

00:34:01.201 --> 00:34:01.825
to information.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.120
And artificial intelligence
gave us some programs.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.639
And you are all familiar with
IBM's Watson, that in 2011 beat

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.960
the two experts in the
game, Ken and Brad.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.380
Actually, Ken was
normally so good

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.340
at playing Jeopardy
that he even wrote

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.969
a book about how to win
at the game Jeopardy.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.170
And do you know what Watson did?

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.796
Watson read the book.

00:34:27.796 --> 00:34:28.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:30.940
But Watson not only
read that book,

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:35.389
Watson was born with
Wikipedia in its head.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:39.040
How many of you have
Wikipedia in your brains,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.370
or even 1% of it?

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.850
And do you even remember
1% of what you have read?

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.679
Well, Watson remembers it all.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.750
Now, obviously, it
was very expensive.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.429
It was over $40 million
TO develop Watson.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.095
Many scientists work during
four years, or a bit longer.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.030
But, soon, it would
probably be free.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.440
It will be a free application,
like it happened before

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:13.450
with Deep Blue, when in 1997,
beat the world chess champion,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.760
Garry Kasparov.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.770
That computer actually
was much more expensive.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.950
That computer was
over $100 million.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.880
And it took IBM over 10 years.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.880
Obviously, we had bad
technology 20 years ago,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.640
compared to what we have today.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.920
Do you know how
much is that today?

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.590
You can buy the descendant
of Deep Blue for free.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.400
You can get descendants of
Deep Blue free in internet.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.200
And no human can
beat those programs.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.150
So anyway, one of the
first applications,

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.150
as you probably know,
of IBM, is Dr. Watson.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.870
In order to become a
good medical doctor

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.070
it will know all the
books of medicine,

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.160
all the journals of medicine.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.930
All the personal histories of
the patients who allow that.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.860
No human can have access or
process all that information.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.670
So finally, medicine
will be good.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.080
Instead of bad, as it is now,
it will be a good science.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.310
And so we arrive at the
last and final technology,

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:17.140
which is the most
interesting-- cognitive

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.410
technology,
neuroscience, the brain.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.330
The brain is very
important because it

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.880
is the most complex
organ in the human body.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.000
And it is basically
the only organ

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.400
that we have not been able to
reproduce artificially yet.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.620
We have been able to do almost
anything, artificial eyes,

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.190
artificial pancreas, artificial
lungs, artificial heart,

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.520
everything except for the brain.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.280
Why?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.040
Because the brain is
the most complex organ.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.180
Not only that, it is the
most complex structure

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.615
in the known universe.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.210
Maybe tomorrow, we have a
Martian, who has a bigger brain

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.360
that we humans.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.500
But until that time,
there is nothing

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.215
that we know of more complex
than the human brain.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.370
And you know what?

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.215
The brain is not that complex.

00:37:05.215 --> 00:37:06.620
And in the next
few years, we are

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.200
going to decipher
the brain, which

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.390
is the final frontier
in terms of complexity.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.360
But we will go beyond the brain.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.590
For that, you have to read Ray's
book, "How to Create a Mind."

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.250
He explains a lot about that.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.615
And now the book
is in Spanish, it

00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:26.860
is in German, and in
many other languages.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.410
And it is recommended
by my colleague

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.640
from Venezuela, who is the
president of MIT, Rafael Reif,

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.640
as one of the best
books there is

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.740
to understand how the
mind, the brain work.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.620
And how did the brain evolve?

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.100
We understand today
that the brain

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.520
has been changing through ages.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.910
In fact, in Japan, they have
the Riken Brain Institute,

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.090
where they have followed the
evolution, biological evolution

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:56.380
of the brain and how the
brain can continue evolving,

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.510
can continue changing.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:03.500
So also in terms of the genome,
let me tell you once all of you

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.240
sequence your genome,
you will realize

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.900
that we are 99%
equal to a monkey.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.220
We are very close to a monkey.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.805
And we are about 90%
equal to a mouse.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.110
So actually we are very similar.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.500
So if we are only
1% above-- to put

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.930
it that way-- above a
monkey, or 10% above a mouse,

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:31.460
can you imagine 1% above a
human, or 10% above a human,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.750
or 100% above a human?

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.700
So all these things,
we are going to see.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.990
Anywhere, in Japan they are
working on this brain research

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.920
institute.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.310
And they originally had
a plan for the year 2018

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:44.960
to create artificial brains.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.520
Since that time actually--
they began in 1997-- now

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.910
they say they are running
between five and 10 years late.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.570
By still, they are
moving forward.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.810
They say between
2023 and 2028, they

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.680
will be able to recreate
artificial brains

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.080
equivalent to human brains.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.580
In the USA, as you
know, a few years ago

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.640
the Human Connectome
project began.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.810
And last year,
President Barack Obama

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.470
announced the Brain
Initiative, with $1 billion

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.885
for the next 10 years.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.210
And just around the same
time, the European Union

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:27.560
gave 1 billion euros for
the Human Brain Project.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.670
So I don't know if
the USA, if Europe,

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.240
or Japan is going to do it.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.320
And China is coming up soon
with their own program.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.810
But in the next
10 years, we will

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.440
understand how the
brain works and we

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.850
will be able to replicate
artificial brains.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:49.270
So this is the second number I
would like for you to remember.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.250
And it's a very
simple schematic.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:57.360
But a brain basically
has 100 billion neurons.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.150
That is 10 to the 11 neurons.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.600
That is all the neurons
we have in the brain.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.820
We can have less.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.800
But we don't have more.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.720
So let's say 10 to the 11.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.990
Each neuron has about 1,000
connections, 2,000 connections,

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:14.720
4,000 connections, maybe
a bit more, a bit less.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.140
That gives about 10 to the
14 connections or synapses.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.060
And those synapses are
the ones that compute.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.860
The brain has basically six
main frequencies, alpha waves,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.750
beta waves, delta
waves, mu waves,

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:31.890
which are actually
very, very slow.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:37.485
The brain frequencies are 1
hertz, 10 hertz, 100 hertz.

00:40:37.485 --> 00:40:41.680
A very fast brain, like
Ray's brain, is 1 kilohertz.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.300
1 kilohertz.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.400
My telephone has
achieved of 3 gigahertz.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.630
So these telephone computes
a million times faster

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:54.865
than any human brain.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.200
The difference obviously
is that I still

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.010
have more neurons than
this has transistors.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.990
But this will change in
the next 10 to 20 years.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:09.830
And we will have devices that
process a million times faster

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.300
than our brains and that have
as many transistors-equivalent

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.480
neurons as we do.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.500
So the complexity of the human
software, to put it that way,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.020
is 10 to the 17.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.260
And this is a ballpark figure.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.190
Some people say it is 10
to the 15, 10 to the 16.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.890
Some people say it is 10
to the 18, 10 to the 20.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.440
I do not care.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.500
It is just a matter of time.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.530
Due to the law of
accelerating returns,

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.500
it can be five years
earlier or five years later.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.890
But it is a finite number.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:42.530
That we know.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.540
It's a finite number.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.320
So if we don't talk about the
mind, the spirit, and the soul,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.780
then a brain just computes 10
to the 17 operations per second.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.155
And we are going to reach that
level in the next 20 years.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.430
But there are a
smaller brains too.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.731
No bigger brains yet.

00:42:02.731 --> 00:42:03.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.320
But we can have smaller brains.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.660
And we are going to
connect the brains

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.910
to computers and
to other devices,

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.390
with internal brain implants or
with external brain implants.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.660
In fact, scientists
are beginning

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.900
to do also brain-to-brain
interfaces.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.400
And they have been
able to transfer

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.780
from the brain of a mouse to
the brain of another mouse,

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.720
how to find cheese
in a labyrinth.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.240
This is just beginning.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.290
They are doing similar
experiments with monkeys.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.520
And then we are going to
do this also with humans.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.925
I have this technology,
which is already like three,

00:42:43.925 --> 00:42:44.550
four years ago.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.430
But I like it lot
because it lets

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.950
you do a few experiments
in terms of concentration,

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:54.290
meditation, targeting,
and playing other games.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.120
This basically is an
electroencephalogram.

00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:57.950
There is no magic here.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.570
This is an
electroencephalogram that

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.450
reads what is happening in the
center part of my frontal lobe.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.360
And then through a
Bluetooth connection,

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.820
sends it to my
computer and analyzes

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.950
what is happening in my brain.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:17.636
Soon we will be able to do this
also from person to person.

00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:19.010
And with more
electrodes, we will

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.770
be able to capture
more information.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.580
There are companies like
Emotiv that have 14 electrodes.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.670
Soon we would have
100 electrodes.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.630
Then we will have
1,000 electrodes.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:31.980
And then we want to stop using
this primitive technology

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.570
called talking.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.930
Talking is a very
primitive technology,

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.970
with a very narrow bandwidth.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.560
I have to say word
after word, after word.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.080
And you have to be listen
to me, word after word,

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.240
after word, bad joke, another
word, and so on, and so forth.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.950
In the future, we
will be able to send

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.150
the information from brain
to brain, like computers do.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.510
Everything I wanted to
say here is in my brain.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:01.540
But I cannot transfer it fast
enough because it is a narrow

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.280
bandwidth communication system.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.890
Obviously, this was incredible,
because monkeys do not talk.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.800
So between a non-talking
monkey and us,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.710
there is a huge difference.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.320
But imagine when we have
brain to brain communication?

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.720
It is not a dream.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.500
Telepathy we will have
thanks to technology.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.820
And we will do this
also with robots.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:28.180
And I want to show you the
last 15 years of Asimo.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.430
Look what Honda has done
in the last 15 years.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.260
I ask you, can you
imagine what Honda

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.960
will do in the next 15 years?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.910
They say that in 20 years,
they will win the World Cup.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.130
It will be a robot team
winning the World Cup.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.460
And robots will be fantastic,
with many degrees of motion,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.925
that we don't have, humans.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.220
And they will have feelings.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.585
At MIT, in the MIT
Media Lab, they

00:44:57.585 --> 00:45:02.820
are working on understanding
the feelings of robots.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.130
And in South Korea, they
are working on a law

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:09.580
to give human rights to robots.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.740
You heard it was human
rights to robots.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:16.270
Because they believe
that in 10 to 15 years,

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.680
every human will have a robot.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.245
And those robots
will not be stupid.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.410
And robots will be
absolutely fantastic.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.450
Imagine those robots.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.070
And also for the
women, don't desperate.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:32.520
You will have your
fantastic match of robots,

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.360
with the additional advantage
that they will never

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.610
get tired at night.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.890
Unfortunately, we think
normally that robots are bad.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.631
And that's because of the
former governor of California.

00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:46.513
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.770
Who actually gave one
of the opening speeches

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:54.860
at the inauguration of
Singularity University in 2009.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.060
And he said, fantastic that
you think about the future

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.890
because the science
fiction of today

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.620
is the science
reality of tomorrow.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:09.120
But here, because of Hollywood,
we think robots are bad.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.130
Even female robots are bad too.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.675
Including, when they
have sex, they are bad.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.000
But are robots good
or are robots bad?

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.710
And I could tell you it
depends where you're from.

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.530
It depends on your culture.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.290
If you grow up in
Japan, robots are good.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.760
In fact, robots are
better than humans.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.590
When a human has a
problem, they expect

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.730
that a robot will help them.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.330
And there are many books
now in Japan-- for example,

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.655
how to have sex with robots.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.290
And I'm not joking.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.320
The mentality of the Japanese,
and the Korean, and the Chinese

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.560
is totally different.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.100
I will give you an
example that you

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.030
will understand, with dragons.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.830
Dragons in China are good.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.910
Dragons in Korea
and Japan are good.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.260
But dragons in Europe are bad.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.970
European dragons are bad.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.210
They kill people.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.520
They destroy cities.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.110
They throw fire.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.120
But in Asia, they are good.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.410
The same with robots.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.320
Robots in Asia are good.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.200
And that is why
Japan and Korea are

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.250
the leaders in humanoid
robotics in the world today.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.260
Because they are good.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.810
And all companies in
Japan are doing robots.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.730
At Honda, Toyota,
Fuji, all of them.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.000
But again, this is
not human or robot.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.370
This is human and machines.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:37.080
This is the synergy, the fusion,
of humans and our creations.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.260
We already saw that
in the London Olympics

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.350
with Blade Runner.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.530
We saw this also at the
opening of the World Cup,

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:50.150
where a paraplegic person,
connected to an exoskeleton

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.600
with a device like this,
much more sophisticated,

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.930
stood up and gave the initial
kickoff of the World Cup

00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:59.260
in Brazil.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.730
We are going to see
more in two years.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.470
After the Olympic
games in Brazil,

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:09.220
there will be the first cyborg
Olympics in Zurich, Switzerland

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:15.510
for discapacitated people, with
no legs, with no eyes, enhanced

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.010
thanks to technology.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.450
This is coming in
two years in Zurich.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.270
This is the beginning
of these technologies

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.780
used to enhance humans.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.710
All of this is
called transhumanism,

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.000
which is transcending
human limitations thanks

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
to science and technology.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.645
We humans, we are not
the end of evolution.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.260
We are just the beginning
of conscious evolution.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.410
Just like we are trans-monkeys,
there will be transhumans.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:48.800
But we have to do
this carefully.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.052
Because we don't want
to finish like that.

00:48:51.052 --> 00:48:52.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.410
Our species is called
Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:56.580
which is quite unique.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.540
This means the human
that knows, that knows.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:05.630
We are the first species that
is fully aware of its existence,

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:07.000
as far as we know.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.050
But we are not the end.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.695
We are just the
beginning of this path.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.690
Life on this planet has
existed for about 3 and 1/2

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.750
billion years.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.540
But the first 3 billion
years was only bacteria.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:23.240
Let me remind you,
bacteria are immortal.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.630
Or better, bacteria do not age.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.180
Also they have
round chromosomes.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.260
They have no telomeres because
they are completely round.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.360
So a bacteria does not age.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.200
It can die, if you kill it.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.690
But it does not age.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.174
Life appeared to be
alive, not to die.

00:49:41.174 --> 00:49:42.840
And that is the
beginning with bacteria.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.360
Anyway, humans we are very new.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.480
Humans, in our
current shape, we have

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.440
existed for maybe 100,000 years.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.280
But we are not the
end of evolution.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.037
We are changing biologically.

00:49:53.037 --> 00:49:54.745
And now, we are changing
technologically.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:00.310
In the next few years, we are
going to cure all diseases.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.760
There will be [INAUDIBLE]
paraplegics in 10 years.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.930
We will not have these
horrible diseases.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:07.062
No more Parkinson's.

00:50:07.062 --> 00:50:07.895
No more Alzheimer's.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.590
No more aging.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:15.920
We are going to see the death
of death in the next few years.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.310
But everything has ying and
yang, as the Chinese say.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.200
And this is so complex that
even the ying/yang, inside

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.840
has little ying/yangs.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.610
And in fact, more-- little,
little, little, ying/yangs.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.435
So there is always the
dark side of the Force.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.970
And I just went to
North Korea last year.

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:38.495
And let me show
you the two Koreas.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.690
There are a good country
and a bad country.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.265
So we have to
think about what is

00:50:44.265 --> 00:50:45.515
going to happen with humanity.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:51.250
The Chinese say it's better
not to blame darkness,

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.070
but to light up a candle.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.010
So I just want to light
up a little candle

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.110
and that is why I went to
North Korea, the last country

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:02.340
in the world without
internet, while South Korea is

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.410
the most connected
country in the planet.

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.740
And they are the same or
they were the same country.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.500
So we just have to think
about the world, which is one.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.920
We have to meditate
about the world.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.470
I do a lot of meditations with
the Hindus, with the Buddhists.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.470
And I finish with
this Chinese word.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:18.680
I lived three years in Japan.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.221
So I learned some
Chinese characters.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.440
At the beginning, I didn't
know how to write it well

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.315
and I wrote it upside
down or sideways.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.430
Now, I know it is
written like that.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:34.280
This is the word in Chinese,
and Japanese, and Korean,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.170
and sometimes in Vietnamese,
that means "crisis."

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.780
Crisis has two
characters in Chinese.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.340
The first one means danger.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:45.220
But the second one means,
normally, opportunity.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.200
So we are going
through the biggest

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.520
crisis in the
history of humanity.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.600
But let's not only
look at the danger.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.700
Let's look at the opportunity.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.436
Thank you very much.

00:51:56.436 --> 00:51:57.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:04.084 --> 00:52:07.500
AUDIENCE: A question
about-- it's sort

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.820
of an ethical question.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.835
So you say there's going
to be these technologies.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.530
But technologies cost money.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:23.270
And I'm wondering do you see it
as being available to everyone

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:27.270
or only the rich
people will become

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.870
immortal and all these things?

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.860
And then-- that's
basically the question.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.760
JOSE CORDEIRO: Yeah.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.590
The ethical issues
are fundamental.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.765
And I myself come from
the developing world.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.910
But I believe that
technology is actually

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:46.820
what will help us to
leapfrog from poverty.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.760
If you look at the example
of mobile telephones,

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.070
in Africa there were
no phones 20 years ago.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.360
Now, every African--
and I'm saying Africa

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.330
because it is the poorest
continent in the planet-- has

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.770
a mobile phone.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.570
Why?

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.760
Because the first
technologies, when they come,

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.920
actually they are expensive, and
they are for the rich people,

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.290
and they do not work.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:10.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.350
Then they go into
mass production.

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:14.800
They become cheap.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.170
And they work.

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.520
And this is when the
poor people get them.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.970
In terms of anti-aging
technologies,

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:24.273
obviously the first
immortal-- to put it

00:53:24.273 --> 00:53:26.550
this way-- will be probably
people like Bill Gates

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.210
or someone like that.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:30.920
But in a very short
time, everybody

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.990
will have access to
those technologies.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.190
But I understand
the ethical issues.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.880
In fact, at
Singularity University,

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.070
there is a special course
called Policy Law and Ethics,

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.760
because this is fundamental.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.330
And I can tell you, as coming
from the developing world,

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.940
I'm concerned about that.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.741
Yes?

00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:48.241
RAY KURTZWEIL: Only
the wealthy will

00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:52.142
access to these technologies at
a price where they don't work.

00:53:52.142 --> 00:53:54.760
By the time they work
well, like cellphones,

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.617
we have today 1 to
2 billion of them.

00:53:56.617 --> 00:53:59.539
And we'll have 5 to 6
billion within a few years.

00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:00.831
And they get better and better.

00:54:00.831 --> 00:54:01.747
JOSE CORDEIRO: Um-huh.

00:54:01.747 --> 00:54:03.080
Yeah, those are smartphones.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.750
Because in terms of
cheap mobile phones,

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.582
almost everybody
now could have one.

00:54:08.582 --> 00:54:10.790
AUDIENCE: As you know, we've
seen accelerating change

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:12.920
in most technologies
in the world.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.870
Why do you think
that kind of change

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:18.360
is not being seen in energy
and the use of fossil fuel?

00:54:19.314 --> 00:54:21.230
JOSE CORDEIRO: You know,
this is so beautiful.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.540
I actually went to give a talk
on that because that's my area.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.830
I work on energy.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.630
And people do not
see this coming.

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:32.570
In the next 20
years, we are going

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.800
to go through a solar
tsunami, a solar tsunami.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.790
What is happening
in solar energy

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.260
is going to disrupt completely
the fossil fuel industry.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.760
And they don't see it,

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.230
I was talking to
Vinod Khosla, one

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.130
of the co-founders
of Sun Microsystems.

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:51.430
And he said the same happened
30 years ago when they did not

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.480
see the mobile
phones, especially

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.860
people in the normal
telephone companies.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.080
And now, everybody has
come a mobile phone.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.500
What we are going to see in
solar energy and renewables

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.460
is incredible.

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.550
And this year is very especially
important because now we

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:09.030
have reached what is
called grid parity,

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:12.540
when renewables are
cheaper than fossil fuels.

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.210
And the trend continues cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:19.230
And now, there is mass
production of solar panels.

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:21.730
And solar panels use many
of the same technologies

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.920
as chips, semiconductor
chips, made

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.150
of silicon and
many other things.

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.570
Companies like Applied
Materials-- Applied Materials

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:33.830
made chips for computers
and chips for solar panels

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.660
We are going to see
a radical change.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.340
And, in fact, Ray says-- and
also I believe in it strongly--

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.040
in 20 years, it will be
fully reliable, mostly solar.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.240
RAY KURTZWEIL: Larry
Page and I did a study

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.910
for the National Academy of
Engineering a few years ago,

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:52.170
before he got this new job.

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:58.165
And we noted a exponential
growth in the number of watts

00:55:58.165 --> 00:56:00.308
for this plateau has
been doubling every two

00:56:00.308 --> 00:56:02.643
years, for the last 30 years.

00:56:02.643 --> 00:56:05.933
It's now only five doublings,
and two years each,

00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:08.188
from 100% of the world's energy.

00:56:08.188 --> 00:56:11.441
At which point, we'll be
using [INAUDIBLE] sunlight

00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:11.940
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:14.470
JOSE CORDEIRO: Absolutely.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:15.660
This is so true.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.210
We receive 10,000
times more solar energy

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.840
on the atmosphere of
the planet than we

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.010
consume-- 10,000 times more.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:24.720
We just need 1% of 1%.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.750
And this is growing really
exponentially, as Ray said.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.590
And it's doubling
every two years.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:36.450
So I do believe in 20 years,
fossil fuel will be fossil.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.220
AUDIENCE: We're working on
sequencing the human genome,

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.530
understanding the human brain.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.582
How we're doing all the
commensal organisms that

00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:44.540
make up the walking
ecosystems that we actually

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.900
are, since our human cells
are outnumbered drastically

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.040
by all of the microflora
and fauna in our bodies?

00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:53.100
JOSE CORDEIRO: Yes.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.950
There are also many
people working on that.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.010
As you said, we have
more foreign cells,

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.260
or non-human cells, than
human cells in our bodies.

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.100
But I don't particularly
think that that is a problem.

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.310
Because in order to
create artificial organs,

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.460
we don't have to go through
all the same messy procedures

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.760
that have created
us or that made us.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:16.480
Like if you want to do
an artificial heart,

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.620
you don't copy a natural
heart completely.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:23.250
Or if you create a plane,
you don't copy a bird.

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.970
So I think many of the things
we will do in the future

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.470
will not be totally biological
and will not necessarily

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:30.710
follow biology.

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:32.655
But anyway, that's not
my area of expertise.

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.950
AUDIENCE: When we see
the death of death,

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:38.700
will we also see
the death of birth?

00:57:40.115 --> 00:57:41.115
AUDIENCE: Good question.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.800
JOSE CORDEIRO: Well,
actually it might

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.260
happen because in fact the
population of the planet

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.850
is already stabilizing.

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:51.700
Today, we are over
7 billion people.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.190
And in most developed countries,
except for the USA, and Canada,

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.340
and Australia, the
developed countries

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.242
have stabilized
or are going down.

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.450
I lived three years in Japan.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:03.610
The population of Japan
declined 1 million people

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.080
in the three years
I was in Japan.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.410
Russia is going through
a collapse in population.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:13.840
China will see the most
incredible common suicide.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:19.815
China is going to lose 200
million people between 2030

00:58:19.815 --> 00:58:21.180
and 2050.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.520
In any event, we are reaching
stabilization of population.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.520
And what will happen in
the future, I do not know.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.380
But we are beginning to
colonize the universe as well.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.080
We need more people
to go to Mars.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.027
We need volunteers.

00:58:34.027 --> 00:58:35.110
Do you want to go to Mars?

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.500
Even if it is one
way, as-- Elon Musk,

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:44.380
Elon Musk said he wants to die
on Mars, but not on landing.

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:45.808
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:51.150
AUDIENCE: Kind of piggy-backing
off this question as well,

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:54.150
but assuming that we see at
least a slowdown in birth

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:55.770
rates, how would
that affect-- I mean

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.900
you saw how small a portion of
the whole evolutionary process

00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.659
we are.

00:58:59.659 --> 00:59:01.200
Would we just be
drawing a line there

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.240
And we'd have to manually tinker
with ourselves from then on?

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.830
Or like how do we continue to
evolve as a species as well?

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:07.820
Because I feel like we're
not exactly perfect.

00:59:09.247 --> 00:59:10.080
JOSE CORDEIRO: Yeah.

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:10.621
I don't know.

00:59:10.621 --> 00:59:13.150
Maybe Ray would like to
comment on that better than me.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:14.900
But I think we are
going to see a Cambrian

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.390
explosion of new life forms.

00:59:16.671 --> 00:59:18.670
RAY KURTZWEIL: Well, it
was actually surprising.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:23.080
Scientists discovered that there
has been biological evolution

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.540
in humans in the
last thousand years.

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.180
But nonetheless,
it's insignificant

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.635
compared to our
technological evolution.

00:59:30.635 --> 00:59:33.090
And that is expanding
exponentially.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:35.660
And we're going to-- we are
enhancing ourselves already.

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.432
The kid who helped to
build the smartphone

00:59:37.432 --> 00:59:40.285
has access to more
information than the president

00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:43.060
of the United States
had 15 years ago.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.810
And we're get closer and
closer to these technologies.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.750
And that's the future
evolution of humanity,

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:51.200
into a human-technological
symbiosis.

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:54.920
JOSE CORDEIRO: Oh, here, here.

00:59:56.546 --> 00:59:58.420
AUDIENCE: Is the timing
of these technologies

00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.795
being planned at
all in the sense

00:59:59.795 --> 01:00:01.540
that if we're going
to become immortal,

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.789
then maybe we should have
figured out all our resource

01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:05.930
problems before then or
we should have figured out

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.770
a way off this planet
before that point?

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.145
Otherwise, we're going to
choke ourselves on this planet.

01:00:10.445 --> 01:00:11.820
JOSE CORDEIRO:
Actually, we think

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.550
we have unlimited
resources on this planet.

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:18.090
Do you know how much are
you worth on raw material?

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:21.210
You're not worth even $100.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.120
Or me-- don't take
it personally.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.110
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.780
I mean we are 70% water.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.360
And we are not Evian
or Perrier water.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.000
We are tap water.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The other 30% that makes us
are very simple elements.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.347
So they are calcium
and potassium.

01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:39.430
We are very cheap to make.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:43.190
We are so cheap to make that our
parents made us in one night.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.530
So humans are very
cheap to make.

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:50.190
Now with nanotechnology, we
will be able to structure

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:52.120
matter the way we want it.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.070
So actually I think we
have enough resources

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.790
on this planet.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:01:00.630
We don't have a resource
scarcity problem.

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:03.880
And the game with
nanotechnology will radically

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.070
change many things.

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.650
And the universe is
full of mass anyway.

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:13.190
I mean we live in a tiny, tiny
planet, in a tiny solar system,

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.330
in a tiny galaxy.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.405
I mean the universe is so big,
so huge, so full of resources.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.217
And we are not even $100.

01:01:22.217 --> 01:01:24.800
AUDIENCE: So when you speak of
these accelerating technologies

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.060
and nanotechnology,
obviously there

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.480
is incredible opportunity for
transhumanistic possibilities,

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.426
for things to go really well.

01:01:32.426 --> 01:01:35.235
But when you speak of, I
guess, developing emotions

01:01:35.235 --> 01:01:37.360
in robots and those sort
of artificial intelligence

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.070
systems, and I
think there's also

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.240
a possibility for
negative almost

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.920
volition of these systems.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.337
Are you worried about that,
I guess in the future?

01:01:45.337 --> 01:01:47.670
JOSE CORDEIRO: Of course, I'm
always worried about this.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:49.950
But also I wanted to
emphasize different cultures.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.497
That's why I said in Japan,
the Japanese love robots.

01:01:53.497 --> 01:01:55.205
I mean they want to
have sex with robots.

01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:00.090
They will probably do it
even better sometimes, huh?

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:02.280
Or they will not get tired.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.750
But I am concerned, obviously.

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.960
I am concerned.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.787
This is the Terminator
scenario or the Skynet.

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:10.370
Does anyone know
Google is the Skynet?

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.700
So this is a possibility.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.080
But I think evolution has been
improving the human conditions

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.260
throughout the ages
and we will continue.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.600
But it is true technology can
be used for good or bad things,

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.510
beginning with fire.

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.920
Fire was one of the first
inventions by humans

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.120
half a million years ago.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.430
And fire, you can use it
for cooking or getting warm,

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.190
or for burning your enemy.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.492
Or nuclear technology,
for electricity

01:02:35.492 --> 01:02:36.450
or for nuclear weapons?

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:39.050
So technology has a dark side.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:42.090
But I think the positive
side is much bigger.

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:44.820
And humanity, obviously,
in general, is good.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.020
I believe most humans are good.

01:02:47.289 --> 01:02:48.830
RAY KURTZWEIL: I
just wanted to thank

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.960
you, Jose, for an
inspiring presentation.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.700
Thank you.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.900
JOSE CORDEIRO: Thank you.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.750
[APPLAUSE]
