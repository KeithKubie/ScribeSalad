You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.443
from

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.440
W. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

4
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.360
the podcast. Today on the podcast,

5
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.650
we are going to revisit something that we explored once upon a time and a show

6
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:26.280
called new normal. You guys talk to each other now? Yeah. Hello. Hello.

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.760
Who's this? In that show we talked with a fellow named Brian Hare,

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.420
who's an evolutionary biologist. Yeah. Though that was a, that's him.

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.980
And he told us the story of a guy whose name was Dmitri [inaudible],

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.620
was a very famous geneticist in Russia. He was, uh,

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.240
alive during World War II and he's pursued by Stalin.

12
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.230
Had a very interesting life.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
Ended up in Siberia where he began one of the most exciting experiments in

14
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.084
biology.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.600
What he did is he took a bunch of wild foxes in Siberia and he kind of weeded

16
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.450
out the aggressive ones. You mean to killed them? Shop them? Yes,

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.120
and he did this for generations. Anytime a Fox was aggressive to people,

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.130
he would kill it unfortunately.

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.460
And then he would keep the other ones and in a relatively few generations,

20
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.870
I think it was 10 or so, yeah,

21
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.320
10 10 he was able to create a kinder and Gentler Fox.

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.680
They had foxes that were attracted to humans, which you would kind of expect.

23
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.090
But the thing that really got us fascinated by the Fox experiment was as these

24
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:26.760
animals behavior changed, their bodies change too. Here's that part of the show.

25
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.790
What was exciting and surprising was that the same foxes,

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
they actually show a whole suite of changes that he did not select for on

27
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.020
purpose. Like what do you mean physical changes?

28
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.330
These foxes as they became more gentle for some unaccountable reason,

29
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.290
their ears instead of pointing straight up flipped over. That's right.

30
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.950
It was a big accident that they now have floppy ears,

31
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.220
the tails on a Fox, which you know wild fucks. They're straight

32
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.380
<v 1>now they have curly tails,</v>

33
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.500
they have multicolored coats that are no longer just grave tips of there cause

34
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.130
loose color.

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.130
The teeth gets smaller and their bones became very thin.

36
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.090
Their bones got thinner. Yes.

37
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:17.350
So what happens to the skull and the face is it actually becomes more feminine.

38
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.150
The whole animal becomes more delicate than were puppy. Like, wow,

39
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.690
<v 0>this was really a surprise to us because I mean, when you domesticate a dog,</v>

40
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.180
you do expect it to become nicer to people.

41
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:33.290
What you don't expect is all this other stuff that it becomes essentially a

42
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:37.760
completely different animal. Completely or certainly differently shaped animal.

43
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
Well, that's the question really. How different is it?

44
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.470
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

45
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.800
<v 0>Once you've become domesticated and on a household pet,</v>

46
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:50.720
is there anything in you, anything inside that's still just a little bit wild?

47
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.820
Turns out our a producer at the time, Lulu Miller had been thinking about this.

48
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.650
Okay. And she wrote an essay,

49
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 3>which is not our usual style, but this is kind of fine. Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.350
And it takes that question, you know, what's left? Uh,

51
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.070
what's wild that's left and it brings it much closer to home. Okay.

52
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.030
So here's the Lulu on most of his birthdays,

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.170
Maureen would give Charlie a sweater. Worrying was my dad's coworker,

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
Charlie was my dog. He was a little white terrier,

55
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.020
a very active little guy.

56
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.980
Always snuffling around at something barking graveling if you took his spot on

57
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.840
the couch, but when we dip him into that year sweater,

58
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.520
he'd go completely still and he'd get that same stillness when my sisters and I

59
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.960
would sit in a circle around him and color on his white far with magic markers.

60
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.900
I used to think he was still like that because he was happy content to be our

61
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.320
little dog, but now I don't know

62
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.250
wildness glimmered up in him though from time to time he chase after vacuum

63
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.840
cleaners, growl at Bongo drums and suspiciously I the dishwasher,

64
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.830
but he was quiet. Mostly Stoic, a good listener.

65
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.110
My Dad's only friend through long stretches.

66
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.270
My Dad's a guy prone to the nostalgic and swoops of sadness and I'd stumble in

67
00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:16.271
on him on early mornings in tender conversation with Charlie testing ideas out

68
00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:20.300
on him. What do you think? Big Guy. He'd say, what do you think?

69
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.720
I imagined he was very lonely Charlie.

70
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.380
That is lost in a purgatory where he didn't belong.

71
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440
Okay, congratulations. You've made it this far in someone else's pet story.

72
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.903
I promise.

73
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.960
Things are about to change because it shortly after his 13th birthday,

74
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.820
Maureen I think got him a little blue Jean jacket with a sheepskin inside and

75
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:50.320
Levi buttons that Charlie got eaten by a pack of wild coyotes.

76
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.360
Well, let me back up just a step or two, and this all happened on Cape Cod,

77
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
the eastern most tale of Massachusetts where you can find beach goers in the

78
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.510
summer. Kennedys, I think if you know where to look, and very few predators,

79
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.950
a couple hawks, the occasional fox, but other than that,

80
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:14.720
as the local fauna goes, it's pretty much snow white land chipmunks,

81
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.820
bunnies skunks until the coyotes came.

82
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.773
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.710
<v 6>[inaudible] I was about 15 when we first started hearing about them.</v>

84
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.750
And for us east coasters, it made no sense. Coyotes were symbols of the West

85
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.640
<v 3>somewhere far, far away from Massachusetts,</v>

86
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.700
somewhere where the land was orange and wide and open

87
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.940
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

88
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.110
<v 6>so I looked into it and it turns out that for a long time it was that way.</v>

89
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.950
Cody's like

90
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.940
<v 3>big states and cheerful personalities was a strictly western thing.</v>

91
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.960
But in the 1920s people started spotting coyotes in New York.

92
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.890
And by the late fifties they'd made it up to Massachusetts only.

93
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.950
They couldn't quite get out to Cape Cod. See,

94
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.820
Cape Cod is literally cut off from the rest of Massachusetts by a canal that's

95
00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:13.500
almost two football fields wide.

96
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.840
So for decades the coyotes were kept on the mainland until one night.

97
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.280
Sometime in the late seventies a pack of coyotes decided to do with the rest of

98
00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.114
us do

99
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.310
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

100
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.120
<v 3>They gathered up their kids together for a road trip and crossed the bridge</v>

101
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.110
or possibly some speculate swam across the canal.

102
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.310
But I think it's a far better image to picture them as silhouettes walking in

103
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:44.010
single file across the bridge with a big white moon behind them.

104
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.130
<v 4>Woo.</v>

105
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.130
<v 3>So suddenly they were there and they started multiplying more and more sightings</v>

106
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:53.750
of them in backyards and on runners roots.

107
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.400
The local press started running articles, keep your pets in after dark.

108
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.360
A cave was found local. Laura has it with hundreds of collars.

109
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.750
In 1998 a three year old boy was bitten.

110
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.233
<v 5>And then</v>

111
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.240
<v 3>my sister found a goose completely slaughtered down on a dock by the pond.</v>

112
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.830
It was surrounded by a splatter painting of feces strewn so wide.

113
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.470
She deemed it that of terror.

114
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.590
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

115
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.820
<v 3>Now it turns out my family came to Cape Cod right around the same time as the</v>

116
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.570
coyotes in the late seventies my parents bought a cabin in the woods that

117
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:32.010
overlooked a purple marsh.

118
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.280
The cabin had a deck and that's where we spent most of our time.

119
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.690
We'd sit out there late into the night watching birds and stars,

120
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.350
and that's where Charlie was the happiest on the deck.

121
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.980
He pays around occasionally nails scraping the wood,

122
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.680
but mostly he just flopped down with a sigh,

123
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.730
literal human sy and gaze out along with us.

124
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.170
We never needed a fence because he simply never left.

125
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.750
When the coyotes first showed up. I used to like hearing them.

126
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.310
You'd hear it as you lay awake in bed. The how will sometimes far off,

127
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.140
sometimes right up close. It felt thrilling to know that things were happening.

128
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.790
Life cycles and grizzly nature, predators prey right outside the walls.

129
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.940
It used to make me feel like part of the earth,

130
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.410
so here's how it happened. From my perspective,

131
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.640
it's late August. Sun Is Setting. We pull into the driveway,

132
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:35.330
but we don't see Charlie on the deck. Immediately. I knew something was wrong.

133
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.610
My Dad said, no way, everything's fine.

134
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.800
But then we heard a whimper off in the woods.

135
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.370
My mom and sisters and I jumped into action. We called for him,

136
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.300
shown flashlights, Charlie, but the woods had gone quiet

137
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.020
and I remember this part very clearly. We were all standing out on the deck,

138
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.680
craning our necks for something and just as my dad was forming the words,

139
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.030
look, there's nothing to worry about. He'll turn up in the morning.

140
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.990
We heard the Yelp, so Charlie,

141
00:09:07.991 --> 00:09:10.240
that same noise he'd make when you stepped on his tail,

142
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.700
followed immediately by the house. I ran into a closet to hide from the sound

143
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.380
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

144
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.730
<v 3>The next morning there was nothing, not a shred, not a color,</v>

145
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.920
not a bone on a piece of hair.

146
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.720
They say one way the coyotes do it, especially with other dogs,

147
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.350
is that a lone coyote comes up to the dog and starts playing with it.

148
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.610
Eventually they go off together and after just a few paces,

149
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.540
the pack descends or a slight variation.

150
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.950
A coyote pretends to be hurt. It whimpers and cries and calls out for help.

151
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.610
I can only imagine Charlie in that moment.

152
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.620
There he is standing face to face with his past self at long last,

153
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.950
I imagine his head looked up a bit, his chest swelled,

154
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:03.920
his ears perked up and he stepped off the deck.

155
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.840
It's right around then that we would have come home.

156
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.740
He would've heard us roll into the driveway seeing our flashlights heard our

157
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:15.040
calls and for once ignored us.

158
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.780
I wonder how fast it happened. I wonder if he even knew.

159
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.940
I imagine he did.

160
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.070
I imagine he saw the eyes suddenly all at once realizing he was surrounded and

161
00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:30.010
thought I've been had well played.

162
00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:35.011
My brother's well played and I like to imagine a nod of respect on their part

163
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.290
before they descended. The morning after it happened,

164
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.470
we were empty. My Dad couldn't look up.

165
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.210
He kept rearranging chairs around the kitchen table as if some new arrangement

166
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.280
would obscure the empty spot on the floor.

167
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.410
And for so long that's how we experienced it. It was about us,

168
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.950
the family member. We lacked. And then one day,

169
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.100
years later it dawned on my sister that for all the sadness we felt that last

170
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:11.411
moment for Charlie was probably glory for that one moment.

171
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.950
He was wild. He went out like a wild dog.

172
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.980
We were all standing out on the deck when she said it.

173
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.980
And my mom smiled and said, yeah, that's a nice thought.

174
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.540
But then she turned to us, you know,

175
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.670
who's to say they got him.

176
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.413
<v 7>Uh,</v>

177
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.500
<v 3>who's to say he didn't often join the pack.</v>

178
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.130
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

179
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.270
<v 3>well first of all, that was a really sad story. Yeah,</v>

180
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.100
that's Brian Herr our Fox guy from the new normal show. Not too long after Lulu

181
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.830
<v 0>wrote the, uh, Charlie piece, she and our producer,</v>

182
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.930
Soren Wheeler called them up or Charlie. Anyway, um,

183
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.820
just to see what he thought of the story. Well, let me, let me, let me for,

184
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.530
can I, can I put on my totally non emotive scientist hat for the moment? Yeah,

185
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.660
sure. Yeah. Without you being too upset with me.

186
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.920
So let me ask you some skeptical questions. Have you,

187
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.530
have you ever heard of Mark Bekoff [inaudible] he is the coyote expert. Okay.

188
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.720
When he's tried to look for evidence that, um,

189
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.220
coyotes are doing all these horrible things to dogs. Um,

190
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.510
I'm just telling you what the guy argues, uh, that he can't,

191
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.130
he can't find any good evidence that, you know, it's coyotes that are to blame.

192
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.820
Huh? You mean like there's just no evidence that Cody's are even doing this?

193
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.900
Yeah, because first of all, coyote is darn generally pack animals. Um,

194
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.160
they're generally solitary and,

195
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.380
and so now what does travel in packs is feral dogs, you know?

196
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:51.940
But what's odd is that a feral dog wouldn't eat your terrier. Um,

197
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.810
so I, I'm just, I'm flummoxed. I just don't know. I'm not a coyote expert.

198
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.840
So are you, are you saying maybe,

199
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.780
let me just ask you one more question just to be sure. So this is horrible.

200
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.510
But Charlie was actually taken away. Yeah, I mean we didn't,

201
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.350
I mean we never found, there was no color, no bone,

202
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:12.430
no scrap of hair. How sure are you that it was multiple individuals? I mean,

203
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:15.190
did you see tracks or footprints or, no,

204
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:20.140
it was all just on the here on the sonic level it was like at least one,

205
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:24.760
but in my memory it's like five Howells these like,

206
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.250
oh, just crazy, which like yapping and, okay. All right. So,

207
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:33.640
so what that could be is it could be coyote pups. Um,

208
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.950
do you know what time of year it was? It was summer. August. So if they were,

209
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.460
you know, if they were a in the spring and by then they would have been five,

210
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:47.050
six months old. So that makes sense. And what would that mean?

211
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.040
Like with the pups I've done the killing or one? No, no. I think mom,

212
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.470
mom would've done killing. They were,

213
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.450
she somehow signaled to them and then they came and, uh, fed together. Wow.

214
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.120
So can I, so this, this is Soren.

215
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.620
The conversation didn't end here because actually Lou and I started to ask Brian

216
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.150
like, forgetting what killed Charlie or,

217
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.800
or what happened to Charlie, you know, is it,

218
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.390
is it even possible scientifically? Can can a dog,

219
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:21.280
a domestic dog somehow go back to being wild, Kinda like the Fox experiment,

220
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:23.140
but uh, the other way. Yeah.

221
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.320
And that's when he told us about this particular kind of dog,

222
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.640
New Guinea singing dogs, Guinea singing dog. Exactly.

223
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.290
I even have a cool recording of one of their, uh, s, uh, singing songs,

224
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.350
things. And they're, they're basically, um, uh,

225
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.440
short legged dingoes and they live in New Guinea. According to Brian. They,

226
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.380
they used to be just regular old domestic dogs, but a long, long time ago,

227
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.710
they left. Humans somehow started out on their own.

228
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.350
And now we have this very strange animal, which is a bit puzzling.

229
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.870
It's like a dog, but not,

230
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.700
but not quite one hypothesis is that actually they really have evolved such that

231
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.710
they're basically now completely wild.

232
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.900
They reverted back to being afraid of people.

233
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.450
So like what we saw in the foxes in reverse,

234
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:11.510
where aggressiveness or fear comes back. Yeah. So they,

235
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.570
they avoid people kind of like a wolf,

236
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.460
but physically Brian says they look basically like a dog. So that would be,

237
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:23.480
you know, they have the splotchy coat colors and they have a smaller brain,

238
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.460
right. A skeleton and all that kind stuff. Sloppy years.

239
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.550
They actually don't have floppy ears. Interestingly enough.

240
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.570
That's one difference.

241
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.870
There have actually been people who have said that they have slightly longer

242
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:35.330
teeth than most dogs and slightly larger heads,

243
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:37.550
which is also kind of more wolf like.

244
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.150
So there seems to be a couple things that are a little bit more like wolf,

245
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.680
but a lot of things that are still like though, I mean it's all over the place.

246
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.710
It's almost, it's almost like they're in between. Yeah. I mean I can imagine.

247
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.573
I know oddly enough,

248
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.200
Brian says that you can actually kind of hear that typically at night, you know,

249
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:58.460
they will start to chorus as it's called and they'll howl and, and,

250
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.820
and so they'll all huddled together. But it's not a wolf howl.

251
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.740
<v 8>Woo.</v>

252
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.710
<v 0>Cause the wolf howl is actually very low pitched.</v>

253
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.670
Whereas the singing dogs are more high pitch

254
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.990
and it's basically, you know,

255
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.740
what would it sound like if a really small dog was trying to, how like a wolf

256
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.130
there try hard wolves

257
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.560
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

258
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.350
<v 0>like how far these dogs are they,</v>

259
00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:38.550
are they like ballpark three generations that they've been living in the wild?

260
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.220
Are they just one like kicked out the back door?

261
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:44.940
Are they [inaudible] how long did it take for them to, uh, to get like that?

262
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.140
The last estimate I saw was 5,000 years. Oh,

263
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:53.070
5,000 years. So they've been away from humans for 5,000 years.

264
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.480
It's an estimate if they're 5,000 years away from humans.

265
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.850
I feel like what I'm learning from you about the potential to become wild again

266
00:17:02.851 --> 00:17:05.250
is there's there, at least for Charlie as,

267
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.810
as much as I may like to imagine that moment was wild. There is no hope. Yeah.

268
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:14.220
Unfortunately. I think that's what I, I think unfortunately that's the,

269
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.930
that is the case. Yeah. But that doesn't mean that he didn't have the, you know,

270
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.940
the desire to be wild. Yeah. I mean,

271
00:17:20.941 --> 00:17:24.000
I can imagine that a little guy who had been dressed up, uh,

272
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.120
he might've liked it, and especially a carrier. Come on, he's like, bring it on.

273
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.840
Bring it on. Coyotes. Come on, let's go. You know, may,

274
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.340
maybe he was surprised it didn't, it, you know, and it was good to have that,

275
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.820
uh, sort of a one shiny moment.

276
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.213
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

277
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.550
<v 9>thank you to Lulu Willer and our producer soar and wheeler [inaudible] Brian</v>

278
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.570
Hare at Duke University. Yup. And I think that's pretty much it. That's pretty,

279
00:18:08.571 --> 00:18:11.990
that's what we have to say this time. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.

280
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.770
Thanks for listening.
