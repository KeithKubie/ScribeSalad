virus gets over that its encounters the
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.210
virus gets over that its encounters the
innate immunity wall and if it gets over

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
innate immunity wall and if it gets over
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.820
innate immunity wall and if it gets over
that then we have acquired immunity and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
that then we have acquired immunity and
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.760
that then we have acquired immunity and
then if it gets over that then

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
then if it gets over that then
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.890
then if it gets over that then
unfortunately the host is in big trouble

unfortunately the host is in big trouble
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.270
unfortunately the host is in big trouble
so let's start with the innate immune

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
so let's start with the innate immune
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.180
so let's start with the innate immune
responses we're gonna bypass a lot of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
responses we're gonna bypass a lot of
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.210
responses we're gonna bypass a lot of
the intrinsic responses as I said dr.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
the intrinsic responses as I said dr.
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.430
the intrinsic responses as I said dr.
Silverstein will talk about those innate

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
Silverstein will talk about those innate

Silverstein will talk about those innate
immune responses are always active in

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
immune responses are always active in
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390
immune responses are always active in
the host without any exposure to virus

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
the host without any exposure to virus
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.000
the host without any exposure to virus
and they are typically activated very

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
and they are typically activated very
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.210
and they are typically activated very
quickly after infection and it's the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
quickly after infection and it's the
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.130
quickly after infection and it's the
only immune defense available for the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
only immune defense available for the
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080
only immune defense available for the
first few days after an infection so

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
first few days after an infection so
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970
first few days after an infection so
until your adaptive defense is kicking

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
until your adaptive defense is kicking
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.770
until your adaptive defense is kicking
you're at the mercy of your innate

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780
you're at the mercy of your innate
 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.710
you're at the mercy of your innate
system and so it's very very important

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
system and so it's very very important
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.800
system and so it's very very important
the innate response comprises cytokines

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
the innate response comprises cytokines

innate response relies on the
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.370
innate response relies on the
recognition of a foreign pathogen by

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
recognition of a foreign pathogen by
 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.590
recognition of a foreign pathogen by
various patterns and these are molecular

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
various patterns and these are molecular
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.770
various patterns and these are molecular

motifs that are found only in microbes
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.070
motifs that are found only in microbes
and as I said earlier the innate

and as I said earlier the innate
 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080
and as I said earlier the innate
response is able to communicate with the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
response is able to communicate with the
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.330
response is able to communicate with the
adaptive response that it will inform it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340
adaptive response that it will inform it
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460

when replication has exceeded a certain
a certain threshold and the innate

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300
a certain threshold and the innate
 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.810

an important component of the innate
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.970
an important component of the innate

promoter so the point here is that they
 

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.889
promoter so the point here is that they
sense the RNA in the cytoplasm and then

00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:55.899
sense the RNA in the cytoplasm and then
 

00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:57.569
sense the RNA in the cytoplasm and then
the end result is the production of

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:57.579
the end result is the production of
 

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:01.710
the end result is the production of
cytokines and one of those cytokines is

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720

added to another cell would protect them
 

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.940
added to another cell would protect them
from influenza virus infection so they

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:23.950
from influenza virus infection so they
 

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.890
from influenza virus infection so they
said it interfered with infection so

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:25.900
said it interfered with infection so
 

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.780

macrophages and dendritic cells these
 

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.519
macrophages and dendritic cells these
produce alpha beta interferon in

00:13:59.519 --> 00:13:59.529
produce alpha beta interferon in
 

00:13:59.529 --> 00:14:01.860

like nucleic acid they will sense that
 

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.800
like nucleic acid they will sense that
nucleic acid and then they will produce

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:13.810
nucleic acid and then they will produce
 

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.480
nucleic acid and then they will produce
interferon alpha beta so you don't have

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.490
interferon alpha beta so you don't have
 

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.360
interferon alpha beta so you don't have
to infect a cell to produce interferons

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.370
to infect a cell to produce interferons
 

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.760
to infect a cell to produce interferons
the Sentinel cells can make it after

the Sentinel cells can make it after
 

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.300
the Sentinel cells can make it after
sensing the products of a dead cell so

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:24.310
sensing the products of a dead cell so
 

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.650

interferons that is alpha beta is very

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:26.890
interferons that is alpha beta is very
 

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.880
interferons that is alpha beta is very
quick after infection within hours so

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:29.890
quick after infection within hours so
 

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.199
quick after infection within hours so
you have a burst of interferon

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:31.209
you have a burst of interferon
 

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:33.690
you have a burst of interferon
production and then it declines by 10

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:33.700

and alpha so there's one gene for

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.220
and alpha so there's one gene for
 

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.250
and alpha so there's one gene for
interferon beta but for alpha there are

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:41.260
interferon beta but for alpha there are
 

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.590
interferon beta but for alpha there are
many and these seem to be differentially

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600
many and these seem to be differentially
 

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.480
many and these seem to be differentially
expressed in other words different sets

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.490
expressed in other words different sets
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.400
expressed in other words different sets
of alpha genes are expressed depending

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:47.410
of alpha genes are expressed depending
 

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.230
of alpha genes are expressed depending
on the virus so the interferon beta as I

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240
on the virus so the interferon beta as I
 

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.850
on the virus so the interferon beta as I
said is stimulated only for a short

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:53.860
said is stimulated only for a short
 

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.670
said is stimulated only for a short
period of time so by ten hours the

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680
period of time so by ten hours the
 

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.890
period of time so by ten hours the
synthesis of protein declines now these

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:58.900
synthesis of protein declines now these
 

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.829
synthesis of protein declines now these
proteins work on cells that have

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839
proteins work on cells that have
 

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:04.290
proteins work on cells that have
receptors for them so interferon alpha

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:04.300
receptors for them so interferon alpha
 

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.780
receptors for them so interferon alpha
will only affect a cell that has a

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:06.790
will only affect a cell that has a
 

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.670
will only affect a cell that has a
receptor for interferon alpha in fact

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680
receptor for interferon alpha in fact
 

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.800
receptor for interferon alpha in fact
alpha and beta share the same receptor

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:10.810
alpha and beta share the same receptor
 

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.150
alpha and beta share the same receptor
the type 1 interferon receptor what

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160
the type 1 interferon receptor what
 

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.730
the type 1 interferon receptor what
these proteins do is to induce the

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:17.740
these proteins do is to induce the
 

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.250
these proteins do is to induce the
synthesis of still more proteins and

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:20.260
synthesis of still more proteins and
 

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.340
synthesis of still more proteins and
they by doing so they make what we call

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:23.350
they by doing so they make what we call
 

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.250
they by doing so they make what we call
an antiviral state so we say the

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:26.260
an antiviral state so we say the
 

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.990
an antiviral state so we say the
interferon is produced in response to

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000
interferon is produced in response to
 

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.460
interferon is produced in response to
the virus infection and the interferon

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.470
the virus infection and the interferon
 

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.740
the virus infection and the interferon
makes an antiviral state and that

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:31.750
makes an antiviral state and that
 

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.300
makes an antiviral state and that
happens when interferon binds to

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.310
happens when interferon binds to
 

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.019
happens when interferon binds to
receptors on cells and that induces the

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:40.029
receptors on cells and that induces the
 

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:42.060
receptors on cells and that induces the
production over a thousand cell proteins

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.070
production over a thousand cell proteins
 

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.260
production over a thousand cell proteins
which are encoded by genes called

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:45.270
which are encoded by genes called
 

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.800
which are encoded by genes called
interferon stimulated genes or is G's so

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:49.810
interferon stimulated genes or is G's so
 

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.269
interferon stimulated genes or is G's so
the is G's of the genes whose

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279
the is G's of the genes whose
 

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.949
the is G's of the genes whose
transcription is stimulated by

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959
transcription is stimulated by
 

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:56.280
transcription is stimulated by
interferon they in turn or make mRNAs

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.290
interferon they in turn or make mRNAs
 

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.690
interferon they in turn or make mRNAs
that are translated to make all these

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:57.700
that are translated to make all these
 

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.510
that are translated to make all these
proteins so all of these proteins that

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:00.520
proteins so all of these proteins that
 

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.280
proteins so all of these proteins that
are involved in establishing an

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.290
are involved in establishing an
 

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.449
are involved in establishing an
antiviral state most of these we have no

00:17:06.449 --> 00:17:06.459
antiviral state most of these we have no
 

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:09.449
antiviral state most of these we have no
idea how they work these is G's it's

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:09.459
idea how they work these is G's it's
 

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:11.730

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:06.820
involved in a variety of activities that
 

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.390
involved in a variety of activities that
viruses need and this leads to their

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:09.400
viruses need and this leads to their
 

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.320
viruses need and this leads to their
degradation so it's a and they're also

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:13.330
degradation so it's a and they're also
 

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.470
degradation so it's a and they're also
ubiquitin ligases that are a part of

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480
ubiquitin ligases that are a part of
 

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.960
ubiquitin ligases that are a part of
that are also is GS and these are of

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:18.970
that are also is GS and these are of
 

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.360
that are also is GS and these are of
course enzymes that attach ubiquitin to

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
course enzymes that attach ubiquitin to
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.040
course enzymes that attach ubiquitin to
proteins this targets them for

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.050
proteins this targets them for
 

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.160
proteins this targets them for
degradation so the idea being you target

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.170
degradation so the idea being you target
 

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.470
degradation so the idea being you target
viral proteins for degradation and that

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480
viral proteins for degradation and that
 

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.450
viral proteins for degradation and that
include that helps with the antiviral

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:30.460
include that helps with the antiviral
 

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.260
include that helps with the antiviral
response and you can show that these

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:34.270
response and you can show that these
 

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.300
response and you can show that these
have some consequence because you can

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:36.310
have some consequence because you can
 

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.220
have some consequence because you can
add inhibitors of the proteosome so when

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:38.230
add inhibitors of the proteosome so when
 

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.920
add inhibitors of the proteosome so when
you a ubiquitinated protein it targets

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:40.930
you a ubiquitinated protein it targets
 

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.100
you a ubiquitinated protein it targets
it to the proteosome which is a massive

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.110
it to the proteosome which is a massive
 

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.150
it to the proteosome which is a massive
Center in the cell for degrading

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.160
Center in the cell for degrading
 

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.970
Center in the cell for degrading
proteins and if you add inhibitors of

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:47.980
proteins and if you add inhibitors of
 

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.830
proteins and if you add inhibitors of
the proteosome you can show that you

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840
the proteosome you can show that you
 

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.290
the proteosome you can show that you
block the antiviral action of interferon

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:52.300
block the antiviral action of interferon
 

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.290
block the antiviral action of interferon
in this case hepatitis B virus so these

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:55.300
in this case hepatitis B virus so these
 

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.790
in this case hepatitis B virus so these
have antiviral effects and that's why we

00:25:59.790 --> 00:25:59.800
have antiviral effects and that's why we
 

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.190
have antiviral effects and that's why we

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.390
it can help coat virus particles to
facilitate them being taken up and

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400
facilitate them being taken up and
 

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.400
facilitate them being taken up and
destroyed by macrophages or phagocytic

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:50.410
destroyed by macrophages or phagocytic
 

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:54.089
destroyed by macrophages or phagocytic
cells this is called opsonization and it

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:54.099
cells this is called opsonization and it
 

00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:55.349
cells this is called opsonization and it
can solubilize

00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359
can solubilize
 

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:58.950
can solubilize
immune complexes so when you do have an

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960
immune complexes so when you do have an
 

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.930
immune complexes so when you do have an
adaptive immune response you're making a

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:00.940
adaptive immune response you're making a
 

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.760
adaptive immune response you're making a
lot of antibodies against foreign

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:02.770
lot of antibodies against foreign
 

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.970
lot of antibodies against foreign
epitopes when they those antibodies bind

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:05.980
epitopes when they those antibodies bind
 

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.329
epitopes when they those antibodies bind
to foreign proteins they tend to clog

00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:09.339
to foreign proteins they tend to clog
 

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:12.329
to foreign proteins they tend to clog
very small capillaries these are called

00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:12.339
very small capillaries these are called
 

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:14.309
very small capillaries these are called
immune complexes so particularly in your

00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319
immune complexes so particularly in your
 

00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:16.890
immune complexes so particularly in your
kidney and brain very tiny capillaries

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:16.900
kidney and brain very tiny capillaries
 

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.569
kidney and brain very tiny capillaries
which are easily clogged by immune

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:18.579
which are easily clogged by immune
 

00:37:18.579 --> 00:37:21.329
which are easily clogged by immune
complexes so you can get glomerular

00:37:21.329 --> 00:37:21.339
complexes so you can get glomerular
 

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:23.940
complexes so you can get glomerular
nephritis for example an inflammation of

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:23.950
nephritis for example an inflammation of
 

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.200
nephritis for example an inflammation of
the kidney as a consequence of

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:25.210
the kidney as a consequence of
 

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.299
the kidney as a consequence of
complement plays a role in keeping these

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:27.309
complement plays a role in keeping these
 

00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:30.510
complement plays a role in keeping these
apart not letting them aggregate so

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520
apart not letting them aggregate so
 

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.400
apart not letting them aggregate so
here's one example of how complement

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.410
here's one example of how complement
 

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.299
here's one example of how complement
works you can see there are many

00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:33.309
works you can see there are many
 

00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:34.770
works you can see there are many
proteins involved these are all

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:34.780
proteins involved these are all
 

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.950
proteins involved these are all
components of the complement cascade you

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960
components of the complement cascade you
 

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.900
components of the complement cascade you
don't have to know any of them all you

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:39.910
don't have to know any of them all you
 

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.359
don't have to know any of them all you
need to know is what complement does so

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:42.369
need to know is what complement does so
 

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:45.630
need to know is what complement does so
here for example is an example of one of

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640
here for example is an example of one of
 

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.070
here for example is an example of one of
the

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:46.080
the
 

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.370
the
complement components c1q forming a

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.380
complement components c1q forming a
 

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.680
complement components c1q forming a
structure called c1 and this can

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:52.690
structure called c1 and this can
 

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.810
structure called c1 and this can
actually code virus particles and have

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:54.820
actually code virus particles and have
 

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.410
actually code virus particles and have
to have them be taken up by macrophages

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.420
to have them be taken up by macrophages
 

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.720
to have them be taken up by macrophages
c1 can also recognize antibodies bound

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:00.730
c1 can also recognize antibodies bound
 

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.940
c1 can also recognize antibodies bound
on the cell surface so this brown line

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:02.950
on the cell surface so this brown line
 

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.220
on the cell surface so this brown line
is the cell surface so here's a viral

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.230
is the cell surface so here's a viral
 

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.750
is the cell surface so here's a viral
antigen being produced it's a

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760
antigen being produced it's a
 

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.900
antigen being produced it's a
transmembrane protein of some kind

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:08.910
transmembrane protein of some kind
 

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.130
transmembrane protein of some kind
antibodies can recognize it and then

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:11.140
antibodies can recognize it and then
 

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.340
antibodies can recognize it and then
this c1 structure will recognize that

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.350
this c1 structure will recognize that
 

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.050
this c1 structure will recognize that
and then it activates this whole cascade

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.060
and then it activates this whole cascade
 

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.260
and then it activates this whole cascade
that follows here with all these jiggly

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:19.270
that follows here with all these jiggly
 

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.120
that follows here with all these jiggly
red arrows so these are a variety of

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.130
red arrows so these are a variety of
 

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.710
red arrows so these are a variety of
proteins that are made there's a lot of

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720
proteins that are made there's a lot of
 

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.090
proteins that are made there's a lot of
processing going on here these various

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:26.100
processing going on here these various
 

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.000
processing going on here these various
soluble components here C 3 a c 5 c 5 a

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
soluble components here C 3 a c 5 c 5 a
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:32.490
soluble components here C 3 a c 5 c 5 a
these can induce the production of

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:32.500
these can induce the production of
 

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.410
these can induce the production of
cytokines by different cell types so

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:34.420
cytokines by different cell types so
 

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.850
cytokines by different cell types so
that's why they are called mediators of

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:35.860
that's why they are called mediators of
 

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.340
that's why they are called mediators of
inflammation and then finally at the end

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:38.350
inflammation and then finally at the end
 

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.960
inflammation and then finally at the end
of all this you have the formation of a

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:39.970
of all this you have the formation of a
 

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.720
of all this you have the formation of a
pore the membrane attack complex this

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:42.730
pore the membrane attack complex this
 

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.180
pore the membrane attack complex this
pokes a hole in this cell and lysis it

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:45.190
pokes a hole in this cell and lysis it
 

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.730
pokes a hole in this cell and lysis it
so this has all become this is all

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:47.740
so this has all become this is all
 

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.280
so this has all become this is all
stemming from the initial recognition by

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:50.290
stemming from the initial recognition by
 

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.010
stemming from the initial recognition by
c1 of antibody bound to the surface of

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:53.020
c1 of antibody bound to the surface of
 

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.630
c1 of antibody bound to the surface of
the cell that we're not virus infected

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640
the cell that we're not virus infected
 

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.060
the cell that we're not virus infected
the antibody wouldn't be bound here so

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.070
the antibody wouldn't be bound here so
 

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.680
the antibody wouldn't be bound here so
that's why it's specific for virus

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:58.690
that's why it's specific for virus
 

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.850
that's why it's specific for virus
infected cells so that's what we've

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:02.860
infected cells so that's what we've
 

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.500
infected cells so that's what we've
talked about so far the innate defense

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:04.510
talked about so far the innate defense
 

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.740
talked about so far the innate defense
system cytokines the pattern recognition

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:07.750
system cytokines the pattern recognition
 

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.470
system cytokines the pattern recognition
molecules tlrs and RL RS we haven't

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480
molecules tlrs and RL RS we haven't
 

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.090
molecules tlrs and RL RS we haven't
talked about NK cells but they're also

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:12.100
talked about NK cells but they're also
 

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.950
talked about NK cells but they're also
an important component and the

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960
an important component and the
 

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.810
an important component and the
complement system and again they take

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:15.820
complement system and again they take
 

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.640
complement system and again they take
care of most infections very early on

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:17.650
care of most infections very early on
 

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.100
care of most infections very early on
your innate system is often kicking into

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:20.110
your innate system is often kicking into
 

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.230
your innate system is often kicking into
play and it takes care of things without

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240
play and it takes care of things without
 

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.120
play and it takes care of things without
you knowing it

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.130
you knowing it
 

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.340
you knowing it
but sometimes these are breached by

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:26.350
but sometimes these are breached by
 

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.560
but sometimes these are breached by
viruses and then in that case the innate

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:28.570
viruses and then in that case the innate
 

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.530
viruses and then in that case the innate
system has signaled the adaptive system

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:31.540
system has signaled the adaptive system
 

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.450
system has signaled the adaptive system
that it needs help and the adaptive

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:33.460
that it needs help and the adaptive
 

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.100
that it needs help and the adaptive
system can kick in now some of the main

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.110
system can kick in now some of the main
 

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.300
system can kick in now some of the main
products of the innate response are

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.310
products of the innate response are
 

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.750
products of the innate response are
cytokines and we divided them into three

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760
cytokines and we divided them into three
 

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.160
cytokines and we divided them into three
primary classes we have the

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.170
primary classes we have the
 

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.730
primary classes we have the
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as I l1

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:47.740
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as I l1
 

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.480
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as I l1
and TNF these promote the activation of

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:51.490
and TNF these promote the activation of
 

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.030
and TNF these promote the activation of
various white blood cells for example

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040
various white blood cells for example
 

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.280
various white blood cells for example
the T cells in them in the vicinity of

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:56.290
the T cells in them in the vicinity of
 

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.400
the T cells in them in the vicinity of
the dendritic cell and we have other

00:39:59.400 --> 00:39:59.410
the dendritic cell and we have other
 

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.930
the dendritic cell and we have other
cytokines that are anti-inflammatory

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:00.940
cytokines that are anti-inflammatory
 

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.710
cytokines that are anti-inflammatory
their purpose is to balance the activity

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720
their purpose is to balance the activity
 

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.900
their purpose is to balance the activity
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines so

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:06.910
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines so
 

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.029
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines so
once an infection has been taking care

00:40:09.029 --> 00:40:09.039
once an infection has been taking care
 

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.670
once an infection has been taking care
of these return the system to its normal

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680
of these return the system to its normal
 

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.609
of these return the system to its normal
basal state and then there are a variety

00:40:14.609 --> 00:40:14.619
basal state and then there are a variety
 

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:17.640
basal state and then there are a variety
of chemokines whose job it is to a

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:17.650
of chemokines whose job it is to a
 

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.769
of chemokines whose job it is to a
recruit immune cells so if there's an

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:19.779
recruit immune cells so if there's an
 

00:40:19.779 --> 00:40:21.539
recruit immune cells so if there's an
area that's infected chemokines are

00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:21.549
area that's infected chemokines are
 

00:40:21.549 --> 00:40:23.339
area that's infected chemokines are
produced and they recruit additional

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:23.349
produced and they recruit additional
 

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:25.650
produced and they recruit additional
cells to the area to help clear the

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:25.660
cells to the area to help clear the
 

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.339
cells to the area to help clear the
infection so cytokines initially are

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:29.349
infection so cytokines initially are
 

00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:31.410
infection so cytokines initially are
produced locally at a mucosal surface

you're il-1 TNF alpha interferon gamma
they they have effects on the blood

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:31.840
they they have effects on the blood
 

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.290
they they have effects on the blood
vessels so they make the blood vessels

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:34.300
vessels so they make the blood vessels
 

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.840
vessels so they make the blood vessels
more permeable they cause migration of

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:36.850
more permeable they cause migration of
 

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.090
more permeable they cause migration of
macrophages from within the circulation

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.100
macrophages from within the circulation
 

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.670
macrophages from within the circulation
to the infected area so that's how we

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680
to the infected area so that's how we
 

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.160
to the infected area so that's how we
have this orchestration between the

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.170
have this orchestration between the
 

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.570
have this orchestration between the
lymph and the blood system in an

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:45.580
lymph and the blood system in an
 

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.330
lymph and the blood system in an
infected area and again the consequences

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:48.340
infected area and again the consequences
 

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.790
infected area and again the consequences
of all these cytokine releases early on

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800
of all these cytokine releases early on
 

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.180
of all these cytokine releases early on
is inflammation the swelling redness

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:53.190
is inflammation the swelling redness
 

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:59.040
is inflammation the swelling redness
heat and pain inflammation is good for

00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.050
heat and pain inflammation is good for
 

00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.400
heat and pain inflammation is good for
you

00:44:59.400 --> 00:44:59.410
you
 

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.750
you
it stimulates potent immune defenses

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760
it stimulates potent immune defenses
 

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.280
it stimulates potent immune defenses
cytopathic viruses that is viruses that

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:05.290
cytopathic viruses that is viruses that
 

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.830
cytopathic viruses that is viruses that
kill cells they cause inflammation

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:07.840
kill cells they cause inflammation
 

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.920
kill cells they cause inflammation
because they damage the cell so if a

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:10.930
because they damage the cell so if a
 

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.720
because they damage the cell so if a
virus kills a cell you have bits of dead

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:12.730
virus kills a cell you have bits of dead
 

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.849
virus kills a cell you have bits of dead
cell floating around in virus parts and

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:14.859
cell floating around in virus parts and
 

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:16.740
cell floating around in virus parts and
those are picked up by the dendritic

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:16.750
those are picked up by the dendritic
 

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.630
those are picked up by the dendritic
cells and that's good so the dendritic

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640
cells and that's good so the dendritic
 

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.849
cells and that's good so the dendritic
cell can sense that there's an infection

00:45:20.849 --> 00:45:20.859
cell can sense that there's an infection
 

00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:23.010
cell can sense that there's an infection
if the cell isn't being killed it's very

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.020
if the cell isn't being killed it's very
 

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.500
if the cell isn't being killed it's very
hard to sense that it's infected so

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:25.510
hard to sense that it's infected so
 

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.810
hard to sense that it's infected so
that's why inflammation is good it means

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:27.820
that's why inflammation is good it means
 

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.580
that's why inflammation is good it means
that the dendritic cells have sensed

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:29.590
that the dendritic cells have sensed
 

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:30.870
that the dendritic cells have sensed
something foreign they're producing

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880
something foreign they're producing
 

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.710
something foreign they're producing
cytokines and so forth and inflammation

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720
cytokines and so forth and inflammation
 

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.099
cytokines and so forth and inflammation
so inflammation sorry cell that cell and

00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:38.109
so inflammation sorry cell that cell and
 

00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:39.810
so inflammation sorry cell that cell and
tissue damage activates the innate

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:39.820
tissue damage activates the innate
 

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.690
tissue damage activates the innate
response leading to inflammation so

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:42.700
response leading to inflammation so
 

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.359
response leading to inflammation so
viral genomes from cytopathic viruses

00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:45.369
viral genomes from cytopathic viruses
 

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:48.540
viral genomes from cytopathic viruses
typically encode proteins that modulate

to otherwise they would be eliminated by
 

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.510
to otherwise they would be eliminated by
the inflammatory response and in viruses

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520
the inflammatory response and in viruses

herpes viruses pox virus is the viruses

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:00.190
herpes viruses pox virus is the viruses
 

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.400
herpes viruses pox virus is the viruses
with larger DNA genomes that have a lot

proteins that specifically antagonize
innate responses they don't want to be

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:10.810
innate responses they don't want to be
 

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.260
innate responses they don't want to be
sensed they want to replicate some

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:13.270
sensed they want to replicate some
 

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.720
sensed they want to replicate some
viruses don't activate the innate

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:15.730
viruses don't activate the innate
 

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.120
viruses don't activate the innate
response the the adaptive response very

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.130
response the the adaptive response very
 

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.250
response the the adaptive response very
well because they don't stimulate the

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:20.260
well because they don't stimulate the
 

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.590
well because they don't stimulate the
inflammatory response remember you have

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:22.600
inflammatory response remember you have
 

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.930
inflammatory response remember you have
to engage the innate response you get

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:24.940
to engage the innate response you get
 

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.690
to engage the innate response you get
inflammation and then you get engagement

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:27.700
inflammation and then you get engagement
 

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.330
inflammation and then you get engagement
of the adaptive response and some

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:30.340
of the adaptive response and some
 

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.920
of the adaptive response and some
viruses don't do that because they're

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:31.930
viruses don't do that because they're
 

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.680
viruses don't do that because they're
not good at stimulating innate responses

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:34.690
not good at stimulating innate responses
 

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.599
not good at stimulating innate responses
and these are usually viruses that don't

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:36.609
and these are usually viruses that don't
 

00:46:36.609 --> 00:46:39.870
and these are usually viruses that don't
kill cells the non psychopathic viruses

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880
kill cells the non psychopathic viruses
 

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.590
kill cells the non psychopathic viruses
and as I said

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:40.600
and as I said
 

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.730
and as I said
if you don't kill a cell you don't

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:41.740
if you don't kill a cell you don't
 

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.790
if you don't kill a cell you don't
release material that can be picked up

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800
release material that can be picked up
 

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.450
release material that can be picked up
by the dendritic cells so cells are not

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:48.460
by the dendritic cells so cells are not
 

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.910
by the dendritic cells so cells are not
damaged they don't die of infection

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920
damaged they don't die of infection
 

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.620
damaged they don't die of infection
there's no cytopathic effect so you

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:52.630
there's no cytopathic effect so you
 

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.660
there's no cytopathic effect so you
don't have an intrinsic response and you

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:54.670
don't have an intrinsic response and you
 

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:57.150
don't have an intrinsic response and you
don't have a very good innate immune

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160
don't have a very good innate immune
 

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.660
don't have a very good innate immune
response so if you don't have an innate

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:00.670
response so if you don't have an innate
 

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.160
response so if you don't have an innate
immune response you don't have those

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.170
immune response you don't have those
 

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.630
immune response you don't have those
cytokines produced you don't have

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640
cytokines produced you don't have
 

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.940
cytokines produced you don't have
inflammation and you never get to a good

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:05.950
inflammation and you never get to a good
 

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.300
inflammation and you never get to a good
adaptive response so the interaction of

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.310
adaptive response so the interaction of
 

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.000
adaptive response so the interaction of
non cytopathic viruses with the immune

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.010
non cytopathic viruses with the immune
 

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:14.220
non cytopathic viruses with the immune
system is very different from cytopathic

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.230
system is very different from cytopathic
 

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.050
system is very different from cytopathic
viruses because of all this and these

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.060
viruses because of all this and these
 

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.930
viruses because of all this and these
are typically Arina viruses like Lassa

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:18.940
are typically Arina viruses like Lassa
 

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.730
are typically Arina viruses like Lassa
fever virus they don't kill cells

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740
fever virus they don't kill cells
 

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.410
fever virus they don't kill cells
paramyxovirus is like measles viruses

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:25.420
paramyxovirus is like measles viruses
 

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.240
paramyxovirus is like measles viruses
they typically cause persistent

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:27.250
they typically cause persistent
 

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.390
they typically cause persistent
infections because they can't be cleared

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400
infections because they can't be cleared
 

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.860
infections because they can't be cleared
you don't have a good innate response

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:31.870
you don't have a good innate response
 

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.350
you don't have a good innate response
and therefore you cannot clear the

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:34.360
and therefore you cannot clear the
 

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.720
and therefore you cannot clear the
infection clearing an infection requires

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:36.730
infection clearing an infection requires
 

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.600
infection clearing an infection requires
a really good adaptive response so again

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:39.610
a really good adaptive response so again
 

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.340
a really good adaptive response so again
why don't you make a good in a response

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:41.350
why don't you make a good in a response
 

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:42.990
why don't you make a good in a response
because you don't make material that can

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000
because you don't make material that can
 

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.600
because you don't make material that can
be sensed by the dendritic cells

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:45.610
be sensed by the dendritic cells
 

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:49.340
be sensed by the dendritic cells
oh the lessen the inflammatory response

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:49.350
oh the lessen the inflammatory response
 

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.200
oh the lessen the inflammatory response
heat swelling redness pain reflects the

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:52.210
heat swelling redness pain reflects the
 

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.230
heat swelling redness pain reflects the
communication of the innate and adaptive

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240
communication of the innate and adaptive
 

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.180

inflammatory response you're going to
 

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.960
inflammatory response you're going to
have a bad adaptive response and that's

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:00.970
have a bad adaptive response and that's
 

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.820
have a bad adaptive response and that's
because the cytokines aren't produced

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:02.830
because the cytokines aren't produced
 

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.940
because the cytokines aren't produced
that link the two processes together

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:04.950
that link the two processes together
 

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.980
that link the two processes together
this is one reason why we use adjuvant

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:07.990
this is one reason why we use adjuvant
 

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.980
this is one reason why we use adjuvant

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:15.490
talk about vaccines there are there are
 

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.730
talk about vaccines there are there are
many vaccines that are inactivated so

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:17.740
many vaccines that are inactivated so
 

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.400
many vaccines that are inactivated so
they don't infect you and so they don't

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:20.410
they don't infect you and so they don't
 

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.680
they don't infect you and so they don't
kill cells right because they can't get

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:22.690
kill cells right because they can't get
 

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.720
kill cells right because they can't get
in the cell and replicate so they're not

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:24.730
in the cell and replicate so they're not
 

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.300
in the cell and replicate so they're not
sensed very well by the innate response

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:27.310
sensed very well by the innate response
 

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.070
sensed very well by the innate response
and you don't get good inflammation and

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:29.080
and you don't get good inflammation and
 

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.480
and you don't get good inflammation and
if you don't get good inflammation you

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:30.490
if you don't get good inflammation you
 

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.340
if you don't get good inflammation you
don't get a good adaptive response and

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:32.350
don't get a good adaptive response and
 

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.800
don't get a good adaptive response and
if vaccines whole modus operandi says to

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:34.810
if vaccines whole modus operandi says to
 

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.830
if vaccines whole modus operandi says to
make a really good adaptive response so

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:37.840
make a really good adaptive response so
 

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.350
make a really good adaptive response so
sometimes we add adjuvant to these

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:40.360
sometimes we add adjuvant to these
 

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.790
sometimes we add adjuvant to these
vaccines and the purpose of those

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800
vaccines and the purpose of those
 

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.370
vaccines and the purpose of those
adjuvant is to stimulate inflammation

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380
adjuvant is to stimulate inflammation
 

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.870
adjuvant is to stimulate inflammation
because they have materials in them that

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880
because they have materials in them that
 

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.000
because they have materials in them that
are sensed by the innate system and

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.010
are sensed by the innate system and
 

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.540
are sensed by the innate system and
induce these cytokines that you need to

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:50.550
induce these cytokines that you need to
 

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.850
induce these cytokines that you need to
a good adaptive response only a few

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:52.860
a good adaptive response only a few
 

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.100
a good adaptive response only a few
vaccines in the US have adjuvant so far

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.110
vaccines in the US have adjuvant so far
 

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.170
vaccines in the US have adjuvant so far
in Europe they use many more and there's

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180
in Europe they use many more and there's
 

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.580
in Europe they use many more and there's
a lot of opposition to adjuvant but it's

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:01.590
a lot of opposition to adjuvant but it's
 

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:03.800
a lot of opposition to adjuvant but it's
probably not well justified we'll talk

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:03.810
probably not well justified we'll talk
 

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.060
probably not well justified we'll talk
more about that in vaccines so here's a

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.070
more about that in vaccines so here's a
 

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.310
more about that in vaccines so here's a
nice summary so far of what we're

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:10.320
nice summary so far of what we're
 

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.690
nice summary so far of what we're
talking about we're about to move into

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700
talking about we're about to move into
 

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.600
talking about we're about to move into
adaptive responses but let's go back and

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:14.610
adaptive responses but let's go back and
 

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.670
adaptive responses but let's go back and
remember we have a nice mucosal surface

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680
remember we have a nice mucosal surface
 

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.910
remember we have a nice mucosal surface
epithelial cells infected by a virus the

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920
epithelial cells infected by a virus the
 

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.970
epithelial cells infected by a virus the
virus infected cells release if their

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980
virus infected cells release if their
 

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.740
virus infected cells release if their
cells are killed they release products

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:24.750
cells are killed they release products
 

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.120
cells are killed they release products
which are picked up by immature

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:26.130
which are picked up by immature
 

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.040
which are picked up by immature
dendritic cells the in fact the cells

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:28.050
dendritic cells the in fact the cells
 

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.410
dendritic cells the in fact the cells
can also produce cytokines that help

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420
can also produce cytokines that help
 

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.960
can also produce cytokines that help
them the dcs mature because remember the

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:32.970
them the dcs mature because remember the
 

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.240
them the dcs mature because remember the
dcs have receptors for those cytokines

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:35.250
dcs have receptors for those cytokines
 

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.600
dcs have receptors for those cytokines
the dcs mature they go to the lymph node

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:38.610
the dcs mature they go to the lymph node
 

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:42.410
the dcs mature they go to the lymph node
and they present viral peptides on their

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420
and they present viral peptides on their
 

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.690
and they present viral peptides on their
surface to the T cells in the lymph node

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700
surface to the T cells in the lymph node
 

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.420
surface to the T cells in the lymph node
the T cells mature and then those go out

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:47.430
the T cells mature and then those go out
 

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:49.600
the T cells mature and then those go out
into the circulation as well as

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:49.610
into the circulation as well as
 

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.990
into the circulation as well as
antibodies produced by b-cells

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000
antibodies produced by b-cells
 

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.390
antibodies produced by b-cells
so here is our one slide summary of the

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400
so here is our one slide summary of the
 

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.000
so here is our one slide summary of the
adaptive response which probably

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.010
adaptive response which probably
 

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:03.380
adaptive response which probably

into a vertebrate you have a humoral

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560
into a vertebrate you have a humoral
 

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.560
into a vertebrate you have a humoral
response and a cell mediated response

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:15.570
response and a cell mediated response
 

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.960
response and a cell mediated response
the humoral response of course is the

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:17.970
the humoral response of course is the
 

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.030
the humoral response of course is the
production of antibodies by activated

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040
production of antibodies by activated
 

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:20.710
production of antibodies by activated
b-cells

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.610
b-cells
these antibodies can combine directly

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:25.620
these antibodies can combine directly
 

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.350
these antibodies can combine directly
with virus particles and render them

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:27.360
with virus particles and render them
 

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.050
with virus particles and render them
non-infectious so the antibody is is

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060
non-infectious so the antibody is is
 

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.020
non-infectious so the antibody is is
important for preventing infection but

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.030
important for preventing infection but
 

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.360
important for preventing infection but
if you are already infected an antibody

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:38.370
if you are already infected an antibody
 

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:41.060
if you are already infected an antibody
has less of an importance it's good if

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:41.070
has less of an importance it's good if
 

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:42.440
has less of an importance it's good if
you already have the antibodies and

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:42.450
you already have the antibodies and
 

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.610
you already have the antibodies and
you're in fact it will prevent you from

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:43.620
you're in fact it will prevent you from
 

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.160
you're in fact it will prevent you from
being infected but when you are infected

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:46.170
being infected but when you are infected
 

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:49.160
being infected but when you are infected
for the first time by a virus it takes

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.170
for the first time by a virus it takes
 

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:51.500
for the first time by a virus it takes
two weeks or more to make antibodies and

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:51.510
two weeks or more to make antibodies and
 

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.720
two weeks or more to make antibodies and
so they don't really have a lot of role

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:53.730
so they don't really have a lot of role
 

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.540
so they don't really have a lot of role
in in your recovery what is important

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:56.550
in in your recovery what is important
 

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.460
in in your recovery what is important
for recovering from a virus infection is

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:58.470
for recovering from a virus infection is
 

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.680
for recovering from a virus infection is
the cell mediated response shown on the

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:00.690
the cell mediated response shown on the
 

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:04.160
the cell mediated response shown on the
right and that consists of of course

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.170
right and that consists of of course
 

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:08.480
right and that consists of of course
helper cells or cytotoxic t-lymphocytes

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:08.490
helper cells or cytotoxic t-lymphocytes
 

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.870
helper cells or cytotoxic t-lymphocytes
so these proceed from immature cells in

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880
so these proceed from immature cells in
 

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.160
so these proceed from immature cells in
the bone marrow they go to the thymus

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:13.170
the bone marrow they go to the thymus
 

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.950
the bone marrow they go to the thymus
and then finally the lymph node and of

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960
and then finally the lymph node and of
 

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.780
and then finally the lymph node and of
course there they can be activated by

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:17.790
course there they can be activated by
 

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.030
course there they can be activated by
dendritic cells which say look I have

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040
dendritic cells which say look I have
 

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.039
dendritic cells which say look I have
some antigen and if it's a foreign

00:51:22.039 --> 00:51:22.049
some antigen and if it's a foreign
 

00:51:22.049 --> 00:51:25.010
some antigen and if it's a foreign
antigen these cells were mature so the T

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020
antigen these cells were mature so the T
 

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.109
antigen these cells were mature so the T
helper cells the cd4 cells produce

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119
helper cells the cd4 cells produce
 

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:30.230
helper cells the cd4 cells produce
cytokines that's their main role they

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240
cytokines that's their main role they
 

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.640
cytokines that's their main role they
produce cytokines depending on the

produce cytokines depending on the
 

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.190
produce cytokines depending on the
subtype that either help b-cells mature

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200
subtype that either help b-cells mature
 

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.809
subtype that either help b-cells mature
to make antibodies or they make

00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819
to make antibodies or they make
 

00:51:35.819 --> 00:51:39.079
to make antibodies or they make
cytokines that help cd8 cells mature

00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:39.089
cytokines that help cd8 cells mature
 

00:51:39.089 --> 00:51:43.309
cytokines that help cd8 cells mature
into cytotoxic T cells so the th the cd4

00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319
into cytotoxic T cells so the th the cd4
 

00:51:43.319 --> 00:51:48.079
into cytotoxic T cells so the th the cd4
th cells have a maturing role that CTL

th cells have a maturing role that CTL
 

00:51:48.089 --> 00:51:51.140
th cells have a maturing role that CTL
is of course kill infected cells they

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.150
is of course kill infected cells they
 

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.260
is of course kill infected cells they
recognize when a cell is infected and

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:54.270
recognize when a cell is infected and
 

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.690
recognize when a cell is infected and
they kill it the idea being we're going

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700
they kill it the idea being we're going
 

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.670
they kill it the idea being we're going
to stop any more virus replication of

00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680
to stop any more virus replication of
 

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.770
to stop any more virus replication of
course that damages cells and it is a

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780
course that damages cells and it is a
 

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.260
course that damages cells and it is a
component of the pathology of infection

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:03.270
component of the pathology of infection
 

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.470
component of the pathology of infection
but it does limit infection in fact CT

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480
but it does limit infection in fact CT

ELLs are crucial for recovery for most
 

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.370
ELLs are crucial for recovery for most
virus infections so if you want to

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380
virus infections so if you want to
 

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.440
virus infections so if you want to
eradicate infected cells and virus

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.450
eradicate infected cells and virus
 

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.349
eradicate infected cells and virus
particles you need an adaptive response

00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359
particles you need an adaptive response
 

00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:20.240
particles you need an adaptive response
you have to clear the infection and a

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:20.250
you have to clear the infection and a
 

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.609
you have to clear the infection and a
response cannot clear an infection once

00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619
response cannot clear an infection once
 

00:52:22.619 --> 00:52:26.240
response cannot clear an infection once
it gets beyond a certain stage the

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:26.250
it gets beyond a certain stage the
 

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.069
it gets beyond a certain stage the
effectives are antibodies as we've said

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079
effectives are antibodies as we've said
 

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:31.490
effectives are antibodies as we've said
that bind viruses and decrease the

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500
that bind viruses and decrease the
 

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.780
that bind viruses and decrease the
number of infected cells and if you

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:32.790
number of infected cells and if you
 

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:33.920
number of infected cells and if you
remember they can also work with

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:33.930
remember they can also work with
 

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:35.510
remember they can also work with
complements so if you have an antibody

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520
complements so if you have an antibody
 

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.609
complements so if you have an antibody
against the viral protein that's on the

00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619
against the viral protein that's on the
 

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:39.859

cells will recognize infected cells and
 

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.500
cells will recognize infected cells and
of course they respond to viral antigens

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:48.510
of course they respond to viral antigens
 

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.569

first place they kill virus infected

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720
first place they kill virus infected
 

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.809
first place they kill virus infected
cells and as I said the helper T cells

00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819
cells and as I said the helper T cells
 

00:52:56.819 --> 00:52:59.720
cells and as I said the helper T cells
make cytokines to either aid in antibody

00:52:59.720 --> 00:52:59.730

as a means of evading adaptive responses

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:48.980
as a means of evading adaptive responses
 

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.310
as a means of evading adaptive responses
so you can find out more of that about

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:51.320
so you can find out more of that about
 

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.339
so you can find out more of that about
that in Chapter four let's talk a little

00:53:54.339 --> 00:53:54.349
that in Chapter four let's talk a little
 

00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:56.440
that in Chapter four let's talk a little
bit about antibodies that are made by

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.450
bit about antibodies that are made by
 

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.839
bit about antibodies that are made by
the adaptive response as I said these

00:53:58.839 --> 00:53:58.849
the adaptive response as I said these
 

00:53:58.849 --> 00:54:00.790
the adaptive response as I said these
are essential in the defense against

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800
are essential in the defense against
 

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.010
are essential in the defense against
many infections when you get vaccinated

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020
many infections when you get vaccinated
 

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.500
many infections when you get vaccinated
the reason that you are protected is

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:05.510
the reason that you are protected is
 

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.630
the reason that you are protected is
because you make antibodies against the

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640
because you make antibodies against the
 

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.140
because you make antibodies against the
particular virus these do what we call

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:11.150
particular virus these do what we call
 

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:13.270
particular virus these do what we call
neutralize virus particles in the blood

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280
neutralize virus particles in the blood
 

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.950
neutralize virus particles in the blood
so if the virus is spreading in your

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960
so if the virus is spreading in your
 

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.950
so if the virus is spreading in your
blood you make antibodies the virus the

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960
blood you make antibodies the virus the
 

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.630
blood you make antibodies the virus the
antibodies will combine with the virus

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640
antibodies will combine with the virus
 

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.160
antibodies will combine with the virus
and that will block them from infecting

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.170
and that will block them from infecting
 

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.920
and that will block them from infecting
new cells they're also antibodies made

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:23.930
new cells they're also antibodies made
 

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.839
new cells they're also antibodies made
at mucosal surfaces the so called

00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:25.849
at mucosal surfaces the so called
 

00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:28.089
at mucosal surfaces the so called
secretory antibodies so if you have a

00:54:28.089 --> 00:54:28.099
secretory antibodies so if you have a
 

00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:30.670
secretory antibodies so if you have a
respiratory virus infection these can

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680
respiratory virus infection these can
 

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.410
respiratory virus infection these can
bind the virus before it can even in

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:32.420
bind the virus before it can even in
 

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.690
bind the virus before it can even in
fact your mucosal epithelium that's what

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:37.700
fact your mucosal epithelium that's what
 

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.290

I said right there and some even though

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:41.300
I said right there and some even though
 

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:45.280
I said right there and some even though
I told you that in general neutralizing

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:45.290
I told you that in general neutralizing
 

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.930
I told you that in general neutralizing
antibodies protect you there are some

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:46.940
antibodies protect you there are some
 

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.630
antibodies protect you there are some
examples where they're important for

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640
examples where they're important for
 

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.329
examples where they're important for
recovery from infection so nothing is

00:54:52.329 --> 00:54:52.339
recovery from infection so nothing is
 

00:54:52.339 --> 00:54:55.270
recovery from infection so nothing is
ever absolute in science there's nothing

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280
ever absolute in science there's nothing
 

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.650
ever absolute in science there's nothing
is ever black and white there are always

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:56.660
is ever black and white there are always
 

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:00.490
is ever black and white there are always
exceptions so if I say to you antibodies

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:00.500
exceptions so if I say to you antibodies
 

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.310
exceptions so if I say to you antibodies
are typically needed for protection

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:03.320
are typically needed for protection
 

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.300
are typically needed for protection
that's true but there are always

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:04.310
that's true but there are always
 

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.070
that's true but there are always
exceptions so there's some examples

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:06.080
exceptions so there's some examples
 

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.700
exceptions so there's some examples
where antibodies are needed for recovery

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:08.710
where antibodies are needed for recovery
 

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:11.829
where antibodies are needed for recovery
so here's an experiment which shows that

00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839
so here's an experiment which shows that
 

00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:13.810
so here's an experiment which shows that
antibody protects against polio

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:13.820
antibody protects against polio
 

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.829
antibody protects against polio
infection

00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839
infection
 

00:55:14.839 --> 00:55:17.680
infection
this is a passive antibody so you

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:17.690
this is a passive antibody so you
 

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.660
this is a passive antibody so you
remember we talked about passive Vyra

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:19.670
remember we talked about passive Vyra
 

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.050
remember we talked about passive Vyra
Mia a while ago passive Irena is when

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:23.060
Mia a while ago passive Irena is when
 

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.390
Mia a while ago passive Irena is when
you inject virus into an animal the

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400
you inject virus into an animal the
 

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.250
you inject virus into an animal the
virus that first appears in the blood

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:27.260
virus that first appears in the blood
 

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.530
virus that first appears in the blood
say is passive by Rima because it's not

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:29.540
say is passive by Rima because it's not
 

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.510
say is passive by Rima because it's not
resulting from replication so these are

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520
resulting from replication so these are
 

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:31.870
resulting from replication so these are
in a

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880
in a
 

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.720
in a
that you inject they're not produced by

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:34.730
that you inject they're not produced by
 

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.730
that you inject they're not produced by
the animal they're just simply

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:36.740
the animal they're just simply
 

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.610
the animal they're just simply
antibodies you've injected so in this

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:38.620
antibodies you've injected so in this
 

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.700
antibodies you've injected so in this
experiment animals have been inoculated

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:42.710
experiment animals have been inoculated
 

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:46.330
experiment animals have been inoculated
with increasing amounts of antibodies so

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:46.340
with increasing amounts of antibodies so
 

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.640
with increasing amounts of antibodies so
the bigger number more antibody here's a

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:48.650
the bigger number more antibody here's a
 

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:51.130
the bigger number more antibody here's a
control animal with no antibody and then

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:51.140
control animal with no antibody and then
 

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.080
control animal with no antibody and then
they're infected with poliovirus so this

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:53.090
they're infected with poliovirus so this
 

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:57.040
they're infected with poliovirus so this
is percent paralyzed so almost all the

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.050
is percent paralyzed so almost all the
 

00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:00.130
is percent paralyzed so almost all the
animals are paralyzed when you inject

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:00.140
animals are paralyzed when you inject
 

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.290
animals are paralyzed when you inject
them and there's no antibodies given and

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:02.300
them and there's no antibodies given and
 

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.910
them and there's no antibodies given and
then as you increase the amount of

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920
then as you increase the amount of
 

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.890

the viruses to cells if you have enough
 

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.670
the viruses to cells if you have enough
binding in the right places you will

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680
binding in the right places you will
 

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.290
binding in the right places you will
block attachment of the virus and

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:14.300
block attachment of the virus and
 

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.950
block attachment of the virus and
thereby block its infectivity so that is

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960
thereby block its infectivity so that is
 

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.960
thereby block its infectivity so that is
blocking before infection begins you can

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:19.970
blocking before infection begins you can
 

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.480
blocking before infection begins you can
also block later on you can have the

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:22.490
also block later on you can have the
 

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.400
also block later on you can have the
antibodies binding to the virus the

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:24.410
antibodies binding to the virus the
 

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.410
antibodies binding to the virus the
virus is still taken up into an endosome

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:26.420
virus is still taken up into an endosome
 

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.810
virus is still taken up into an endosome
but uncoding is blocked so there are

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:28.820
but uncoding is blocked so there are
 

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.910
but uncoding is blocked so there are
examples of antibodies that do this so

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920
examples of antibodies that do this so
 

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.230
examples of antibodies that do this so
the particle gets all the way into the

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240
the particle gets all the way into the
 

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.780
the particle gets all the way into the
cell but then when the pH drops the

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:34.790
cell but then when the pH drops the
 

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.820
cell but then when the pH drops the
antibodies prevent the changes in the

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:36.830
antibodies prevent the changes in the
 

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.620
antibodies prevent the changes in the

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:38.630
particle that are needed to get the RNA
 

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:43.000
particle that are needed to get the RNA
out and finally you have antibodies that

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.010
out and finally you have antibodies that
 

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.280
out and finally you have antibodies that
aggregate viruses so that they're so

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:45.290
aggregate viruses so that they're so
 

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:46.080
aggregate viruses so that they're so
large

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.090
large
 

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.250
large
aggregates are so big they cannot be

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:48.260
aggregates are so big they cannot be
 

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.800
aggregates are so big they cannot be
taken up into the cells so three

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:50.810
taken up into the cells so three
 

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.260
taken up into the cells so three
different mechanisms of neutralization

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:53.270
different mechanisms of neutralization
 

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.360
different mechanisms of neutralization
this is how antibodies block infectivity

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:55.370
this is how antibodies block infectivity
 

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:58.420
this is how antibodies block infectivity
in various parts of you either your

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:58.430
in various parts of you either your
 

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:02.110
in various parts of you either your
blood or at mucosal surfaces so what are

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:02.120
blood or at mucosal surfaces so what are
 

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:07.150
blood or at mucosal surfaces so what are
these antibodies recognizing when when

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160
these antibodies recognizing when when
 

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.680
these antibodies recognizing when when
antibodies are made of course they're

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:08.690
antibodies are made of course they're
 

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:11.410
antibodies are made of course they're
made against viruses that are broken up

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:11.420
made against viruses that are broken up
 

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.530
made against viruses that are broken up
by antigen presenting cells the peptides

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:14.540
by antigen presenting cells the peptides
 

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.300
by antigen presenting cells the peptides
are presented to b-cells

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:16.310
are presented to b-cells
 

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:18.280
are presented to b-cells
so you make antibodies against all the

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:18.290
so you make antibodies against all the
 

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.980
so you make antibodies against all the
possible peptides of a virus but the

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:20.990
possible peptides of a virus but the
 

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.330
possible peptides of a virus but the
ones that are important for us are the

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:22.340
ones that are important for us are the
 

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:24.130
ones that are important for us are the
antibodies that bind at the surface and

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:24.140
antibodies that bind at the surface and
 

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.350
antibodies that bind at the surface and
can block infection and these are two

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:26.360
can block infection and these are two
 

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.470
can block infection and these are two
examples of the epitopes recognized by

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480
examples of the epitopes recognized by
 

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.940
examples of the epitopes recognized by
these antibodies so an epitope is a

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:30.950
these antibodies so an epitope is a
 

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:33.250
these antibodies so an epitope is a
short amino acid sequence that is

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:33.260
short amino acid sequence that is
 

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.400
short amino acid sequence that is
recognized by an antibody and all viral

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:36.410
recognized by an antibody and all viral
 

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:39.310
recognized by an antibody and all viral
proteins have epitopes in them but the

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:39.320
proteins have epitopes in them but the
 

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.110
proteins have epitopes in them but the
ones that we care about in this

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:41.120
ones that we care about in this
 

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.330
ones that we care about in this
discussion are the neutralizing epitopes

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:43.340
discussion are the neutralizing epitopes
 

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.700
discussion are the neutralizing epitopes
that is the ones where an antibody will

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:45.710
that is the ones where an antibody will
 

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:48.310
that is the ones where an antibody will
bind and block infection so that's what

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:48.320
bind and block infection so that's what
 

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.160
bind and block infection so that's what
we're showing here here on the left is a

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:50.170
we're showing here here on the left is a
 

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.290
we're showing here here on the left is a
structure of Rhino virus and we're

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:53.300
structure of Rhino virus and we're
 

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.690
structure of Rhino virus and we're
showing in the lighter colors some of

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:55.700
showing in the lighter colors some of
 

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.480
showing in the lighter colors some of
the neutralizing epitopes that is these

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:58.490
the neutralizing epitopes that is these
 

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.060
the neutralizing epitopes that is these
are short sequences to which antibodies

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:01.070
are short sequences to which antibodies
 

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.970
are short sequences to which antibodies
will bind and block infection so these

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:03.980
will bind and block infection so these
 

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.470
will bind and block infection so these
are on the surface of the particle and

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480
are on the surface of the particle and
 

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.000
are on the surface of the particle and
they're in very specific places you can

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.010
they're in very specific places you can
 

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:09.400
they're in very specific places you can
see not every sequence isn't as a

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:09.410
see not every sequence isn't as a
 

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:12.010
see not every sequence isn't as a
neutralizing epitope so that's for a

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:12.020
neutralizing epitope so that's for a
 

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.100
neutralizing epitope so that's for a

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440
gluten these are all mainly located at
 

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.710
gluten these are all mainly located at
the distal tip of the hemagglutinin so

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720
the distal tip of the hemagglutinin so
 

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.360
the distal tip of the hemagglutinin so
the receptor binding area is right up

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:43.370
the receptor binding area is right up
 

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.670
the receptor binding area is right up
here and these colored areas are all

here and these colored areas are all
 

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.220
here and these colored areas are all
neutralizing epitopes so antibodies

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:48.230
neutralizing epitopes so antibodies
 

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.230
neutralizing epitopes so antibodies
would bind to these portions of the H a

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240
would bind to these portions of the H a
 

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.410
would bind to these portions of the H a
and thereby block either attachment or

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:53.420
and thereby block either attachment or
 

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.620
and thereby block either attachment or

it's because these epitopes mutate every

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:02.780
it's because these epitopes mutate every
 

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.110
it's because these epitopes mutate every
year you have amino acid changes in

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:05.120
year you have amino acid changes in
 

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.390
year you have amino acid changes in
these neutralizing epitopes so the

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400
these neutralizing epitopes so the
 

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.130
these neutralizing epitopes so the
antibodies that you make one season

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.140
antibodies that you make one season
 

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.740
antibodies that you make one season
against influenza virus that neutralize

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:11.750
against influenza virus that neutralize
 

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.980
against influenza virus that neutralize
that virus very well the next year will

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:14.990
that virus very well the next year will
 

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.230
that virus very well the next year will
not neutralize it even just one or two

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240
not neutralize it even just one or two
 

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.940
not neutralize it even just one or two
amino acid changes in one of these

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:18.950
amino acid changes in one of these
 

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.710
amino acid changes in one of these
epitopes will make the antibodies

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720
epitopes will make the antibodies
 

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.130
epitopes will make the antibodies
ineffective and that's why with time we

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:24.140
ineffective and that's why with time we
 

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.660
ineffective and that's why with time we
have to be immunized against the new

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:25.670
have to be immunized against the new

right so those are neutralizing

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:30.410
right so those are neutralizing
 

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.620
right so those are neutralizing
antibodies and the epitopes that they

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:32.630
antibodies and the epitopes that they
 

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.870
antibodies and the epitopes that they
recognize now cell mediated immunity as

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880
recognize now cell mediated immunity as

I've said is essential for clearing most
virus infected most virus infections and

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:41.210
virus infected most virus infections and
 

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.980
virus infected most virus infections and
this is what we call the th1 response

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:43.990
this is what we call the th1 response
 

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:48.400
this is what we call the th1 response
the it is generated by a synapse form

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:48.410
the it is generated by a synapse form
 

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.070
the it is generated by a synapse form
between the cytotoxic t-lymphocytes and

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:51.080
between the cytotoxic t-lymphocytes and
 

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.710
between the cytotoxic t-lymphocytes and
the target cells that are infected with

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720
the target cells that are infected with
 

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.040
the target cells that are infected with
viruses and the CTL is bind to the

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.050
viruses and the CTL is bind to the
 

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.750
viruses and the CTL is bind to the
target cell they recognize foreign

01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760

antigen on the surface of the targets of
 

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.300
antigen on the surface of the targets of
the infected cell and they lyse them and

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:04.310
the infected cell and they lyse them and
 

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:06.130
the infected cell and they lyse them and
there are two ways that the CTL is lice

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:06.140
there are two ways that the CTL is lice
 

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.370
there are two ways that the CTL is lice
them one they transfer granules to the

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:09.380
them one they transfer granules to the
 

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.620
them one they transfer granules to the
target cell that have these these

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:11.630
target cell that have these these
 

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:14.350
target cell that have these these
proteins perforin and granzymes and they

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:14.360
proteins perforin and granzymes and they
 

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.390
proteins perforin and granzymes and they
poke holes in the target cell

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400
poke holes in the target cell
 

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.300
poke holes in the target cell
effectively licen it and also they can

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:19.310
effectively licen it and also they can
 

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:22.630
effectively licen it and also they can
induce apoptosis so the engagement of

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640
induce apoptosis so the engagement of
 

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.140
induce apoptosis so the engagement of
the CTL with an infected target cell can

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.150
the CTL with an infected target cell can
 

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.270
the CTL with an infected target cell can
turn on a pop tonic pathways which will

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280
turn on a pop tonic pathways which will
 

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.980
turn on a pop tonic pathways which will
also cause the target cell to die so

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:32.990
also cause the target cell to die so
 

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.170
also cause the target cell to die so
here is an experiment where we look at

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:35.180
here is an experiment where we look at
 

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.110
here is an experiment where we look at
the role of antibodies versus cell

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:38.120
the role of antibodies versus cell
 

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.140
the role of antibodies versus cell
mediated immunity in protecting monkeys

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:41.150
mediated immunity in protecting monkeys
 

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.530
mediated immunity in protecting monkeys
against monkey pox infection so what we

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:44.540
against monkey pox infection so what we
 

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.440
against monkey pox infection so what we
have done here is we have immunized

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:46.450
have done here is we have immunized
 

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:52.330
have done here is we have immunized
these animals at day 0 and then we have

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:52.340
these animals at day 0 and then we have
 

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.370
these animals at day 0 and then we have
done something to the immune system here

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:54.380
done something to the immune system here
 

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.670
done something to the immune system here
either nothing the control or we deplete

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680
either nothing the control or we deplete
 

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.180
either nothing the control or we deplete
the B cells or the cd8 cells which are

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.190
the B cells or the cd8 cells which are
 

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.360
the B cells or the cd8 cells which are
the CTLs the cytotoxic T cells so the B

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:04.370
the CTLs the cytotoxic T cells so the B
 

01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.280
the CTLs the cytotoxic T cells so the B
cells of course making antibodies the

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:06.290
cells of course making antibodies the
 

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.590
cells of course making antibodies the
CTL is the cellular response so we're

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:08.600
CTL is the cellular response so we're
 

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.030
CTL is the cellular response so we're
going to tell which one is important

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040
going to tell which one is important
 

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.210
going to tell which one is important
so in these animals vaccinated day zero

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220
so in these animals vaccinated day zero
 

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.880
so in these animals vaccinated day zero
and no manipulation they make a nice

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:16.890
and no manipulation they make a nice
 

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:19.730
and no manipulation they make a nice
antibody response on day 22 if you take

01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740
antibody response on day 22 if you take
 

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.520
antibody response on day 22 if you take
away the b-cells the antibody response

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:22.530
away the b-cells the antibody response
 

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.190
away the b-cells the antibody response
is dampened so this is antibody titer

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200
is dampened so this is antibody titer
 

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.590
is dampened so this is antibody titer
it's neutralizing titer so the larger

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:27.600
it's neutralizing titer so the larger
 

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.160
it's neutralizing titer so the larger
number is better and the ones depleted

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:31.170
number is better and the ones depleted
 

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:34.100
number is better and the ones depleted
of cd8 have slightly reduced but not a

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:34.110
of cd8 have slightly reduced but not a
 

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.230
of cd8 have slightly reduced but not a
bad antibody response then we infect

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240
bad antibody response then we infect
 

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.350
bad antibody response then we infect
these animals with monkey pox on day 28

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:39.360
these animals with monkey pox on day 28
 

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.880
these animals with monkey pox on day 28
and we look at fatal infection and high

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:43.890
and we look at fatal infection and high
 

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.430
and we look at fatal infection and high
tide or replication so here these

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440
tide or replication so here these
 

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.110
tide or replication so here these
animals who were immunized and not

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:48.120
animals who were immunized and not
 

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.390
animals who were immunized and not
manipulated are all protected from

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400
manipulated are all protected from
 

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.600
manipulated are all protected from
lethal infection if we take away the

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:53.610
lethal infection if we take away the
 

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:54.230
lethal infection if we take away the
b-cells

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240
b-cells
 

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.020
b-cells
three out of the four animals die if we

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.030
three out of the four animals die if we
 

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:59.960
three out of the four animals die if we
take away the t-cells the animals are

01:02:59.960 --> 01:02:59.970
take away the t-cells the animals are
 

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:02.450
take away the t-cells the animals are
fine so here you can see if you have

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460
fine so here you can see if you have
 

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.160
fine so here you can see if you have
antibodies ahead of time you're

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:04.170
antibodies ahead of time you're
 

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.320
antibodies ahead of time you're
protected from infection it doesn't

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:06.330
protected from infection it doesn't
 

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.600
protected from infection it doesn't
matter if you have t-cells the

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:08.610
matter if you have t-cells the
 

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:11.890
matter if you have t-cells the
antibodies are really what's important

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:11.900
antibodies are really what's important
 

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.750
antibodies are really what's important
but sometimes both antibody and cell

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760
but sometimes both antibody and cell
 

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.550
but sometimes both antibody and cell
responses can play a role so here's

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:16.560
responses can play a role so here's
 

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.770
responses can play a role so here's
another experiment to show you that

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780
another experiment to show you that
 

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.650
another experiment to show you that
we're looking at a virus replication on

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660
we're looking at a virus replication on
 

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.950
we're looking at a virus replication on
the y axis either by RNA or plaque

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960
the y axis either by RNA or plaque
 

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.430
the y axis either by RNA or plaque
forming units here and we have animals

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440
forming units here and we have animals
 

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.290
forming units here and we have animals
who are infected they're all infected at

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:30.300
who are infected they're all infected at
 

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.600
who are infected they're all infected at
day zero and we have a control group

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:32.610
day zero and we have a control group
 

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.180
day zero and we have a control group
here in the open in the closed circles

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:35.190
here in the open in the closed circles
 

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:37.220
here in the open in the closed circles
and here's the titer of virus in the

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:37.230
and here's the titer of virus in the
 

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.620
and here's the titer of virus in the
serum it goes up and then then the

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:39.630
serum it goes up and then then the
 

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:42.170
serum it goes up and then then the
titers go down and about 30 percent of

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.180
titers go down and about 30 percent of
 

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.520
titers go down and about 30 percent of
the animals die if you deplete

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:43.530
the animals die if you deplete
 

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.530
the animals die if you deplete
antibodies from these animals they all

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540
antibodies from these animals they all
 

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.780
antibodies from these animals they all
die and the virus cannot be controlled

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:47.790
die and the virus cannot be controlled
 

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:51.140
die and the virus cannot be controlled
so in the normally unmanipulated animals

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:51.150
so in the normally unmanipulated animals
 

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:52.850
so in the normally unmanipulated animals
they eventually control the ones who

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:52.860
they eventually control the ones who
 

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.460
they eventually control the ones who
survive control virus infection but if

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:55.470
survive control virus infection but if
 

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.900
survive control virus infection but if
you take away antibodies they cannot

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:56.910
you take away antibodies they cannot
 

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.090
you take away antibodies they cannot
clear the infection so that shows that

01:03:59.090 --> 01:03:59.100
clear the infection so that shows that
 

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.820
clear the infection so that shows that
antibody is also important in this case

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:01.830
antibody is also important in this case
 

01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.070
antibody is also important in this case
if you deplete cd8 cells you have 85%

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:04.080
if you deplete cd8 cells you have 85%
 

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.470
if you deplete cd8 cells you have 85%
death a little more death than the

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480
death a little more death than the
 

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.570

at controlling the levels of virus

01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880
at controlling the levels of virus
 

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.730
at controlling the levels of virus
presumably because they have antibodies

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740
presumably because they have antibodies
 

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.190
presumably because they have antibodies
so that's in the serum in the spleen you

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200
so that's in the serum in the spleen you
 

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.410
so that's in the serum in the spleen you
can see the control group has a similar

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420
can see the control group has a similar
 

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.870
can see the control group has a similar
pattern of virus production but if you

01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880
pattern of virus production but if you
 

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.320
pattern of virus production but if you
take away either antibodies or cd8 cells

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:23.330
take away either antibodies or cd8 cells
 

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:24.590
take away either antibodies or cd8 cells
these

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:24.600
these
 

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.360

the virus and the spleen cannot be

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:26.370
the virus and the spleen cannot be
 

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:31.010
the virus and the spleen cannot be
controlled so the control of virus

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020
controlled so the control of virus
 

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.960
controlled so the control of virus
replication differs according to where

you look blood versus spleen same thing

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:36.030
you look blood versus spleen same thing
 

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.100
you look blood versus spleen same thing
with the brain if you take away

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.110

there are always exceptions to the rules
so but for some infections the CTL

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:56.100
so but for some infections the CTL
 

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.280
so but for some infections the CTL
response is more important than

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:58.290
response is more important than
 

01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.810

about already today peptides and
cytokines and that causes the

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:04.410
cytokines and that causes the
 

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.800

antibodies so you see there's a very

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880
antibodies so you see there's a very
 

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.690
antibodies so you see there's a very
early decision point where you have to

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700
early decision point where you have to
 

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.280
early decision point where you have to
decide you're going to go the B cell

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:28.290
decide you're going to go the B cell
 

01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:31.640
decide you're going to go the B cell
route or the CTL route and that depends

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:31.650
route or the CTL route and that depends
 

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:34.340
route or the CTL route and that depends
on whether you make th one or th2 cells

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:34.350
on whether you make th one or th2 cells
 

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:36.020
on whether you make th one or th2 cells
and there seems to be a yin-yang

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:36.030
and there seems to be a yin-yang
 

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:38.180
and there seems to be a yin-yang

make both at high levels so how do you

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:43.320
make both at high levels so how do you
 

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:48.620
make both at high levels so how do you
decide whether to make th one or th2

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:48.630
decide whether to make th one or th2
 

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.720

cells activate the antibody response

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:00.120
cells activate the antibody response
 

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.840
cells activate the antibody response
this is not a good response for most

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:02.850
this is not a good response for most
 

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:05.150
this is not a good response for most
virus infections remember with a few

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160
virus infections remember with a few
 

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.980
virus infections remember with a few
exceptions that I showed you most virus

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:06.990
exceptions that I showed you most virus
 

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.470
exceptions that I showed you most virus
infections to be cleared need a CTL

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480
infections to be cleared need a CTL
 

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.540
infections to be cleared need a CTL
response this is good for bacterial and

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:11.550
response this is good for bacterial and
 

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.850
response this is good for bacterial and
worm infections to make antibodies but

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:13.860
worm infections to make antibodies but
 

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.940
worm infections to make antibodies but
not for virus infections so what is the

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:16.950
not for virus infections so what is the
 

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.160
not for virus infections so what is the
response do you get what mixture of both

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:19.170
response do you get what mixture of both
 

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.890
response do you get what mixture of both
gets turned on and how and it's the

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900
gets turned on and how and it's the
 

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.750
gets turned on and how and it's the
mixture of cytokines that are produced

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760
mixture of cytokines that are produced
 

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:27.830
mixture of cytokines that are produced
by infected cells or Sentinel cells so

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:27.840
by infected cells or Sentinel cells so
 

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.380
by infected cells or Sentinel cells so
you have a precursor cell that can

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:30.390
you have a precursor cell that can
 

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:33.710
you have a precursor cell that can
either go to a th one or th two it's an

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720
either go to a th one or th two it's an
 

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.410
either go to a th one or th two it's an
immature cd4 positive th cell and

01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420
immature cd4 positive th cell and
 

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.780
immature cd4 positive th cell and
remember in the lymph node these cells

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:38.790
remember in the lymph node these cells
 

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:41.390
remember in the lymph node these cells
are encountering the dendritic cells and

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400
are encountering the dendritic cells and
 

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.420
are encountering the dendritic cells and
being activated by then the mix of

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:44.430
being activated by then the mix of
 

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.940
being activated by then the mix of
cytokines that are produced determines

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:46.950
cytokines that are produced determines
 

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:49.310
cytokines that are produced determines
whether they go to th one or the th 2

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:49.320
whether they go to th one or the th 2
 

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.160
whether they go to th one or the th 2
root so if you're making for example

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:52.170
root so if you're making for example
 

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.830
root so if you're making for example
il-2 12 and interferon gamma it pushes

01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:54.840
il-2 12 and interferon gamma it pushes
 

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.020
il-2 12 and interferon gamma it pushes
you to the th one side or if you make al

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:57.030
you to the th one side or if you make al
 

01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.330
you to the th one side or if you make al
four or five and ten you go the other

01:07:59.330 --> 01:07:59.340
four or five and ten you go the other
 

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.280
four or five and ten you go the other
route now you don't need to know what

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:01.290
route now you don't need to know what
 

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.860
route now you don't need to know what
particular cocktail of cytokines pushes

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:03.870
particular cocktail of cytokines pushes
 

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.690
particular cocktail of cytokines pushes
it either way you just need to know that

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700
it either way you just need to know that
 

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.570
it either way you just need to know that
the decision to go th one or th two is

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:08.580
the decision to go th one or th two is
 

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.270
the decision to go th one or th two is
based on which cytokines you get now

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280
based on which cytokines you get now
 

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.920
based on which cytokines you get now
interestingly look here the suppression

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:12.930
interestingly look here the suppression
 

01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:16.070
interestingly look here the suppression
of the th one response is is done by

01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080
of the th one response is is done by
 

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.590
of the th one response is is done by
some of the cytokines that induce the

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600
some of the cytokines that induce the
 

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.010
some of the cytokines that induce the
th2 response so that's why I said this

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020
th2 response so that's why I said this
 

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.780
th2 response so that's why I said this
was a yin-yang relationship you have

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:23.790
was a yin-yang relationship you have
 

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:25.910
was a yin-yang relationship you have
either one or the other high but not

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920
either one or the other high but not
 

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.090
either one or the other high but not
both and again the kinds of cytokines

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:29.100
both and again the kinds of cytokines
 

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.020
both and again the kinds of cytokines
produced are presumably detected by the

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.030
produced are presumably detected by the
 

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:36.410
produced are presumably detected by the
static cells according to which pathogen

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420
static cells according to which pathogen
 

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.810
static cells according to which pathogen
is present so they can sense that and

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:38.820
is present so they can sense that and
 

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:42.800
is present so they can sense that and
then the cd4 T cells respond by making

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:42.810
then the cd4 T cells respond by making
 

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:46.190
then the cd4 T cells respond by making
the right cocktail of cytokines these

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:46.200
the right cocktail of cytokines these
 

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.890
the right cocktail of cytokines these
adaptive responses also provide memory

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:48.900
adaptive responses also provide memory
 

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.120
adaptive responses also provide memory
this is very important

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.130
this is very important
 

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:53.249
this is very important
so that if you're infected later on you

01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:53.259
so that if you're infected later on you
 

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:55.499
so that if you're infected later on you
get a more rapid and specific response

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:55.509
get a more rapid and specific response
 

01:08:55.509 --> 01:08:58.079
get a more rapid and specific response
so the adaptive response takes two to

01:08:58.079 --> 01:08:58.089
so the adaptive response takes two to
 

01:08:58.089 --> 01:09:00.149
so the adaptive response takes two to
three weeks to engage fully if you're

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159
three weeks to engage fully if you're
 

01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:02.129
three weeks to engage fully if you're
reinfected it's much faster because you

01:09:02.129 --> 01:09:02.139
reinfected it's much faster because you
 

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.649
reinfected it's much faster because you
have memory and eight responses don't

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:04.659
have memory and eight responses don't
 

01:09:04.659 --> 01:09:06.780
have memory and eight responses don't
have that they're always on they respond

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:06.790
have that they're always on they respond
 

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.399
have that they're always on they respond
quickly they don't need to have memory

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:08.409
quickly they don't need to have memory
 

01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:10.620
quickly they don't need to have memory
and this of course is the basis for

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:10.630
and this of course is the basis for
 

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.079
and this of course is the basis for
vaccination you're immunized and then

01:09:13.079 --> 01:09:13.089
vaccination you're immunized and then
 

01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:14.609
vaccination you're immunized and then
you encounter the pathogen some other

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:14.619
you encounter the pathogen some other
 

01:09:14.619 --> 01:09:16.919
you encounter the pathogen some other
time and you respond quicker so you

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:16.929
time and you respond quicker so you
 

01:09:16.929 --> 01:09:19.349
time and you respond quicker so you
prevent infection so you make antibodies

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359
prevent infection so you make antibodies
 

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:22.200
prevent infection so you make antibodies
very quickly you block infection before

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:22.210
very quickly you block infection before
 

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:24.599
very quickly you block infection before
it starts and that's why antibodies will

01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:24.609
it starts and that's why antibodies will
 

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.370
it starts and that's why antibodies will
prevent infection whereas if you have a

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:26.380
prevent infection whereas if you have a
 

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.620
prevent infection whereas if you have a
first encounter with the pathogen you

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:28.630
first encounter with the pathogen you
 

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:31.649
first encounter with the pathogen you
need the CTL response to clear it so

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:31.659
need the CTL response to clear it so
 

01:09:31.659 --> 01:09:33.300
need the CTL response to clear it so
here's an experiment where we look at

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:33.310
here's an experiment where we look at
 

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:36.149
here's an experiment where we look at
antibody production after time so we

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159
antibody production after time so we
 

01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:38.430
antibody production after time so we
inject an animal with antigen a we have

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440
inject an animal with antigen a we have
 

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.620
inject an animal with antigen a we have
a primary response three four weeks

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:40.630
a primary response three four weeks
 

01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:43.439
a primary response three four weeks
after injections kind of modest and then

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:43.449
after injections kind of modest and then
 

01:09:43.449 --> 01:09:45.689
after injections kind of modest and then
the antibody levels return to low levels

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:45.699
the antibody levels return to low levels
 

01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:47.760
the antibody levels return to low levels
if you get infected or in this case

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:47.770
if you get infected or in this case
 

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.919
if you get infected or in this case
we're injecting antigen a seven weeks

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:49.929
we're injecting antigen a seven weeks
 

01:09:49.929 --> 01:09:52.019
we're injecting antigen a seven weeks
down the road you have a very specific

01:09:52.019 --> 01:09:52.029
down the road you have a very specific
 

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:56.100
down the road you have a very specific
and much more effective antibody

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:56.110
and much more effective antibody
 

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:58.560
and much more effective antibody
response against a so the curve goes up

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:58.570
response against a so the curve goes up
 

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.689
response against a so the curve goes up
higher and much more quickly and

01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:00.699
higher and much more quickly and
 

01:10:00.699 --> 01:10:02.879
higher and much more quickly and
eventually that goes down as well so

01:10:02.879 --> 01:10:02.889
eventually that goes down as well so
 

01:10:02.889 --> 01:10:04.470
eventually that goes down as well so
that's an example of memory you have

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480
that's an example of memory you have
 

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.569
that's an example of memory you have
memory cells that will respond to this

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:06.579
memory cells that will respond to this
 

01:10:06.579 --> 01:10:09.240
memory cells that will respond to this
antigen very quickly and more robustly

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:09.250
antigen very quickly and more robustly
 

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:12.089
antigen very quickly and more robustly
there is also cellular memory as well

01:10:12.089 --> 01:10:12.099
there is also cellular memory as well
 

01:10:12.099 --> 01:10:14.280
there is also cellular memory as well
not just antibody memory so there are B

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:14.290
not just antibody memory so there are B
 

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.069
not just antibody memory so there are B
cell memory and T cell memory that's

01:10:17.069 --> 01:10:17.079
cell memory and T cell memory that's
 

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.839
cell memory and T cell memory that's
shown here here we have infected an

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:18.849
shown here here we have infected an
 

01:10:18.849 --> 01:10:22.649
shown here here we have infected an
animal with a virus the titer rises this

01:10:22.649 --> 01:10:22.659
animal with a virus the titer rises this
 

01:10:22.659 --> 01:10:24.750
animal with a virus the titer rises this
is virus in the spleen and then it goes

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760
is virus in the spleen and then it goes
 

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.899
is virus in the spleen and then it goes
back down again at the same time where

01:10:27.899 --> 01:10:27.909
back down again at the same time where
 

01:10:27.909 --> 01:10:30.330
back down again at the same time where
that animal is making cytotoxic

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:30.340
that animal is making cytotoxic
 

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.370
that animal is making cytotoxic
t-lymphocytes those are the green bars

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:32.380
t-lymphocytes those are the green bars
 

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.990
t-lymphocytes those are the green bars
and they are specific for the virus so

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000
and they are specific for the virus so
 

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.330
and they are specific for the virus so
if you take the CTLs out of the animal

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:39.340
if you take the CTLs out of the animal
 

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.800
if you take the CTLs out of the animal
at these different time points you can

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:40.810
at these different time points you can
 

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:42.810
at these different time points you can
show that they will lyse virus infected

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:42.820
show that they will lyse virus infected
 

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.490
show that they will lyse virus infected
cells but eventually the activity of

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:44.500
cells but eventually the activity of
 

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.919
cells but eventually the activity of
those go down as well but still

01:10:46.919 --> 01:10:46.929
those go down as well but still
 

01:10:46.929 --> 01:10:49.800
those go down as well but still
circulating in the blood our epitope

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:49.810
circulating in the blood our epitope
 

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.370
circulating in the blood our epitope
specific lymphocytes so they don't kill

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380
specific lymphocytes so they don't kill
 

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.770
specific lymphocytes so they don't kill
cells but they will recognize viral

01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:55.780
cells but they will recognize viral
 

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.720
cells but they will recognize viral
epitopes so that means that there is

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:57.730
epitopes so that means that there is
 

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:00.720
epitopes so that means that there is
memory towards those cd8 lymphocyte

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:00.730
memory towards those cd8 lymphocyte
 

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:03.089
memory towards those cd8 lymphocyte
epitope so again there is not just

01:11:03.089 --> 01:11:03.099
epitope so again there is not just
 

01:11:03.099 --> 01:11:04.390
epitope so again there is not just
memory to

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400
memory to
 

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.360
memory to
antibody antibody producing cells but

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:07.370
antibody antibody producing cells but
 

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.820
antibody antibody producing cells but
also CTLs as well and we'll talk more

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:09.830
also CTLs as well and we'll talk more
 

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:14.680
also CTLs as well and we'll talk more
about memory when we consider vaccines
