00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.970
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.890
It's Mark Weins.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.430
I am in Goiania in the state of Goias

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.150
in Central Western Brazil.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.640
We're gonna especially focus today

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.230
on a local fruit called pequi

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.930
which is a semi-dangerous fruit,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.330
but it's loved in this region.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.090
It's one of those fruits that
you either love or you hate,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.610
and it's gonna be my first time to try it.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.730
I can't wait to try it out.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.563
We're starting at the market.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.150
We're gonna walk around,
we're gonna eat some snacks,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.571
we're gonna get a feel for the city.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:25.990
Then we're gonna go to lunch.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.920
It's a little drive away to the,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.740
it's a place called Goias Vale,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.410
and then we're gonna come
back and eat some street food.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.370
So, that's the plan for today.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.310
It's gonna be an incredible
day of unique food,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.671
exploring the fruit.

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.254
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:45.134
(speaking in foreign language)
- Good morning, man.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:46.680
- Good morning.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.513
- [Mark] How are you today?

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.670
- Good, good, and yourself?

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.510
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.967
- You're here, Mercado Central in Goiania,

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.227
and a lot of handcrafts, local food,

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:58.870
and we're gonna see like,
which fruits are available,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.410
and we're gonna try the empadao.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.620
- Step into the market immediately greeted

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.530
by an abundance of produce.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.840
There's cheeses, there's greens,
there's both fresh things,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.190
but then they also have
pre-cooked food here as well.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.310
- [Guilherme] This is a pequi chili sauce.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.550
- It's such a like,
spacious, wide alley market.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.510
Oh, here's some of the clay pots,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.170
and clay pots are very
important for cooking in Brazil.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.690
Cooking in this region,
the local traditional food.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.230
- [Guilherme] The guy
here said it's strong.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.147
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:38.020
That's the empadao.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.568
- That's awesome, that's huge.
- Yeah.

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:40.690
- [Mark] We'll just get the big one.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.170
- [Guilherme] Chicken
sausage, onions, tomatoes.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.380
- [Mark] So that's the one
with all the different meats.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.613
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Awesome.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450
You take a yellow bar stool,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.900
and it's all just countertop seating.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.950
You're seated right in front
of the case of empadaos.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.320
This one's like, a super-size one,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.320
which is the state of Goia style,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.620
which is, there's meat in here,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.555
a variety of different sausages.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.910
Guilherme just opened it up

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.340
and added some of that chili sauce.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
The chili sauce looks unbelievably good.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.063
Mmm.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.773
Oh, yeah.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.650
Got a good bit of that chili sauce,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.640
which has a wonderful
like, sour spiciness to it.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.110
Almost like a meat stew in the center.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.760
That's delicious and hearty.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.580
The next one that we're gonna
try is the frango pequi,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.993
which is the, it's chicken with
the fruit, the pequi fruit.

00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:33.991
Mmm.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.800
Oh dude, I could like, taste it, in like,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410
the fumes before I took a bite.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.640
That does have an amazing
like, pungent flavor.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.010
Cheesy, very tropical.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.530
Very, very tropical, like, immediately,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.668
you taste like, like jungle.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.751
(upbeat Latin music)

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.870
I cannot overemphasize how good

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.393
the chili sauces are in Brazil.

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.590
This one is with guariroba,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.507
which is a type of heart of palm, right?

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:08.950
- Yes.
- It's another thing

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.670
I've never tried, heart of palm.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.811
This type of heart of palm.

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:15.300
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.859
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it does,

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.400
you taste a little bit of bitterness,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.863
and it sort of has the
texture of bamboo shoots.

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:24.060
(upbeat Latin music)
- Jatoba.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.650
- We're stopping by another fruit shop.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.280
This, he has a bunch of different fruit.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.289
Some of them are kind of
like, dry in like, pots.

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:32.230
The fruit that we're gonna try is jatoba,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.420
which is, it looks, yeah, it's
kind of like a hard shell.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.395
He has to crack it open.

00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:38.645
(pounding)

00:03:40.402 --> 00:03:42.950
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.342
- [Guilherme] Okay, this is good, Mark.

00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:46.580
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.363
- It feels like fossilized
powder, like, in a pod.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.183
Wow.

00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:54.286
It smells like, like
almost like powdered milk.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:58.203
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:01.750
Oh. (laughs)

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.000
Wow. (laughs)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.730
It tastes like powdered
milk, but with like a,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.160
it turns to like, cream when
it mixes with your saliva.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.993
Maybe the type of fruit

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:10.510
that you would really make something with,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.610
rather than like, just snack on it.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.443
But that is

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.870
man, I love tasting new fruits.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.910
New fruits to me that
I've never tried before.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.743
Oh, yeah.

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:23.550
Don't take too big of a bite
or you'll have a dry mouth.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.614
It's almost like bread.

00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:28.893
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:29.966
- We have, we have this.
- Oh, this is a baru?

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:34.068
- Yeah, look.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:34.980
- Mmm.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.346
Oh, this is the, that's
the seed inside of it.

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:38.910
Oh, wow.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.410
Yeah, you can hear it rattling around.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.840
But that tastes, that tastes,
yeah, it's very sweet.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.010
Kind of like leathery, and
has a raisin taste to it.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.030
We gotta move though because we gotta go.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.996
We're gonna, from here, we're
gonna take a two-hour drive

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:54.995
to an amazing family local restaurant.

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:55.828
All right.

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:58.911
(upbeat Latin music)

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:11.840
(motorcycle humming)

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.673
Is that the place?

00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:13.506
- [Guilherme] Yeah.

00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:14.968
Aruana.

00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:18.051
(upbeat Latin music)

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.220
- That was a beautiful drive.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.320
That took about two hours.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.960
We arrived to the old city.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.610
We're right in the
historic center of Goias,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.550
and this is a beautiful city.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.460
It's not even cobblestone,
but these are like,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.280
straight stone slab roads.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.800
There's a church, the
buildings, it's gorgeous.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.770
I love how there's just massive trees

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.035
even in the middle of the road.

00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:49.846
This is like, the center town square.

00:05:49.846 --> 00:05:52.963
We're gonna go straight to go
eat because it's lunchtime.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.630
It's so incredibly beautiful.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.890
The streets, the
construction, the heritage.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.640
I'm just loving the walk even
to get to the restaurant.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.660
Micah is having a roller coaster ride.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:15.610
(wheels clattering)

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.430
This is the spot, Restaurante Braseiro,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.700
and they're known for their traditional,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.460
just a home, traditional,
this is the type of restaurant

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.474
I get psyched about.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:28.060
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.870
The owner is so friendly.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.938
Thank you so.

00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:33.200
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.177
An amazing restaurant.

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.350
You can immediately smell the smoke

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.109
because they cook over
fire all of the dishes.

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:43.026
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:45.830
(chuckles) Oh, yes!

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.810
Coming back into the kitchen

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.630
where they have the
entire stove is burning,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.370
all, everything is cooked over wood.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.370
Some things are cooked in big,
giant, like, iron kettles.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.590
Others are cooked in clay.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.590
These are just local, local
dishes cooked with love.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.923
It's beautiful.

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:08.703
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.038
- [Guilherme] She's gonna cook for us

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:17.871
the pequi.
- Yes!

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.310
- [Guilherme] She didn't wanna
cook today with the heat.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.535
I said we're here for the pequi.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:23.031
(speaking in foreign language)
And she goes no,

00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:24.840
we gotta cook.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.830
- Oh, I am loving this place.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.170
The food, you get all the aromas,

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.490
and actually, one of the main
dishes we wanted to eat here

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.897
is the pequi, which is the fruit,

00:07:32.897 --> 00:07:36.290
but they didn't make it
today, but she is so nice.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.323
She said she's gonna
make us some pequi now.

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.200
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.582
Is it okay to taste?

00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:44.291
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:45.124
Wow.

00:07:45.124 --> 00:07:47.791
(food sizzling)

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.270
That is the pequi, pequi
fruit that she just took out,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.103
and she's gonna boil it.

00:07:56.103 --> 00:07:57.190
She just put it into a pot right now.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.023
That's gonna boil.

00:07:58.023 --> 00:07:59.540
I'm not sure what she's
gonna make exactly,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.120
but that is the fruit,
that is the unique fruit.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.490
Oh, it's just beautiful, like,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.363
the orange and yellow colors of it.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.870
Oh, so just don't dig
deep, don't dig deep.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.560
- It's like, when you eat
like, a rabbit, you know?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.796
Look.
- Ah, okay.

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:17.870
- You just use the teeth to like,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.208
like a rodent animal, right?

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:22.041
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:22.874
- But it's a dangerous fruit.

00:08:22.874 --> 00:08:24.610
You can't bite into the
whole fruit or the spikes,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.070
the little spikes from what I understand,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.690
will like, stick to your tongue.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.230
Okay, here it goes, my first time.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.493
You're just kind of, like.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.443
Yeah!

00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:40.276
Mmm.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.754
Oh wow, yeah.

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:45.087
You gotta just like, nibble.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.250
I'm being a little cautious, just kind of,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.963
taking the outside flesh.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.500
It tastes like string
cheese, cheese on seed.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.960
You wanna like, bite
the entire thing, but,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.540
that would be bad news.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.373
That's great, though.

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:02.450
It's so like, oily, too.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.730
Even on my fingers, you can feel like,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.470
almost like, avocado oil.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.150
And then, if you get into
it, Guilherme is opening one.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.440
You can see like, the
little like, spikes in it.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.273
Oh, yeah.

00:09:11.273 --> 00:09:12.720
You do not wanna mess with that.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.330
That will like, actually
stick to your tongue.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.100
- Oh yeah, it will.
- Sharp.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.820
As we're waiting for the pequi,
the owner has blended us a,

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.140
this is a cashew fruit smoothie.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.440
I've eaten the cashew fruit before,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.000
but I've never had a smoothie of it.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.450
You can see, she also garnished it

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.450
with a little cashew fruit on the side,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.100
like a miniature, a mini one.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.010
This is, it's gorgeous.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.533
It's bubbling, it's frothy.

00:09:39.054 --> 00:09:40.950
Oh. (chuckles)

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.053
Oh, wow.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.060
That has like, a sour
strawberry taste to it.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.490
Slightly like, alcoholic taste to it,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.380
and it does have that,
but it's almost like,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.770
strawberry-like.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.100
That's, that's incredible.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.310
- That is not water.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.210
This is homemade sugarcane alcohol.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.870
- The owner of the restaurant
really wants us to taste

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.333
his sugarcane liquor.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.853
Ooh, yeah.

00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:05.686
That's strong.

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:07.900
And then you chase it with
the cashew, the cashew fruit.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.603
Mmm.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.530
Yeah, that's like, really strong,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.861
followed by like, really sour.

00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.490
It is almost like strawberry-like.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.552
- [Crew] It's strong, but
it also, it smells nice.

00:10:21.552 --> 00:10:24.635
(upbeat Latin music)

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.970
- She boiled the pequi for
at least like, 30 minutes.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.920
Then, she added it to the chicken.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.753
She added it to the chicken.

00:10:46.753 --> 00:10:50.230
You really, you could smell
that aroma, cheesy fruitiness.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.063
They look like little egg yolks.

00:10:54.753 --> 00:10:57.280
(food bubbling)

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.663
Her name is Casimira.

00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:00.564
Casimira,

00:11:00.564 --> 00:11:01.670
she is an amazing cook.
(Casimira laughs)

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.660
She's the main cook
here, she's so friendly.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.739
She is, she is taking care of us,

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:07.720
and the dish is almost ready.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.520
It's unbelievably fragrant.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.023
I am ecstatic to try it.

00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:14.690
(food bubbling)

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.400
Another dish that I just smelled
over here, bubbling away,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.920
this is a preserved
like, like, smoked meat.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.630
It smells so good, and I can almost,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.645
I think there must be
like, some sugar in there.

00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:28.926
The sauce looks almost like caramely.

00:11:28.926 --> 00:11:30.256
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:33.099
- [Guilherme] And you just
slice off a piece with a fork.

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:37.016
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:40.543 --> 00:11:42.988
- Oh! (chuckles)

00:11:42.988 --> 00:11:45.488
(dog barking)

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.250
Before we dig into the main dish,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.610
she wanted us to try this beef,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.460
which has been simmering in that pot.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.420
Such pure beef!

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.901
It's so lean.

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:04.897
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:04.897 --> 00:12:06.110
Okay.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.613
Let's get started with the full meal.

00:12:07.613 --> 00:12:09.580
It's all buffet, self-service.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.020
So, even, you even, they have
some salads at the front,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.734
but you even come to the kitchen,

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:16.670
where the dishes are
still cooking and heating,

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.503
to serve yourself.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:18.340
I'm going rice first

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.577
because this is what you wanna
lay your base down before,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.560
before you dig into the pequi stew.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.370
Yeah, the main dish I
really wanna eat right now

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.230
is the pequi stew,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.973
so I'm gonna get some
of the chicken first.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.520
Some pieces of chicken on there, pequi.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.997
You accidentally forget that it's a pequi

00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:35.890
and just chomp down on the whole thing,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.070
you would actually like, suffer.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.150
And then, just drizzle it, and sauce it.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.670
I'm gonna move over here
to some of the beans.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.870
Like, really sticky, really hearty beans.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.850
Oh, the stickiness of that.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.247
Bean stew with, this
looks like pork hearts.

00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:51.360
(gasping)
(upbeat Latin music)

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.193
One meatball.

00:12:52.193 --> 00:12:53.938
Meatball on the side here.

00:12:53.938 --> 00:12:54.990
Oh, what is that?

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.087
Kind of like, almost lasagna-y,

00:12:56.087 --> 00:12:58.130
but it's more like enchilada style.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.485
On the side there.

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.879
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:02.712
Okay.

00:13:02.712 --> 00:13:04.000
I think it's okra.
- It's okra.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.833
- There's also the salads,

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.947
but I think I'll have to wait
for round two for salads.

00:13:06.947 --> 00:13:09.523
(upbeat Latin music)
So excited!

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.870
I got a variety of the different dishes,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.530
but that, yeah, that main dish

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.350
is the pequi with the chicken stew.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.260
You can, like, as you're
carrying your plate around,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.520
like, the entire restaurant
can just smell of the fruit.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.160
It kind of, I was just trying
to think what it smells like.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.780
It does kind of smell like jackfruit.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.770
It kind of has almost a, like
a overly pungent banana aroma.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.900
I'm gonna first just taste
the rice with the pequi sauce

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.963
that she boiled out.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.980
Oh, yes.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.813
It's so unique.

00:13:41.813 --> 00:13:44.733
Like, it's a salty chicken
stew that has a really like,

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.470
like, kind of, like, chicken
peppery broth taste to it,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.030
but then with that like,
fruity, jackfruity taste.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.510
They do kind of look like egg yolks,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.180
but they are far from egg yolks.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.550
People do say it is a dangerous fruit

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.383
because you gotta know.

00:13:57.383 --> 00:13:58.917
If you don't know and you
just take a bite of it,

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:01.200
you're like, in real serious trouble.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.400
Like, you could, your
tongue might be in danger

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.722
of never tasting again.

00:14:04.722 --> 00:14:06.780
Like. (muffled speaking)

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.090
Oh, wow!

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.189
When it's cooked, it's almost like,

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:13.660
it almost takes on more of
a starchy, oh! (chuckles)

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.680
Like, hardened cheese,
but like, with a banana,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.833
like a pungent banana taste.

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:19.163
It's kind of creamy.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.819
Almost like the texture of a
bean now that it's been cooked.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:26.397
You don't wanna get too overly
excited about eating this.

00:14:26.397 --> 00:14:28.350
Because it's so delicious,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.043
and then end up with a,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.260
with a tongue

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.223
that's just like, your
tongue's torn apart.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.723
That's all I should know,
that's unbelievably unique.

00:14:38.723 --> 00:14:40.020
When you touch it with your fingers,

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.090
it feels like avocado oil.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.990
It has to be healthy.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.709
To the beans and the feijoada,

00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:47.080
and I think that's pork skin,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.201
chunks of pork skin in there too.

00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:52.990
(laughing)
(upbeat Latin music)

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.700
Dude, that pork skin
just melts in your mouth,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.900
and with those starchy
beans, pure home cooking.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.400
And you taste the fire in it as well.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.961
And I got a piece of sausage in here too.

00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:03.740
Beans and rice.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.113
What a, what a combination of love.

00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:09.400
(upbeat Latin music)

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.611
That roll of dough with meat
inside and tomato sauce.

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:15.500
(upbeat Latin music)

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.090
Feels like a noodle wrapper,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.770
but it's more of like a pancake.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.603
Minced meat in the middle

00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:21.410
with a very vibrant tomato sauce.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.431
- Be careful,

00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:23.440
be careful with the pequi.
- Yeah.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.630
You two handled it well.
(laughs)

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.530
True, but the flavor is
just, it's unbelievably good.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.363
- Yes.

00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:30.196
- Like, it's so unique.

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.276
(upbeat Latin music)

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.450
Hearty food.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.500
Okay, I'm going to try some of the juices

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.013
that the owner just brought us.

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:48.310
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.230
Not sure what this one is,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.130
but it's a green juice, a local fruit.

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:54.910
Mmm.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.430
Oh, that tastes like soursop.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.670
- The name, cagaita.
- Cagaita.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.701
- Yeah, I have no clue
how to say it in English.

00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:02.800
- (laughs) Neither do I.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.620
- Because there's some
fruits, Brazilian fruits,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.229
for example, jabuticaba,
there's no meaning.

00:16:06.229 --> 00:16:08.324
And you just say, jabuticaba, you know.

00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:09.845
- It originates here, it's from here.

00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.233
- Yes.
- And it's like,

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:13.320
it's just where you have to try it.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.548
It's kind of like, minty,
kind of like soursop-y.

00:16:15.548 --> 00:16:17.143
Delicious.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.853
Okay, next juice is the caja.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.260
Oh.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.490
That's like, it tastes like marian plum,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.973
like a stronger mango.

00:16:32.113 --> 00:16:33.650
Mmm.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.483
Wow.

00:16:34.483 --> 00:16:36.870
And like, almost like,
apricot at the same time.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.863
Last juice is the tamarind juice.

00:16:41.247 --> 00:16:42.345
(slurps)

00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:43.178
Oh!

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.195
Oh, that's amazing.

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:48.916
And I've had tamarind like,
countless, countless times,

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:50.267
in so many things,

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:52.340
but this is really good,
the way she's made it.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.449
It's extra sour, and just
balanced to a sweetness.

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.810
(upbeat Latin music)

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.000
Okay, add a little chilies, you know,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.582
going for that meatball next.

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:03.836
(upbeat Latin music)

00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:05.340
Mmm.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.700
Oh!

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.317
The meatball.

00:17:08.317 --> 00:17:10.800
It's just like, solid, condensed meat

00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:13.640
with a very fine grind.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.050
Went back for some vegetables.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.703
I got some, I think it's green zucchini.

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.637
I think it's green zucchini
but I'm not totally sure.

00:17:19.637 --> 00:17:22.690
(Guilherme Laughs)

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:23.930
I think so.
- Yeah.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.845
- Okay, final pequi.

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:27.928
(upbeat Latin music)

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.850
You gotta, yeah, you have to
nibble on it like a rabbit.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.769
That actually tastes like cheddar cheese.

00:17:34.769 --> 00:17:36.810
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.643
Amazing.

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:45.450
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.287
Thank you.

00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:47.617
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:47.617 --> 00:17:48.827
Thank you so much.

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:51.830
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.002
Amazing, amazing.

00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:55.104
Thank you, thank you.

00:17:55.104 --> 00:17:56.860
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.447
That was a spectacular meal.

00:17:59.447 --> 00:18:02.349
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.430
And she is so nice, Anna.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.360
She took care of us.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.915
She calls us all by name here.

00:18:07.915 --> 00:18:09.070
Yeah. (laughs)

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.250
It's amazing.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.050
And also.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.000
Oh, man.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.587
That was special.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:16.587 --> 00:18:18.586
So special, an honor to be here.

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:21.072
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:21.072 --> 00:18:22.925
(Mark and Anna laughing)

00:18:22.925 --> 00:18:23.758
Yes.

00:18:23.758 --> 00:18:24.645
Yes.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.067
(Mark and Anna laughing)

00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:29.984
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.993
Super cool.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.010
We even said goodbye like,
probably 10 times before leaving.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.235
That, just, the food, the
hospitality, the culture.

00:18:44.235 --> 00:18:48.110
It will leave you just
smiling, walking away.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.981
We're just gonna walk around
for a little bit in this town,

00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.240
get a few more shots, just walk around,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.130
just enjoy the peacefulness of this town,

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.467
and then drive back to the city.

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:59.108
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:59.108 --> 00:19:00.010
- Yes.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.843
- For good after,

00:19:00.843 --> 00:19:02.030
that means good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.010
- Going across the bridge.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.060
This is such a
picture-perfect little town.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.510
And we're almost to the church.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.520
The natural beauty, then
just how warm and friendly

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.419
and welcoming everybody is here.

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:15.502
(motorcycle humming)

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:19.458
(upbeat Latin music)

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.559
How much are the coconuts?
- Five each.

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:26.745
- [Mark] Five each?

00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:30.662
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:32.283 --> 00:19:36.200
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:37.812 --> 00:19:38.853
Yeah.

00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:40.650
- [Guilherme] He was
replying like, how are you?

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.483
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:42.316
- [Guilherme] And then it's like.

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:43.847
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:45.305
- Sorry.

00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:48.260
It's almost like a, a
wine corkscrew remover

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.340
that he opens the coconut.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.790
That's so fast and efficient.

00:19:51.652 --> 00:19:53.770
(upbeat Latin music)

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.930
Oh, yeah.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.070
Oh, that's refreshing.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.903
That's so good.

00:19:56.903 --> 00:19:58.549
Perfectly sweet, a little bit sour.

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:00.060
Under the tree.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.883
This is fabulous.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.603
It's called Igreja de
Nossa Senhora do Rasario.

00:20:09.603 --> 00:20:11.940
It's so quiet, so peaceful.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.203
The murals around.

00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:15.593
Oh, yes.

00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:20.135
It was an absolute pleasure
and joy to walk around town.

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.850
This is the old city of Goias.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.380
And yeah, what a beautiful,
spectacular place.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.000
Highly recommended to visit.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.342
Well worth the drive from
Goiania in the main city.

00:20:31.342 --> 00:20:33.500
We're now driving back to the main city,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.595
and we're gonna have a few
street foods when we get back.

00:20:35.595 --> 00:20:38.678
(upbeat Latin music)

00:20:40.016 --> 00:20:43.933
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.920
We arrived back into town,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.450
and we came straight to a
place to eat like a tamale.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.060
It's made from corn, and
this place is amazing.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.775
It's in a parking lot,
a sea of corn husks.

00:20:56.775 --> 00:20:59.810
They've gone through just a mound of corn.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.410
And unfortunately, we
got here kind of late.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.480
They're almost sold out,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.698
but they literally, they just
had one left for us to taste,

00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:08.328
so I'm grateful they had one more for us,

00:21:08.328 --> 00:21:09.730
but yeah, this is the type of place

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.960
you gotta get here really
early because it's so popular,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.793
it sells out.

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:15.039
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.000
Ah.
- This is with the,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.880
kind of like, drippings,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.940
like a sauce.
- Ah, okay.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.200
She, as I was logging, she
brought out another one,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.502
so we got one chicken, one beef.

00:21:22.502 --> 00:21:25.976
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:25.976 --> 00:21:28.350
(car motors humming)

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.578
- [Guilherme] In Brazil,
they call Pamonha.

00:21:30.578 --> 00:21:31.620
- Oh, pamonha.
- Pamonha, yeah.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.557
- Ah, okay, okay.
- It's kind of like

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.810
the Brazilian tamales.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.020
We have different flavors, you know.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.509
This one is kind of like, carne de sal.

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:37.841
- With the beef in it.
- With the beef.

00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:39.228
And then this is the--
- And the other one is.

00:21:39.228 --> 00:21:41.084
- The chicken one.
- Pamonha with chicken in it.

00:21:41.084 --> 00:21:43.490
- And we also have the sweet
ones, with butter, with salt.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.480
- Ah!
- Plain.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.613
And it's a typical dish from Goias state.

00:21:47.613 --> 00:21:52.290
So, these will be the dessert, kind of.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.360
- These are monster, too.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.350
They're huge!

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.040
So, this is a full meal.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.873
- Full meal.
- It's not just for like,

00:21:56.873 --> 00:21:57.950
a snack, right?
- Oh, absolutely, full meal.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.240
- Originally, we weren't
gonna be able to have

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.380
the full spectrum of them,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.010
but now we got a sweet
one, so they're warming up.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.450
They have a full leftovers still left,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.550
so we got now three varieties.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.533
All right, we're gonna
try the beef one first.

00:22:10.533 --> 00:22:11.903
Cheers.
- Cheers, man.

00:22:14.428 --> 00:22:16.473
- [Unison] Mmm.

00:22:16.473 --> 00:22:17.306
- Mmm.

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:18.440
- Salty, huh?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.800
- Yeah, it's like salty, but it's like,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.633
it's sweet corn, right?

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:22.740
- Yes, sweet corn.
- It's sweet corn

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.173
because it's so, very
sweet, rather than the,

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.410
the non-sweet field corn.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.680
It has that immediate sweetness.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.001
Oh, that's incredibly delicious.

00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:33.623
And yes, that's a wise move right there.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.693
Add some hot sauce all over it.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.020
And then, you taste the
shreds of beef in it too.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.853
It's such a balance

00:22:41.853 --> 00:22:42.686
of sweet and salty.
- Really good.

00:22:42.686 --> 00:22:43.519
Yeah, there's cheese.

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:44.352
I think this is curd,

00:22:44.352 --> 00:22:45.440
curd cheese.
- Curd cheese in here.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.030
- Cheese love.
- Oh wow, that's a whole like.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:47.863
- [Guilherme] Yeah.

00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:49.230
- [Mark] That's a whole string of cheese.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.030
- [Guilherme] Start with the cheese.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.440
I'm almost positive it's curd cheese.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.290
- [Crew] Awesome.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.940
- Mm-hmm.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.163
Oh, yeah.

00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:00.441
Mmm.
- That's curd cheese.

00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:02.130
- With the sauce, it's awesome.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.440
It's sour, it's almost fruity and spicy.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.013
It's like, something so simple.

00:23:07.013 --> 00:23:08.470
It's so flavorful.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.152
- [Guilherme] Let's try the chicken one.

00:23:10.152 --> 00:23:10.985
- [Mark] Let's try the chicken one.

00:23:10.985 --> 00:23:11.980
- [Crew] Waterfall it.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.810
- [Mark] Like, I'm actually
impressed how good it is.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.010
Cheers.
- Cheers, chicken one.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.716
- Oh, you're doing away
with your fork, oh no!

00:23:16.716 --> 00:23:19.383
(Mark laughing)

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.164
- It's good.

00:23:23.164 --> 00:23:24.370
(all laughing)

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.203
- [Mark] Okay, let's try

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.036
the sweet real fast.
- Sweet one.

00:23:26.036 --> 00:23:27.140
Wait, it comes with cheese.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.134
- It comes with cheese?

00:23:28.134 --> 00:23:30.962
Oh yeah, there's a whole
stick of cheese in the middle.

00:23:30.962 --> 00:23:33.001
(upbeat Latin music)

00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:33.834
Mmm.

00:23:34.982 --> 00:23:37.963
The sweet one is good too.

00:23:37.963 --> 00:23:39.437
It's almost like pudding.
- Yeah.

00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:41.203
It's like, my favorite.
- It's like, the, that one.

00:23:41.203 --> 00:23:42.203
That's one of your favorites?

00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:43.036
- Yeah.

00:23:43.036 --> 00:23:45.080
- Yeah, it really is almost
like pudding, like corn pudding.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.304
I'd say my favorite is the
beef one, but they're all good,

00:23:47.304 --> 00:23:48.780
like, impressively good.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.891
We have one more thing to
eat on this food tour today.

00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:55.615
It's gonna be some grilled,
some grilled things.

00:23:55.615 --> 00:23:58.532
(crowd chattering)

00:24:01.328 --> 00:24:03.710
(crowd chattering)

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.550
Totally bumping.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.060
It's so packed, it's so
energetic, it's so lively.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.681
The meat is just roasting away.

00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.590
They have this unique grilling system

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.550
where they have two layers of the grill,

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.881
but one of the kebabs that
we're here to eat especially

00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:20.020
is the chili kebab, the pemienta kebab.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.900
It's like a chili which is
stuffed with ground meat,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.170
wrapped in bacon and
grilled over the charcoal,

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.003
and it smells incredible.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.540
Part Brazilian steakhouse,
part like, beer garden.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.540
Just an amazing, vibrant,
energetic, lively place.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.460
Really friendly as well,

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.650
and you could just smell the meat, like,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.779
in this entire neighborhood.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.901
(upbeat Latin music)

00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:47.818
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.450
- [Guilherme] Cow tongue.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.410
- I've just been told to just
take a bite from the kebab.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.283
That's the best way to do it,
just take a bite out of it.

00:24:56.283 --> 00:24:57.980
This is a beautiful skewer.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.200
Chilies, there's minced meat kind of like,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.120
popping out at the top.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.070
It's stuffed with minced meat,
and then wrapped with bacon.

00:25:08.996 --> 00:25:09.829
Mmm.

00:25:11.016 --> 00:25:11.849
Mmm.

00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:15.380
Oh, that's amazing.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.530
It's not spicy at all, but
the pepper is so fragrant.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.170
It's sweet and charred,
then filled with meat.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.941
And then you've got that bacon umami.

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:27.294
Mmm.

00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:29.220
Good.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.073
- Let's do it.
- You gotta try that.

00:25:31.073 --> 00:25:34.600
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.431
You film, you film yourself though.

00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:37.931
You film yourself.

00:25:38.793 --> 00:25:39.626
- Mmm.

00:25:41.137 --> 00:25:42.840
Not spicy at all.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.519
Really good.
- Delicious, all right?

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:45.440
- Delicious.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.500
- [Mark] I know what we need to do.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.702
Trinidad Scorpion.

00:25:47.702 --> 00:25:50.441
Oh, yes. (laughs)

00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:53.365
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:54.198
Oh.

00:25:54.198 --> 00:25:58.030
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.380
- [Guilherme] Kind of
like the bacon crackling.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.010
- The owner is so nice.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.560
He just brought over this signature dish

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.130
which is like a mountain
of pork cracklings.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.593
Okay, and we're about to taste

00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:12.160
the Trinidad Scorpion
chili sauce on that chili.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.319
Chili on chili.

00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:16.402
(upbeat Latin music)

00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:21.306
Mmm.

00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:25.497
Oh, it's actually not that spicy.

00:26:25.497 --> 00:26:27.072
- [Guilherme] Not spicy.

00:26:27.072 --> 00:26:30.230
- [Mark] Not that spicy, yeah.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.880
- [Crew] Love those chilies, man.

00:26:34.098 --> 00:26:35.645
- Wow.

00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:36.478
Oh, wow.

00:26:36.478 --> 00:26:40.498
That is just like, unbelievably crispy.

00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:41.640
And crunchy.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.150
Next, the rice plate with
those beans on the side,

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.133
and I think that's cassava flour.

00:26:49.652 --> 00:26:50.485
Mmm, mmm.

00:26:51.703 --> 00:26:52.800
Yeah.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.180
Wonderful, simple.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.433
Rice, beans, and the refreshing tomato.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.890
I'm not sure if it's beef.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.830
A little bit chewy but really flavorful.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.736
It's a video.
- Oh!

00:27:03.736 --> 00:27:04.793
- Nice to meet you.

00:27:04.793 --> 00:27:05.631
- Nice to meet you.

00:27:05.631 --> 00:27:08.092
(speaking in foreign language)

00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:11.243
- Next up, for the tongue,
I'm gonna sauce it.

00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.504
Mmm.

00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:17.427
Oh, yeah.

00:27:19.122 --> 00:27:22.334
The tongue is so soft, it's almost creamy.

00:27:22.334 --> 00:27:26.251
(speaking in foreign language)

00:27:27.592 --> 00:27:28.970
It's onions stuffed with minced meat.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.030
Like kofta, I think, they told us.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.720
And I think there's cheese
in the middle as well,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.100
and then wrapped in bacon.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.058
And they're like, pool ball-sized.

00:27:36.058 --> 00:27:38.975
(crowd chattering)

00:27:40.442 --> 00:27:43.050
There's cheese, oh! (laughs)

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.690
There's cheese squeezing out that,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.291
that squeezed out the bottom.

00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.660
(laughs)

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.493
Wow.

00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:51.140
I think a little bit of
the Trinidad Scorpion

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.455
would be in order for this one.

00:27:52.455 --> 00:27:55.538
(upbeat Latin music)

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.460
It's not really that spicy.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.152
The reaper was a lot spicier.

00:28:02.152 --> 00:28:05.235
(upbeat Latin music)

00:28:11.048 --> 00:28:12.465
That's delicious.

00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:15.511
Oh, wow.

00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:18.230
We have come to the end of this just,

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.370
incredible day in Brazil.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.000
This has been such a fun
day, such an educational,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.760
such a learning day.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.593
The highlight for me

00:28:26.593 --> 00:28:30.240
was definitely the drive
out to Ciudado de Goias.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.480
Honestly, a huge thank you
to Guilherme and Rafaela,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.610

eating some of the best food.
