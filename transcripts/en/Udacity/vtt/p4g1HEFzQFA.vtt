00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.630
While less than 2% of the human genome

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.980
actually counts as coding for anything, there are

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.490
more than 20,000 genes in just that 2%.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.000
Now we refer to this major division in the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
genome as protein coding DNA and non-coding DNA.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.220
Now the rest of this lesson will actually continue

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.960
to cover how this 2% of our genome

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.240
still codes for all those proteins. The next lesson

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.147
will actually start to reveal some more about the role of this 98% of non-coding

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:33.545
DNA. To make sure that your understanding of

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.350
non-coding and protein coding DNA sequences is clear,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.710
I've listed five different types of sequence that we could find in a genome. We

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.800
have exons, introns, promoter regions, translated sequence between

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.410
start and stop codons, and untranslated sequence that

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.740
would be transcribed but outside start and stop codons. I want

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.770
you to indicate which sequences is in this list here. Which

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.430
sequences of DNA would be considered either coding or non-coding. So

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.230
we're going to use the number one to represent coding and

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.810
two to represent non-coding. So in each box I want you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.270
to put either the number one or the number two to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.575
indicate whether an exon would be considered part of coding or

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.480
non-coding sequence. Go ahead and pick which answer you think is

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.790
best for each item in the list.
