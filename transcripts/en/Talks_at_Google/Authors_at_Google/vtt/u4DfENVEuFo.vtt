JONATHAN: Happy Halloween.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:22.740
Welcome to Talks at
Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.700
It's great to see
such a big crowd.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.370
I think we all know
why we're here,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.680
because this office is such a
huge supporter of neuroscience.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm sure I'm not
the only person who

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.590
subscribes to alerts
on Google Scholar.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.180
Tim Verstynen, faculty
at Carnegie Mellon today,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.060
this is just a small
sample of his papers.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.680
His co-author, Bradley Voytek
of UC San Diego, similarly.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.860
These are giants in the field.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.790
They're also pioneers in the
field of zombie research.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.790
And there's not a
lot more to say.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.760
I know their parents are
exceptionally proud of them.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.770
I know we're eager
to hear what Tim

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.870
has to say about developments
in this emerging field

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.430
that he is helping
to blaze a path in.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.630
So without further
ado, please join me

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.390
in welcoming the
author of this seminal

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.210
and groundbreaking book, "Do
Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep?:

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.860
A Neuroscientific View of the
Zombie Brain, Tim Verstynen.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.500
TIM VERSTYNEN:
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.940
And Happy Halloween everybody.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.110
Thanks for coming.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.360
Before I get into
it, I just would

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.810
like point out that my
collaborator, Bradley Voytek,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.540
and I have kind of
teamed up on this.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.250
And what you're going
to see is a hobby

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.285
that's gone out of hand.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.230
We are both zombie geeks.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.940
And how this started was
that in graduate school,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.940
we were both in
the same program.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.194
And on our off hours,
we liked to just geek

00:01:58.194 --> 00:01:59.360
out and watch zombie movies.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.744
And being nerds,
we decided, well,

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.410
what would happen
with the zombie brain?

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.090
And it all went
downhill from there.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.229
So you're about to see
the aftermath of that.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.110
But before I really get into
the nitty gritty details, just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.150
a disclaimer, I'm going to be
showing clips from some zombie

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.400
movies, primarily "Night
of the Living Dead,"

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.442
because it's the best
zombie movie ever.

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:20.900
So there's going
to be a little bit

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.560
of 1960-style gore
and some spoilers.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.371
So just be warned.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:27.870
All right.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930
So I get asked
this question a lot

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.130
by my colleagues
in neuroscience,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.960
why zombie neuroscience?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.790
Why are we doing this silly
endeavour on our off hours

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880
instead of writing
another grant?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.732
Well, Brad and I are both big
science outreach advocates.

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.440
And one of the things
we're interested in

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.370
is trying to get general
audiences more engaged

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.950
with basic science information.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.120
By and large, the way
the broader public

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
gets science is filtered through
types of media sources that

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.770
try to spin and make big
mountains out of small mole

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.562
hills.

00:03:01.562 --> 00:03:02.770
And often, it gets distorted.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.930
So we need to get the
general public more engaged

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.465
in the real core
scientific literature.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.590
So we've thought about
possibilities of doing this.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.580
One, we thought about using
internet memes as our figures

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.040
to illustrate our findings.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.510
So use your LOL Cat to
display Hebbian networks.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.900
That didn't go over so well.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.940
We pondered, accidentally,
releasing sex tapes

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.520
during our lectures to get a
broader audience coming in.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.080
Our lawyers suggested
that we don't do that.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.100
And we thought, well, maybe
we could attract more readers

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.610
to our journal
articles if we just

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.950
added a Kardashian
to the author list.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.900
Again, apparently, you
need their permission

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.566
in order to put them
on the author list.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:42.550
So this didn't work.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.600
And each one of these approaches
has the following structure.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.610
What we're doing is we're
trying to take aspects

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.910
of popular culture and inject
it into science to pull people

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.050
into the basic science.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.540
And it's kind of hard to do.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.270
So what we need to do
is instead flip this

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.170
and say, bring science
into popular culture.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.890
How can we start bringing your
real scientific principles

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.560
into popular culture in
order to educate the broader

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.370
public on scientific issues?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.980
And so this was
our first attempt

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.330
at this kind of leveraging
science information

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.320
into popular culture.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.490
And so, of course, us
beings zombie nerds,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.649
well, we're going to take
a look at zombies first.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.370
They're actually
a perfect example

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.680
for exploring neuroscientific
ideas in this broader context.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.500
So that's why
zombie neuroscience.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.320
So for the next about half
an hour or so, bear with me.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.930
We're going to be
suspending our disbelief

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.880
and pretending that outside
around Kendall Square,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.200
the undead are walking around.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.880
In fact, on a Halloween
like today, there probably

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.890
are undead walking
around Kendall Square.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.480
So welcome to "The Science
of Surviving the Zombie

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.460
Apocalypse," more importantly,
the neuroscience of it.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.170
So as a scientist and as a
neuroscientist, in particular,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.910
when I see a zombie
like this woman here,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.830
I see an undead creature, yes.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.340
But I also see a spectrum
of very particular types

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.950
of behaviors that
you see repeated

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.620
again and again and again
in "The Walking Dead."

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
You see things like
hyper-aggression,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.300
memory deficits,
attention problems.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.030
You'll see language disruption,
reduced impulse control,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.520
movement disorders, and even
visual recognition impairments.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.240
And these are seen across
almost every genre of the zombie

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.370
movie.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.060
So as a neuroscientist,
this tells us

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.370
something very interesting.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.080
This gives us some
pretty key insights

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.360
into what's happened to
this individual's brain

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.610
as she's gone from being
a high school cheerleader

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.600
into being a ravenous zombie.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.080
So using this collective
set of behaviors

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.455
that have changed
into zombie, we

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:52.070
were able to
actually reconstruct

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.170
a model of what the
zombie brain looks like.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.830
So let me show you
our model here.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.330
So on the left right here is a
normal, neurologically healthy

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.592
human individual.

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.925
There's lots of tissue packed
into a really small space,

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:05.000
so it's very wrinkly.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.110
And it's a very robust,
healthy looking structure.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.490
On the right is
the zombie brain.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.910
And what you see is
lots of big gaps,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.900
lots of space that's unused.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.580
In fact, this
little guy back here

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.370
is completely gone
in the zombie brain.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.660
We're going to get to
that a little bit later.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.290
So this shows atrophy
in the zombie brain.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.340
And this atrophy that
you're seeing isn't random.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.010
Each one of the areas that's
decayed away in the zombie

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.520
brain reflects a very
particular symptom

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.570
that we see in zombieism
So the goal of "Do Zombies

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.880
Dream of Undead Sheep?"
is to take apart

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.250
the behavior of zombies
and link it back up

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.770
to each one of these brain
regions that's been atrophied

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.507
and destroyed in zombie brain.

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.090
So that's what we're
going to do today

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.520
and just looking at a
few of these symptoms.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.680
Now, before we do,
we're scientists.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.330
We like to take what seems
like supernatural phenomenon

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.690
and make it dry and boring
and clinically defined.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.150
So we're going to
define zombieism

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.785
not as zombies, but as
a clinical disorder.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:06.910
And so we're going to call
it Consciousness Deficit

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.910
Hypoactivity
Disorder, CDHD, which

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.180
is defined as the loss of
rational, voluntary, and

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.160
conscious behavior
that's been replaced

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.190
by delusional/impulsive
aggression,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.540
stimulus-driven attention,
and the inability

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.400
to coordinate motor or
linguistic behaviors.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.740
There, we've stripped
away all the really weird

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.350
supernatural stuff and made
it a nice, clean studyable

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.240
phenomenon.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.952
Also, with a cool
name like CDHD,

00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.660
maybe we can get a
pharmaceutical company

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.390
to fund our research.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.100
All right, so from
now on, we're going

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.646
to be calling zombieism CDHD.

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:38.020
And we're going
to try to explore

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.490
the neural underpinnings
of CDHD by going

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.080
through a set of symptoms
that we see with the disorder.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.830
So the first symptom or the
first behavioral characteristic

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.730
that people notice when
they encounter the undead

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.660
is their hyper-aggression.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.570
Let's see an example
of this behavior.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.020
This is Karen.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.350
Karen's just recently
turned to the undead.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.440
And here she's, I believe,
eating the arm of her father.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.226
And let's see what happens when
Karen runs into her mother.

00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:08.218
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:10.694
-Karen.

00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:11.194
Karen?

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:15.162
Karen.

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:19.626
Oh baby.

00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:23.098
Baby.

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:28.320
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
Because you always

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.941
got to get the garden shears.

00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:30.441
-Ah.

00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:36.777
Aaaah.

00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:37.610
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.850
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: OK,
we'll save you the blood

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.500
and gore there.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.020
But I think it's pretty
safe to say that Karen's

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.929
pretty angry with
her mother, right?

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.160
Most normal kids who are
not angry with their parents

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.790
don't grab a garden shear
and start stabbing them.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.280
So this type of
aggression is interesting

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.730
because it's very reflective of
a well-described type of anger

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.640
known as reactive-impulsive
aggression.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.086
This is, and this
is a quote from

00:09:02.086 --> 00:09:04.460
an actual scientific paper,
"a subtype of aggression that

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.640
can result in sudden,
heightened, enduring, or

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.590
inappropriate
aggressive responses."

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.624
So this is the stimulus-driven
type of aggression

00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:15.040
that you'll see when you engage
the body's fight or flight

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.837
responses.

00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:18.420
And it's very different than the
type of aggression you see in

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.380
say something like a
school shooting, which

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.101
is a very calculated, decisive,
cool type of aggression.

00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:27.100
And we know a lot about
the neural underpinnings

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.433
of this reactive-impulsive
aggression, what we sometimes

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:32.280
call as road rage aggression.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.540
So this type of
aggressive behavior

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.506
is well-characterized
in many animal models.

00:09:36.506 --> 00:09:38.630
So we've laid out a lot of
the neural circuits that

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.550
drive this type of response.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.120
So let's take a look at
those neural circuits.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.320
The control of aggression,
normally in hopefully everyone

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.970
in this room, is
regulated by areas

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.600
in the front of the brain
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.870
usually around what's known
as the orbital frontal cortex

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.880
or complex.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.110
And this is a set of
higher level brain areas

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.790
that regulate a lot
of different things.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.040
But one of the things they
do is they regulate control

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.790
in subcortical
networks, networks

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.010
that are buried
deep in the brain.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.920
And in particular, one
area known as the amygdala

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.340
receives extensive input from
this orbital frontal complex.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.370
And what this does is it
acts as like a cooling

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.400
mechanism for amygdala function.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.640
So the orbitofrontal cortex
is doing the, shh, it's OK.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.450
It's OK.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.364
And the amygdala
is hypersensitive

00:10:25.364 --> 00:10:27.030
to potential threats
in the environment.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.007
It's always looking
for a threat.

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:31.590
So if we wanted to couch this
in Freudian terms,-- and please,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.400
I hope my department chair
doesn't hear me talking about

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.100
Freud in this talk-- you can
think of the amygdala as being

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.770
the id and the orbitofrontal
cortex is being superego.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.180
It's trying to keep this
reactive, primal, instinctive

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.440
fight or flight response intact.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.960
So the amygdala
controls aggression

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.950
through a very particular set
of interactions between areas

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.130
known as the hypothalamus and
thalamus, which in turn send

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.430
excitatory projections to
an area of the brain known

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.980
as the periaqueductal gray.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.750
This is buried deep,
deep in the brain.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.820
And the periaqueductal
gray stimulates

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.300
your arousal mechanisms.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.650
So it's what gets you ramped up,
and in this case, aggressive.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.250
So normally, the prefrontal
cortex is saying calm down.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.900
Don't react.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.390
That guy cut you off in traffic.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.130
Don't throw a brick
through his window.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.100
But if you remove the
orbitofrontal cortex

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.630
from the equation, what
happens is the subcortical

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.870
fight or flight
responses are unchecked.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.800
So you get an unconstrained
amygdala response,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.270
which through this
network of other areas,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.600
increases sensitivity
to reactive behaviors.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.050
And what you get if you wipe
out those prefrontal control

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.360
mechanisms is you get a
unconstrained, impulsive rage.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.930
You get more appetite
diregulation, chronic stress

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.940
responses.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.240
You'll even get
appetite disregulation.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.390
So these are all behaviors that
you see in animals with damage

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.570
to the orbitofrontal areas.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.210
And you also see it in zombies.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.760
So I think it's a
pretty good guess

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.310
that that's what we're
seeing, at least in this case,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.540
with zombies.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.510
So if we look at the human
brain and the zombie brain side

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.880
by side, the
orbitofrontal areas that

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.010
tend to control those
type of reactive response

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.120
rest right up here.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.620
This is the front side of
the brain, looking at front.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.685
And this is the underview
of the brain here.

00:12:11.685 --> 00:12:13.130
If we look at the
zombie brain, we

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.790
see an atrophy of these
prefrontal networks.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.170
So that control
region has gone away.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.579
But that's not all.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:22.870
We don't just see extensive
damage to the zombie brain.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.960
We actually see some
plasticity as well.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.940
So if we look at those
subcortical areas,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.900
like the amygdala
and the thalamus--

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.640
so this is a slice through
the brain right about here

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.890
on the left showing
the amygdala in red.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.390
And this guy in the right, this
is a slice through the brain

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.850
this way showing the thalamus.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.170
If we look at the volume of
these two subcortical areas,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.850
the humans are displayed
in gray and zombies

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.940
are displayed in orange.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.660
And we see-- actually, these
areas should be bigger.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.880
These areas are more
enlarged in the zombie,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.580
or the CDHD subtypes, than
what you see in humans.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.040
So they're unconstrained.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.780
They're using more resources and
they're building more neurons.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.930
So they're becoming
more sensitive.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.040
So this explains
a little bit how

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.170
you have this reactive
aggression in the zombie brain.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.220
So let's look at another
symptom of the zombie epidemic,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.875
or the CDHD epidemic.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:17.250
Let's look at
visual recognition.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.430
I'm going to show you two scenes
of the same two individuals.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.550
The first is a scene before
this gentleman here, Johnny,

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.320
has turned.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.800
And this is his sister Barbara.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.466
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:28.720
-To really be scared here.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.190
-Johnny.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.940
-You're still afraid.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.730
-Stop it now.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.330
I mean it.

00:13:37.178 --> 00:13:41.350
-They're coming to
get you, Barbara.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.060
-Stop it.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.893
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:44.390
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
OK, so it's very

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.920
obvious he knows who
this person is, right?

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.370
Now, let's look at Johnny
after he's become a zombie.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.840
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.290
-No.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.210
No, get out.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.190
No.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:04.110
No Johnny, no.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.050
No, no,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.890
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
So, notice he doesn't

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.860
have that glint of
recognition in his eye.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.990
He doesn't see his sister.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.010
He just sees a human that
he can devour, right?

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.580
He doesn't recognize her at all.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.090
This seems to be a
common phenomenon

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.220
throughout the zombie genre.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.240
You see it many times, two
high school sweethearts.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.980
One gets bitten and
turns into a zombie.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.270
As soon as they turn
into the zombie,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.320
they start to eat the
cheek of their loved one

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.903
because they no
longer recognize them.

00:14:34.903 --> 00:14:37.290
They just react as if this
is just some random person

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.210
that they can devour.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.990
And this type of visual
recognition problem

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.090
resembles a well-described
psychiatric disorder

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.100
known as Capgras Delusion.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.079
Capgras Delusion
is the false belief

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:51.620
that the people you know well
have been replaced by impostors

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.010
and are typically
seen of as a threat.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.180
This is the invasion of the body
snatchers psychiatric disorder,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.190
It's a very real disorder.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.994
So you wake up one
morning and suddenly,

00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:02.660
that's not your wife
laying next to you.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.620
That's some alien that's
inhabited your wife's body.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.970
She might look, sound,
talk like my wife,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.240
but she's not really my wife.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.310
This isn't always bad.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.726
There was a case
report of a woman

00:15:12.726 --> 00:15:15.550
who was in a miserable
marriage for years.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.662
She had a stroke,
developed Capgras Delusion

00:15:17.662 --> 00:15:19.620
and was convinced that
her husband was replaced

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.690
by Casanova and
that she was having

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.150
illicit affair
with this Casanova

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.160
that was in her husband's body.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.743
And their love life
actually improved.

00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:28.370
So it's not always bad.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.970
But Capgras Delusion is
a psychiatric problem,

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.870
which means it's characterized
at this behavioral level,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.990
but we don't really know the
neural underpinnings of it.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.460
But the phenomenon
is very similar

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.030
to a well-described
neurological phenomenon

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.820
known as prosopagnosia.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.010
Prosopagnosia is the inability
to delink a person's identity

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.320
to the visual image
of their face.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.070
So in the classic scenario,
somebody with prosopagnosia,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.250
you stand them in front
of a mirror and say, who's

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.790
looking back at you?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.900
And they won't be able
to tell you who they are.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.630
They'll just say, I see a face.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.590
I see that person.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.340
They've got a beard.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.350
But I don't know who they are.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.585
Or another famous example
is an experimenter

00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:11.840
will be showing a set
of faces on the screen.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.430
The experimenter's face
will come on the screen.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.270
The experimenter's
right here and the guy

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.700
asks, who are you
seeing on the screen?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.250
And the patient will
reply, I don't know.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.190
Somebody.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.010
So this type of
disorder has been

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.210
described in the neurological
literature for about 100 years

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.090
or so now.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.330
And it's linked to
disorders or damage

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.430
to a particular network of areas
in the brain known as the face

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.200
network.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.630
OK So the face
network, particularly

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.580
an area known as the
fusiform face area

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.550
are a well-described
set of brain areas

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.400
that are sensitive
to seeing faces

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.610
more than any other object.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.210
In fact, the face area
was first described at MIT

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.422
by Nancy Kanwisher
about 20 years ago.

00:16:56.422 --> 00:16:58.255
So the way the face
network is characterized

00:16:58.255 --> 00:17:01.627
is let's say I put you in an
MRI and look at the functional

00:17:01.627 --> 00:17:03.710
activation of your brain
when I show you pictures.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.680
So I show you a picture
of this dude here.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.710
And then I show you
pictures of houses or cars.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.050
And I say, which areas are
more active to this face

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.720
than to these cars?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.280
Well, what you
would see is a set

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.780
of regions in the
back of the head

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.910
on the underside
of the neocortex.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.400
So each one of these blobs
here shows a separate region

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.089
that's more responsive to
this face than anything else.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.780
This is sometimes known
as the core face network.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.480
And what these are is a set of
well-connected brain regions

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.440
that basically deconstruct
the visual image of the face,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.140
reassemble it, and link it
categorically to an individual.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.740
So it's a stream of information,
starting in the back

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.380
where the primary
visual cortex is

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.804
that just sees spatial features,
and keeps moving forward

00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:48.220
to higher level
areas of the brain

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.050
until it's linked up to a face.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.650
So damage to any
part of this network

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.886
can lead to prosopagnosia.

00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:57.290
And I'm going to show you
an interesting example

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.320
of temporarily
induced prosopagnosia.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.630
What we're going
to see is a patient

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.400
is about ready to
undergo neurosurgery.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.960
He's got a tumor
in the underside

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.220
of his brain near that
core face network.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.952
And surgeons want
to resect the tumor,

00:18:09.952 --> 00:18:11.910
but they don't want to
make him prosopagnosiac.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.080
So what they did is they
implanted stimulators

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.331
on the underside of his brain.

00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:16.955
And what they're
going to do is they're

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:18.400
going to stimulate
different parts

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.489
and see where does his face
perception get disrupted.

00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:24.030
And that way, they can map out
where the face selective areas

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.810
are and the neurosurgeon
can work around them.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.910
So you're going to
see two trials here.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.160
In one trial, the
experimenter isn't

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.560
going to deliver any
stimulation at all.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.280
In the second trial,
they're actually

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.470
going to deliver stimulation.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.540
So this took place in Stanford.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.650
And this patient has no
neuroscience or psychology

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.592
background whatsoever.

00:18:43.592 --> 00:18:45.050
So he doesn't know
what's going on.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.716
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:47.290
-Just look at my
face and tell me

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.670
what happens when I
do this, all right?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.470
-OK.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.576
-One, two, three.

00:18:57.576 --> 00:18:58.543
-Nothing.

00:18:58.543 --> 00:18:59.043
-Nothing.

00:18:59.043 --> 00:19:01.000
OK.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.896
I'm going to do
it one more time.

00:19:02.896 --> 00:19:06.510
Look at my face.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.000
One, two, three.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.930
-You just turned
into somebody else.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.680
-Tell me about it.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.890
-Your face metamorphised.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.000
Your nose got saggy.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.300
It went to the left.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.520
You almost looked like
somebody I had seen before,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.404
somebody different.

00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:26.070
That was a trip.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.903
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:26.903 --> 00:19:28.700
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: I
love that last line.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.570
So just a brief stimulation
of these face areas--

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.430
in this particular case, it was
the fusiform form face area--

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.230
caused this disruption of
the perception of the face.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.706
And so as the clip goes on,--
I don't have time to show you

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:43.914
the entire clip-- the
experimenter keeps turning down

00:19:43.914 --> 00:19:46.060
the voltage and keeps
turning down the current.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.980
And eventually he says,
your face didn't change.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.370
I just didn't know you were you.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.805
So the disconnect between
seeing the face and the identity

00:19:54.805 --> 00:19:57.350
of the experimenter-- he was
looking at the experimenter.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.620
He knew who this person
was-- just got disconnected.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.300
So this is a great example
of a transiently induced

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.800
prosopagnosia.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.400
The whole image of the
face just got torn apart.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.240
So the face network is part
of a larger visual network

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.790
in the brain known as the
ventral visual stream.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.530
And so this is the ventral
visual stream in one

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.050
of our zombie
experimental subjects.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.350
So this is the primary visual
cortex here and information

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.430
that flows on the
underside of the brain,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.440
mostly along the temporal lobe.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.090
And this is the
undercurrent here.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.890
It's part of the
ventral visual stream.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.060
So this is the fusiform face
area I talked about earlier.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.712
This is known classically
as the "What" pathway.

00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:40.170
It's the pathway
in your brain that

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.000
tries to assemble
object knowledge

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.470
and recognize
objects in the world.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.779
So if we look at this
"What" pathway in a human,

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:48.570
if we did a slice right
through the brain--

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.240
this would be a saggital
slice right through here.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.000
This is the main core
of the "What" pathway

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.640
on the left and right side.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.410
In the zombie brain,
the "what" pathway

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.760
would be extensively damaged.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.610
So they would have impaired face
knowledge, object knowledge.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.590
And this is actually
where the fusiform face

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.540
area sits in the
right hemisphere.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.550
So we're going to say
that not only are zombies

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.820
losing the prefrontal
control of their aggression.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.930
They've also lost the
ability to recognize

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.070
faces in other objects
with few exceptions.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.330
Another classic
deficit we see in CDHD

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.950
all the time is language.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.470
Zombies don't talk.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.280
In fact, I'm going to show
you an example of the most

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.410
fluent zombie we know of,
if you ignore that movie

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.060
"Warm Bodies."

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.490
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
OK, that's Tar Man.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:44.500
Tar Man is the individual who
single handedly linked brains

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.460
to zombies.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.136
Up until Tar Man, brains
and zombies weren't linked.

00:21:48.136 --> 00:21:49.760
Zombies would eat
any part of the body.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.220
They would go for the liver
before they'd go for the brain.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.420
But Tar Man had a
particular taste for brains.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.592
And so he was the one who was
always going after brains.

00:21:58.592 --> 00:22:00.050
But I want you to
notice something.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.850
Here, he was asking
this teenager

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.400
if he could eat her brains.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.334
But he didn't say,
can you come over

00:22:06.334 --> 00:22:07.750
here so that I can
eat your brains

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.440
or please come by because your
gray matter looks delicious.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.900
No, he just said, brains.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.760
You got the idea, but it
was a single-word sentence.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.480
That type of
phenomenon, if we see it

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.500
in clinical
neurological patients,

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.520
is known as telegraphia.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.410
So the idea being that patients
who are having difficulty

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.260
getting words out will resort
to just the most critical parts

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.560
of the sentence, the most
critical semantic parts

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.590
of the sentence, and take
away all the other fluency.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.890
And the name comes
from the old telegraph

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.980
for long-distance communication
a hundred and some years ago.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.900
In that case, you
paid by the character.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.360
So you had to make your notes
short, sweet, and to the point.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.180
The same is true
with these patients.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.860
They have trouble
getting out words.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.880
So the whole idea
just to get out

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.730
the key, most important
parts of the sentence.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.520
Now telegraphia is
a symptom that you

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.260
see in a larger class of
disorders known as aphasias.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.089
And aphashias are broad
term that reflect, really,

00:23:06.089 --> 00:23:08.130
any language deficit, but
there's many sub-types.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.850
So for example,
there's the inability

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.720
to produce language,
which is classically

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.030
known as Broca's aphasia,
or difficulty comprehending

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.410
language, which is classically
known as Wernicke's aphashia.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.520
And each one of these two areas
has different cortical sources

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.460
that play a larger part in the
language networks of the brain.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.360
So this is Tar Man in here
holding his favorite dish.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.420
So this is the human
brain right here.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.260
We're looking in the left side.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.460
So Broca's area is
right up here in front.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.270
And this is the area
that if you damage

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.830
it gets you Broca's aphasia.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.440
It's tightly linked up
to the motor cortex.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.080
And it's single handedly linked
to the language production

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.850
end of things.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.670
So it's what forms
your mouth movements

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.090
and your gestural patterns
to producing language.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.310
In the back, right
by the temporal lobe

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.150
and the parietal
lobe, where they meet,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.280
you see Wernicke's area,
which is a region that's

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.250
linked to language
comprehension.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.560
So if you damage Wernicke's
area, you can get words out.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.940
They're just discombobulated.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.610
They're not well-structured.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.300
You also have difficulty
understanding people.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.810
And these two areas
are connected together

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.757
by a very large bundle of
white matter pathways known

00:24:24.757 --> 00:24:25.840
as the arcuate fasciculus.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.910
These are big superhighways
of the brain that

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.735
connect Wernicke
and Broca's area.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.860
When you think about as
language, what you're doing

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.120
is you're constructing the
idea and semantics of what

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.844
you're saying.

00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:37.510
You're shipping all
that information out

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.110
to the output area of the
language circuit and saying,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.340
ship out this information
to the rest of the world.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.930
So information typically
flows from Wernicke's over

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.890
to Broca's.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.220
And damage to any
one of these areas

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.030
will impair language function.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.460
So if we look at this circuit
in the human and zombie brain,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.710
this is the human on the left.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.850
Broca's would be
right about up here

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.900
and Wernicke is right
about back here.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.590
If you look in the zombie
brain, we see extensive atrophy

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.470
in both ends of the circuit.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.810
So basically, this tells us,
don't try talking to a zombie.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.310
They're not going
to understand you.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.590
And they're not really
going to talk back,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.610
except for maybe
asking for your brains.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.170
So this could
explain how you get

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.115
these sorts of language fluency
problems in the CDHD disorder.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.910
The final symptom I'm going to
go over for CDHD is movement.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.220
And this is what really
when you ask somebody

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.240
to pretend to be a zombie,
the first thing they do

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.920
is move and walk like a zombie.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.344
So let's see a classic
zombie movement here.

00:25:36.344 --> 00:25:37.760
I want you to pay
attention to how

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.755
these creatures are walking.

00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:39.421
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:39.421 --> 00:25:47.191
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:48.024
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:48.024 --> 00:25:49.232
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: All right.

00:25:49.232 --> 00:25:53.780
So we have arms out, wide,
lumbering, stiff stance.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.920
They tend to do this.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.690
So there's obviously
something wrong with the way

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.280
their brains are
coordinating their actions.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.700
So let's take a quick look
at the general circuits

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.830
in the brain that
regulate our movements.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.960
There are three, big
collective circuits

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.724
in the brain that
drive our actions.

00:26:12.724 --> 00:26:14.265
There's actually
many more than this.

00:26:14.265 --> 00:26:16.750
These are just the
big sets of them.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.520
In the neocortex, you have
the cortical motor areas.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.030
So this is our
zombie subject here.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:22.905
This is their brain.

00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:25.925
Everything shown here in gray
are cortical motor areas.

00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:27.300
And this is actually
a collection

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.350
of a few dozen different
areas that collectively

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.794
coordinate your actions.

00:26:31.794 --> 00:26:33.210
And they're
responsible for things

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.950
like sensory integration,
movement planning, and movement

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.090
execution.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.070
So they kind of plan what to
do with the marionette strings

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.880
of your muscles and joints
and coordinate those movements

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.610
together.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.390
Underneath the motor cortex
and deep in the brain

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.330
is an area known as
the basal ganglia.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.470
This is the second
major motor pathway.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.200
So this little alien
looking creature in here,

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.770
that's a subcortical
nuclei and part

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.020
of the basal ganglia circuit.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.070
And what they do is they're
responsible for gating

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.430
or inhibiting actions.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.710
So really, they're the
gatekeepers of the movements

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.766
that you execute.

00:27:09.766 --> 00:27:11.640
So they decide whether
or not you're actually

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.470
going to throw a brick
through a window or not.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.070
So they kind of make that
final output decision.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.990
And then on the back
of the head here,

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.910
this is shown
right back here, is

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.250
a little cauliflower-shaped
area of the brain

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.860
known as the cerebellum.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.940
Cerebellum is responsible
for motor timing

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.611
and actual temporal perception
to coordination and error

00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:34.110
correction.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.230
So it's the quality
assessment guy

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.830
that makes sure that your
actions are being conducted

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.980
smoothly and without
major errors.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.920
So each one of these three areas
contributes in different ways

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.180
to different types
of motor control.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.140
Now, when most people look
at the way that zombies move,

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.009
the first thing
they'll say is, oh,

00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:57.550
they look like they
have Parkinson's.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.271
In fact, "Slate" just had a
write up of one of our chapters

00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:01.270
from the book yesterday.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.660
And their first title, before
we got them to change it, was,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.520
"Do Zombies Have Parkinson's?"

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.010
And Parkinson's is a disorder
of the basal ganglia.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.910
So patients with Parkinson's
lose a major pathway

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.290
in this system.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.130
And it results in a
very particular type

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.250
of movement disorders.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.150
But let me show you what
Parkinson's patients look

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.250
like when they have
full-blown movement disorders.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.940
So typically, they'll
have slouched posture.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.700
They're losing postural control.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.820
Their hands are
closer to their sides.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.480
And the way they walk are
short, shuffling steps.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.680
This is a very characteristic
Parkinson's walk.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.850
That's not what we see in
the CDHD disorder at all.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.740
We see wide legs,
stiff, arms out.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.850
There's a balance problems and
these kind a lumbering walks.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.780
That kind of movement actually
resembles a different motor

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.730
disorder known as
spinocerebellar ataxia.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.880
So individuals with SCA,
or spinocerebellar ataxia,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.290
suffer from an
inability to produce

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.180
smooth, coordinated actions.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.010
And it results in these kind
of lumbering movements, balance

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.300
problems, tremors, slurred
speech, visual eye movement

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.270
problems, so a host of
different movement problems.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.010
And they all resolve
around the fact

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.360
that patients with this
disorder are suffering

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.630
from a degeneration of
the cerebellum itself.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.390
So the cerebellum
atrophies away and it

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.210
causes these movement disorders.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.930
In fact, if you want to
know just very little bit

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.590
what it's like to suffer
from this disorder,

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.560
think about the last
time you were drunk.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.500
You had balance problems,
your slurred speech,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.930
your stumbled walk.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.030
Those are all
cerebellar symptoms,

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.260
because the alcohol's explicitly
influencing and affecting

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.400
the cerebellum.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.480
So that's what these individuals
suffer on a daily basis,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.340
without the euphoria of alcohol.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.460
So those kind of movements
are very, very characteristic

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.390
of cerebellar damage.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.600
Now, the cerebellum is probably
my favorite area of the brain.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.120
It's kind of under
appreciated in

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.090
the neuroscientific community.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.860
It contains half of the
neurons in the brain.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.400
So even though the
neocortex is bigger,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.550
the cerebellum contains
half of the neurons.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.100
And it had a sordid history.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.580
There were a ton of really
off the wall theories

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.190
about what the cerebellum did.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.140
Early on, it was
thought to just regulate

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.140
the fluids of the body.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.950
There was once a theory that it
was the battery of the brain.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.400
So it was just doing
voltaic battery generation

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.300
in order to produce
electrical impulses.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.880
But, perhaps, my favorite
early theory of the cerebellum

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.840
came from the phrenologists.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.410
The phrenologists were
the early neuroscientists

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.810
who tried to map out
lumps on the head

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.120
with certain personality
characteristics.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.610
And the phrenologists
thought that the cerebellum

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.930
was the root of the libido.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.900
They thought that
all your sexual drive

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.230
came from the cerebellum.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.920
And they were scientists.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.800
I like to knock
the phrenologists,

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.237
but they practiced
the scientific method.

00:30:58.237 --> 00:30:59.820
And they figured
this out because they

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.630
would go to French
prisons and then feel

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.380
bumps on the heads of
different criminals.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.210
And they just noticed
that criminals

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.270
with chronic, habitual
masturbation problems

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.300
had larger bumps over
the back of their head

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.920
by where the cerebellum was.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.040
So they thought, ah, they've
got large cerebellum.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.870
So that's what's driving
these sexual impulses.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.850
And to their credit,
they'd actually

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.440
tried an experimental
manipulation

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.210
to see if they could
prove this theory.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.150
So in one individual,
this poor female inmate,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.330
they strapped an ice cube
to the back of her head,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.240
strapped it in, tied it
in, a giant block of ice,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.500
and noticed that this inmate
stop touching yourself

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.990
when the ice cube was strapped
to the back of her head.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.560
So voila, they proved
that the cerebellum

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.980
is responsible for the libido.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.210
So if you're like me,
you could probably

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.240
see many different
reasons why people

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.070
would stop touching themselves
with a giant block of ice

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.153
to the back of their head.

00:31:56.153 --> 00:31:58.260
And another
individual who shared

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.830
this theory was this gentleman
here, Pierre Fluorens.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.720
Pierre Fluorens was a
classic neuroanatomist

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.660
and neurophysiologist.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.160
He was really a pioneer
of early neurology.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.720
And he thought this
was ridiculous.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.090
So I'm going to read you
a quote from an article

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.710
about his discovery of how
the cerebellum is actually

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.670
linked to motor control.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.070
"Fluorens dismissed as
unfounded the claims

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.430
for the sexual function
in the cerebellum.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.130
He removed the cerebellum
of a mature rooster.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.850
The animal was still deeply
interested in the hens,

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.670
but motor dysfunction
made it difficult

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.210
for him to express his
feelings towards them."

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.910
I love that little
delicate ending there.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.730
So basically, the
rooster was still randy,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.535
but he couldn't really
coordinate his actions

00:32:40.535 --> 00:32:41.990
to make his affections known.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.860
So this was actually
the first explicit case

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.830
showing that the cerebellum
was linked to motor control.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.550
It didn't happen
until the mid 1800s.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.640
So since then, we've
done a lot of work

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.240
characterizing how
the cerebellum is

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.930
linked to motor control.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.020
Now, cerebellum sits right
back here in the humans.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.450
And over here in
the zombie brain,

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.200
you see that the
cerebellum is pretty much

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.650
completely atrophied.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.250
So these kinds of
movement disorders

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.590
that you see in zombies reflects
severe cerebellar dysfunction.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.930
Any zombie movie
fan in the audience

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.410
is going to be a
little bit frustrated

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.140
at this point
because so far, I've

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.730
only been talking about one very
particular subtype of the CDHD

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.330
disorder, known as the
slow zombie subtype.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.340
These are the
classic early forms

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.080
of the disease as we saw it.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.900
But more recently,
another subtype

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.160
has emerged, particularly
starting around 2002, 2004.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.740
And that's the fast
zombie be subtype.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.100
These guys don't lumber.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.770
They don't have
discoordinated actions.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.770
They can climb.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.120
If you've watched the movie
"World War Z," they can swarm.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.820
And these are vicious,
vicious predators out there.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.990
So we wanted to
say, OK, well, what

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.720
is the difference between
this guy and this guy?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.750
So Brad and I flew
out to England,

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.457
grabbed ourselves a
set of fast zombies,

00:34:06.457 --> 00:34:08.790
brought them back to the lab
and looked at their brains.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.860
And if you compare the
brains of the slow zombie

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.385
to the fast zombie, you see
some very interesting things.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.010
First off, you see
that the fast zombie

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.900
has an attached cerebellum.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.070
So they still have this motor
coordination ability intact.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.829
They also have no atrophy in
the superior parietal portions

00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:27.370
of the brain.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.710
These are the brain
portions up here,

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.001
which means they have actually
better spatial attention

00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:31.800
as well.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.800
So there's not as
extensive brain damage

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.350
in the fast zombies as what
you see in the slow zombie

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.000
variant of the CDHD disorder.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.670
So what drives this difference?

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.330
Why do we suddenly see
this different subtype

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.530
in the disease?

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.650
Well, again, we did
extensive research.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.150
We watched a ton
of movies and then

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.770
had to rewatch them
when we were sober.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.170
The one thing we
noticed time and time

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.300
again was that in the
new, fast zombie subtype,

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.940
the time between infection
and resurrection of zombie

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.790
became quite short.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.450
So we developed what
we call now the time

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.332
to resurrection hypothesis.

00:35:10.332 --> 00:35:12.040
So according to this
hypothesis, the time

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.930
between sudden death due to
infection and resurrection,

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.780
if it's short, as you see in the
fast zombie, the amount of time

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.510
that the brain is starved
of oxygen and glucose

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.042
is relatively short.

00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:24.750
So what happens when
the brain is starved

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.280
of oxygen and glucose is
it starts to die away.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.410
It induces itself into this
hypoxic state and tissue

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.890
loss occurs.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.400
So if that's
relatively short, you

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.850
don't get as extensive
of tissue loss.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.390
But if as in the
older variant, like we

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.380
saw in "Night of
the Living Dead,"

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.590
it would take hours,
days, weeks or months

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.600
in order to resurrect.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.891
And that's going to lead to
much more extensive damage,

00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:48.930
because the brain is
starved of those resources

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.070
for much longer.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.000
The cerebellum and
early visual areas

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.560
are particularly
sensitive to hypoxia.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.350
So this would predict
that we should

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.420
see a negative correlation
between the walking

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.470
speed of an undead individual
and the time at which it

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.467
took them to resurrect.

00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:05.925
So this could explain why we
get the two different subtypes

00:36:05.925 --> 00:36:08.900
of the CDHD disorder.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.540
All right.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.130
So what might cause CDHD?

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:15.350
Well, there's lots of
potential pathogens

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.220
that could cause this disorder.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.400
Viruses are known
to attack the brain.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.210
What you're seeing
here is an individual

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.510
who had a neural infection
with the herpes simplex virus.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.240
So everything you
see here in white

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.819
is calcified neural tissue.

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.360
This is the same
virus that gives you

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.780
cold sores in your mouth,
except every once in awhile,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.180
instead of traveling
out a cranial nerve,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.710
it travels up to the brain.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.800
And it can cause
extensive damage up

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.170
in particularly the
prefrontal cortex.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.610
But most viral damages
we know to the brain

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.110
are very nonspecific
and just very global.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.400
They wouldn't lead to
a very specific pattern

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.630
of a global behavioral deficit.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.370
So we don't think viruses
are what's causing the zombie

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.680
brain, much to the frustration
of the producers of "28 Days

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.580
Later."

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.770
Bacteria is another potential
source of the infection.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.700
This is an image of
an individual who

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.740
had meningitis, which is
a bacterial infection.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.230
And you see that meningitis
ate away, basically, the lower

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.850
quarter of this
individual's brain.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.030
It's a massive
infectious disease.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.170
And the damage that it does
is, again, very nonspecific.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.120
So while viruses
and bacteria are

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.880
known to influence
the brain, they

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.870
don't lead to these coordinated,
specific regional changes

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.610
in brain tissue.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.280
Another potential
candidate is prions.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.690
So prions are little
forms of protein

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:40.350
that can unfold the cellular
structure of basically all cell

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.950
types, but particularly neurons.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.900
And so this is a brain
image of an individual

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.850
with Creutzfeldt-Jakob's
disease.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.630
Everything in white, again,
is areas of calcified tissue

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.480
that have been damaged.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.940
And again, prions
are nonspecific.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.580
Now, I apologize if you
don't sleep tonight.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.240
But another potential
candidate is brain worms.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.820
Yes, brain worms are real.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.580
This is a syndrome known
as neurocysticercosis.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.330
These arrows are pointing
to these little sacks here.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.560
Can you guess what's
in the little sacks?

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.380
Yes, a little tape worm that
buries itself in the brain

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.400
and siphons off nutrients
from your blood supply.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.492
And this happens from eating
fecally contaminated foods.

00:38:20.492 --> 00:38:21.950
And we actually
think it's probably

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.750
epidemic in third
world countries.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.864
But normally, these brain
worms don't do any harm.

00:38:27.864 --> 00:38:29.530
They just take up a
little bit of space.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.280
They siphon off a
little bit of resources.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.200
But they don't cause
big behavioral problems

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.090
until you have, as
I tell you now--

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.780
one patient had three
dozen worms in his head.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.546
He started showing
behavioral symptoms,

00:38:41.546 --> 00:38:43.170
but that was because
his head basically

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.090
turned into Swiss cheese.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.530
So we can imagine the case where
maybe a subtype of these worms

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.530
is forming a chemical
interaction with the brain

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.080
and leading to these slow,
specific behavioral changes.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.890
Another hypothesis that was
put out in the literature

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.745
is if anybody seen the
movie "The Signal,"

00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:05.250
is that TV and radio
transmissions can

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.800
emit a particular EM frequency
that causes the neuron activity

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.697
patterns to change
fundamentally.

00:39:10.697 --> 00:39:12.530
And we know that you
can actually kill cells

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.470
by letting them just fire a lot.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.920
So you could see coordinated
brain damage, which

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.570
we sometimes call
excitotoxicity,

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.880
induced by particular
stimulus inputs.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.240
Again, this is the premise
for the movie "The Signal."

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.560
And at first I thought this
was silly until I saw this.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:28.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.776
[MUSIC RICK ASTLEY,"NEVER GONNA
 GIVE YOU UP"]

00:39:35.497 --> 00:39:36.330
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.205
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: So
I don't know about you,

00:39:38.205 --> 00:39:39.890
but that makes me
want to kill somebody.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.760
So I'm going to go
with the Rick Astley

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.160
theory of the CDHD disorder.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.960
All right, so far
I've shown you how

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.840
you can look at this silly
pop culture supernatural

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.950
entity, this little zombie
here, characterize it

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:02.360
in a very rigorous way
in a scientific manner

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.970
where we can link up specific
behavioral traits to the brain,

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.490
and use real science
to kind of explain

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.310
a relatively silly, supernatural
organism like the zombie.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.960
So this really
shows the potential

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.940
of trying to push
this scientific idea

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.810
into popular culture
in order to educate

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.140
real scientific principles
in the general public.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.640
So in a way, what
we're trying to do

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.110
is keep building this bridge
between popular culture

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.650
and science and get these
to interplay more in order

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.770
to facilitate greater
scientific education.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.430
So if you want to know more,
you can obviously read our book,

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.610
"Do Zombies Dream
of Undead Sheep?"

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.320
We also have a set of
animated videos released

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.080
through the TED-Ed foundation.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.750
They are great supporters
of science outreach.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.920
I love the TED-Ed foundation.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.540
So we have two
videos up about how

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.700
to diagnose the zombie
brain and some fallacies

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.320
in using neuroimaging to explain
brain-behavior relationships.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.940
We also have a set of colleagues
collective in the zombie

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.760
Research Society.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.900
And this is a bunch
of academics who

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.114
use zombies to teach
their particular field.

00:41:03.114 --> 00:41:05.280
Actually, two members of
the Zombie Research Society

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.260
are here in Boston
and Cambridge.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:13.480
Dan Drezner teaches the
politics and political science

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.030
of zombies.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.920
And he's over at Tufts.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.450
And Steve Schlozman is at MGH.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.450
And he's a psychiatrist.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.490
And he does these
psychiatry of zombies.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.290
And he actually published a
novel on the zombie disorder

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.050
as a psychiatric condition,
which is really fun.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.925
And so if you're
not just interested

00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:32.300
in neuroscience
but other fields,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.591
check out the people who are
associated with the Zombie

00:41:34.591 --> 00:41:36.850
Research Society because
they do great work like this.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.697
So thank you guys.

00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:44.661
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:44.661 --> 00:41:46.642
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: So questions.

00:41:46.642 --> 00:41:47.878
Yeah.

00:41:47.878 --> 00:41:51.490
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
popular zombie movies and TV

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.870
shows, where you see them as
truly scientifically inaccurate

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.940
either in general or in
specific important scenes.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.770
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Ah.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.030
Actually, I would say 99% of
the zombies I've seen in TVs

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:09.450
and movies are so unrealistic
as to make them impossible.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.550
There are a few exceptions.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.100
There's a video game,
"The Last of Us,"

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.810
in which a evolution of
the cordyceps fungus, which

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.460
actually induces
zombieism in ants.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.990
Really, it does.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.897
It somehow mutates and
causes the same thing

00:42:25.897 --> 00:42:26.730
to happen in humans.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.354
So you see these
zombies running around

00:42:28.354 --> 00:42:30.340
with giant fungi
attached to their heads.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.287
And that is one that
I thought was actually

00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:35.620
a fairly realistic one, because
they're also not undead.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.130
You can easily kill them.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.730
And then the most
realistic representation

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.470
of zombies that I would say
had the biological plausibility

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.190
were the zombies in the "28
Days Later" and "28 Weeks Later"

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.176
movies.

00:42:49.176 --> 00:42:50.800
And for those you
who haven't see them,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.050
the premise of the movie is
that scientists in Oxford

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.300
are trying to understand rage.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.840
And they develop a virus
known as the rage virus, which

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.010
plays with the aggression
circuits in the brain.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.210
And it gets loose in
the general public.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.460
And what happens is
people just being

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.900
become really just
ravenously aggressive.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.050
They're not undead.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.940
In fact, the premise
is that 28 days later

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.960
means that they're not
thinking about eating.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.120
So they're going to starve
to death in 28 days.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.800
And so you can ideally wait
out the zombie apocalypse

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.780
just by letting them
starve to death.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.530
So I thought that
probably "28 Days Later"

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.440
was the most biologically
possible one.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.110
But even then, the behavioral
patterns and the transmission

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.550
rates were nowhere
near plausible.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.584
The scene that frustrated
me the most was

00:43:34.584 --> 00:43:36.750
at the end of "The Walking
Dead's" first season when

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:38.916
they were in the CDC and
there was this biologically

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:42.030
plausible explanation of
the neuroscience of zombies

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.530
was so bad that it made me cry.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.030
Yeah.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.890
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of realistic zombies,

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:53.830
there's this notion
of the voodoo zombies

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:58.830
and being controlled by drugs
on plantations and stuff.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:03.484
I'm just curious how
that plays into--

00:44:03.484 --> 00:44:04.900
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
Yeah, so that's

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.180
actually another little
side tangent to mine.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.810
Because the zombieism
that you see in Haitian

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.680
voodoo culture is quite
interesting in that it

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.110
has a proposed
neuropharmacological

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.390
explanation.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.060
So there's a classic
book by Wade Davis, who

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.200
was an ethnobotanist,
who went down to Haiti

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.610
and made two particular
pharmacological links

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.840
to Haitian zombies.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.540
And one was
tetrodotoxin, which was

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.730
the poison used
to simulate death.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.690
And tetrodotoxin works by
blocking the sodium channels

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.830
that allow neurons to fire in
the peripheral nervous system.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.340
So your muscles
become paralyzed.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.150
And it actually won't kill
you unless your diaphragm

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.430
stops working.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.760
So basically, it kills you
because the diaphragm muscle

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.343
stops working.

00:44:50.343 --> 00:44:53.180
But if you get a low
enough dose, what'll happen

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.460
is that your diaphragm will
keep moving so slowly that you

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.640
can't really detect it.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.050
But in all intents and
purposes, you look dead.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.300
So that's the simulated death.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.560
And then the control
aspects, he proposed

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:11.610
that the bokors, who are the
bad or evil voodoo priests,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.925
would dose the individual after
the tetrodotoxin had worn off

00:45:14.925 --> 00:45:16.660
when they dug them
out of their grave

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.900
that they were buried
alive in, would douse them

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.010
with datura, which has
three major psychoactive

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.670
ingredients, [? hyoscapines ?],
scopolamine, and atropine,

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.810
I think.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.994
Each one of those will
induce a psychotic state.

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:33.160
And so the idea is that you
can make this person who

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.197
is now convinced this he's dead,
because he saw himself dead.

00:45:37.197 --> 00:45:39.530
He was well aware of everything
that's happening to him,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.810
felt buried.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.970
And then he gets raised.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.010
And then there's a
psychoactive chemical

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.190
that keeps him compliant.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.549
That was the Wade Davis theory.

00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:47.340
It's controversial.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.710
It hasn't been replicated yet.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.570
And people are saying that
there's probably other aspects

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.340
to it that link more to
psychological belief.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.730
But yeah, the Haitian voodoo
zombie links to neurobiology

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.030
are quite interesting that way.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.830
Yeah.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:05.220
AUDIENCE: I had two questions.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.490
So one was, what
causes zombieism?

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:13.090
And so in some forms
of movies, it's

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.482
kind of like a venomous
thing, that if you're bitten,

00:46:15.482 --> 00:46:16.190
you're infected--

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.760
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Right.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.250
AUDIENCE: You get it.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.430
In other more recent ones,
it's everyone's infected.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.960
When you die, you're a zombie.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.680
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Right.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.180
AUDIENCE: They're really
different outcomes.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:23.980
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Right.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.520
AUDIENCE: So I don't
know if you had

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.110
any thoughts about
that difference.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:27.630
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.590
The we're all infected
and we're just going

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.180
to reanimate when whenever we--

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:32.930
AUDIENCE: Romero--

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.840
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:
--transition from one state.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.800
Romero was-- so we actually
got to interview George Romero.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.133
And we were asking him about it.

00:46:38.133 --> 00:46:40.130
He said, the way he
made up, particularly

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:43.732
in his first three movies,
he didn't care about it.

00:46:43.732 --> 00:46:45.690
He was trying to use the
zombies as a metaphor.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.850
So in the first one,
he kept it vague.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.994
There was the satellite from
outer space that had come back.

00:46:52.994 --> 00:46:54.410
And it was somehow
linked to that.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.097
But it could have
been space radiation.

00:46:56.097 --> 00:46:57.680
And he was saying
he explicitly didn't

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.090
care about what caused it.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.440
He just wanted them to be there.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.034
In fact, he put the nail
in our coffin of our theory

00:47:07.034 --> 00:47:07.950
about zombie movement.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.980
But I'll tell you
about that later.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.361
So I think what happened
was because the early zombie

00:47:13.361 --> 00:47:15.360
cultures didn't really
care about the mechanism,

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.784
there was lots of
different explanations.

00:47:17.784 --> 00:47:19.450
From a biological
standpoint, it doesn't

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.270
seem like that
would be the case.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.206
So I like the idea of the
infection theory of zombieism.

00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:28.372
AUDIENCE: So like a latent--

00:47:28.372 --> 00:47:30.100
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.840
The real phenomenon that I think
fascinates me the most in this

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.930
is toxoplasmosis.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.130
So toxoplasmosis is a
single cell organism.

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.435
It's what lives in cat poop.

00:47:39.435 --> 00:47:42.450
And it's why pregnant women
shouldn't be around cat poop.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.370
It's because it induces
flu-like symptoms

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.740
if you get the infection.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.780
And it'd be dangerous to
fetuses and young children.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.070
But normally, if you're
an adult and you get it,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:53.960
you just get a flu.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:54.930
It seems to go away.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.500
But really what happens is
it's a single organism that

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.955
reproduces sexually in
the gut of a feline.

00:48:01.955 --> 00:48:04.080
So that's where it gets
its most genetic diversity.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.990
When it's outside the feline,
it can only reproduce asexually.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.680
So it clones itself.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.240
So what this organism does
is even after the infection,

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.530
it stays latent in your system.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.530
And in the mammals
that it infects,

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.720
so the rodents,
humans, it actually

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.470
starts modifying the
neuropharmacology

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.100
of the individual's brain.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.090
And what you see is you see
characteristic behavioral

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:32.035
differences in people who have
had toxoplasmosis assistant

00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:34.900
and survived versus
those who don't.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.670
And the most
classic case of this

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.180
was an experimental
study where they

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.010
took a rat-- and rats
normally hate cats.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.216
They're instinctively
afraid of cats-- gave it

00:48:43.216 --> 00:48:45.410
a toxoplasmosis intervention.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.140
And across time, if
you had a glass wall

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:52.180
between the rat and the cat,
normally the rat's over here.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.290
But as the infection
rate occurs,

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.930
the rat actually
starts to not only

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.090
not be afraid, but want
to be near the cat.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.130
So there's increased
risk taking behavior

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.110
that happens as a
result of the infection.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.909
And actually, that same kind
of behavior, not towards cats

00:49:06.909 --> 00:49:08.575
obviously, but more
risk taking behavior

00:49:08.575 --> 00:49:10.390
is seen in individual
human individuals

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.530
who've had the infection.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.630
So somehow, the
single cell organism

00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.360
is hijacking the
complex circuits that

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.060
induce our ability to be
afraid of certain things

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.630
and it increased risk taking.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:24.260
So that coupled with the
popularization of the infection

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.890
theory of zombies is the
more interesting link there.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.860
And if you're going to ask me
about biologically plausible,

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.312
with the caveat that it's
still way, way far away,

00:49:33.312 --> 00:49:35.895
that is more the route that you
would see something like this.

00:49:35.895 --> 00:49:36.226
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:36.226 --> 00:49:38.100
This is more than the
rat simply becoming

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.790
acclimated to having a cat on
the other side of the wall.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.410
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.050
So you don't see
it all in rats that

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.383
have never exposed to the virus.

00:49:43.383 --> 00:49:46.110
They stay far away.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:46.610
Yeah.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.310
AUDIENCE: The other question
I had, pretty quickly.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:56.000
So you talked about the amygdala
and rage and anger aggression.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.844
So I've heard of Kluver-Bucy
syndrome, which is basically

00:49:58.844 --> 00:49:59.760
uncontrolled appetite.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.460
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:00.860
Yeah.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.620
AUDIENCE: You didn't talk
much about why the appetite

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.745
side, rage can be all sorts
of aggressive behavior.

00:50:04.745 --> 00:50:05.744
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:50:05.744 --> 00:50:08.080
So Kluver-Bucy syndrome is
a rare neurological disorder

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.621
that happens-- it
can only occur when

00:50:09.621 --> 00:50:11.620
you get both amygdala damaged.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.690
And they exhibit
hyperorality, hypersexuality.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.930
And it's a very odd
characteristic feature.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.170
So you caught a
hole in our theory.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.490
Because according to our theory,
zombies should be hyperoral,

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.240
hypersexual.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.030
They should also
be hyperfearful,

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:33.540
because the amygdala actually
controls fight and flight.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.630
So what it's doing is
if you leave it intact,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.130
zombies should be just as
easily spooked as pissed off.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.461
So you did catch the
hole in the theory.

00:50:41.461 --> 00:50:42.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
different way.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.600
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Right.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.100
Right.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.340
All right.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.131
Any more questions?

00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:49.680
OK.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.245
Go ahead.

00:50:50.245 --> 00:50:54.350
AUDIENCE: So with this
CDC blog post a while

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:59.744
ago about what to do in the
event of a zombie outbreak,

00:50:59.744 --> 00:51:01.160
do you have any
critiques of that?

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.000
Did they do a good job?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.020
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: I loved that.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.200
I thought they did a great job.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.700
Because really,
what they were doing

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.430
is epidemic preparedness
and emergency preparedness,

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.640
but just couched in zombies.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.950
It got people's attention.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.717
It got people excited
about doing it.

00:51:14.717 --> 00:51:16.300
Instead of just
doing, OK, we're going

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.880
to pretend that there's
a SARS virus out,

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.240
people habituate
to these things.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.060
But if you do it tongue in
cheek, people got engaged.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.490
I think it got a lot more
people interested in thinking

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:31.200
about preparedness for
epidemics and emergencies

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.910
than if they had just done
anything else, except for maybe

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.780
now, they could probably
do it with ebola.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.160
But otherwise, yeah, I
thought it was a great idea.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.320
And I like seeing agencies
do that tongue in cheekness

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.535
to engage in awareness
and attention.

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:46.910
Did you still have
your question?

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just real quick.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:49.955
First of all, thank
you, super helpful.

00:51:49.955 --> 00:51:52.660
I added more cardio into my life
after I watched "Zombieland."

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.707
So now, I feel more prepared.

00:51:54.707 --> 00:51:57.290
The second was, do you and your
friends at the Zombie Research

00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:00.060
Society plan on doing research
into other parts of the zombie

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.600
body, so beyond the brain?

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.510
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:07.620
So we did a Reddit AMA.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.910
And one of the questions
was about the gut system.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:16.410
And the next avenue
of zombie science

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:17.620
is zombie internal medicine.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.320
Because how do zombies
get their nutrients

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.050
when you've got your entrails
dragging on the ground?

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.920
I think that's a
fascinating question.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.050
So I think that getting
people interested in talking

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.362
about digestive systems
and poop is normally not

00:52:32.362 --> 00:52:33.070
that interesting.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.010
But you couch it in zombies,
it can be interesting.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:40.210
Same with cardiac
systems and blood systems

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.290
from a biological angle.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.260
I think there's lots
on the biological side

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.610
that you could explore
on the zombie body,

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:46.950
because their physiology.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.866
How do you explain how
you could have somebody

00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:51.190
that's got thick,
goop, viscous blood

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.520
but somehow still
manages to be animated?

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.730
So yeah, that would be a fun
avenue on the biological side.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:59.830
And of course, on
the social side,

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.340
you can use zombies
to explain anything,

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.336
different hierarchical
societies.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.900
Zombie cognitive phenomenon
would be really interesting.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.170
So I don't really
think there's anything

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.652
you can't do with zombies just
because they keep changing.

00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:18.360
They're not like
vampires and werewolves,

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.140
which have a very
static structure.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.596
Zombies keep changing with time.

00:53:22.596 --> 00:53:23.970
So you can always
find an example

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:28.949
of a zombie doing something
that you want to study.

00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:31.240
But yeah, I'm waiting for
the zombie internal medicine.

00:53:34.186 --> 00:53:37.100
AUDIENCE: So one connection
that you didn't touch on

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.740
is between rabies and zombieism.

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.430
I've heard people
talk about that.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.890
Any comments on whether rabies
would be or a form of rabies--

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:47.290
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: So a
longer version of the talk,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.380
we actually go over this.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.840
Because when we go over the
memory systems and the impulse

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.550
control systems, those
are all linked up

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.630
to a system known as
the Papez circuit.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.570
That's a classic
neurological circuit

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.510
that was discovered
in the 1930s.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:05.300
And it was discovered
using the rabies virus.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.200
And so what this guy
James Papez would do

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.241
is he was trying to find
the link between emotion

00:54:09.241 --> 00:54:09.930
and intention.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.974
How is it that we can't remember
what we did at the store

00:54:12.974 --> 00:54:14.390
yesterday, but
everybody remembers

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:15.560
where they were at 9/11?

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.300
How do we have these
emotional bonding of memories?

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.950
And so he mapped out
this theoretical circuit

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:24.630
and then would map it out in
cats by injecting the rabies

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.649
virus and watching the
virus propagate from one

00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:28.440
area to the next, look
for the connections.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.530
And he actually made cats
that were memory problems.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.630
They were hyperaggressive.

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.590
So we do a tongue in
cheek thing saying

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.130
that James Papez made
the first zombie cats.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:44.800
But the rabies virus is a very
specific type of infection.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.260
And it's very general.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:51.440
So what it does is it
attacks a particular cell,

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.710
jumps across what's known
as the synapse, which

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:57.122
is the gap between cells,
and keeps propagating down

00:54:57.122 --> 00:54:57.830
to the next cell.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:58.870
And it just wanders.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.074
It just follows
from place to place.

00:55:01.074 --> 00:55:03.240
So if you get an infection
in one part of the brain,

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.657
it's-- where it goes
is determined by who

00:55:05.657 --> 00:55:06.490
it's connected with.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.790
And it'll keep traveling
until it basically

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.190
kills the organism.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.250
Now, normally you
get some symptoms

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.560
like the cognitive disorders.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.210
You'll get delusions and
dementia with rabies infection.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.820
You get hydrophobia.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.610
So individuals infected
with the rabies virus

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:26.792
will be afraid of water.

00:55:26.792 --> 00:55:27.500
They won't drink.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.260
They'll become dehydrated.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.970
And some of those are
explained by the virus

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.490
doesn't survive well when
there's lots of brain swelling.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.360
So it automatically
dehydrates you

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.820
to keep that brain
swelling down.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.500
Things like that
have been put forth

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.750
as explanations for
those kind of behaviors.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.630
But a lot of them
just happen to be--

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.460
people show those when the
virus has spread so far

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.900
throughout the brain as
to basically wipe away

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.460
most of the neocortex.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.986
And so it's nonspecific in the
sense of where it's attacking.

00:55:57.986 --> 00:55:59.610
But we really start
to see the symptoms

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:03.320
once it's just so widespread
as to be catastrophic.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.450
So yeah, the rabies
virus has been

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.120
linked to zombies more
times than anything else.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.210
So the book "World War Z,"
the first name for the virus

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:15.380
was African rabies,
because they first

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.039
talked about in South Africa.

00:56:17.039 --> 00:56:19.080
And there's been a lot of
movies that talk tongue

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.890
in cheek about a
rabies-like infection.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.480
That's just because more of
the hyperaggressive, impulsive

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.670
responses.

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:31.460
But we don't really see
how that's occurring yet

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.290
until you get to this
catastrophic stage.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:37.129
AUDIENCE: You also see that
with the association of bites.

00:56:37.129 --> 00:56:37.920
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN:.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.380
Yeah

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.126
AUDIENCE: Rabies
get's transmitted--

00:56:39.126 --> 00:56:39.830
TIMOTHY VERSTYNEN: Right.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:40.520
Oh that's true.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.020
That's true.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:45.230
Yeah, so it's a good
infectious disease that way,

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.220
to use as a metaphor.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:46.720
Yeah.

00:56:49.753 --> 00:56:50.253
All right.

00:56:50.253 --> 00:56:51.070
Any other questions?

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.030
Thank you guys very much.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.155
Thanks for inviting me out.

00:56:53.155 --> 00:56:54.650
Happy Halloween.
