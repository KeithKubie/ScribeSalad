moment I thought this is an appropriate
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150
moment I thought this is an appropriate
place to talk about stars and so that's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
place to talk about stars and so that's
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.830

science of fun yeah start you off if he
didn't already know stars are basically

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
didn't already know stars are basically
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.990
didn't already know stars are basically
ginormous super hot luminous balls of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
ginormous super hot luminous balls of
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269
ginormous super hot luminous balls of
plasma floating around in space and when

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
plasma floating around in space and when
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.350
plasma floating around in space and when
I say plasma yes

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
I say plasma yes
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.420
I say plasma yes
I do mean the same plasma that you find

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
I do mean the same plasma that you find
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060
I do mean the same plasma that you find
inside of plasma screen TVs and plasma

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

lamps like this this is what stars are

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
lamps like this this is what stars are
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.479
lamps like this this is what stars are
made out of there's somewhere in the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
made out of there's somewhere in the
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.910
made out of there's somewhere in the
region of between 200 to 400 billion

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
region of between 200 to 400 billion
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549
region of between 200 to 400 billion
stars just in our Milky Way galaxy and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
stars just in our Milky Way galaxy and
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.580
stars just in our Milky Way galaxy and
then there are over 170 billion galaxies

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
then there are over 170 billion galaxies
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160
then there are over 170 billion galaxies
in our observable universe so if you do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
in our observable universe so if you do
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200
in our observable universe so if you do
math there are quite a lot of stars you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
math there are quite a lot of stars you
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.639
math there are quite a lot of stars you
probably already know that stars don't

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
probably already know that stars don't
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.410
probably already know that stars don't
really look anything like this but what

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
really look anything like this but what
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849
really look anything like this but what
you might not know is that stars don't

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
you might not know is that stars don't
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650
you might not know is that stars don't
actually really look much like this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
actually really look much like this
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389
actually really look much like this
either there are two reasons as to why

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
either there are two reasons as to why
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.219
either there are two reasons as to why
stars from here on earth look like tiny

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
stars from here on earth look like tiny
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.929
stars from here on earth look like tiny
little sparkly specks of light in the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
little sparkly specks of light in the
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.280
little sparkly specks of light in the
distance and the first reason is that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
distance and the first reason is that
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410
distance and the first reason is that
they are very distant so with our naked

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
they are very distant so with our naked
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240
they are very distant so with our naked
fallible human eyes we can't really see

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
fallible human eyes we can't really see
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770
fallible human eyes we can't really see
them very well and the second reason the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
them very well and the second reason the
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.120
them very well and the second reason the
reason that we actually see stars

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
reason that we actually see stars
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399
reason that we actually see stars
twinkling even though spoiler alert

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
twinkling even though spoiler alert
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469
twinkling even though spoiler alert
stars don't actually twinkle is that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
stars don't actually twinkle is that
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.969
stars don't actually twinkle is that
when the light from the star enters our

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
when the light from the star enters our
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280
when the light from the star enters our
atmosphere it gets refracted or bent a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
atmosphere it gets refracted or bent a
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020
atmosphere it gets refracted or bent a
little bit and then we interpret that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
little bit and then we interpret that
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179
little bit and then we interpret that
bendy light as twinkling in reality

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
bendy light as twinkling in reality
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190
bendy light as twinkling in reality
closer up stars actually look like this

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
closer up stars actually look like this
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469
closer up stars actually look like this
and this time particular is a pretty

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
and this time particular is a pretty
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630
and this time particular is a pretty
well known star it's a called the Sun

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

on earth gives us light and heat and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
on earth gives us light and heat and
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580
on earth gives us light and heat and
stops us from dying stuff like that and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
stops us from dying stuff like that and
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080
stops us from dying stuff like that and
even though the Sun is the nearest star

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
even though the Sun is the nearest star
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.569
even though the Sun is the nearest star
to us it's still about 93 million miles

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
to us it's still about 93 million miles
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.280
to us it's still about 93 million miles
away and it takes light about eight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
away and it takes light about eight
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.690
away and it takes light about eight
minutes to get from the surface of the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
minutes to get from the surface of the
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160
minutes to get from the surface of the
Sun to the surface of Earth but

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
Sun to the surface of Earth but
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.660
Sun to the surface of Earth but
interestingly sunlight is actually much

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
interestingly sunlight is actually much
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370
interestingly sunlight is actually much
older than you might think the light is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
older than you might think the light is
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170
older than you might think the light is
made right at the core of the Sun and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
made right at the core of the Sun and
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209
made right at the core of the Sun and
because the Sun is so friggin massive it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
because the Sun is so friggin massive it
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.459
because the Sun is so friggin massive it
takes like about thirty thousand years

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
takes like about thirty thousand years
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350
takes like about thirty thousand years
to get from the core to the surface

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
to get from the core to the surface

currently is about not
 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.090
currently is about not
like a millisecond old but the light on

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
like a millisecond old but the light on
 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.370

years old science is awesome if you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
years old science is awesome if you
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.360
years old science is awesome if you
wanted to you could fit about a million

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370
wanted to you could fit about a million
 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.940
wanted to you could fit about a million
earths inside of the Sun it's about 109

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.340
earths inside of the Sun it's about 109
times the size of Earth or about that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350

big there's a picture but as big as the
 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.360
big there's a picture but as big as the
Sun is it's still only a relatively

average-sized star in fact when we

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
average-sized star in fact when we
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.630
average-sized star in fact when we
compare it to the biggest star that we

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640
compare it to the biggest star that we
 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640
compare it to the biggest star that we
know of in the universe a star called V

pixel big and then if you like you can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
pixel big and then if you like you can
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.200
pixel big and then if you like you can
think about how big we are compared to

my favorite thing about stars though is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020
my favorite thing about stars though is
 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.900
my favorite thing about stars though is
what they actually do the light and heat

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
what they actually do the light and heat
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.280
what they actually do the light and heat
that they give off is pretty much just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
that they give off is pretty much just
 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.750
that they give off is pretty much just
an affectation of their main purpose

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
an affectation of their main purpose
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.850
an affectation of their main purpose
which is to take hydrogen the simplest

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860
which is to take hydrogen the simplest
 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.650
which is to take hydrogen the simplest
of the elements and build it into more

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660
of the elements and build it into more
 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630
of the elements and build it into more
complicated elements like oxygen and

apple pie just like everything else on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630
apple pie just like everything else on
 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.240
apple pie just like everything else on
earth is essentially just made out of

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250
earth is essentially just made out of
 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.460
earth is essentially just made out of
recycled atoms a star will spend it's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
recycled atoms a star will spend it's
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.320
recycled atoms a star will spend it's
like making new elements in its core

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330
like making new elements in its core
 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.150
like making new elements in its core
until eventually it dies and explodes

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
until eventually it dies and explodes
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.490
until eventually it dies and explodes
and sends those elements out into space

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
and sends those elements out into space
 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.229
and sends those elements out into space
and then those elements go into making

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
and then those elements go into making
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.840
and then those elements go into making
new things like planets and rocks and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850
new things like planets and rocks and
 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.930
new things like planets and rocks and
plants and iPods and people the actual

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
plants and iPods and people the actual
 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.210
plants and iPods and people the actual
elements that go into making me and you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220
elements that go into making me and you
 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.550
elements that go into making me and you
and everything else on this planet were

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
and everything else on this planet were
 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.449
and everything else on this planet were
formed in the furnaces of stars we are

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459
formed in the furnaces of stars we are
 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.970
formed in the furnaces of stars we are
literally made of star stuff and that's

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980
literally made of star stuff and that's
 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.560
literally made of star stuff and that's
one of my favorite things about science

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
one of my favorite things about science
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.880
one of my favorite things about science
is to be able to say something that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890
is to be able to say something that
 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.280
is to be able to say something that
sounds as insane as that but to know

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
sounds as insane as that but to know
 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930
sounds as insane as that but to know
that it's actually true because it's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940
that it's actually true because it's
 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.000
that it's actually true because it's
backed up by hard scientific evidence

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010
backed up by hard scientific evidence
 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.160
backed up by hard scientific evidence
anyway I hope you've had fun with the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170
anyway I hope you've had fun with the
 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.840
anyway I hope you've had fun with the
science today and if you have any

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
science today and if you have any
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.820
science today and if you have any
suggestions for scientific topics that

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830
suggestions for scientific topics that
 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.140
suggestions for scientific topics that
you would like me to cover leave a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
you would like me to cover leave a
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.780
you would like me to cover leave a
suggestion in the comments yo and I will

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
suggestion in the comments yo and I will
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.660
suggestion in the comments yo and I will
see you goodbye you've just had the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
see you goodbye you've just had the
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.600
see you goodbye you've just had the
almost imponderable joy of watching

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610
almost imponderable joy of watching
