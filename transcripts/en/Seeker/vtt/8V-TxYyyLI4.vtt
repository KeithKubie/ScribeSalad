00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
The Kepler space telescope discovered something very strange.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.180
And there're suspicions that could be a sign of alien intelligence.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.720
Scientists aren't saying it's aliens, but, come on!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.960
It's totally aliens!

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.640
Hey everyone tracy here for d news with astronomer
Aaron white from the California Academy

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.880
of Sciences hi Aaron I'm gonna get
excited about aliens you've probably

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.840
heard this week about a super weird
discovery from the Kepler space

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.140
telescope there might be aliens around a
distant star KIC 846 2852 or at least

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.710
that's how it's being reported

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.900
yeah there's a lot of excitement around
the story but we've got to keep ourselves

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.629
grounded essentially the Kepler space
telescope has a specific mission we're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.160
looking for planets around distant stars
Kepler spotted something unusual and that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
has been blown up by the media to huge
proportions we're not saying it's aliens

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.940
but maybe aliens. Let me reiterate astronomers are
not saying its aliens, they're just not

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
ruling out aliens as a possibility
right? So kepler's mission is to look for

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.200
transiting planets around other stars. We've
talked about these on Dnews before, Kepler

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
looks at a star and if a planet passes
between the star and our point of view

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.830
we'd see a dimming lights so think about
it this way normal starlight and the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.119
planet start passing slightly dim more dim
slightly brighter back to normal cause

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.690
the planet's moved away that's
predictable at regular and it's easy to

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.200
spot a planet that way. Right exactly
that's called the transit it's an easy

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.170
way to detect planets around other stars, now just keep in mind a normal run of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.420
the mill a giant planet like jupiter, which by
the way is about a hundred and twenty

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.000
two times larger than the earth, will only
dim a star by about 1% when we see this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.420
transit the crazy thing about this story
is that KIC 8 462 8528 is showing dips in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.849
the ballpark of 20% that, is insane. So this could mean, right Aaron,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.849
that something huge is blocking the stars light
over on TestTube+ Dr Ian O'Neill

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:00.220
astrophysicist and I talked about how a
sufficiently advanced civilization might

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.890
build a Dyson Sphere around a sun! We're
talking about a Dyson spheres come'on! Dyson spheres! So a Dyson Sphere

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.610
is essentially a huge collection of
space-based solar panels that gathers up

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.489
light from its host star in it converts
it into usable energy, any civilization

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.230
that could build one of these things
would get them access to an enormous

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.410
power source but as a side effect it
would block the star's light from

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.750
a distant viewers perspective,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.120
like maybe us. So a Dyson sphere might
explain the observations of KIC whatever

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.280
if your goal is to show other
civilizations of your existence putting

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.920
a beacon like a big artificial thing
around your star would definitely do it. So

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.420
what we're seeing could be explained by
alien intelligence looking to make its

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.750
presence known to other intelligent
beings, but to be honest it could also be

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.760
a lot of other things.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.840
Party pooper.
But that's why astronomers have always got to be careful about making any claims

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.790
about aliens remember aliens or not this
is still a pretty unprecedented finding

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.880
the reason that were even at this point
of mentioning aliens is that so far the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.360
explanations for this huge dimming have
come up pretty short. Good ol' KIC 84

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.440
whatever it is that's an f3 type star
its on its main sequence basically this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.070
means that the star isn't too old it
isn't too young it's a little harder

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.730
than our star which tells us that any
dust clouds left over from its formation

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.310
or particles blown off to the end of the
star's life are unlikely sources for

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.020
this dimming we're seeing. Absolutely, KIC

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.840
whatever also rotate slightly faster
than once per earth day this is way faster

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.210
than the observed dims that we're seeing
meaning star spots which are sun spots

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.500
but just but on stars over there on this
star surface cannot be responsible one

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.600
of their main guess is that some sort of
the collision within the system left

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.750
debris cloud. It could be asteroids
impacting each other, it could be planets

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.390
colliding, but even that doesn't fully
explain this dimming factor normally dust

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.120
from collisions would heat up and then
glow with infrared light which we would

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.770
then be able to detect using
ground-based follow-up surveys and they

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.300
did not detect any IR aliens Aaron say yes!? Uh, still unlikely I'm sorry instead

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.800
the best explanation is actually
commets. Commets?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.220
yeah commets so it turns out that of
commets are in a distant orbit around

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.110
the star and they were recently
perturbed and knocked into the system

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.420
they could have bashed together they
would leave an abscure debris cloud

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.060
that could explain what we're seying commets are in 
white orbit so any debris would move in

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.540
and out of our line of sight so it's
possible that when they did these

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.030
follow-up surveys looking for the ir
missions they could have just missed

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.890
that debris cloud and therefore wouldn't
have seen the infrared left behind.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.120
This is actually the most likely scientific
solution that been offered so far, but it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.770
would have to be a pretty incredible
coincidence that out of the billions of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.490
years the star has yet to live this
event happened in the four year time

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.110
span that Kepler was looking at it
seriously the odds are literally

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.300
astronomical

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.410
astronomical it's important to stress
here that all this talk of Dyson spheres

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.770
an alien it's it's a far-flung idea A.K.A.
as we sometimes say. I hear that you have a saying. Do you want to say it?

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.270
"More research is needed"

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.640
Remember, twenty years ago we just
detected the first batch of exoplanets

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.990
like ever exoplanet research is still in its
infancy the most likely solution is that

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.820
there are some natural phenomenon that
we haven't observed, or we haven't thought

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.410
of yet and that's what we're saying look
astronomers are not saying it's aliens

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.370
and they're not saying it's not aliens
it's like they're saying it's not not

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.130
aliens but we don't know what it is. Yeah,
so here's the thing is that finding life

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.669
beyond Earth is probably the biggest and
most profound discovery that science

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.300
could make

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.940
so we need to be absolutely sure that we
exhaust every other possible explanation

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.849
before you make that claim that aliens
are responsible so you know whenever you

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.340
ask an astronomer is it aliens? the respond
with no of course not there's more

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.879
plausible explanations don't even think
about it but there's always that little

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.120
bit in the background minds that says well maybe. What do you guys think about this

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.819
discovery? is the media blowing it out of
proportion! or is this a conspiracy cover

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.729
up of X-File-ien proportions! Luckily
scientists have explored the idea of

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.500
what alien life might actually look like
if we were to come across it and Amy as

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.409
wages those alien intelligence in this
video here

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.919
the arsenic became a building block for any strength cell when this news came out it was massively

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.509
exciting for the astrobiology and space
world but the discovery was eventually debugged

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.740
so thanks for watching everybody make
sure you subscribe so you get all of our

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.169
videos and Aaran if they have follow-up
questions about aliens I hear they can

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:38.930
find you on Twitter at Astro what? Astro W UT
it's alien so right I mean I can't say yes

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.219
just between you and me aliens? In my heart I want it.
