00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.503
Welcome to "The Next Level," everybody.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.005
[applause]

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.340
- What's up?
- Hi, Tacarra.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.591
- What's going on, Kev?
- How are you?

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.467
You look nice.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:09.384
Oh, well, come on now.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:10.969
Now, born in Belize--

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.304
- Yes.
- But from Bronx.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:13.722
From the Bronx, right?

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.057
Raised right in the South
Bronx, right in the projects.

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:16.099
Raised.
TACARRA WILLIAMS: Raised.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.476
Raised.
TACARRA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:18.560
- Mommy and daddy, or--
- Mommy and daddy.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.062
Mommy and daddy.

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:21.313
- Third-oldest of eight kids.
- What?

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:21.980
Yeah.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.065
Same mommy and daddy?

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:24.775
No TV, no jobs,
no nothing, just--

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:25.734
KEVIN HART: Just--
- Just kids.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.902
--smacking.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.278
One out after the other.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.279
Belly bumping.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.323
TACARRA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, apparently.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.574
I don't-- but I don't want that
visual, so if we could just--

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:33.742
And where are you at?

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:34.952
Where are you at
within the eight?

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.079
I am the third-oldest,
and a twin.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.664
- And you got a twin?
- I do.

00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:39.706
Twin brother or sister?

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.791
- Sister.
- What's your job?

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:41.583
What do you do?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.834
OK.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:43.752
So I am a life skills coach.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.587
I'm a teacher.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:46.838
And I work in all of the
jails in Southern California.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:47.631
And what that is--

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:48.590
Sheesh.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.633
Sheesh.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.717
Yeah.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.094
Yeah, I'm a little hard core.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.345
I took some of that--
KEVIN HART: In the jail?

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:53.929
I took some of
that project with me.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.056
So it works perfect.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.391
The balance works perfect.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.934
Now I mean, was it a--

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.228
was it an easy fit
right out of the gate,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.646
or did it take some
getting used to?

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:03.981
Oh, it took some getting--
because you know, I'm cute.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.357
So uh--
[laughter]

00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:09.778
When you work in a jail
full of men, it is--

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.155
you just got to know how to
set your boundaries up front.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.283
If not, they will
run some game on you.

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:16.118
But you know, growing
up in the projects--

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.577
[inaudible] I'm
gonna crack your head.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.578
Saying stuff like that?

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.455
No.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:21.373
I say, if you're going to
make me feel uncomfortable,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:22.708
we going to all
be uncomfortable.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.084
Is that what y'all want?

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.836
And then somebody be
like, nah, nah, chill.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:26.753
No, chill, chill.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.879
Chill, twin.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:28.547
TACARRA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:30.007
Chill, twin.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.134
Don't even act like that, twin.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.176
Have you ever seen an inmate--

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.219
- Yes.
- Have you ever seen--

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.595
you didn't even
know the question!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.389
[laughter]

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.017
Because it's questions
I get all the time.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.394
And sometimes they
come to my shows.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.937
Oh, are you serious?

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.647
To the point where I
can't even-- in the jail,

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.817
I'm just Miss C. I can't go by--
and that's a random initial,

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.695
just because they'll Google me
if I give them first or last.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.113
They'll find me.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.531
And then they pop
up at my shows.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.659
And then after my show,
they be like, yo, Miss T!

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.910
No.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.870
You don't remember me.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.496
You don't remember me.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.331
TACARRA WILLIAMS: That's
exactly what I say.

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.540
D block.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.374
D block.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.042
5000 floor.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:05.751
You don't remember me?

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:07.336
KEVIN HART: 5000.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:08.003
Remember when you locked
down the one dude?

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.255
It be like, woo woo!

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.840
Well, I would definitely
say this-- you

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.467
have lived an interesting life.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.136
And I think interesting lives
make for amazing stories.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.304
I think right now
it's time for you

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.389
to go to the next
level, Tacarra.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.098
I am so ready.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.099
You go to the next level.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.808
You get them, people, day one.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.809
You send me?

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.561
Go, Tacarra!

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:30.561
Go, Tacarra!
