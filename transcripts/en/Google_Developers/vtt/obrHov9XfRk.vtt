JUSTIN CHU: Hi.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.217
I'm Justin Chu, product
manager of the Places API.

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:05.550
Today I'm going to talk about
how you can use the Places

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.760
API to build location-based
applications.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.480
Location-based applications
are becoming all the rage,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
and for good reason.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.105
With mobile devices,
apps are always at hand

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:17.760
and can provide incredible
value based on the end user's

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.365
location and context.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.240
There's a number of
Google services out there

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570
to help you integrate location
into your app, including

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.871
Google's geofencing
and geocoding APIs.

00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:28.620
Most of those APIs,
however, are typically

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.140
based on user coordinates.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.300
Where the Places API excels is
that it partners user location

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.342
with accurate,
comprehensive local data.

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.800
So your app isn't limited to
working just with coordinates,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100
but instead, real places.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.030
Places, like the
Sydney Opera House,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.080
can help your app provide
more valuable use cases

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.210
than just using
geographic coordinates.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.330
Sharing a place to
meet, attaching location

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.760
to a status update,
adding events to a place,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850
or even creating a list
of must-see attractions

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.080
all become much easier when you
work with real-world places.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.930
So with that, let's take a
closer look at the Places API.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.530
The Places API is part of a
larger Google Maps API product

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.080
family.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.660
And you can use the API through
either a JavaScript library

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.180
or standalone HTTP web service.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.880
The library is available by
the Maps JavaScript API v.3.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.070
The Places API is a
rich local search API

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.940
that includes several powerful
location-based features that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.670
connect your end users to
places they care about.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.620
One of the biggest
features of the Places API

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.170
is our data quality.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.640
The Google Places API is powered
by the same local listings

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.220
database that powers Google
Maps, which includes over

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.620
100 million listings
all around the globe.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.520
These places are all embedded
and moderated by numerous teams

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.330
in order to become
a real Google place,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.450
so developers can rest
easy that their apps are

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.240
using the most up-to-date,
comprehensive, and accurate

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.950
model of the world.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.640
Then moving from the
data side of things

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.600
to more of the
smarts, how many times

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.660
have you groaned when
faced with the address form

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.780
on a mobile app?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.530
Don't your thumbs
deserve something better

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.090
than typing in a full
address in a small keyboard?

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.162
As both a user and
a developer, you

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:59.120
know that while typing
in a location or address

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.320
is hard work, it's often a
vital part of a user flow.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.345
Otherwise, how can
an app send a taxi

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:06.855
to the right pick-up location,
know what area a user wants

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.050
to rent an apartment
in, or ship the product

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.889
to the right address?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.850
To help your app get
the data it needs

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.030
and limit the pain
for your end users,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.140
the Places API offers
an Autocomplete service,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.560
which provides type-ahead
search functionality

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.972
that both Airbnb and Sunrise
Calendar already use today.

00:02:23.972 --> 00:02:27.290
The Autocomplete API allows you
to choose what types of places

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.530
you want to get back.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.484
So, if you're real estate app
that only cares about cities,

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.150
or a travel planning
app that only cares

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.760
about establishments, or let's
say a geotagging app that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.790
cares about both,
Autocomplete can

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.770
be customized to
suit your needs.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.474
If you can't tell ready, we're
huge fans of Autocomplete.

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:45.390
And with its clear
benefits to both developers

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.650
like you and your
end users, we believe

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.290
it's a no-brainer
integration for

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.570
any location-based application.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570
In addition to
Autocomplete, another one

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.830
of the Places API's
primary features is Search.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.480
The Places API has
two main flavors

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.650
of Search, Nearby
Search and Tech Search.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.900
Nearby Search allows you to
define a particular radius

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.159
to discover and explore
establishments close by.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.950
Tech Search returns
information about a set

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.222
of places based
on a query string.

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:14.430
It's like having the magic
of Google Maps' search box

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.736
inside your own application.

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.500
Both endpoints also include
various knobs and levers

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.420
so you can customize what
type of data is returned.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.270
For example, in
this map, we're only

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.207
showing museums
around central Sydney.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.040
Showing specific types
of places is only one

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.492
of the many
customizations you can do.

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.450
You can also choose to
return to your end users

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.570
only places that are open now or
ones at a specific price level.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.230
With the Places API
Search features,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.060
you can enable your
users to find, explore,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.770
and share places
that matter to them.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.140
Finding a place is often
just the first step.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.290
Users might want more
information about a place

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.680
beyond just its name,
location, and type.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.180
For example, if you're building
a travel planning tool which

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.804
suggests restaurants,
shops, and sites and hotels,

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.220
your users will
likely need access

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.950
to phone numbers, price
levels, and hours of operation

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.750
to complete their reservations.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.130
They would also likely
need photos and reviews

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.022
to help with picking the best
places to stay, visit, and eat.

00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:12.230
This valuable place information,
along with a handful

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.020
of other useful
data fields, is all

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.589
available with the Place
API Details service.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.410
To get a place's
details, all you need

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.850
is an identifier, which is
returned from both the Search

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.830
and Autocomplete services.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.990
Now while we're extremely
confident about Google's

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.320
local listing data
freshness, we also

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.020
know that the world's places
change very, very quickly.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.820
And sometimes your end users
may know more about new places

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.160
before we do.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.140
The Places API allows
you to add new places

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.860
so that your users can
interact with them immediately.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.630
Perhaps your app
encourages users

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.644
to share exciting
place with friends.

00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:45.810
What happens if someone
discovers a shiny new Google

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.630
shoe store, and they can't
find it with the API?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.770
You can use the Add a Place
action to add the place

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.160
to the app so that your users
can always interact with

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.760
their model of the world
in addition to Google's.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.310
This was a very quick
overview of the Places API.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.640
There's so much more you can do.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.910
Please click this link to
get to our documentation.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.285
We also have a
thriving community

00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:07.015
of developers on
Stack Overflow, where

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.410
you can ask technical questions
and find tons of advice

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.480
and insight about how to
best use the Places API.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.490
Thanks so much for
checking out this video.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.900
I look forward to
seeing what you

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.970
can do with the
Google Places API.
