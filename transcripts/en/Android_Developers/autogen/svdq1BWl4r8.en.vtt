that we're going to guide you through
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160
that we're going to guide you through
the process of building two applications

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
the process of building two applications
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590
the process of building two applications
we're going to start by focusing on the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
we're going to start by focusing on the
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540
we're going to start by focusing on the
video use case we're going to build a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
video use case we're going to build a
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160
video use case we're going to build a
simple video player app that will play

an mp4 stream then we're going to show

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
an mp4 stream then we're going to show
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.330
an mp4 stream then we're going to show
you how to insert ads alongside that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
you how to insert ads alongside that
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430
you how to insert ads alongside that
video content then we're going to shift

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
video content then we're going to shift
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560
video content then we're going to shift
our focus to audio we're going to show

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
our focus to audio we're going to show
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360
our focus to audio we're going to show
you how to play audio in a background

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
you how to play audio in a background
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100
you how to play audio in a background
service we're going to show you how to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
service we're going to show you how to
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.900

integrate with Android media sessions

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
integrate with Android media sessions
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880
integrate with Android media sessions
and finally we're going to take a look

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
and finally we're going to take a look
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740
and finally we're going to take a look
at some new functionality we've we've

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
at some new functionality we've we've
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110
at some new functionality we've we've
recently released for downloading media

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
recently released for downloading media
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.770
recently released for downloading media
for offline playback so like last year

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
for offline playback so like last year
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510
for offline playback so like last year
we're hoping to have a mixture of some

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
we're hoping to have a mixture of some
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250
we're hoping to have a mixture of some
introductory content and also some

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
introductory content and also some
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.750
introductory content and also some
coverage of slightly more tricky use

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
coverage of slightly more tricky use
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399
coverage of slightly more tricky use
cases so hopefully there's something for

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
cases so hopefully there's something for
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590
cases so hopefully there's something for
everyone and with that in mind I'm going

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
everyone and with that in mind I'm going
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330
everyone and with that in mind I'm going
to start by saying a bit about what

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
to start by saying a bit about what
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580
to start by saying a bit about what
exoplayer is for anyone who hasn't used

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
exoplayer is for anyone who hasn't used
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.890
exoplayer is for anyone who hasn't used
the library before ok clicker doesn't

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
the library before ok clicker doesn't
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740
the library before ok clicker doesn't
seem to you're working next slide great

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
seem to you're working next slide great
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530
seem to you're working next slide great
and so exoplayer is an application-level

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and so exoplayer is an application-level
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.870
and so exoplayer is an application-level
media player that means that you choose

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
media player that means that you choose
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670
media player that means that you choose
which version of exoplayer you'd like to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
which version of exoplayer you'd like to
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289
which version of exoplayer you'd like to
use and then you bundle the player

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
use and then you bundle the player
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390
use and then you bundle the player
implementation into your application as

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
implementation into your application as
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609
implementation into your application as
a dependency and what that gives you is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
a dependency and what that gives you is
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770
a dependency and what that gives you is

project as I mentioned and we're going
 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.770
project as I mentioned and we're going
to make a video player app where we

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
to make a video player app where we
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.360
to make a video player app where we
start playing the stream as soon as the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
start playing the stream as soon as the
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.009
start playing the stream as soon as the
app comes into the foreground and then

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019
app comes into the foreground and then
 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.330
app comes into the foreground and then
we stop playing the stream when we go

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
we stop playing the stream when we go
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.369
we stop playing the stream when we go
into the background and to do that the

implementation in this example we're

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909
implementation in this example we're
 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.339
implementation in this example we're
going to use a default track selector

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349
going to use a default track selector
 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.230
going to use a default track selector
but this is an example of a pattern

okay let's let's now switch back to the
 

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.469
okay let's let's now switch back to the
laptop please so let's imagine we've

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479
laptop please so let's imagine we've
 

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:40.290
laptop please so let's imagine we've
launched our video app and if you switch

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:40.300
launched our video app and if you switch
 

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.480
launched our video app and if you switch
to the laptop please we've launched our

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:42.490
to the laptop please we've launched our
 

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.769
to the laptop please we've launched our
video app and now we'd like to think

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:43.779
video app and now we'd like to think
 

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.930
video app and now we'd like to think
about how we're going to monetize our

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:45.940
about how we're going to monetize our
 

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.810

content by showing ads this is extremely

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:48.820

easy to do with exoplayer we've recently

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.100
easy to do with exoplayer we've recently
 

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.240
easy to do with exoplayer we've recently
added an IMA extension which makes this

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.250
added an IMA extension which makes this
 

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.220
added an IMA extension which makes this
very easy

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.230
very easy
 

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.620
very easy
so exoplayer extensions are wrappers

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:57.630
so exoplayer extensions are wrappers
 

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.900
so exoplayer extensions are wrappers
around external functionality that make

00:08:59.900 --> 00:08:59.910
around external functionality that make
 

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.880
around external functionality that make
it very easy to use with exoplayer in

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:01.890
it very easy to use with exoplayer in
 

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.300
it very easy to use with exoplayer in
this case the IMA extension is a wrapper

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.310
this case the IMA extension is a wrapper
 

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.310
this case the IMA extension is a wrapper
around the interactive media ads SDK

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320
around the interactive media ads SDK
 

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.220

add tags in vast and V map formats which
is a standard format for information

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580
is a standard format for information
 

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.420
is a standard format for information
about ads so we're going to be using

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.650
about ads so we're going to be using
that to load ads and then we're going to

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660
that to load ads and then we're going to
 

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.540
that to load ads and then we're going to
insert it with it within the content in

play we'll pass in a data source factory

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:13.710
play we'll pass in a data source factory
 

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.080
play we'll pass in a data source factory
which is going to be used to load data

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.090
which is going to be used to load data
 

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.360
which is going to be used to load data
for playing the ads we'll fast in the

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.370
for playing the ads we'll fast in the
 

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.580
for playing the ads we'll fast in the
ads loader and finally we'll pass in a

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:19.590
ads loader and finally we'll pass in a
 

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.320
ads loader and finally we'll pass in a
view group that's on top of the player

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.330
view group that's on top of the player
 

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.210
view group that's on top of the player
and that's going to be used to show any

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220
and that's going to be used to show any
 

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.520
and that's going to be used to show any
user interface associated with ads like

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:25.530
user interface associated with ads like
 

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.210
user interface associated with ads like
for example the skip button and building

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220
for example the skip button and building
 

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.890
for example the skip button and building
an ads media source out of a content

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:30.900
an ads media source out of a content
 

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.810
an ads media source out of a content
media source like this is an example of

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820
media source like this is an example of
 

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.910
media source like this is an example of
media source composition and this is

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920
media source composition and this is
 

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.320
media source composition and this is
something that you can do with exoplayer

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.330
something that you can do with exoplayer
 

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.210
something that you can do with exoplayer
and we'll see some more examples of it

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220
and we'll see some more examples of it
 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.660
and we'll see some more examples of it
later when we look at playlists okay so

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:41.670
later when we look at playlists okay so
 

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.460
later when we look at playlists okay so
we refer the player with the ads media

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.470
we refer the player with the ads media
 

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.600
we refer the player with the ads media
source and then we should be good to go

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:46.610
source and then we should be good to go
 

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.130
source and then we should be good to go
so you can see we've hopefully hopefully

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140
so you can see we've hopefully hopefully
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.700
so you can see we've hopefully hopefully
this will work

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:49.710
this will work
 

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.360
this will work
if we can switch to the phone we were

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.370
if we can switch to the phone we were
 

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.640
if we can switch to the phone we were
able to add support for playing ads with

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:55.650
able to add support for playing ads with
 

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.710
able to add support for playing ads with
maybe 10 or so lines of code and

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720
maybe 10 or so lines of code and
 

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.390
maybe 10 or so lines of code and
actually this this way of integrating

00:10:59.390 --> 00:10:59.400
actually this this way of integrating
 

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.750
actually this this way of integrating
the IMA SDK gives a really good user

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760
the IMA SDK gives a really good user
 

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.310
the IMA SDK gives a really good user
experience because exoplayer

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320
experience because exoplayer
 

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.550
experience because exoplayer
knows about which ads are coming up in

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560
knows about which ads are coming up in
 

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.660
knows about which ads are coming up in
the future

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:08.670
the future
 

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.010
the future
and that means that it's going to be

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.020
and that means that it's going to be
 

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.540
and that means that it's going to be
able to buffer the content in advance

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:11.550
able to buffer the content in advance
 

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.160
able to buffer the content in advance
and that adds it can buffer their ads in

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.170
and that adds it can buffer their ads in
 

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.900
and that adds it can buffer their ads in
advance to give you seamless transitions

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:14.910
advance to give you seamless transitions
 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.200
advance to give you seamless transitions
between ads and content so as you saw we

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.210
between ads and content so as you saw we
 

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.850
between ads and content so as you saw we
had a pre-roll ad at the beginning and

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860
had a pre-roll ad at the beginning and
 

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.040
had a pre-roll ad at the beginning and
now the time bar has little yellow

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.050
now the time bar has little yellow
 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.080
now the time bar has little yellow
markers it's just showing us their

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.090
markers it's just showing us their
 

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.990
markers it's just showing us their
positions of ads within the content and

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000
positions of ads within the content and
 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.130
positions of ads within the content and
exoplayer is taking care of all of the

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140
exoplayer is taking care of all of the
 

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.530
exoplayer is taking care of all of the
difficulty of loading the ads and

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540
difficulty of loading the ads and
 

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.910
difficulty of loading the ads and
buffering everything behind the scenes

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920
buffering everything behind the scenes
 

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.360
buffering everything behind the scenes
for us okay so that's I'll play back and

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.370
for us okay so that's I'll play back and
 

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.190
for us okay so that's I'll play back and
now over some arcs to talk a bit about

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200
now over some arcs to talk a bit about
 

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.400
now over some arcs to talk a bit about
audio yeah thank you Andrew so far we

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:40.410
audio yeah thank you Andrew so far we
 

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.130
audio yeah thank you Andrew so far we
focus on video only so let's switch to

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140
focus on video only so let's switch to
 

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.660
focus on video only so let's switch to
another application and look a little

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:44.670
another application and look a little
 

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.270
another application and look a little
bit into audio playback audio playback

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:47.280
bit into audio playback audio playback
 

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.490
bit into audio playback audio playback
is a little bit more challenging because

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500
is a little bit more challenging because
 

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.740
is a little bit more challenging because
we want to enable the user to put our

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:51.750
we want to enable the user to put our
 

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.600
we want to enable the user to put our
application into the background and use

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:53.610
application into the background and use
 

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.640
application into the background and use
another application and audio should

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:55.650
another application and audio should
 

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.580
another application and audio should
still keep playing in the background for

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:58.590
still keep playing in the background for
 

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.620
still keep playing in the background for
this we are going to use the so called

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:00.630
this we are going to use the so called
 

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.510
this we are going to use the so called
foreground service it's called a

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:02.520
foreground service it's called a
 

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.310
foreground service it's called a
foreground service because we need to

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320
foreground service because we need to
 

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.530
foreground service because we need to
attach a notification to this service

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540
attach a notification to this service
 

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.450
attach a notification to this service
and this notification is in the

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:08.460
and this notification is in the
 

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.370
and this notification is in the
foreground it's visible to the user so

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380
foreground it's visible to the user so
 

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.440
foreground it's visible to the user so
the user is always aware we are doing

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.450
the user is always aware we are doing
 

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.110
the user is always aware we are doing
some work in the background

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120
some work in the background
 

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.060
some work in the background
since Oreo such a know such a foreground

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.070
since Oreo such a know such a foreground
 

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.220

service is a mandatory requirement if we

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.230
service is a mandatory requirement if we
 

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.780
service is a mandatory requirement if we
don't put our service into the

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:20.790
don't put our service into the
 

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.580
don't put our service into the
foreground the system will kill our

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:22.590
foreground the system will kill our
 

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.820
foreground the system will kill our
service and the application crashes so

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:25.830
service and the application crashes so
 

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.920
service and the application crashes so
let's have a look at the starting point

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:27.930
let's have a look at the starting point
 

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.320
let's have a look at the starting point
of our foreground service and let's

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.330
of our foreground service and let's
 

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.170
of our foreground service and let's
switch back to the laptop please yes we

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180
switch back to the laptop please yes we
 

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.630
switch back to the laptop please yes we
see here we have this audio player

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640
see here we have this audio player
 

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.880
see here we have this audio player

the service is not immediately destroyed

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540
the service is not immediately destroyed
 

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.660
the service is not immediately destroyed
and we can explicitly terminate our

finished with audio playback the service

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.030
finished with audio playback the service

we have this simple service element

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440
we have this simple service element
 

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.710
we have this simple service element
which just points to our audio player

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720
which just points to our audio player
 

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.530
which just points to our audio player
service clause and finally we need to

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540
service clause and finally we need to
 

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.710
service clause and finally we need to
have a way to store our service we do

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720
have a way to store our service we do
 

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.540
have a way to store our service we do
this in the main activity in the own

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:20.550
this in the main activity in the own
 

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.630

create method

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:21.640
create method
 

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.270
create method
of the mainactivity here we create an

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.280
of the mainactivity here we create an
 

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.340
of the mainactivity here we create an
intent pointing to our audio player

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.350
intent pointing to our audio player
 

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.340
intent pointing to our audio player
service and then we use a static method

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.350
service and then we use a static method
 

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.620
service and then we use a static method
of the exoplayer library which starts

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.630
of the exoplayer library which starts
 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.660
of the exoplayer library which starts
the service in foreground according to

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:33.670
the service in foreground according to
 

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.160
the service in foreground according to
the to the API level so now let's go

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.170
the to the API level so now let's go
 

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.460
the to the API level so now let's go
back into the audio player service again

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:41.470
back into the audio player service again
 

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.260
back into the audio player service again
and let's change this code a little bit

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.270
and let's change this code a little bit
 

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.230
and let's change this code a little bit
of the very initialize our player

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240
of the very initialize our player
 

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.660
of the very initialize our player
because for audio we don't want to only

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:48.670
because for audio we don't want to only
 

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.240
because for audio we don't want to only
support playing a single media item we

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.250
support playing a single media item we
 

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.100
support playing a single media item we
want to support playlists so the user

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.110
want to support playlists so the user
 

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.860
want to support playlists so the user
can can move to the next or to the

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:55.870
can can move to the next or to the
 

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.020
can can move to the next or to the
previous item Oh can't just let the

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.030
previous item Oh can't just let the
 

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.650
previous item Oh can't just let the
players play one item after the other

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660
players play one item after the other
 

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.030
players play one item after the other
with EXO player we are using a

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040
with EXO player we are using a
 

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.610
with EXO player we are using a
concatenating media source to implement

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.620
concatenating media source to implement
 

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.520
concatenating media source to implement
playlists these concatenating media

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:08.530
playlists these concatenating media
 

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.100
playlists these concatenating media
source just joins together a number of

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.110
source just joins together a number of
 

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.890
source just joins together a number of
media sources and place them callously

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:13.900
media sources and place them callously
 

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.990
media sources and place them callously
and without rebuffering in between so we

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000
and without rebuffering in between so we
 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.270
and without rebuffering in between so we
achieve a pretty nice user experience

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:18.280
achieve a pretty nice user experience
 

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.620
achieve a pretty nice user experience
for platfor do play back the

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:22.630
for platfor do play back the
 

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.390
for platfor do play back the
concatenating media source also allows

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:24.400
concatenating media source also allows
 

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.760
concatenating media source also allows
us to dynamically change the playlists

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:26.770
us to dynamically change the playlists
 

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.040
us to dynamically change the playlists
so we can add and remove media sources

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.050
so we can add and remove media sources
 

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.350
so we can add and remove media sources
while the player is playing or we can

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360
while the player is playing or we can
 

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.560
while the player is playing or we can
even move the currently playing item in

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.570
even move the currently playing item in
 

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.300
even move the currently playing item in
our playlist while the player is playing

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:36.310
our playlist while the player is playing
 

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.030
our playlist while the player is playing
that's pretty neat so Andrew already

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040
that's pretty neat so Andrew already
 

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.220
that's pretty neat so Andrew already
started to iterate over our song whose

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.230
started to iterate over our song whose
 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.190
started to iterate over our song whose
area and for each sample we get a URI we

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.200
area and for each sample we get a URI we
 

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.290
area and for each sample we get a URI we
again are going to create an extractor

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:46.300
again are going to create an extractor
 

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.630
again are going to create an extractor
media source but then we add this

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:48.640
media source but then we add this
 

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.920
media source but then we add this
extract a media source to our

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:49.930
extract a media source to our
 

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.010
extract a media source to our
concatenating media source in the end we

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.020
concatenating media source in the end we
 

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.450
concatenating media source in the end we
prepare our player with this

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:54.460
prepare our player with this
 

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.760
prepare our player with this
concatenating media source and we are

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:56.770
concatenating media source and we are
 

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.620
concatenating media source and we are
already done we are now supporting

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:58.630
already done we are now supporting
 

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.990
already done we are now supporting
playlists with gapless play gapless

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000
playlists with gapless play gapless
 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.540
playlists with gapless play gapless
which play gapless lee and without repo

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:03.550
which play gapless lee and without repo
 

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.740
which play gapless lee and without repo
rebuffering so but now let's have a look

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:07.750
rebuffering so but now let's have a look
 

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.570
rebuffering so but now let's have a look
at our service again and make it a

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:09.580
at our service again and make it a
 

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.030
at our service again and make it a
proper foreground service we've already

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040
proper foreground service we've already
 

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.060
proper foreground service we've already
said we need to attach a notification to

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.070
said we need to attach a notification to
 

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.730
said we need to attach a notification to
our foreground service and for this we

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:17.740
our foreground service and for this we
 

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.280
our foreground service and for this we
are going to use the player notification

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.290
are going to use the player notification
 

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.620
are going to use the player notification
service in what manager the player

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:22.630
service in what manager the player
 

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.380
service in what manager the player
notification manager will not only

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.390
notification manager will not only
 

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.660
notification manager will not only
create the notification but it will keep

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:27.670
create the notification but it will keep
 

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.030
create the notification but it will keep
it nicely in sync with the state of the

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040
it nicely in sync with the state of the
 

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.310
it nicely in sync with the state of the
player so each time the player state

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320
player so each time the player state
 

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.650
player so each time the player state
changed the manager will update an

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:34.660
changed the manager will update an
 

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.350
changed the manager will update an
application

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360
application
 

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.499
application
and post it to our driver again we use a

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:38.509
and post it to our driver again we use a
 

00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:40.539
and post it to our driver again we use a
static method to create display or

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:40.549
static method to create display or
 

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:42.609
static method to create display or
notification manager and we need to pass

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:42.619
notification manager and we need to pass
 

00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:45.369
notification manager and we need to pass
a couple of arguments which first we

00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:45.379
a couple of arguments which first we
 

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:47.590
a couple of arguments which first we
need to pass the context then we need to

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600
need to pass the context then we need to
 

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.710
need to pass the context then we need to
pass the channel ID which identifies our

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720
pass the channel ID which identifies our
 

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.379
pass the channel ID which identifies our
channel to which we post our

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:52.389
channel to which we post our
 

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:55.030
channel to which we post our
notification the next parameter is a

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040
notification the next parameter is a
 

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.449
notification the next parameter is a
string identifier which which gives us a

00:15:57.449 --> 00:15:57.459
string identifier which which gives us a
 

00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:00.249
string identifier which which gives us a
localized name for our channel this is

00:16:00.249 --> 00:16:00.259
localized name for our channel this is
 

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.929
localized name for our channel this is
the name which shows up in the settings

00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:01.939
the name which shows up in the settings
 

00:16:01.939 --> 00:16:04.689
the name which shows up in the settings
dialog where our user maybe want to mute

00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:04.699
dialog where our user maybe want to mute
 

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:07.960
dialog where our user maybe want to mute
our notification channel and then next

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.970
our notification channel and then next
 

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.389
our notification channel and then next
parameter is a notification ID to

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399
parameter is a notification ID to
 

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:13.419
parameter is a notification ID to
identify identify our notification and

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:13.429
identify identify our notification and
 

00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:16.449
identify identify our notification and
finally we need to pass a so called

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:16.459
finally we need to pass a so called
 

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:19.840
finally we need to pass a so called
media description adapter the manager

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:19.850
media description adapter the manager
 

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.059
media description adapter the manager
will use our adapter to get information

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:22.069
will use our adapter to get information
 

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:24.850
will use our adapter to get information
about the currently playing item so each

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:24.860
about the currently playing item so each
 

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.129
about the currently playing item so each
time the notification is rebuilt the

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:27.139
time the notification is rebuilt the
 

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:28.539
time the notification is rebuilt the
adapter is called to get this

00:16:28.539 --> 00:16:28.549
adapter is called to get this
 

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:32.169
adapter is called to get this
information so we see that for each of

00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:32.179
information so we see that for each of
 

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:34.749
information so we see that for each of
those callbacks the player instance is

00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759
those callbacks the player instance is
 

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:37.329
those callbacks the player instance is
passed to the method so we can use this

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:37.339
passed to the method so we can use this
 

00:16:37.339 --> 00:16:39.850
passed to the method so we can use this
player this player to get the current

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:39.860
player this player to get the current
 

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.009
player this player to get the current
window index the current window index

00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:42.019
window index the current window index
 

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:44.859
window index the current window index
gives us the index to pick our sample

00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:44.869
gives us the index to pick our sample
 

00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:47.919
gives us the index to pick our sample
out of our samples arrey which is kind

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:47.929
out of our samples arrey which is kind
 

00:16:47.929 --> 00:16:50.499
out of our samples arrey which is kind
of the playlist we return the title to

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:50.509
of the playlist we return the title to
 

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.030
of the playlist we return the title to
get a content title then we have a

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040
get a content title then we have a
 

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.710
get a content title then we have a
pretty similar method where we just

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720
pretty similar method where we just
 

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.199
pretty similar method where we just
return the description which is a longer

00:16:56.199 --> 00:16:56.209
return the description which is a longer
 

00:16:56.209 --> 00:16:58.030
return the description which is a longer
text which is displayed in the context

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040
text which is displayed in the context
 

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.030
text which is displayed in the context
in a notification and finally we also

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040
in a notification and finally we also
 

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.739
in a notification and finally we also
provide a bitmap to make our

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:02.749
provide a bitmap to make our
 

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:06.129
provide a bitmap to make our
notification a little bit nicer we just

00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:06.139
notification a little bit nicer we just
 

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:08.860
notification a little bit nicer we just
use a convenient method of our examples

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:08.870
use a convenient method of our examples
 

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:11.019
use a convenient method of our examples
to get such a bitmap for each of our

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:11.029
to get such a bitmap for each of our
 

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:14.470
to get such a bitmap for each of our
samples finally we also need to provide

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480
samples finally we also need to provide
 

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.199
samples finally we also need to provide
a pending intent this pending intent is

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:17.209
a pending intent this pending intent is
 

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:19.059
a pending intent this pending intent is
fired when the user taps on the

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:19.069
fired when the user taps on the
 

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.610
fired when the user taps on the
notification and we want to get the user

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:21.620
notification and we want to get the user
 

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.220
notification and we want to get the user
back to our application in this thin our

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:24.230
back to our application in this thin our
 

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.829
back to our application in this thin our
example to the main HDV the activity so

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839
example to the main HDV the activity so
 

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.139
example to the main HDV the activity so
we create and intent pointing to our

we create and intent pointing to our
 

00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:31.389
we create and intent pointing to our
main activity and then we wrap this

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:31.399
main activity and then we wrap this
 

00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:33.789
main activity and then we wrap this

again a couple of arguments the context

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.490
again a couple of arguments the context
 

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.759
again a couple of arguments the context
as the first argument then a request

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:42.769
as the first argument then a request
 

00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:44.680
as the first argument then a request
code which is 0 in our case we are not

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:44.690
code which is 0 in our case we are not
 

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.230
code which is 0 in our case we are not
going to use it in our sample then they

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240
going to use it in our sample then they
 

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.270
going to use it in our sample then they
tend pointing to our main active

tend pointing to our main active
and finally a flag to tell the system to

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.250
and finally a flag to tell the system to
 

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.000
and finally a flag to tell the system to
update any pending intents already in

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.010
update any pending intents already in
 

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.600
update any pending intents already in
the queue so now we have this player

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:58.610
the queue so now we have this player
 

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.510
the queue so now we have this player
notification manager we now also need to

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520
notification manager we now also need to
 

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.240
notification manager we now also need to
register a notification listener this

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.250
register a notification listener this
 

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.940
register a notification listener this
listener makes our service aware of the

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:06.950
listener makes our service aware of the
 

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.299
listener makes our service aware of the
lifecycle of our notification it has two

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:10.309
lifecycle of our notification it has two
 

00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:13.210
lifecycle of our notification it has two
methods so we register this notification

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:13.220
methods so we register this notification
 

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.070
methods so we register this notification
in a listener which is an anonymous

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080
in a listener which is an anonymous
 

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.649
in a listener which is an anonymous
clause in this case the first method or

00:18:19.649 --> 00:18:19.659
clause in this case the first method or
 

00:18:19.659 --> 00:18:22.600
clause in this case the first method or
notification started is called when the

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.610
notification started is called when the
 

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.450
notification started is called when the
notification is initially created here

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.460
notification is initially created here
 

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.840
notification is initially created here
we are now passed those two arguments to

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:28.850
we are now passed those two arguments to
 

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.149
we are now passed those two arguments to
the start foreground service and this is

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159
the start foreground service and this is
 

00:18:31.159 --> 00:18:33.279
the start foreground service and this is
now the moment where our service is

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:33.289
now the moment where our service is
 

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:35.680
now the moment where our service is
officially at foreground service we are

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:35.690
officially at foreground service we are
 

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.140
officially at foreground service we are
now safe the system is not going to kill

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.150
now safe the system is not going to kill
 

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.549
now safe the system is not going to kill
our service anymore the next method then

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559
our service anymore the next method then
 

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.200
our service anymore the next method then
is called when the notification is

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.210
is called when the notification is
 

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.419
is called when the notification is
counseled here it just stopped self our

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:46.429
counseled here it just stopped self our

the playback state this is two things
 

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.600
the playback state this is two things
like the player state itself the current

media session so let's change again back
 

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.280
media session so let's change again back
to the laptop please so we can see how

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:06.290
to the laptop please so we can see how
 

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.030
to the laptop please so we can see how
we can do this in code we are again in

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.040
we can do this in code we are again in
 

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.700
we can do this in code we are again in
the oncreate method of our player of our

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:12.710
the oncreate method of our player of our
 

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.650
the oncreate method of our player of our
audio player service and we are now

session session compart we assign it to

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.150
session session compart we assign it to
 

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.330
session session compart we assign it to
a field we just call the

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340
a field we just call the
 

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.090
a field we just call the
mediasessioncompat constructor with the

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.100
mediasessioncompat constructor with the
 

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.520
mediasessioncompat constructor with the
context and an identifier which is the

context and an identifier which is the
 

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.830
context and an identifier which is the
media which is just a string then we

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840
media which is just a string then we
 

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.590
media which is just a string then we
immediately set our media session had to

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600
immediately set our media session had to
 

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.410

notification manager aware of our
 

00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:44.169
notification manager aware of our
session and we pass the token to the

00:22:44.169 --> 00:22:44.179
session and we pass the token to the
 

00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:46.180
session and we pass the token to the
player notification manager so we can

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.190
player notification manager so we can
 

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.730
player notification manager so we can
enhance the media style notification and

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:48.740
enhance the media style notification and
 

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.910
enhance the media style notification and
provide an organ artwork for our lock

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:51.920
provide an organ artwork for our lock
 

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.090
provide an organ artwork for our lock
screen of our device but now we are

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.100
screen of our device but now we are
 

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.370
screen of our device but now we are
going to create such a media session

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:57.380
going to create such a media session
 

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.250
going to create such a media session
connection we call the constructor and

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:00.260
connection we call the constructor and
 

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.280
connection we call the constructor and
we just pass the media session to the

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:03.290
we just pass the media session to the
 

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.049
we just pass the media session to the
connector so he has access to the

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:05.059
connector so he has access to the
 

00:23:05.059 --> 00:23:09.340
connector so he has access to the
session we said we want to synchronize

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.350
session we said we want to synchronize
 

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.220

our playlist with the cue of the media

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:12.230
our playlist with the cue of the media
 

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.410
our playlist with the cue of the media
session so external application know

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:14.420
session so external application know
 

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.600
session so external application know
what items we are having in our playlist

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:16.610
what items we are having in our playlist
 

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.930
what items we are having in our playlist
for this we are going to use a timeline

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:19.940
for this we are going to use a timeline
 

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.780
for this we are going to use a timeline
view navigator the timeline is the

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:22.790
view navigator the timeline is the
 

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.669
view navigator the timeline is the
internal representation of the playlist

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679
internal representation of the playlist
 

00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:27.549
internal representation of the playlist
after the player has been prepared so

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559
after the player has been prepared so
 

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:29.860
after the player has been prepared so
there are as many windows in our

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:29.870
there are as many windows in our
 

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.990
there are as many windows in our
timeline as we have items in our

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000
timeline as we have items in our
 

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.440
timeline as we have items in our
playlist so with this we can use the

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:35.450
playlist so with this we can use the
 

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.270
playlist so with this we can use the
window index which is the parameter

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280
window index which is the parameter
 

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.390
window index which is the parameter
which is passed to our our method we are

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400
which is passed to our our method we are
 

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.970
which is passed to our our method we are
going to override to create to get the

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:42.980
going to override to create to get the
 

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.610
going to override to create to get the
samples again out of our our samples

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:45.620
samples again out of our our samples
 

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.740
samples again out of our our samples
array and we then are going to create a

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:47.750
array and we then are going to create a
 

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.590
array and we then are going to create a
media description for such a sample

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600
media description for such a sample
 

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.290
media description for such a sample
let's have a look in this get media

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:53.300
let's have a look in this get media
 

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.330
let's have a look in this get media
description method to see that there is

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.340
description method to see that there is
 

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.790
description method to see that there is
not much magic behind it we see we are

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:57.800
not much magic behind it we see we are
 

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.370
not much magic behind it we see we are
just using a media's description

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:00.380
just using a media's description
 

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.950
just using a media's description
compared builder and

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960
compared builder and
 

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.560
compared builder and
we populate this data with the data from

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:04.570
we populate this data with the data from
 

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.649
we populate this data with the data from
our samples and then we built such a

00:24:07.649 --> 00:24:07.659
our samples and then we built such a
 

00:24:07.659 --> 00:24:09.840
our samples and then we built such a
media description compared which we

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:09.850
media description compared which we
 

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:14.669
media description compared which we
return to our connector so now we offer

00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679
return to our connector so now we offer
 

00:24:14.679 --> 00:24:16.620
return to our connector so now we offer
we've already this media session

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.630
we've already this media session
 

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.630
we've already this media session
connector as a next step again we need

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640
connector as a next step again we need
 

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.580
connector as a next step again we need
to pause the player to the connector so

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:20.590
to pause the player to the connector so
 

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.740
to pause the player to the connector so
we can sync the player with the media

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:22.750
we can sync the player with the media
 

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.080
we can sync the player with the media
session here we again set use the set

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.090
session here we again set use the set
 

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.720
session here we again set use the set
player method the first parameter is the

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:27.730
player method the first parameter is the
 

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.029
player method the first parameter is the
player itself the second parameter is a

00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039

playback preparer we are not going to

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:32.169
playback preparer we are not going to
 

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:34.200
playback preparer we are not going to
use it because we don't want to allow

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:34.210
use it because we don't want to allow
 

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.419
use it because we don't want to allow
external application to initiate

00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:36.429
external application to initiate
 

00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:40.260
external application to initiate
playback in our sample so that's kind of

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:40.270
playback in our sample so that's kind of
 

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.720
playback in our sample so that's kind of
it again a non destroy we need to clean

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:42.730
it again a non destroy we need to clean
 

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.779
it again a non destroy we need to clean
up first we just release the media

00:24:45.779 --> 00:24:45.789
up first we just release the media
 

00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:48.299
up first we just release the media
session and as a second step we again

00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:48.309
session and as a second step we again
 

00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:50.430
session and as a second step we again
set the player instance to null this

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440
set the player instance to null this
 

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.159
set the player instance to null this
time in the connector to avoid leaking

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:53.169
time in the connector to avoid leaking
 

00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:57.330
time in the connector to avoid leaking
an instance of the player so now that's

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:57.340
an instance of the player so now that's
 

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.330
an instance of the player so now that's
kind of it if everything is correct we

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:00.340
kind of it if everything is correct we
 

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.680
kind of it if everything is correct we
should be able to deploy the application

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:01.690
should be able to deploy the application
 

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.529
should be able to deploy the application

our support for downloading is built on

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080
our support for downloading is built on
 

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.230
our support for downloading is built on
top of our support for caching so I'm

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240
top of our support for caching so I'm
 

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.120
top of our support for caching so I'm
going to and say a little bit about how

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.130
going to and say a little bit about how
 

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.010
going to and say a little bit about how
caching fits into the picture of the

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.020
caching fits into the picture of the
 

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.720
caching fits into the picture of the
player setup and then we'll look at how

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:13.730
player setup and then we'll look at how
 

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.740
player setup and then we'll look at how
downloading builds on top of that so

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:17.750
downloading builds on top of that so
 

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.570
downloading builds on top of that so
this diagram is intended to show you the

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:19.580
this diagram is intended to show you the
 

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.230
this diagram is intended to show you the
data flow when playing one mp3 file we

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240
data flow when playing one mp3 file we
 

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.730
data flow when playing one mp3 file we
have a song which is in the cloud

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:24.740
have a song which is in the cloud
 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.620
have a song which is in the cloud
somewhere we have a data source which is

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:26.630
somewhere we have a data source which is
 

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.779
somewhere we have a data source which is
requesting that over HTTP it's loading

00:26:28.779 --> 00:26:28.789
requesting that over HTTP it's loading
 

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:30.789
requesting that over HTTP it's loading
the data and then we had a media source

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799
the data and then we had a media source
 

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:32.380
the data and then we had a media source
that was getting the information from

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:32.390
that was getting the information from
 

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.770
that was getting the information from
there and providing it to the player

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:34.780
there and providing it to the player
 

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.029
there and providing it to the player
let's see how caching fits into this

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039
let's see how caching fits into this
 

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:38.620
let's see how caching fits into this
well it's quite simple we just add a

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:38.630
well it's quite simple we just add a
 

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.140
well it's quite simple we just add a
cache data source that sits in between

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:41.150
cache data source that sits in between
 

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.330
cache data source that sits in between
the data source we're using for loading

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.340
the data source we're using for loading
 

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.100
the data source we're using for loading
from the network and the media source

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.110
from the network and the media source
 

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.919
from the network and the media source
that's providing data to the player and

00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:46.929
that's providing data to the player and
 

00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:49.870
that's providing data to the player and
it's going to be responsible in with a

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880
it's going to be responsible in with a
 

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.700
it's going to be responsible in with a
cache instance in this case we're using

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:51.710
cache instance in this case we're using
 

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.680
cache instance in this case we're using
a simple cache which is provided by XO

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:53.690
a simple cache which is provided by XO
 

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.560
a simple cache which is provided by XO
players core library the way this works

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:56.570
players core library the way this works
 

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.510
players core library the way this works
is as follows when the media source

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520
is as follows when the media source
 

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.430
is as follows when the media source
requests some data it's going to ask

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440
requests some data it's going to ask
 

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.840
requests some data it's going to ask
that ask the cache data source to

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:01.850
that ask the cache data source to
 

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.640
that ask the cache data source to
provide that information the cache data

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:03.650
provide that information the cache data
 

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.080
provide that information the cache data
source is going to look in the cache if

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.090
source is going to look in the cache if
 

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.539
source is going to look in the cache if
it's present there then that's great we

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:07.549
it's present there then that's great we
 

00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:09.130
it's present there then that's great we
can get the data from local storage that

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:09.140
can get the data from local storage that
 

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.810
can get the data from local storage that
goes to the media source and we never

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.820
goes to the media source and we never
 

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.090
goes to the media source and we never
had to go to the network on the other

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:13.100
had to go to the network on the other
 

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.279
had to go to the network on the other
hand if the data is not present in the

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:15.289
hand if the data is not present in the
 

00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:17.500
hand if the data is not present in the
cache so we've got a cache miss then the

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:17.510
cache so we've got a cache miss then the
 

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.600
cache so we've got a cache miss then the
cache data source needs to go to the

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:19.610
cache data source needs to go to the
 

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.950
cache data source needs to go to the
data source that's being used to load

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960
data source that's being used to load
 

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.419
data source that's being used to load
from the network and it's going to

00:27:22.419 --> 00:27:22.429
from the network and it's going to
 

00:27:22.429 --> 00:27:24.190
from the network and it's going to
request the data from there and then

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200
request the data from there and then
 

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.630
request the data from there and then
it's going to store it in the cache when

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640
it's going to store it in the cache when
 

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.310
it's going to store it in the cache when
it arrives and in this way the cache

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320
it arrives and in this way the cache
 

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.049
it arrives and in this way the cache
gradually gets populated with the data

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:29.059
gradually gets populated with the data
 

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:31.960
gradually gets populated with the data
that's loaded while during playback

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:31.970
that's loaded while during playback
 

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.330
that's loaded while during playback
you can see also on this diagram we've

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:34.340
you can see also on this diagram we've
 

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.850
you can see also on this diagram we've
got a cash Viktor this component is

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:36.860
got a cash Viktor this component is
 

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.410
got a cash Viktor this component is
responsible for making sure that our

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:38.420
responsible for making sure that our
 

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.450
responsible for making sure that our
cash doesn't grow indefinitely as we

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:40.460
cash doesn't grow indefinitely as we
 

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.710
cash doesn't grow indefinitely as we
play more and more different media items

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720
play more and more different media items
 

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.000
play more and more different media items
okay now let's we want to think about

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.010
okay now let's we want to think about
 

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.730
okay now let's we want to think about
downloading so downloading is a separate

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:48.740
downloading so downloading is a separate
 

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.930
downloading so downloading is a separate
operation which you might want to

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:49.940
operation which you might want to
 

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.370
operation which you might want to
perform in the background so it might

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.380
perform in the background so it might
 

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.310
perform in the background so it might
need a service and this downloading

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320
need a service and this downloading
 

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.140
need a service and this downloading
operation what's going on internally is

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:56.150
operation what's going on internally is
 

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.060
operation what's going on internally is
it's going to read through the entire

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:58.070
it's going to read through the entire
 

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.010
it's going to read through the entire
stream and as it does that it'll be

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:00.020
stream and as it does that it'll be
 

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.650
stream and as it does that it'll be
populating the same cache instance that

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:02.660
populating the same cache instance that
 

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.050
populating the same cache instance that
you're using for playback and as you can

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:05.060
you're using for playback and as you can
 

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.340
you're using for playback and as you can
probably guess when you do this

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:06.350
probably guess when you do this
 

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.350
probably guess when you do this
operation if you've populated the cache

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360
operation if you've populated the cache
 

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.420
operation if you've populated the cache
with all of the data then when it comes

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:10.430
with all of the data then when it comes
 

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.460
with all of the data then when it comes
to playback your player is going to be

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:12.470
to playback your player is going to be
 

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.020
to playback your player is going to be
able to get everything from the cache

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.030
able to get everything from the cache
 

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.910
able to get everything from the cache
from the cache data source there's never

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:15.920
from the cache data source there's never
 

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.210
from the cache data source there's never
a need to go to the network in this case

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.220
a need to go to the network in this case
 

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.070
a need to go to the network in this case
one very important thing to note is that

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080
one very important thing to note is that
 

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.080
one very important thing to note is that
we've got a no op cache of victor so

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.090
we've got a no op cache of victor so
 

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.490
we've got a no op cache of victor so
this is an implementation of cache the

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:24.500
this is an implementation of cache the
 

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.650
this is an implementation of cache the
victor which does nothing it's never

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:26.660
victor which does nothing it's never
 

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.020
victor which does nothing it's never
going to evict data from the cache the

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.030
going to evict data from the cache the
 

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.310
going to evict data from the cache the
reason we have that is that we don't

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320
reason we have that is that we don't
 

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.260
reason we have that is that we don't
want to have a situation whereby we're

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:32.270
want to have a situation whereby we're
 

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.970
want to have a situation whereby we're
downloading the stream and then when

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:33.980
downloading the stream and then when
 

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.410
downloading the stream and then when
we've downloaded up to a certain amount

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:35.420
we've downloaded up to a certain amount
 

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.630
we've downloaded up to a certain amount
of data we start getting rid of data at

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640
of data we start getting rid of data at
 

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.740
of data we start getting rid of data at
the beginning of the stream because that

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:38.750
the beginning of the stream because that
 

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.730
the beginning of the stream because that
would be very annoying for users ok

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:42.740
would be very annoying for users ok
 

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.380
would be very annoying for users ok
so that's the theory let's see how this

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:44.390
so that's the theory let's see how this
 

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.600
so that's the theory let's see how this
works in practice if we could switch

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:46.610
works in practice if we could switch
 

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.660
works in practice if we could switch
back to the laptop please so we're going

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:49.670
back to the laptop please so we're going
 

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.740
back to the laptop please so we're going
to do this in three steps

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:50.750
to do this in three steps
 

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.840
to do this in three steps
the first step is we're going to add

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:52.850
the first step is we're going to add
 

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.380
the first step is we're going to add
support for caching to our player then

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:56.390
support for caching to our player then
 

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.940
support for caching to our player then
we're going to implement an audio

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:57.950
we're going to implement an audio
 

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.440
we're going to implement an audio
download service which is going to

00:28:59.440 --> 00:28:59.450
download service which is going to
 

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.120
download service which is going to
actually run the download operation as

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.130
actually run the download operation as
 

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.700
actually run the download operation as
in the background then finally we're

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:03.710
in the background then finally we're
 

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.440
in the background then finally we're
going to add a very minimal piece of UI

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.450
going to add a very minimal piece of UI
 

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.690
going to add a very minimal piece of UI
to our activity in order to let us

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:07.700
to our activity in order to let us
 

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.170
to our activity in order to let us
trigger the downloads to take place okay

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:11.180
trigger the downloads to take place okay
 

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.750
trigger the downloads to take place okay
so we'll go ahead and create a cache

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760
so we'll go ahead and create a cache
 

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.210
so we'll go ahead and create a cache
data source Factory and as we saw on the

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.220
data source Factory and as we saw on the
 

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.740
data source Factory and as we saw on the
slide this is going to sit between our

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:17.750
slide this is going to sit between our
 

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.330
slide this is going to sit between our
data source factory for loading from the

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340
data source factory for loading from the
 

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.280
data source factory for loading from the
network and the media source which is

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:21.290
network and the media source which is
 

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.690
network and the media source which is
actually going to be extracting the

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.700
actually going to be extracting the
 

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.230
actually going to be extracting the
media so you can see we're using a

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240
media so you can see we're using a
 

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.910
media so you can see we're using a
utility method to get our cache and

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:27.920
utility method to get our cache and
 

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.680
utility method to get our cache and
let's jump into that and see what's

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:29.690
let's jump into that and see what's
 

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.350
let's jump into that and see what's
going on there so as I mentioned we're

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360
going on there so as I mentioned we're
 

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.450
going on there so as I mentioned we're
sharing the same cache for playback and

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:34.460
sharing the same cache for playback and
 

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.370
sharing the same cache for playback and
downloading and that means it's

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:36.380
downloading and that means it's
 

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.510
downloading and that means it's
important that we just have a single

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520
important that we just have a single
 

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.660
important that we just have a single
tune for our whole process inside get

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:40.670
tune for our whole process inside get
 

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.190
tune for our whole process inside get
cache what we're doing is we check if

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200
cache what we're doing is we check if
 

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.870
cache what we're doing is we check if
we've got one already if we don't have

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880
we've got one already if we don't have
 

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.910
we've got one already if we don't have
one we're going to create a file

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:45.920
one we're going to create a file
 

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.010
one we're going to create a file
which is pointing to a directory where

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:48.020
which is pointing to a directory where
 

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.470
which is pointing to a directory where
we're going to store the downloads then

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480
we're going to store the downloads then
 

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.000
we're going to store the downloads then
we're going to instantiate a simple

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.010
we're going to instantiate a simple
 

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.700
we're going to instantiate a simple
cache passing in that directory and also

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:54.710
cache passing in that directory and also
 

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.260
cache passing in that directory and also
a no op cache of victor which is very

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.270
a no op cache of victor which is very
 

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.760
a no op cache of victor which is very
important because we don't want to be

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:57.770
important because we don't want to be
 

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.390
important because we don't want to be
removing data from the cache okay so

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:01.400
removing data from the cache okay so
 

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.180
removing data from the cache okay so
that's how we make a simple cache we

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.190
that's how we make a simple cache we
 

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.530
that's how we make a simple cache we
also need to provide the cache data

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:05.540
also need to provide the cache data
 

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.900
also need to provide the cache data
source factory with the upstream data

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:07.910
source factory with the upstream data
 

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.760
source factory with the upstream data
source factory for loading data from the

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:09.770
source factory for loading data from the
 

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.640
source factory for loading data from the
network okay and that's what we need to

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:12.650
network okay and that's what we need to
 

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.230
network okay and that's what we need to
instantiate a cached data source factory

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240
instantiate a cached data source factory
 

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.480
instantiate a cached data source factory
let's introduce a local variable for

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:16.490
let's introduce a local variable for
 

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.549
let's introduce a local variable for
that and then we're going to use that

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559
that and then we're going to use that
 

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.590
that and then we're going to use that
cache data source factory in place of

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600
cache data source factory in place of
 

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.240
cache data source factory in place of
the data source factory we were using

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.250
the data source factory we were using
 

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.870
the data source factory we were using
before for loading from the network okay

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880
before for loading from the network okay
 

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.240
before for loading from the network okay
so hopefully that makes sense for adding

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.250
so hopefully that makes sense for adding
 

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.669
so hopefully that makes sense for adding
support for caching to our player now

00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679
support for caching to our player now
 

00:30:30.679 --> 00:30:31.990
support for caching to our player now
we're going to move on and we're going

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000
we're going to move on and we're going
 

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.030
we're going to move on and we're going
to add an audio download service which

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:34.040
to add an audio download service which
 

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.380
to add an audio download service which
is actually going to run the downloading

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:35.390
is actually going to run the downloading
 

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:40.270
is actually going to run the downloading
operation so we provide a superclass

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:40.280
operation so we provide a superclass
 

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.180
operation so we provide a superclass
forward called download service for your

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.190
forward called download service for your
 

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.860
forward called download service for your
for you download services that you'll be

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:44.870
for you download services that you'll be
 

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.299
for you download services that you'll be
putting in your application so we'll be

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:46.309
putting in your application so we'll be
 

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:52.240
putting in your application so we'll be
inheriting from that here ok so there's

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.250
inheriting from that here ok so there's
 

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.680
inheriting from that here ok so there's
a few things a few steps we need to do

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:53.690
a few things a few steps we need to do
 

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.810
a few things a few steps we need to do
now the most important one important not

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:55.820
now the most important one important not
 

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.820
now the most important one important not
to forget is to add a declaration for

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:57.830
to forget is to add a declaration for
 

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.130
to forget is to add a declaration for
the service to your manifest so we're

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.140
the service to your manifest so we're
 

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.630
the service to your manifest so we're
going to add our audio download service

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:01.640
going to add our audio download service
 

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.539
going to add our audio download service
here now we can switch back and we have

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:04.549
here now we can switch back and we have
 

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:06.730
here now we can switch back and we have
to implement a constructor and three

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:06.740
to implement a constructor and three
 

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.980
to implement a constructor and three
methods so let's let's start doing that

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:08.990
methods so let's let's start doing that
 

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.169
methods so let's let's start doing that
we'll create a constructor with no

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:11.179
we'll create a constructor with no
 

00:31:11.179 --> 00:31:13.270
we'll create a constructor with no
arguments but then we're going to call

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.280
arguments but then we're going to call
 

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.950
arguments but then we're going to call
the super constructor and pass in some

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960
the super constructor and pass in some
 

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.270
the super constructor and pass in some
information about the download

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.280
information about the download
 

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.130
information about the download
notifications so we'll need a

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:18.140
notifications so we'll need a
 

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.350
notifications so we'll need a
notification ID which must be different

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360
notification ID which must be different
 

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.120
notification ID which must be different
from the notification ID we used for

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.130
from the notification ID we used for
 

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.919
from the notification ID we used for
audio playback

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:22.929
audio playback
 

00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:25.750
audio playback
we'll also pass in an interval and what

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760
we'll also pass in an interval and what
 

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.030
we'll also pass in an interval and what
at which to update the notification and

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.040
at which to update the notification and
 

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.190
at which to update the notification and
we'll just use the default here will

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200
we'll just use the default here will
 

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.710
we'll just use the default here will
pass in we'll pass in a channel ID for

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720
pass in we'll pass in a channel ID for
 

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.640
pass in we'll pass in a channel ID for
our download notification channel and

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:35.650
our download notification channel and
 

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.080
our download notification channel and
finally we also need to provide a string

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.090
finally we also need to provide a string
 

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.580
finally we also need to provide a string
resource which describes the

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.590
resource which describes the
 

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.350
resource which describes the
notification channel and that works just

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360
notification channel and that works just
 

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.020
notification channel and that works just
the same as the one we did for audio

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.030
the same as the one we did for audio
 

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.640
the same as the one we did for audio
playback that had a notification channel

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:45.650
playback that had a notification channel
 

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.390
playback that had a notification channel
as well now we need to override some

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:49.400
as well now we need to override some
 

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.140
as well now we need to override some
methods so let's have a look at those

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.150
methods so let's have a look at those
 

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.330
methods so let's have a look at those
the first one is we need to provide a

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:55.340
the first one is we need to provide a
 

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.250
the first one is we need to provide a
download manager and we have a utility

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:57.260
download manager and we have a utility
 

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.419
download manager and we have a utility
method for this which we'll have a look

00:31:58.419 --> 00:31:58.429
method for this which we'll have a look
 

00:31:58.429 --> 00:31:59.620
method for this which we'll have a look
at in a second

00:31:59.620 --> 00:31:59.630
at in a second
 

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.289
at in a second
that's just taking a context let's jump

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:02.299
that's just taking a context let's jump
 

00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:02.830
that's just taking a context let's jump
in there

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840
in there
 

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.409
in there
so again we're using a singleton

00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:05.419
so again we're using a singleton
 

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:06.940
so again we're using a singleton
instance of a download manager for our

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:06.950
instance of a download manager for our
 

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.760
instance of a download manager for our
whole process this is also creating a

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:09.770
whole process this is also creating a
 

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.289
whole process this is also creating a
file because it needs to persist some

00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:11.299
file because it needs to persist some
 

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:12.820
file because it needs to persist some
information about downloads that are in

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:12.830
information about downloads that are in
 

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.039
information about downloads that are in
progress and then we're instantiated a

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:15.049
progress and then we're instantiated a
 

00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:16.779
progress and then we're instantiated a
download manager passing in the same

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:16.789
download manager passing in the same
 

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:18.700
download manager passing in the same
cache instance as the one that we're

we'll just use our playback I confer for
 

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.039
we'll just use our playback I confer for
that then we'd provide the download

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:12.049
that then we'd provide the download
 

00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:14.560
that then we'd provide the download
channel ID which is the same one that we

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:14.570
channel ID which is the same one that we
 

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:18.370
channel ID which is the same one that we
used earlier this one's actually a

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:18.380
used earlier this one's actually a
 

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.210

that's implementing our download service

00:34:03.399 --> 00:34:03.409
that's implementing our download service
 

00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:05.710
that's implementing our download service
the final step I promised is just

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720
the final step I promised is just
 

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.120

providing a way to trigger these

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.130
providing a way to trigger these
 

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.430
providing a way to trigger these
downloads from our activity so as you

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440
downloads from our activity so as you
 

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.930
downloads from our activity so as you
can see we've got an empty list view

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:10.940
can see we've got an empty list view
 

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.820
can see we've got an empty list view
here we're going to replace that with a

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:12.830
here we're going to replace that with a
 

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.119
here we're going to replace that with a
live

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:13.129

samples so we've just got three items in

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200
samples so we've just got three items in
 

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.339
samples so we've just got three items in
a playlist when the user taps one of

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:18.349
a playlist when the user taps one of
 

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:20.440
a playlist when the user taps one of
those we're going to trigger the

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:20.450
those we're going to trigger the
 

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.720
those we're going to trigger the
download to start and to do that well we

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.730
download to start and to do that well we
 

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.609
download to start and to do that well we
will be creating a progressive download

00:34:24.609 --> 00:34:24.619
will be creating a progressive download
 

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.190
will be creating a progressive download
action if you were downloading a

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200
action if you were downloading a
 

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.599
action if you were downloading a
different type of content like a -

different type of content like a -
 

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:29.859
different type of content like a -
stream then you would not use

00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:29.869
stream then you would not use
 

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:31.180
stream then you would not use
progressive download action you'd use

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.190
progressive download action you'd use
 

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.740
progressive download action you'd use
the corresponding download action for

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:32.750
the corresponding download action for
 

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.829
the corresponding download action for
the type of stream you're downloading

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839
the type of stream you're downloading
 

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:37.749
the type of stream you're downloading
that's going to take a URI it's going to

00:34:37.749 --> 00:34:37.759
that's going to take a URI it's going to
 

00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:38.919
that's going to take a URI it's going to
take a flag to say whether we're

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:38.929
take a flag to say whether we're
 

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:40.569
take a flag to say whether we're
removing or not we want to add it to the

00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:40.579
removing or not we want to add it to the
 

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.450
removing or not we want to add it to the
cache so we'll pass in false we don't

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:43.460
cache so we'll pass in false we don't
 

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.129

want to associate any custom data so

00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:45.139
want to associate any custom data so
 

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.629
want to associate any custom data so
we'll pass null for the data and the

00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639
we'll pass null for the data and the
 

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:50.799
we'll pass null for the data and the
custom cache key once we've created our

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:50.809
custom cache key once we've created our
 

00:34:50.809 --> 00:34:52.389
custom cache key once we've created our
progressive download action all that

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399
progressive download action all that
 

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:55.329
progressive download action all that
remains is to call a method on the

00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:55.339
remains is to call a method on the
 

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:56.889
remains is to call a method on the
download service there's a static method

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:56.899
download service there's a static method
 

00:34:56.899 --> 00:34:59.049
download service there's a static method
to start the service with that action

00:34:59.049 --> 00:34:59.059
to start the service with that action
 

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:02.349
to start the service with that action
and that takes a context which is main

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359
and that takes a context which is main
 

00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:05.259

it takes the class of the download

00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:10.849
it takes the class of the download
 

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:12.490
it takes the class of the download
service which is audio download service

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:12.500
service which is audio download service
 

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.130

we've just created progressive download

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:16.670
we've just created progressive download
 

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.720
we've just created progressive download
action and finally we can pass Falls for

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:19.730
action and finally we can pass Falls for
 

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.039
action and finally we can pass Falls for
foreground because our activity is

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:21.049
foreground because our activity is
 

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:24.339
foreground because our activity is
already in the foreground okay it's

00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:24.349
already in the foreground okay it's
 

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:25.809
already in the foreground okay it's
quite a few bits to remember there but

00:35:25.809 --> 00:35:25.819
quite a few bits to remember there but
 

00:35:25.819 --> 00:35:27.519
quite a few bits to remember there but
hopefully we've got everything let's

00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:27.529
hopefully we've got everything let's
 

00:35:27.529 --> 00:35:29.370
hopefully we've got everything let's
give that a try and see if it works

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:29.380
give that a try and see if it works
 

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.499
give that a try and see if it works
now we had plans to show you putting the

00:35:32.499 --> 00:35:32.509
now we had plans to show you putting the
 

00:35:32.509 --> 00:35:34.120
now we had plans to show you putting the
device into flight mode and playing back

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.130
device into flight mode and playing back
 

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.650
device into flight mode and playing back
the downloaded content but unfortunately

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:35.660
the downloaded content but unfortunately
 

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.569
the downloaded content but unfortunately
we're having to use cost to play the

00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:37.579
we're having to use cost to play the
 

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:38.950
we're having to use cost to play the
stream so we won't actually be able to

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960
stream so we won't actually be able to
 

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.349
stream so we won't actually be able to
show you the putting the device in

00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359
show you the putting the device in
 

00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:42.190
show you the putting the device in
flight mode you'll need to use your

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200
flight mode you'll need to use your
 

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.859
flight mode you'll need to use your
imagination as you can see when we tap
