[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is I/O
Live, and I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.170
And I'm standing here
with Hannah Beachler

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.730
who is a production designer.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.054
You may know her
from "Black Panther".

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:15.012
HANNAH BEACHLER: Hello.

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:16.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
How are you today?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.770
HANNAH BEACHLER: I've got
to give it one of these.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.180
Great.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.880
I'm doing great.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Me too.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.070
We're really glad that you came
here to talk about your work

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.710
and to talk about
diversity and inclusion

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.404
and how that's affected by
representation in media.

00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:29.570
HANNAH BEACHLER: Absolutely.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.070
I mean, I think a
big important part

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.230
of that is if you don't
see it, you can't be it.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
And so putting those things into
our narrative work in films,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.760
which everybody finds the
time to go see a good movie,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.500
as noted by "Infinity War",
and to represent a huge portion

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.170
of the population in that way.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.990
I think when people see it,
they realize, I can do that.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.620
I can have those
same goals in life

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.760
because it's not going
to be impossible.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.000
And I think that that's
such a huge important part

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.822
of my work, in my body of work,
over the last three years.

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:08.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, one of
the things I think about a lot

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.470
is that I was really
lucky growing up

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.500
wanting to be an engineer
and seeing lots of engineers

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.940
that looked like me.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.524
And that was inspiring, and I
really want that for everyone.

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:18.690
HANNAH BEACHLER: Absolutely.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.350
I mean, I think inspiring
the next generation

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.080
of young scientists
who are female,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.960
young kids of color who
see a world where they have

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
a sense of pride, where they
have a sense of reaching

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.130
back and seeing their
tradition, and their culture,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.110
and their ancestors, and
all those things even

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.830
being a part of their future.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.260
And I think walking away with
a huge sense of themselves

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.370
that they otherwise may not
know or have had privy to.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.290
So it's lifting spirits
that's so important when

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.950
it comes to representation.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.580
It's not only about getting
into certain fields.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.590
It's about who we're raising
in the world for the future.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.350
Because I know I'm going to
be relying on my young child

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.289
to take care of me, and I
want him to know some things.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.980
So it's always on my
mind, and it's something

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.240
that I think I'm now more than
ever driven to do and include

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.455
as part of my design aesthetic.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:22.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, it's
almost like if you can see it,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.720
you can be it.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.622
HANNAH BEACHLER: Absolutely.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:26.580
And I've been watching.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.413
You know, I watch all
the videos on Twitter.

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:30.570
People will send me
stuff of teachers

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.740
teaching about the sort
of things that we did--

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.470
I did a deep dive, but it
was sort of a lighter dive

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.200
into the technology
in "Black Panther"

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.899
and the science in
"Black Panther".

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.440
And teachers are
coming up with a way

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.410
to teach the class
using "Black Panther"

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.780
as an example of our vibranium
and our sound science

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.540
that we used in the movie.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.000
And to see that become a
part of a curriculum and kids

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.730
getting excited about it
because they see themselves

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.130
and yeah, I can do this, is--

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
I mean, you can't ask
for anything more.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.050
I've always thought, what can
I do to better the world as one

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.280
individual?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.190
And I didn't really know ever
what that was until, I think,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.594
after "Black Panther" and I
saw the response of young kids.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.260
And it was all about
the representation.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.420
And so that does
become a design choice.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.370
And it's something that
I think that I'm just

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.129
going to do now forever.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's talk
about that a little bit more

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.980
because you're on
record as saying

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.938
that, when you were
working on "Black Panther",

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:35.605
you were just focusing
on it being good.

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:36.521
HANNAH BEACHLER: Yeah.

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:37.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.900
But then afterwards,
looking back

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.410
on how big a deal this
is for how many people,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.780
how has your
perspective changed?

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.490
HANNAH BEACHLER: I mean, hugely.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.160
Because it was just
you're kind of in it

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.660
and you can't, like
you were saying,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.890
see the forest or the trees.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.760
So you're just wanting to make
sure it's good and it's right

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.745
and that people are going
to be happy and proud

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:02.026
and that you did
the right thing,

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:03.150
you made the right choices.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.070
Because at the
end of the day, it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.270
was a lot of responsibility
in some aspects.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.120
And then after, when
I saw it, I was like--

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.980
I mean, my eyes were-- because
I did a little bit of the VFX.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.680
I was there for a
little bit, but I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.720
didn't see the final edit.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.670
I saw one of the cuts.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.340
So when I was there in the
theater with everybody else,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.670
I was blown away.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.860
I was like, this is insane.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.410
I can't believe I did this.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.970
And seeing the responses,
it's just on another level.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.975
It's just-- you know, it's
really hard to put into words

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.790
or articulate in a way
that others can understand

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.150
because it really is--

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.670
it made me speechless,
in a sense.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.330
There hasn't been
the words made yet

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.010
to describe what that's like.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.380
But it was certainly always
about making a good movie

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.240
with a great story.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.150
And hopefully, everything
else sort of fell in line.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.280
And then we had other great
filmmakers, Ruth Carter,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.410
who is a Oscar-nominated
costume designer, who

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.880
I worked with really intensively
to make sure that what

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.410
we did matched up, you know?

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.710
Because a lot of what
she did in the foreground

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.970
on the characters defined
who they were on screen,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.280
so that also gave back
to the representation

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.534
of powerful women who had
their own agency about them

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:23.950
and could make
their own decisions

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.517
and stand up for themselves
and could think quick

00:05:26.517 --> 00:05:27.100
on their feet.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.960
That's a whole other
sense of representation

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.300
in a social aspect
for young kids,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.790
young girls, and the
men who treated them

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.920
on this equal playing field.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.820
There was no, like oh, we need
to make it easy for the girls.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.990
You saw the door fight.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.830
You saw the king treat
them as if they were--

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.110
when they were the most
powerful guards in Wakanda.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.636
So it's all of those
things mixed together.

00:05:55.636 --> 00:05:57.760
Then, you talk about the
technology on top of that.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.750
You're giving a new generation,
old generation, my generation,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.540
a whole other narrative
than the one that we've

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.297
sort of heard for the last
how many ever decades.

00:06:08.297 --> 00:06:10.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
talk a little bit more

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.210
about the technology, but not
go away from the human aspects

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.610
that you're talking about.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.026
I think one of things that has
always really interested me

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:22.580
in technology is not how to
make tech just better on its own

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.180
and then teach
people how to use it,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.704
but rather, teach technology
how to be better for people.

00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:28.870
HANNAH BEACHLER: Absolutely.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.786
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I
think that you've really

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.640
captured in this film an
intersection with culture,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.900
and people, and technology.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.372
How did you approach that?

00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:39.830
HANNAH BEACHLER:
That's heavy, man.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.340
You know, very carefully.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.360
Because it's really trying
to understand community, what

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.970
the needs of community
are, and then how do

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.270
we envelope the technology,
just what you said.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.345
And I know, for Ryan,
community was really important.

00:06:57.345 --> 00:06:58.940
And I talked to
a lot of experts.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.190
It wasn't just me sort
of coming up with things.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.390
I talked to a lot of people who
really knew, nanotechnologists,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.580
neuroscientists, archaeologists,
geologists, geographers,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.950
on a daily basis to understand
how to fold that in.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.600
And I think that one of the
biggest things that I did was I

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.590
tried to find--

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.360
a lot of the tech was
based on biomimetics--

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.970
so I tried to find in nature
and in different cultures what

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.235
the use of something was and
then the evolution of it.

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:31.610
Because at the
end of the day, it

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.250
is all about the evolution
of it, how we are in society

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.830
and how we are advancing
technologically.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.370
So it was me relating
these things back

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.280
in a way that represented
what they are really used for

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.560
and how they would
have evolved over time.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.110
And I think technologically,
often times, it

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.950
is the thing for
the thing's sake

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.720
and not, here is
something that has

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.660
been such a big
part of a tradition

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.820
of any nationality, any
ethnicity, any culture

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.780
or religion.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.120
And this is how it becomes
useful in a futuristic

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.490
and an advanced way.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.089
If that means
technology, then that's

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:10.130
the way that it would be.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.350
So that's sort of how I
strung those together.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.810
And then pulling from
nature, that was a huge one.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.980
And thereby, keeping
everything organic, in a sense.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.120
So it becomes not
such a scary thing,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.290
but a very organic thing.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.990
Because we're so used to seeing
certain things in nature--

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.101
patterns, shapes, geometry.

00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:31.850
All of these things--
math, science-- it's

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.049
all around us constantly.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.789
So it was really
easy, at some point,

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.200
to start just looking
just into nature.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.830
Because it is science.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.240
It is technology.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.890
You know what I mean?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.830
The way everything works.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.360
So looking beyond the
hardware and the finish

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.720
of the hardware of it and into
the organic nature of it all.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.049
That's a little dive
into how it went.

00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:01.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It must have
been a very full 14 months

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.740
working on this film.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.740
HANNAH BEACHLER: Beyond.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.390
We were on three continents.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.550
We were in two states.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.370
And I had a team,
at any given moment,

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.850
that were 500 strong,
just in my department.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.260
So we went 14 months,
and we went hard

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.480
as we could go for 14
months to get this done.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.720
My whole team put every
last inch of themselves.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.720
So it was a beautiful thing
because we represented

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.520
the diaspora, just our crew.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.510
So it was a micro
version of the macro

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.520
that we were
building in Wakanda.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.937
I lived that every single
day for a little over a year.

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:42.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.520
I want to ask you
about what's next,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.700
but it doesn't have to
be specific projects.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.650
But it's like, where do you
go from here with everything

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.890
that you've talked about, like
the production design itself,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.560
but the bigger themes and
ideas that you're working on?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.680
HANNAH BEACHLER: You
know, challenging myself,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.740
I think, to try to
continue to do things that

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.450
are out of my comfort zone.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.370
Something I learned
from Ryan Coogler,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.290
who has taken me from
"Fruitvale Station"

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.900
to a boxing movie,
"Creed", to a comic book

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.400
movie, "Black Panther".

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.130
I want to continue
the trend on my own

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.920
and not just be in a place
that I feel comfortable.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.410
My next project with
Melina Matsoukas, who

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.082
was a director for "Insecure"--

00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:24.290
I'm just working on the
pilot for "Why the Last Man",

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.587
which is a graphic novel.

00:10:25.587 --> 00:10:26.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.310
I've read the entire series.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.240
HANNAH BEACHLER: OK.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So good.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.777
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.777 --> 00:10:33.110
HANNAH BEACHLER: So I'm going
to be designing the pilot.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.546
We're working on
that, currently.

00:10:34.546 --> 00:10:36.170
I can't really say
much more than that,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.060
but it's super exciting.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.660
The script is phenomenal.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.310
And our approach to
it is going to be,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.990
I think, something really cool.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.240
So I'm really super
excited about that.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.410
Worked with Beyonce again.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.750
That's all I can say about that.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.583
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Woo!

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.580
HANNAH BEACHLER: And
the future is wide open.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.300
And if the Denis
Villeneuve is listening,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.910
I'd love to do "Doom".

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.130
HANNAH BEACHLER: I throw
that out every opportunity

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.730
I can get.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.360
Denis?

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.193
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:11:06.193 --> 00:11:08.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.094
Hannah, thank you so much
for joining me and sharing

00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:12.760
your story and all
the work that you do.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.430
HANNAH BEACHLER:
Thank you so much.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.280
It's super exciting.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.445
I'm so happy to be
here, and I think

00:11:16.445 --> 00:11:18.070
I'm going to learn
something today too.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.370
So it's all about soaking
in all this greatness.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.290
So fabulous.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:22.957
Thank you.

00:11:22.957 --> 00:11:24.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.590
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.812
