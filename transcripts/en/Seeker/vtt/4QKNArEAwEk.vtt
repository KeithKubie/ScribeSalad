00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.510
Brain games promise to enhance your mind with
stimulating fun.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.230
So what’s to stop some maniac from downloading
all of them, getting a sidekick named Pinky,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.570
and taking over the world?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.320
As it turns out…

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.349
Brain games.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.999
Hello mind craft enthusiasts, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.880
Computer-based cognitive-training software,
or brain games, are a growing market with

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.650
over 10 thousand in the app store.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.029
They promise boosted problem-solving abilities
that will be long lasting.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.079
They claim to help sustain your memory in
your twilight years.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.379
Some even say they can make you good at math!

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.710
All in exchange for few minutes of play a
day.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.489
But nearly 70 scientists have signed an open
letter from the Stanford Center for Longevity

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.329
saying they’re not so sure.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.530
The letter explains that playing these brain
games does make you better at something; playing

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.530
brain games.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.039
The same way that playing a lot of flappy
bird makes you better at unbridled rage!

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.960
But getting better at a very specific task
doesn’t translate to broad cognitive improvements.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.600
The letter also explains that when players
get better at a game, usually it’s because

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.650
they’ve developed a better strategy, and
I can attest firsthand to that.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.570
One of my favorite “brain games” involves
combining numbered tiles to get the highest

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.570
score.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.330
I only got that damn 2048 tile when I changed
up my strategy, not by playing so much my

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.509
planning and spatial reasoning improved.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960
But surely playing these games can’t hurt
right?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.710
Well the letter goes on to explain that the
time spent playing these games could be better

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.610
used doing things known to promote a healthy
brain.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.390
Things like reading, exercise, or being sociable.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
So the opportunity cost of playing a repetitive
game with narrow benefits may make them not

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
worth your time.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.210
If you’d like to learn about more myths
about your brain, like the oft-quoted stat

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.560
that we use 10% of it, Anthony has a video
on that here.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.000
How are you making your brain healthier?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.950
What do you do to get it jump-started?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.670
Let us know in the comments, and I’ll see
you next time on DNews
