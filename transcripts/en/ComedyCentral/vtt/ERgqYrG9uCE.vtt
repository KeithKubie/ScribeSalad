WELCOME BACK.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.110 align:start position:0% line:91%
I AM HERE WITH MY PANEL,
COMEDIAN AND SHOW RUNNER HERE AT

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:14.414 line:85%
THE NIGHTLY SHOW, RORY ALBANESE.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:19.786 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND RETURNING TO THE SHOW,
WRITER AND COMEDIAN, BARATUNDE

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.054 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.090 line:91%
AND HIS NEW DOCUMENTARY, CALL ME
LUCKY OPENS AUGUST 7TH, COMEDIAN

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.627 line:85%
AND DIRECTOR, BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.227 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.161 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUYS.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.263 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THIS
HUNTING STORY.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.831 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THIS THING IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.333 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF COURSE IT HAS BEEN ALL OVER
THE NEWS, THIS DENTIST FROM

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.937 line:91%
MINNESOTA AND ALL OF THAT, WENT
TO ZIMBABWE ON A HUNTING TRIP,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.672 line:85%
KILLED CECIL THE BELOVED LION.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
TWITTER IS BLOWING UP ABOUT
THIS.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANT TO KNOW, DOES ANYBODY
THINK HUNTING IS STILL OKAY?  IT

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start position:0% line:91%
FEELS LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS
LIKE BOXING.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:52.485 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL THAT -- I AM ALL FOR,
ACTUALLY YEAH, I AM ALL FOR

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:56.055 align:start position:0% line:91%
HUNTERS OWNING GUNS BECAUSE IT
INCREASES THE ODDS OF TWO

00:00:56.088 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0% line:91%
REDNECKS BLOWING EACH OTHER'S
HEADS OFF.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.028 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT MIGHT BE FINE.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.931 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ACCIDENTAL HUNTING.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.732 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DICK CHENEY STYLE.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.399 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.170 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT YOU WERE A DUDE.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:11.971 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY WE BROKE UP.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:12.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: EXACTLY.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.207 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT FEELS ANTIQUATED TO ME.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.409 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IT'S INTERESTING,  IN OUR
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WE ALWAYS

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.744 line:85%
HAVE TO DO THAT GUN PHOTO-OP.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.012 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.715 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT HUNTING,
RIGHT?  IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU CAN

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
USE A GUN BECAUSE THEY ARE SHOWN
SHOOTING SOMETHING WHICH IS

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:26.485 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPPOSEDLY AN ANIMAL.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.387 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO IT IS LIKE WE WANT OUR
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO BE

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.423 size:78% position:39% line:85%
ABLE TO KILL GAME, RIGHT?

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:33.793 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE MISSED SOMETHING FROM OUR
PAST AS HUMAN BEINGS AND I THINK

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.762 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DON'T REALLY FIGHT THAT MUCH
ANYMORE, ESPECIALLY IN THIS

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.030 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOCIETY.

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:41.367 line:91%
WE HAVE LAWYERS NOW, AND THAT'S
A LOT LESS EXCITING FOR PEOPLE.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.339 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU SAY 50-YEAR-OLD
MINNESOTA DENTISTS AND THAT

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.609 size:88% position:44% line:85%
DOESN'T EXACTLY IMPLY RAMBO.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.345 line:91%
RIGHT?  HE IS ACTING OUT SOME
KIND OF FANTASY HE CAN CLEARLY

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.147 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT DO IN THAT CHAIR.
&gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE BADASS

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.287 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS ME,
BEING A

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.559 align:start position:0% line:91%
BAD-ASS, YOU KNOW, FLY TO AFRICA
AND (BLEEP) A TIGER.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:07.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.861 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WOULD BE IMPRESSED.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.897 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.099 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY --
&gt;&gt; IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:17.270 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, I WAS GOING TO SAY
TRAVELOCITY HAS GREAT DEALS ON

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.171 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:23.342 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT TRYING TO PLUG OR
ANYTHING --

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:31.517 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;
ENOUGH, WHEN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.720 line:91%
OF DENTISTS, PEOPLE WON'T GET
THEIR ROOT CANAL BECAUSE THEY

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.390 line:91%
ARE AFRAID WITH THIS GUY IN A
CROSSBOW TO MESS WITH THEM.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.259 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE SITTING IN THE
CHAIR AND YOU HAVE A BIG MOOSE

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:41.861 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOKING AT YOU OR SOMETHING,
THEY ARE TERRIFYING.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.997 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I ALSO THINK TOO IT DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU ARE HUNTING, YOU

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.967 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOW, BECAUSE IT IS A DEFINITE
FACTOR.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.436 line:91%
IF YOU ARE HUNTING A LION AND
THERE IS NOT THAT MANY LEFT,

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.406 line:91%
LIKE THERE SHOULD BE AN EQUATION
LIKE IF THERE IS MORE PEOPLE ON

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
AN ISLANDERS GAME THAN
THERE ARE OF THE SPECIES YOU

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:58.944 line:85%
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO KILL IT.

00:02:58.977 --> 00:03:03.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS LIKE -- AND ANYTHING WITH
A NAME, I FEEL LIKE --

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ONCE YOU NAME IT --
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD NEVER

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.254 size:84% position:42% line:85%
NAME RATS IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:11.624 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:12.091 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXACTLY.

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:12.792 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KILLED JERRY.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.629 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT THE (BLEEP)!

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:20.299 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE MINE, STEVE!

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:26.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS LIKE BEN WAS --
&gt;&gt; ASK YOUR PARENTS ABOUT BEN.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:30.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL MY JOKES YOU NEED TO TAKE
A DELOREAN TO GET TO.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:34.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY THE WAY, EVEN THAT DELOREAN
JOKE YOU WILL NEED ONE.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:41.454 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVEN YOUR TIME MACHINE RE
FERENCE REQUIRES A MORE 

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.555 align:start position:0% line:85%
MODERN TIME MACHINE.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:46.592 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS AUDIENCE WASN'T EVEN
BORN WHEN I WAS RELEVANT.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE COVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM
HERE, MAN.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:51.264 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE OTHER THING ABOUT HUNTING
IT IS A ONE-SIDED SPORT MOST OF

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.966 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TIME AND  THAT'S
NOT A REAL SPORT MOST OF THE

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0% line:85%
TIME.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:58.471 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF THE LION GOT BODY ARMOR OR IF
THE HUNTER HAD TO GO IN NAKED

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:02.475 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH JUST LIKE A SHARP BONE THAT
WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING,

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:03.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:04.310 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.  EXACTLY.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:05.544 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S NOT A BAD
IDEA.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:08.781 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ALSO JUST LIKE
TALKING ABOUT SPORTS, I WOULD

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:10.249 size:75% position:38% line:85%
WATCH THAT EVERY SUNDAY.

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE IF IT WAS A DENTIST VERSUS
A LION WITH A BONE.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:13.919 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.254 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT IS GOOD TV.

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.491 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO OFFENSE TO THE NFL BUT I
WOULD WATCH THAT EVERY SUNDAY,

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:23.329 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND ALSO, AND THERE IS A LOT
OF OTHER (BLEEP) YOU CAN KILL IN

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.563 size:81% position:41% line:85%
AFRICA ONCE YOU ARE THERE.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.434 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND IT IS LIKE THERE IS AN
ENTITLEMENT TOO BECAUSE HE PAID

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.605 line:91%
FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING IT,
NOT JUST THE FLIGHT BUT ALSO A

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:36.042 align:start position:0% line:91%
LICENSE, IT IS JUST -- YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WOULD PAY A LICENSE TO KILL A
RICH DENTIST.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD TOO.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.381 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD DO THAT.

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:43.816 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD DO THAT.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.453 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT?  I DON'T THINK WE
FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT ALL

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:47.887 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANIMALS.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.121 align:start position:0% line:85%
I REALLY DON'T.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:52.258 line:91%
IF SOMEBODY KILLED A SHARK, IT
IS LIKE, OH, OKAY BUT PEOPLE GO,

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.026 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, A DOLPHIN.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.994 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:59.632 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT I HEARD DOLPHINS ARE SOME
NASTY MOTHERS.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.168 align:start position:0% line:91%
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN, THEY
RESCUE PEOPLE AND LIKE THEY SAVE

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:03.202 align:start position:0% line:85%
KIDS AND STUFF.

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.970 line:85%
HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED FLIPPER?

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:08.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I AM GOING TO
CHALLENGE ONE OF YOUR

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
REFERENCES.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.375 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.943 align:start position:0% line:85%
A GOOD CALL.

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:14.780 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO DO A GENTLE
BEN RIFF IN A MINUTE.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:19.051 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT --
&gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.019 align:start position:0% line:85%
MEANS.

00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:23.723 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE BOB
DENVER VEHICLE.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:32.331 size:84% position:42% line:91%
EVERY TIME BOBCAT'S ON, THE
RASCAL SALES ARE GOING TO

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:32.665 align:start position:0% line:85%
SPIKE.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.266 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:34.666 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXACTLY.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.569 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:37.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT I KNOW.

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:38.003 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO.

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:38.904 align:start position:0% line:85%
DOLPHINS AREN'T COOL.

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:43.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY ARE ACTUALLY -- I MEAN --
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON.

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:47.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE SAYING THEY AREN'T
COOL --

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:51.317 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LIKE IF WE ARE EATING IT OR
--

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.957 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LIKE THAT IS ABOUT A COOL --
LIKE I AM NOT SUGGESTING WE KILL

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.191 align:start position:0% line:85%
DOLPHINS.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO A
WHOLE THING ABOUT WHAT IS A COOL

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:02.194 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANIMAL.

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:03.929 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE WILL, WELL, TOUCANS ARE
PRETTY COOL.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:06.766 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AT THE END OF THE DAY,
RACCOON YOU GO IN MY TRASH CAN

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:15.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE MORE TIME --
&gt;&gt; BUT KOALAS IN AUSTRALIA,

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:18.043 line:91%
KOALAS, THEY DON'T KILL THEM
BECAUSE THEY ARE ADORABLE, YOU

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:18.744 align:start position:0% line:85%
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:19.912 line:85%
&gt;&gt; ADORABLE SHOULDN'T BE KILLED.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:23.516 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WHOLE THING.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.952 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE, AND BY
THE WAY, I AM A VEGETARIAN AND I

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:31.824 line:91%
LOVE ANIMALS AND I -- YOU KNOW,
I SUPPORT ADOPTING THEM AND I

00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:36.195 line:91%
REALLY DO LOVE ANIMALS BUT WHAT
IS GOING ON IN OUR SOCIETY AND

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:40.332 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE, IT IS
TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:45.571 line:91%
BUT WHEN AN ANIMAL IS CUTE AND
ADORABLE WE SUDDENLY CARE, YOU

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:49.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOW?  AND I THINK AMERICA WOULD
IMPROVE IF WE ACTUALLY HAD

00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:55.748 align:start position:0% line:91%
VIDEOTAPE OF A POLICE OFFICER,
YOU KNOW, BEATING A PANDA

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:56.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT.

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.184 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERICA WOULD IMPROVE.

00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.585 line:85%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WOULD CARE MORE.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:00.519 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.455 align:start position:0% line:85%

WE'D SUDDENLY GIVE A [BLEEP]
ABOUT COPS BEATING PEOPLE.

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:17.570 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL LIONS MATTER WOULD BREAK
OUT ON TWITTER.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.772 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY DOES EVERYBODY HAVE TO TAKE
THIS THEME? 

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:22.775
EVEN THE LIONS HAVE TO
TAKE THE

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:24.109 align:start position:0% line:91%
BROTHERS BACK TO WHAT IS GOING
ON.

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:27.279 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE LIONS ARE NOT TWEETING
THAT.

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:30.082 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND ALSO BY THE WAY JUST FOR
THE RECORD IF A PANDA WAS

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:33.552 align:start position:0% line:91%
DRIVING I WOULD FEEL LIKE
THE COP DOES HAVE A RIGHT TO GET

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:37.923 line:91%
AGGRESSIVE WITH IT, THAT IS
WEIRD, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? 

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:40.125 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY COULD PULL THEM OVER
BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK AND WHITE.

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:42.728 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE DRIVING WHILE
PANDAS.

00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:43.896 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DRIVING WHILE PANDAS.

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WENT WITH PANDAS BECAUSE I
DIDN'T WANT TO BE RACIST.

00:07:47.232 --> 00:07:47.799 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT IS BOTH.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:48.767 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.237 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE BLACK AND WHITE.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.473 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW ABOUT THE BROWN
ANIMALS?  YOU LEFT THEM OUT.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:08:02.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND PANDAS ARE ASIAN SO --
&gt;&gt; ANY OTHER INFO?

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.817 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; AND THERE IS THE KUNG FU

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:12.324 align:start position:0% line:91%
PANDA WHO WOULD KICK YOUR ASS
&gt;&gt; RIGHT,

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:14.894 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THIS CONVERSATION
GOING?  BUT I DO WANT TO ASK

GAME OF HUNT, EAT OR PET.

TRUMP AFTER I HUNTED

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.272 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I JUST WANT HIM TO GO AWAY.

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:02.875 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU WANT HIM TO DIE
AND THEN EAT HIM.

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:03.576 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.411 line:85%

I AM TRYING TO THINK OF LIKE --
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.253 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:17.823 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, DO YOU HUNT TRUMP IN IS
IT LIKE WHEN YOU HUNT A DEER YOU

SMELLS IT?

00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:26.699 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK I WOULD HUNT RICK
PERRY, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.968 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS A CHALLENGE.

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE HAS SOME ANTI-HUNTING
SKILLS.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.072 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES, LIKE RICK SANTORUM.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE IS A SORRY.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:38.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RICK PERRY WENT JOGGING AND
SAW A COYOTE AND

00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:41.747 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PULLED OUT A GUN AND SHOT A

GOES JOGGING HE IS LIKE, WHICH
GUN DO I TAKE?

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE MIGHT KILL YOU.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:51.790 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE PUT A GUN
 IN THEIR SWEAT PANTS WAISTBAND.

00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:53.892 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO GO MANO A MANO.

00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:56.862 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TO EAT, I WOULD GO WITH CHRIS
CHRISTIE.

00:09:56.895 --> 00:10:00.165 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:01.032 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:02.768 align:start position:0% line:91%

KEEP TRUMP AS A PET BECAUSE HE

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:07.840 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:33.432 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:40.473 align:start position:0% line:85%
