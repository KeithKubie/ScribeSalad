As a startup, and learning all this
great data within Google Analytics,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.620
I think the best advice I
would say is stick with it.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.690
It's a lot of information, and I think
a lot of people think it's a little

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.740
daunting because they don't
know where to get started.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.590
What's really great is that we have
a lot of amazing tutorials online.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.030
There's actually a video overview
that kind of walks them through

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.300
the different steps.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.388
Talks about someone who's a bit more,
you know, has implemented and

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.474
maybe used it a little bit more further
than like a brand new start up can

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.752
give them all the tips and
tricks to be successful.

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:30.022
So I think the best advice is
to keep at it and don't give up.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:32.540
And make sure that you can
get help along the way.
