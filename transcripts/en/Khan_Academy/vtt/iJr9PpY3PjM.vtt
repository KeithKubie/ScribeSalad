00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Voiceover] Yuna grows
two varieties of pears,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.750
Bosc and Anjou.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.210
She took a sample of each variety to test

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.160
if their average caloric contents

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.700
were significantly different.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.910
Here is a summary of her results.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.150
And so they give the same data
for both of these samples,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.040
and once again they happen
to have the sample size,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.440
they don't need to.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.700
But over here instead
of giving us a P-value,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.240
we've gotten a confidence interval.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.950
Yuna wants to use these results
to test her null hypothesis

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.220
that the mean caloric content is the same,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.200
versus her alternative hypothesis,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.030
that they are different.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170
Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.850
Based on the interval, what do we know

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850
about the corresponding P-value

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.570
and conclusion at the alpha is equal

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.850
to 0.01 level of significance?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.653
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.663
Remember what a 99%
confidence interval is.

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:04.833
That says that if we
construct confidence intervals

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:09.833
100 times, that 99 of those
times we should overlap

00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:14.370
with the true parameter that
we're trying to estimate.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.220
In that case the true parameter

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.630
is the true difference of these means.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.980
Now when we do a hypothesis test,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.770
we always start assuming that
the null hypothesis is true.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.850
And so if we assume that
the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.830
well another way of writing
this null hypothesis,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.060
if the two means are equal,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.160
that's the same thing as

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.560
the difference of the means equaling zero.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.470
And since we're assuming this,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.146
and this a 99% confidence interval,

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:47.040
then 99 out of 100 times that we do this,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.010
we should see that this interval overlaps

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.140
with what we're assuming
is the true parameter

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.810
right over here.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.890
Now this interval does
indeed overlap with zero,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.040
if you take four minus 6.44,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.200
you're gonna get negative 2.44.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.860
So zero is definitely in the interval.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.190
And so another way to think about it,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.700
we're not in the 1% of the times

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.210
where we don't overlap.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.600
If we were in the 1% of
times where we don't overlap

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.630
with the assumed difference,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.990
then we would reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.260
Or another way to think about it is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.870
our significance level
0.01 right over here,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.440
it's one minus our confidence
level, right over here.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.950
If our 99% confidence interval overlaps

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.900
with mu from the Bosc pears

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.170
minus the mean caloric content

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.860
of the Anjou pears, equaling zero,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.520
then that means,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.830
that means that the P-value

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.190
is greater than 0.01.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.580
And so we could also
say that our p-value is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.940
greater than our significance level,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.750
because that is our significance level,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
and because of that we fail
to reject our null hypothesis.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.340
If this did not overlap

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.750
with our assumed difference in the means,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.070
if it did not overlap with zero,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.080
then we would be in that
one in a hundred scenario

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.130
and then that would tell
us that hey our p-value

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.630
is less than 0.01.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.390
Our P-value is less than one
minus our confidence level

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.510
and in that case we would
reject the null hypothesis

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.690
and it would suggest that

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.820
there is a difference in caloric content.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.390
But because we failed to reject it,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.670
we can't conclude that

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.013
there's a difference in caloric content.
