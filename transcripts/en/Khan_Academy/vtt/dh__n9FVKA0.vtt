00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:01.960
What we're going
to do in this video

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.180
is review the product
rule that you probably

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.001
learned a while ago.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.500
And from that, we're
going to derive

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.720
the formula for integration
by parts, which could really

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.819
be viewed as the inverse product
rule, integration by parts.

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:17.860
So let's say that I start
with some function that

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.950
can be expressed
as the product f

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.940
of x, can be expressed as a
product of two other functions,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.090
f of x times g of x.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.210
Now let's take the
derivative of this function,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.867
let's apply the derivative
operator right over here.

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.200
And this, once again, just a
review of the product rule.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.890
It's going to be the derivative
of the first function

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.460
times the second function.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.050
So it's going to be
f-- no, I'm going

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.750
to do that blue color-- it's
going to be f-- that's not

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.870
blue-- it's going to be f
prime of x times g of x times--

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.480
that's not the same
color-- times g of x

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.740
plus the first function times
the derivative of the second,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.640
plus the first function, f
of x, times the derivative

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.760
of the second.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.315
This is all a review
right over here.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:12.690
The derivative of
the first times

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.770
the second function
plus the first function

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.130
times the derivative
of the second function.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100
Now, let's take
the antiderivative

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.970
of both sides of this equation.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.345
Well if I take
the antiderivative

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:28.540
of what I have here on the
left, I get f of x times g of x.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.540
We won't think about
the constant for now.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.160
We can ignore that for now.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.010
And that's going to
be equal to-- well

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.830
what's the
antiderivative of this?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.160
This is going to be the
antiderivative of f prime

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:50.250
of x times g of x dx
plus the antiderivative

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.200
of f of x g prime of x dx.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.580
Now, what I want
to do is I'm going

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.910
to solve for this
part right over here.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.820
And to solve for that, I just
have to subtract this business.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.530
I just have to subtract this
business from both sides.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.300
And then if I subtract
that from both sides,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.190
I'm left with f of x
times g of x minus this,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.056
minus the antiderivative
of f prime of x

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:38.630
g of x-- let me do that in
a pink color-- g of x dx

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.620
is equal to what I
wanted to solve for,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:51.590
is equal to the antiderivative
of f of x g prime of x dx.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.090
And to make it a
little bit clearer,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.650
let me swap sides here.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.200
So let me copy and paste this.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.000
So let me copy
and then paste it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.230
There you go.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.450
And then let me copy and
paste the other side.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.110
So let me copy and paste it.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.650
So I'm just switching the
sides, just to give it in a form

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.210
that you might be more used
to seeing in a calculus book.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.290
So this is essentially the
formula for integration

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.870
by parts.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.400
I will square it off.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.940
You'll often see it squared
off in a traditional textbook.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.800
So I will do the same.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.730
So this right over here
tells us that if we

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.860
have an integral or an
antiderivative of the form

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.050
f of x times the derivative
of some other function,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.710
we can apply this
right over here.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.960
And you might say, well this
doesn't seem that useful.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.430
First I have to identify a
function that's like this.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.540
And then still I have
an integral in it.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.390
But what we'll see
in the next video

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.190
is that this can
actually simplify

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.360
a whole bunch of
things that you're

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.870
trying to take the
antiderivative of.
