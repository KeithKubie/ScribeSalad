00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.621
- [Instructor] As we talked
about in other videos,

00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:05.283
shortly after the
Declaration of Independence

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:09.131
in July of 1776, the representatives from

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.042
what were colonies but
now self-declared states

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.609
had to think about how
to organize themselves.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.754
And so they start drafting
the Articles of Confederation,

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:20.171
which go into effect in 1781.

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:24.005
Now as we'll see,
Articles of Confederation

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.076
do not provide for any type
of real central government.

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:31.148
It really was a mutual defense union

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:33.079
with a little bit of free trade,

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.480
as well see in the text here.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.989
This is some of the beginning passages

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.007
of the Articles of Confederation,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.926
and I encourage you to
read the whole thing,

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.324
it's actually quite interesting.

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:45.536
But you immediately see it
has a very different tone

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.955
than the one that we see
in the US Constitution.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:49.991
The Constitution starts
with "we the people,"

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:51.932
while the Articles of
Confederation starts with

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:55.779
"to all to whom these
Presents shall come,"

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:57.811
so it's almost, you know,

00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.770
kind of an awkward business letter.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.494
"We the undersigned
Delegates of the States

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:04.672
"affixed to our Names send greeting.

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:07.491
"Articles of Confederation
and perpetual Union

00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:10.670
"between the states of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts-bay,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.538
"Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:16.013
"Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.323
"Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina,

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:19.830
"South Carolina and Georgia.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.483
"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.233
"'The United States of America.'"

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:29.251
This part is interesting.

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.915
"Each state retains its sovereignty,"

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:33.520
so it rules over itself,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.847
it's not giving up its sovereignty
to some type of a union.

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:40.529
So it "retains its
sovereignty, its freedom,

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:44.067
"and independence, and every
power, jurisdiction, and right,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.073
"which is not by this Confederation

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:48.490
"expressly delegated to the United States,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.408
"in Congress assembled."

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:51.963
So they're really viewing themselves

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:54.636
as independent countries
that are next to each other

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:58.856
that for the sake of fighting
the Revolutionary War,

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:01.701
agree to things like mutual
defense and free trade,

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:03.837
but they are really separate countries.

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:07.542
"The said States hereby severally
enter into a firm league

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:10.344
"of friendship with each other,
for their common defense,"

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:12.451
so this is that mutual defense idea,

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.888
"the security of their liberties,

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:16.893
"and their mutual and general welfare,

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:19.341
"binding themselves to assist each other

00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:23.471
"against all force offered
to, or attacks made upon them,

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.886
"or any of them, on account of
religion, sovereignty, trade,

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.794
"or any other pretense whatever."

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:32.690
And then it says, "the better
to secure and perpetuate

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.126
"mutual friendship and
intercourse among the people

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:36.847
"of the different States in this Union,

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:39.251
"the free inhabitants of
each of these States...

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.805
"shall be entitled to all
privileges and immunities

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:43.942
"of free citizens in the several States;

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:47.773
"and the people of each State
shall free ingress and regess

00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:50.848
"to and from any other State,
and shall enjoy therein

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:53.877
"all the privileges of
trade and commerce."

00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:56.310
So people could travel back
and forth between these states,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.177
there would be free trade,
but these would be viewed

00:02:59.177 --> 00:03:01.182
as different countries.

00:03:01.182 --> 00:03:02.992
One interesting thing that you don't hear

00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:05.236
people talk a lot about, there
is even a little passage here

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:09.333
that allows Canada to
join this confederation.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:12.031
"Canada, acceding to this confederation,

00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:14.751
"and adjoining in the
measures of the United States,

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:18.212
"shall be admitted into, and
entitled to all the advanatages

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:20.956
"of this Union; but no other
colony shall be admitted

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.797
"into the same, unless such admission

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:24.433
"be agreed to by nine States."

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.631
So they're saying hey, if Canada agrees,

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:30.400
they are pre-agreeing to allow
Canada to join this union,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.853
which Canada obviously does not join.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:36.056
But it's interesting to think
that they thought about this.

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:38.301
Now what are the weaknesses here?

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.021
Well the most obvious one,
I don't have the entire

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.751
Articles of Confederation here,

00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.748
but how does this United States
of America wield its power?

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.349
Where does its money come from?

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.752
It turns out that if it
needs to generate revenue

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:53.357
in order to take some action,

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:56.151
it can't tax the citizens of the states,

00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:58.316
the states can only do that themselves.

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:00.554
Instead it has to apply to the states

00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:04.223
in order to contribute to
the United States of America.

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:06.806
If you want to take some
type of unified action,

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.315
well you would have to have delegates

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.513
from the various states, and meet together

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:12.907
and decide what to do.

00:04:12.907 --> 00:04:14.762
You wouldn't have any strong leader

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:17.121
being able to take decisive action.

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:19.219
And so there really wasn't a notion

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.818
of a central government here.

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:24.918
There wasn't even a notion
of one country, one nation.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:29.463
It really was about
different sovereign states.

00:04:29.463 --> 00:04:32.252
And all of this, as we'll
see, will come to a head

00:04:32.252 --> 00:04:33.669
in the mid-1780s.

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:38.951
The United States has a
significant amount of debt

00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:41.563
exiting the American Revolutionary War.

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:44.352
Debt to countries like France.

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:46.479
You also have debt on
the individual level.

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.166
Merchants owe money to
European merchants and traders

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.106
and lenders, and these
lenders weren't interested

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:57.020
in paper currency from
these newly created states.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.543
They wanted hard
currency, they wanted gold

00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:00.756
and they want silver.

00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:02.898
And so many of the merchants
in the United States

00:05:02.898 --> 00:05:05.988
in turn put pressure on the
people they lend money to,

00:05:05.988 --> 00:05:09.192
especially poor farmers, many
of whom had been veterans

00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:10.517
in the Revolutionary War,

00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:13.260
to pay their debts in hard currency.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.277
And so you can imagine these poor farmers

00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:17.255
who were kind of the
bottom of this food chain

00:05:17.255 --> 00:05:19.422
were in a pretty tough bind.

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:21.487
They had fought in the Revolutionary War,

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.194
they had risked their lives,

00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:24.991
many of them had been injured,

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.138
but they actually did not
get paid for their service,

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:29.561
to a large degree.

00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:32.767
And then now, they were not
able to even survive as farmers,

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:36.110
because not only were they
not able to borrow new funds,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.879
but some of their existing funds

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.401
they had to pay back in hard currency,

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.724
which wasn't available
in the United States.

00:05:43.724 --> 00:05:47.080
And so all of this tension
eventually comes to a head

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.445
in western Massachusetts.

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:52.472
This right here is a
picture of Daniel Shays,

00:05:52.472 --> 00:05:55.515
who was one of these poor
farmers in western Massachusetts

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:59.140
who was also a veteran of the
American Revolutionary War

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.307
who was not paid for his service.

00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:04.501
And so he eventually
becomes one of the leaders

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:08.669
of these rebellious former
veterans, poor farmers,

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.720
and they start taking the courthouses

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.809
of western Massachusetts,
making them inoperable.

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:16.052
These were the courthouses
where people had to report to

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:19.407
in order to talk about how
they would repay their debt.

00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:23.668
Well you can imagine this
worried many of the merchants

00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:25.700
who these people owed their debt to.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.004
It also worried many of
the founding fathers,

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:30.112
because it took some time

00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:33.081
for the government of Massachusetts

00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:34.917
to be able to react to this,

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:36.715
and while that was happening,

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:40.042
through mid-1786 into
the beginning of 1787,

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:43.963
this rebellion got stronger
and stronger and stronger.

00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.796
Eventually, on January 25th, 1787,

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:50.169
we see things coming to a head

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.435
where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:56.107
to take the armory in
Springfield, Massachusetts,

00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:57.665
which is in western Massachusetts,

00:06:57.665 --> 00:06:59.849
but stopped by militia.

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.469
This is a militia that's paid
for by merchants in the area,

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:05.745
who probably want their debt paid,

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.746
or just wanted functioning courthouses,

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:10.286
or did not want all of
these rioting farmers

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:11.643
and former veterans.

00:07:11.643 --> 00:07:14.516
And so this rebellion is put down,

00:07:14.516 --> 00:07:16.813
but it shows the weakness inherent

00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:18.910
in the Articles of Confederation.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.299
This rebellion starts having
the potential to spread

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.631
well beyond Massachusetts.

00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:26.916
But there was not a coordinated action.

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:29.257
In fact, it took many
months to even be able

00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.817
to field a militia against the rebellion.

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.902
It also highlighted the weakness

00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:36.760
of not having one central government

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.673
that could take decisive action.

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:40.503
Also one central government

00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:43.098
that could generate its own revenue

00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:45.693
through taxing the citizens
of all of the states

00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:49.367
and using that for things like a military,

00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:53.076
or being able to negotiate
debts with foreign countries.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.384
And so Shays' Rebellion is
cited by many historians

00:07:56.384 --> 00:07:59.429
as one of the main catalysts,
after it was put down,

00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:03.062
for having the Constitutional
Convention in mid-1787

00:08:03.062 --> 00:08:06.736
to rethink the Articles of Confederation.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.516
Now as we talked about in other videos,

00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:10.779
many people went to
this convention thinking

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:12.985
we're not just gonna edit the
Articles of Confederation,

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:15.913
we need to create a
stronger central government.

00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:17.363
We need a federalist system where yes,

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.177
the states can have rights,

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:20.901
but we also need a central government.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:22.651
We need a strong leader

00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:24.568
at the head of that central government.

00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:28.326
And so they do draft what
is now the Constitution

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:30.775
at this convention, and
after the convention,

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:33.894
they sell this new constitution,

00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:35.995
because remember, it has to
be ratified by the states

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:37.742
through the Federalist Papers,

00:08:37.742 --> 00:08:39.643
which we also talk about in other videos,

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:41.290
Hamilton organized it,
