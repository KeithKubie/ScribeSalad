delivery really needs to be reinvented

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070

there are several opportunities to

there are several opportunities to
 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.680
there are several opportunities to
innovate around what a so-called primary

since the current model rewards

paying for so-called performance paying
 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.590
paying for so-called performance paying
for coordination of care and paying for

a person who acts as the pin point for
the patient the pain in a way for that

relationship between that primary care

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
relationship between that primary care
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.660
relationship between that primary care
provider and the patient then you would

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
provider and the patient then you would
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.220
provider and the patient then you would
have a way to build some efficiencies

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230
have a way to build some efficiencies
 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.050
have a way to build some efficiencies
into the system

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060
 
 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.980
 
I think patron centracare is really the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990
I think patron centracare is really the
 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.529
I think patron centracare is really the
ethos of primary care we as general

internist pediatricians family doctors

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
internist pediatricians family doctors
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210
internist pediatricians family doctors
are really interested in doing what's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
are really interested in doing what's
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.810
are really interested in doing what's
best for the patient and I think that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820
best for the patient and I think that
 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.590
best for the patient and I think that
can become rather difficult given the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
can become rather difficult given the
 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.380
can become rather difficult given the
pressures put upon us by folks who

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390
pressures put upon us by folks who
 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.389
pressures put upon us by folks who
actually pay for the care because

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399
actually pay for the care because
 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.789
actually pay for the care because
sometimes they might be more interested

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799
sometimes they might be more interested
 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.190
sometimes they might be more interested
in what is the actual cost of providing

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
in what is the actual cost of providing
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.710
in what is the actual cost of providing
care for a population so there are two

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720
care for a population so there are two
 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.230
care for a population so there are two
counterintuitive forces at hand here you

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
counterintuitive forces at hand here you
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.020
counterintuitive forces at hand here you
want the best care for your patient

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030
want the best care for your patient
 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.580
want the best care for your patient
who's sitting in front of you who might

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
who's sitting in front of you who might
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.889
who's sitting in front of you who might
be a diabetic but then you also want the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899
be a diabetic but then you also want the
 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.330
be a diabetic but then you also want the
best care for the population of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
best care for the population of
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.990
best care for the population of
diabetics within a practice primary care

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
diabetics within a practice primary care
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.199

doctors don't really have the tools to

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
doctors don't really have the tools to
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.680
doctors don't really have the tools to
provide both and what we end up doing is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
provide both and what we end up doing is
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.509
provide both and what we end up doing is
providing patient centric care but not

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519
providing patient centric care but not
 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.490
providing patient centric care but not
in the way that we would like to do it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
in the way that we would like to do it
 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.410
in the way that we would like to do it
simply because we don't have the time to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
simply because we don't have the time to
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.509
simply because we don't have the time to
release sit and talk with patients and

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519
release sit and talk with patients and
 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.330
release sit and talk with patients and
think about informed decisions we want

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
think about informed decisions we want
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.890
think about informed decisions we want
patients to have the information and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
patients to have the information and
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.860
patients to have the information and
then be able to make shared decisions

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
then be able to make shared decisions
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.069
then be able to make shared decisions
with the primary care doctor as the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079
with the primary care doctor as the
 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.960
with the primary care doctor as the
person who's sharing that decision with

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
person who's sharing that decision with
 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.240
person who's sharing that decision with
the patient so that would really be what

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
the patient so that would really be what
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.819
the patient so that would really be what
patient centric care is about

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829
patient centric care is about
 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.500
patient centric care is about
unfortunately in today's environment we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
unfortunately in today's environment we
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.559
unfortunately in today's environment we
don't typically have time to practice it

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569
don't typically have time to practice it
 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.289
don't typically have time to practice it
right now again we're paid for what we

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299
right now again we're paid for what we
 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.910
right now again we're paid for what we
do which is actually a perverse

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920
do which is actually a perverse
 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.069
do which is actually a perverse
incentive so it makes us do more and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
incentive so it makes us do more and
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.629
incentive so it makes us do more and
that's one of the reasons I think you're

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639
that's one of the reasons I think you're
 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.009
that's one of the reasons I think you're
seeing the cost of healthcare rise eight

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019
seeing the cost of healthcare rise eight
 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.759
seeing the cost of healthcare rise eight
percent in terms of inflation per year

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769
percent in terms of inflation per year
 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.220
percent in terms of inflation per year
now that obviously can't continue and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230
now that obviously can't continue and
 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.009
now that obviously can't continue and
Obama has some proposals on the table to

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019
Obama has some proposals on the table to
 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.559
Obama has some proposals on the table to
reduce that increase by one point five

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569
reduce that increase by one point five
 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.539
reduce that increase by one point five
percent per year over the next few years

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549
percent per year over the next few years
 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.539
percent per year over the next few years
I think however if you start to pay for

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549
I think however if you start to pay for
 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.210
I think however if you start to pay for
performance pay for quality pay for

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220
performance pay for quality pay for
 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.679
performance pay for quality pay for
efficiency then you eliminate these

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689
efficiency then you eliminate these
 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.100
efficiency then you eliminate these
types of incentives so if a patient has

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110
types of incentives so if a patient has
 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.850
types of incentives so if a patient has
diabetes and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860
diabetes and
 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.920
diabetes and
can self manage their blood sugars which

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
can self manage their blood sugars which
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.650
can self manage their blood sugars which
a lot of patients do but now we have a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
a lot of patients do but now we have a
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.170
a lot of patients do but now we have a
tool which enables the physician or the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180
tool which enables the physician or the
 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.000
tool which enables the physician or the
care provider to actually see those

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010
care provider to actually see those
 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.310
care provider to actually see those
self-manage values and work off of those

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320
self-manage values and work off of those
 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.830
self-manage values and work off of those
to help coach the patient as to how

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840
to help coach the patient as to how
 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.300
to help coach the patient as to how
better manage their blood sugars and

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
better manage their blood sugars and
 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.790
better manage their blood sugars and
behavior then it doesn't matter where

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800
behavior then it doesn't matter where
 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.280
behavior then it doesn't matter where
that management is taking place so if

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
that management is taking place so if
 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.540
that management is taking place so if
that management is taking place at the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550
that management is taking place at the
 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.970
that management is taking place at the
home but the outcome in terms of quality

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980
home but the outcome in terms of quality
 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.990
home but the outcome in terms of quality
is good or better than the visit based

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
is good or better than the visit based
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.350
is good or better than the visit based
model then you have incentives to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360
model then you have incentives to
 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.630
model then you have incentives to
provide this type of care

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640
provide this type of care
 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.090
provide this type of care
so there are certain systems that are in

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
so there are certain systems that are in
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.490
so there are certain systems that are in
the United States right now that seem to

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500
the United States right now that seem to
 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.800
the United States right now that seem to
be able to provide better value based

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
be able to provide better value based
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.840
be able to provide better value based
care these systems that are commonly

geisinger and what they do is that they
 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.030
geisinger and what they do is that they
have the ability to provide care across

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040
have the ability to provide care across
 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.690
have the ability to provide care across
the continuum so if you see someone

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700
the continuum so if you see someone
 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.760
the continuum so if you see someone
within the system you're likely to be

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770
within the system you're likely to be
 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.050
within the system you're likely to be
referred to somebody else within the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060
referred to somebody else within the
 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700
referred to somebody else within the
system and that information that you

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710
system and that information that you
 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.800
system and that information that you
that you is obtained from the first

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810
that you is obtained from the first
 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.290
that you is obtained from the first
person you saw is seen by that second

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
person you saw is seen by that second
 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.510
person you saw is seen by that second
person so you reduce the costs of

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520
person so you reduce the costs of
 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.480
person so you reduce the costs of
repetition additionally those systems

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490
repetition additionally those systems
 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.280
repetition additionally those systems
tend to control their administrative

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290
tend to control their administrative
 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.940
tend to control their administrative
costs a lot tighter and they also tend

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
costs a lot tighter and they also tend
 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.310
costs a lot tighter and they also tend
to follow certain things like formulary

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320
to follow certain things like formulary
 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.890
to follow certain things like formulary
restrictions and they have decision

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900
restrictions and they have decision
 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.030
restrictions and they have decision
support for their physicians in the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040
support for their physicians in the
 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.200
support for their physicians in the
electronic medical records that they use

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210
electronic medical records that they use
 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.760
electronic medical records that they use
and they all have basically a hundred

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770
and they all have basically a hundred
 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.590

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.700
 
electronic medical records are important

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710
electronic medical records are important
 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.650
electronic medical records are important
because they allow for information

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660
because they allow for information
 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.360
because they allow for information
sharing the problem with electronic

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370
sharing the problem with electronic
 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.040
sharing the problem with electronic
medical records is that if there are a

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050
medical records is that if there are a
 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.680
medical records is that if there are a
hundred different vendors and therefore

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
hundred different vendors and therefore
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.850
hundred different vendors and therefore
a hundred different records that

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860
a hundred different records that

effective within the system so the tests
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.920
effective within the system so the tests
aren't repeated you can see tests that

different records with different
 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.850
different records with different
information systems so if you would

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860
information systems so if you would
 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.380

administration is buying cars but we
need to build roads so that the cars can

need to build roads so that the cars can
 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.770
need to build roads so that the cars can
travel and all that information that is

travel and all that information that is
 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.600

obtained at a practice in Denver can be

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610
obtained at a practice in Denver can be
 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.120
obtained at a practice in Denver can be
seen at a practice in Boston if a

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130
seen at a practice in Boston if a
 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.840
seen at a practice in Boston if a
consultation is required in Boston there

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850

the promise of the record starts to come
 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.430
the promise of the record starts to come
to fruition additionally the record can

to fruition additionally the record can
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.490
to fruition additionally the record can
also provide a way for the patient to

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500
also provide a way for the patient to
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.550
also provide a way for the patient to
have some input of end and access to

in the same that the physician should be
 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.310
in the same that the physician should be
able to see a part of a patient's record

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320
able to see a part of a patient's record
 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.110
able to see a part of a patient's record
and that the patient should have access

and that the patient should have access
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.170
and that the patient should have access
to the same information in a view that

to the same information in a view that
 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.400
to the same information in a view that
he or she can understand that would

allow the promise of the record to
 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.159
allow the promise of the record to
really be realized because once you

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169
really be realized because once you
 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.200
really be realized because once you
start giving patients

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210
start giving patients
 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.700
start giving patients
access to their information you start

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710
access to their information you start
 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.920
access to their information you start
empowering patients you start empowering

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930
empowering patients you start empowering
 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.469
empowering patients you start empowering
self management and you start really

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479
self management and you start really
 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:38.339
self management and you start really
developing a shared strategy of care

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349
developing a shared strategy of care
 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.350
developing a shared strategy of care
between the patient and the care

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360
between the patient and the care
 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.810
between the patient and the care
provider

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:43.820
 
 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.600
 
I think that the government should also

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610
I think that the government should also
 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.960
I think that the government should also
think about investing in things that

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.970
think about investing in things that
 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.150
think about investing in things that
enable patients to take better care of

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160
enable patients to take better care of
 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.210
enable patients to take better care of
themselves so again the medical record

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:55.220
themselves so again the medical record
 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.680
themselves so again the medical record
is not enough we need something that

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:56.690
is not enough we need something that
 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.080
is not enough we need something that
patients can see and we need them to

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.090
patients can see and we need them to
 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.420
patients can see and we need them to
have access to their information whether

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.430
have access to their information whether
 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.010
have access to their information whether
it's through readily available

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.020
it's through readily available
 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.140

public library and get their information
 

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.740
public library and get their information
yes there's a question of safety but

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:11.750
yes there's a question of safety but
 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.330
yes there's a question of safety but
that has to be managed appropriately I

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:15.340
that has to be managed appropriately I
 

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.440
that has to be managed appropriately I
think those are the types of things that

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.450
think those are the types of things that
 

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.140
think those are the types of things that
that the government should be spending

scheme and the people behind the

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.180
scheme and the people behind the

technology that matter

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:44.779
 
 

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:47.050
 
I think that we can use available

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.060
I think that we can use available
 

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.449
I think that we can use available
technologies to really transform how we

platforms are available for patients to

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800
platforms are available for patients to
 

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.369
platforms are available for patients to
manage their diabetes to manage blood

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:57.379

pressure we can take examples for

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839
pressure we can take examples for
 

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.319

had the test to see whether they have
 

00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:12.460
had the test to see whether they have
malaria or not they receive an SMS to

medication or no you don't you don't
 

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:18.639
medication or no you don't you don't
need to do anything else so there's an

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:18.649
need to do anything else so there's an
 

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:20.319

throughout the United States why not use

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
throughout the United States why not use

that platform as a way to deliver care
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.530
that platform as a way to deliver care
and I think if we start thinking

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:32.540
and I think if we start thinking
 

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.949
and I think if we start thinking
differently about technology it's not

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959
differently about technology it's not
 

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:39.540

available technology to to manage
patients it has to come from a trusted

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:33.770
patients it has to come from a trusted
 

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.210
patients it has to come from a trusted
source and it should be based in some

source and it should be based in some
 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.370
source and it should be based in some
relationship so the work that I'm doing

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.380
relationship so the work that I'm doing
 

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.830
relationship so the work that I'm doing
for example is really housed in that

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:43.840
for example is really housed in that
 

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.390
for example is really housed in that

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:52.900
technology to enable that relationship
 

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.610
technology to enable that relationship
again for example I have a patient who's

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:57.620
again for example I have a patient who's
 

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.220
again for example I have a patient who's
depressed and I send him home on a

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.230
depressed and I send him home on a
 

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.390
depressed and I send him home on a
medication there's data to show that

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:03.400
medication there's data to show that

medication there's data to show that
patients might be more comfortable

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600
patients might be more comfortable

patients might be more comfortable
interacting with the machine when rating

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.660
interacting with the machine when rating
 

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.260
interacting with the machine when rating
their depression as opposed to

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.270
their depression as opposed to
 

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.610
their depression as opposed to
interacting with a person that's not to

interacting with a person that's not to
 

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.140
interacting with a person that's not to
say that they prefer to receive their

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.150
say that they prefer to receive their
 

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.660
say that they prefer to receive their
treatment for depression from a machine

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:16.670
treatment for depression from a machine
 

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.060
treatment for depression from a machine
but they might be more honest in rating

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.070
but they might be more honest in rating
 

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.710
but they might be more honest in rating
their level with the machine so imagine

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720
their level with the machine so imagine
 

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.110
their level with the machine so imagine
if we enabled patients with the tools to

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120
if we enabled patients with the tools to
 

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.960
if we enabled patients with the tools to
rate their with their depression scores

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:28.970
rate their with their depression scores
 

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.180
rate their with their depression scores
at home and then send those to the

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.190
at home and then send those to the
 

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.760
at home and then send those to the
provider and then have an assessment /

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:33.770
provider and then have an assessment /
 

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.200
provider and then have an assessment /
video conferencing which is shown to be

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.210
video conferencing which is shown to be
 

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.970
video conferencing which is shown to be
effective for a lot of psychiatric

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:36.980
effective for a lot of psychiatric
 

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.270
effective for a lot of psychiatric
issues have that assessment and

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:40.280
issues have that assessment and
 

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.700
issues have that assessment and
follow-up or video conferencing so these

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:42.710
follow-up or video conferencing so these
 

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.620
follow-up or video conferencing so these
are ideas that I think we need to

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:44.630
are ideas that I think we need to
 

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.420
are ideas that I think we need to
explore more in the care delivery stream
