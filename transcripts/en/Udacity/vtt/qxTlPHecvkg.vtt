00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.044
Thanks, Susan. The first focus here is a Visuospatial sketchpad. This is

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:10.701
responsible for visual and spatial information. Try this close your eyes. Are

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:15.935
they closed? Okay, now tell me how many rows of dots there were on the screen.

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:21.103
Okay, open your eyes. Were you right? So for this example, the sketch pad

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:26.019
provides storage for information that's visual. Such as images of photos. In

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.675
this example, you're using your visual spacial sketch pad. When you were trying

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:35.480
to remember how many rows of dots there were on the screen. The second part of

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.731
the storage system is the episodic buffer. This is related to the storage of

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:44.013
inforamation that will become long term memories of specific events. And

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:48.920
finally, We have the Phonological loop. As the name implies, it's our memory

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.106
for sound or linguistic information. Now if we want the information that we've

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:59.001
learned to last, and become a long term memory, we have to rehearse it. And

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.872
this is called Rehearsal. As the name implies, rehearsal is a process of

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:08.020
practicing or reciting the information to ourselves. Now, go back to the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.530
example of the letters I wanted you to remember, your Visuospatial sketchpad

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.336
allows you to see the numbers in your head. Your phonological loop allows you

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:19.684
to hear the numbers, and you'll need to rehears the letters if you want them

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:21.520
for later use.
