00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.310
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: English
words are like prisms.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.740
Empty. Nothing inside.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.790
And still they make rainbows.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.050
So says a character in "Already
Dead," a novel by the late,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.700 position:56%
great American writer Denis Johnson.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.530
Johnson's stories, as legions of
his fans know, are also prisms.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.880
They are hard, merciless, flinty.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.850
And yet they, too, make rainbows.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.700
He has been called a
writer's writer's writer and,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.300
for all the enigma of those three
words, they hold a simple truth.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.620
Those who bring language

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.700
to life recognize Johnson's gifts
instantly Louise Erdrich calls his

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.710
work "profound" and "transcendent."

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.490
Jonathan Franzen finds
"his sentences miracles

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.770
of transparency and tone."

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.780
Philip Roth calls him
"daring,"terrifying,"

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.070
and an emissary for
"tortured," "broken souls."

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.220
Marilynne Robinson marvels that
a writer's personal passions

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.940
and energies can be so
inextricably wedded to his prose.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.240
All agree.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.380
Denis Johnson has managed to give
us "minimalist," yet distinctly

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.770
"ecstatic and hallucinatory"
rainbow prose.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.970
He is an American original.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.780
He was born in 1949 in Munich,
Germany, and raised in Tokyo

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.800
and Manila, the child
of Americans diplomats.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.960
As a teenager, moving back

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980
to Washington D.C. during
the tumultuous '60s,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.180 position:56%
he came to know the country and the
restless characters he would capture

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.760
so vividly in his fiction.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.610
He graduated in English literature
from the University of Iowa

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.730
and earned an MFA from the
Iowa Writers' Workshop,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.090
where he returned as a teacher.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.030
He has also taught at
Texas State University

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.920
and the University
of Texas at Austin.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
In the course of his fevered
career, he published novels,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.180
short stories, journalism,
and poetry.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.220
Among his best known works are
those about the flotsam and jetsam

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.500
of American life: The
Laughing Monsters, Nobody Move,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.540
Tree of Smoke, Already Dead, Jesus'
Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.400
The Stars at Noon,
Fiskadoro, Angels.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.170
He has received numerous
awards for these,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.070
including a National Book Award,
a Lannan Fellowship in Fiction,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.240
a Whiting Writer's
Award, and in 2008,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.460
he was named a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.520
Throughout, he has
chronicled an America

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.140
that has gone unobserved,
unrecorded.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.610
Here are our drug addicts, our
war veterans, our disaffected,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.300
our used up and left behind.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.360
And yet the most affecting
and rewarding aspect

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
of Denis Johnson's fiction
is that, in work after work,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.480
he has proved that beauty often
lurks in unexpected places,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.450
that strength can be
found in failure,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.960
that the human spirit is a
fragile but resilient vessel.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.560
His is a very American story.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.980
He once described his works as
"pressure cookers of language,"

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.660
his characters as those who
inhabit life's perilous edge.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.610
As time wore on, he found that
he himself was all too vulnerable

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.910
to these human frailties.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.190 position:56%
When the Librarian of Congress Carla
Hayden offered Denis Johnson The

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.730
Library of Congress Prize for
American Fiction in March of 2017,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.800
he wrote in an e-mail message,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.300
"My head is spinning
from such great news."

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.130
Two months later, tragically,
he was dead.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.720
The Library is very proud
to honor, posthumously,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.490
this extraordinary human being
and writer, whose contributions

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.910
to the American canon have
been lasting and invaluable.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.470
As the Librarian wrote when the
prize was announced in June, 2017:

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.760
"Denis Johnson was a
writer for our times.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.740
In prose that fused grace with
grit, he spun tale after tale

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.400
about our walking wounded,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.690
the demons that haunt,
the salvation we seek.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.360
We emerge from his imagined
world with profound empathy,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.080
a different perspective-a
little changed.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.900
We are very proud to count Denis
Johnson among the distinguished

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.210
winners of the Library of Congress
Prize for American Fiction.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.160
&gt;&gt; This is been a presentation
of Library of Congress.
