1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,880
Our second look at what
does a patient is a look at.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,200
Our more recent history,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,010
the parts of it that have
medical consequences that
we will also trace in the

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,690
next couple of short lectures.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,450
Here is a table of things that have
happened recently in human evolution.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,040
Things that have happened since our
last common ancestor with chimpanzees.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,620
We have a, an alteration in
the way that our brains grow.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,350
We have prolonged postnatal brain
growth and delayed Myelin is Asian.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,360
These are probably both associated
with our capacity for learning with our

10
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,310
heightened intelligence.
Uh,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
and they appear to be
associated also with childhood,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,530
which is a condition that
does not exist in chimpanzees.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,250
Chimpanzees transition much more
directly from being infants into being

14
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,750
juveniles are brain size
has been much increased.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,840
We have a descended larynx,

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,500
which is very probably associated
with our capacity for language.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,570
We have a high density of eScreen sent
sweat glands that gives us enhanced

18
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,671
sweating capacity and we also have
increased ability to do endurance running.

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,940
So both of these are probably associated
with the ability to hunt down prey by

20
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,560
endurance running on the Savanna.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,530
That also has to do with our hair loss.

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,090
So we are relatively naked of
hair compared to chimpanzees

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,120
in when a woman goes into labor,
when a human woman goes into labor,

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
she has earlier onset and a longer
duration of labor than does a chimpanzee.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,630
Interestingly, we are able to cry, cry.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,660
Crying is a social signal of distress
and it is not something that chimpanzees

27
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:58,650
can do, so it is an enhanced communication
ability. As part of our body language,

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,110
we have enhanced t cell function,
they are relatively hypersensitive,

29
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,290
so that gives us a enhanced immune
resistance and we have a thumb which is

30
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,860
longer and a little bit
more distantly placed.

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,480
We have larger muscles on our thumb and
that also has to do with our ability to

32
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,030
manipulate tools.
In addition,

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,690
our young are born relatively helpless
with more need for parental care for a

34
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,140
two year period.

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,150
We have a short inter birth interval
and the combination of those two traits

36
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,290
means that human reproduction is
necessarily social mothers need help,

37
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,010
otherwise they wouldn't be able to
pull off a short inter birth interval.

38
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:45,240
With a relatively helpless young.
We have delayed maturation,

39
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:50,190
so we start reproducing a bit later
than do chimpanzees and Bonobos,

40
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,350
we have menopause now.
If chimpanzees lived as long as we do,

41
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,570
we might observe
menopause in them as well,

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,420
but in fact our reproductive cycle
matches. There's pretty well,

43
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:05,920
it's just that they die just about at
the point when they stop reproducing and

44
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,900
we continue to survive and that has
to do with our enhanced longevity,

45
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
which is probably due to
our social defense and our
ability to avoid death from

46
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,434
predation.

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,023
Now,

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,850
what has been our recent history
of movement on the planet?

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,340
Homosapiens evolved from another Hammad
ancestor in Africa about 150 to a

50
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,020
hundred thousand years ago,

51
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,460
perhaps a little earlier and spread out
of Africa somewhere around a hundred

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,361
thousand years ago.

53
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:47,361
This thought that we paused in the
mid east for a while and it is likely,

54
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,580
as you'll see in a moment,

55
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,210
the first to move out of the mid
east went in the direction of Europe.

56
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,700
Others, however, probably fairly rapidly,

57
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,930
got down into US Australia
and a into New Guinea.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,900
Then somewhere around
25 to 35,000 years ago,

59
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:12,580
East Asia was colonized
and about 12,000 years ago,

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,110
people made it across the Bering strait
and then spread rapidly all the way down

61
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,540
to the tip of South America
moving very quickly.

62
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,880
The colonization of the islands of
the Pacific is much more recent.

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,790
That probably came out
through Southeast Asia,

64
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,791
possibly Taiwan and went first to the
central Pacific and then from there to

65
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:37,360
Hawaii, Easter island in New
Zealand. Interestingly, by the way,

66
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,830
Madagascar also was only
recently colonized probably
about a thousand or 1200

67
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:42,664
years ago.

68
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,040
Okay.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,700
Africa contains more genetic diversity
than the whole rest of the planet

70
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,430
combined.
As we migrated,

71
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,810
different groups encountered different
diseases and diets and the groups that

72
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,890
moved into America.

73
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:01,390
Pollen in Polynesia left some diseases
behind including measles, smallpox,

74
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:06,391
plague influence and typhus and having
been free of those diseases for on the

75
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,880
order of about 10,000 years when
they Rayanne countered them,

76
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,460
when Europeans then colonize those areas,

77
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,860
they experience very high mortality rates.

78
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,600
One recent result has been great genetic
variation in ability to resist disease

79
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,370
and to metabolize drugs. So if we look
at the global population of humans,

80
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,740
those are two very important
medical characteristics
that vary among individuals

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,230
and that are related
to this recent history.

82
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,970
Now we're going to take a look at what
we can learn from details of the human

83
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,534
genome,

84
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,990
and I would like to start by noting
that all humans are nearly identical.

85
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,163
Genetically.

86
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,660
Our genome is so large that both of
the following statements are true.

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,920
I am 99.9% identical to you.

88
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,490
That means we share 99.9% of our 3.3
billion nucleotides in our DNA sequence.

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,880
At the same time.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That old 0.1% means that my genome
differs from yours at up to 3.3 million

91
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,654
positions.

92
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,830
This is a consequence of thinking
about very large numbers,

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,160
so the first suggests how conservative
inheritance is and the second points to

94
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,230
the flexibility of inheritance.

95
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
Now note that all nucleotide
changes are not equivalent.

96
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,730
You can't really tell the difference
in the organism just from counting

97
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,890
nucleotide changes
because some are neutral,

98
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,540
some alter the structure of a
single protein and some change.

99
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,910
The control over large genetic networks.

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,060
So not all nucleotide changes are equal.

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,730
Genetic differences among human
individuals are of all these types.

102
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,930
So here is a picture of human
genetic diversity. This is
from a paper in science.

103
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,220
In 2008

104
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,840
a group headed by Lee at Stanford looked
at 928 unrelated individuals from 51

105
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:17,681
populations and they looked at 650,000
single nucleotide polymorphisms in each

106
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:19,651
individual.

107
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:24,651
So this picture that you see has 928
individuals or rate along the x axis and

108
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:31,751
the y axis is showing 650,000
single nucleotide polymorphisms.

109
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,930
The colors come from a program called
structure and structure is looking for

110
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,790
groups, groupings in the variation.
It can be set to different levels.

111
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,791
And in this case they found that the
best way to describe the data was to use

112
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,120
seven groups. And you see those seven
groups here, African, Middle East, Europe,

113
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,370
South Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania,

114
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,250
and America that can be tuned.

115
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,800
You can actually set structure
to look for other groups.

116
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,060
So the single nucleotide polymorphisms,

117
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,810
those are differences between two
strands of DNA at a single site.

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,920
And what you see reflected here are
those where one of the differences,

119
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,960
the rarer of the,

120
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,130
of the two differences is at
least 1% of the population.

121
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,510
Now using that same data,
they build a phylogenetic tree.

122
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,500
This is the tree and you can see here
that it's rooted down here where all of

123
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,700
the people in these groups are in Africa.
There's a very long branch here,

124
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,080
which indicates the migration out of
Africa at about a hundred thousand years

125
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,030
ago.
Uh,

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,030
this branch here moving into East
Asia and then over towards, uh,

127
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,800
North America.
Is that about 40,000 years.

128
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,140
These people here in the Middle East,
these people here or in Europe,

129
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,530
these people here are sort
of at the boundary between
Europe and Southeast Asia,

130
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,790
South West Asia.

131
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,830
And then these people are
in China, Japan, Korea,

132
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,820
Southeast Asia.

133
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,450
And then up here we have north
Americans and south Americans.

134
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,370
And here we have people in Melanesia.

135
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,670
Now

136
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,780
if you take that data,
you are able,

137
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,410
because there's so much data
to discriminate local groups.

138
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,550
So here for example, we can see
here are the Basques in this group.

139
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,080
Here are the French here, here are
the Italians, here are the Tuscans,

140
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,370
the Sardinians or off here.
The Russians are out here.

141
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,360
The Arcadians to people in the Orkney
islands are up here in the attic.

142
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,361
Gay Eds who are in the northwest
caucuses are down here.

143
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,570
So it looks like with this data you can
see quite a bit of differentiation of

144
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,770
what we would call ethnic groups, but
these are principle components. Okay,

145
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:14,600
so this is a statistical abstraction of
a huge dataset and I'd like you to note

146
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:18,440
how much of the variation
is being accounted for by
these principal components.

147
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,830
The first one accounts for 2.4% and the
second one accounts counts for 1.6% so

148
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,460
if you add that up and you look
at total human genetic diversity,

149
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,560
we're only looking at a pattern that's
being discriminated with 4% of total

150
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,030
human genetic diversity here.

151
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,840
If we then ask how is human genetic
diversity allocated between individuals,

152
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,950
among groups like the
ones we've just looked at,

153
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,570
among larger divisions such as people
coming from different continents and so

154
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,000
forth.
We find a very reliable pattern.

155
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,800
Most genetic differences are among
individuals and only about six to 11% of

156
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,920
those differences are among
what we call racist. Okay,

157
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,230
so here are the results of four
different studies of increasing technical

158
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,830
sophistication. This last one is
the one that we just looked at.

159
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,330
They used from three to seven groups
than they had populations and samples

160
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:19,780
within those groups.

161
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,810
So that would be a within populations
that would be variation among individuals.

162
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,540
In this last date of said it
was 89% among populations.

163
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,820
Then we can see that among all
of those groups that we saw,

164
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,950
the population groups in that slide,

165
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,300
this was 2.1% and some of the other
studies that goes up to about 8% so that's

166
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,150
like differences between the French
and the Russians and so forth.

167
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,030
And then when we look among groups, that's
somewhere between about six and 11%.

168
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:55,090
So these are the things that
people would call races.

169
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,930
The take home message on this is that
race is not a very significant biological

170
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,110
phenomenon.
And when we look at skin color,

171
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,250
which most people use is their
method of discriminating race,

172
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,220
we can make the following observations.

173
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,480
Our primate ancestors have light skin
under dark hair, so they're exposed.

174
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,380
Skin was light at birth and darkened
with age. If you take a champion,

175
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,400
you shave off all of its, uh, hair.
It has a fairly light skin color.

176
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,610
About two to 3 million years ago,

177
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,560
we evolved black skin to protect ourselves
against skin cancer and against fully

178
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:37,120
depletion when we lost our hair and we
probably lost our hair to improve our

179
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:41,650
ability to sweat the coolest down because
we had become long distance runners to

180
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:46,300
hunt down prey.
So when did we evolve other skin colors?

181
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,570
Well is probably between about 10 and a
hundred thousand years ago in some cases

182
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,650
fairly quickly.

183
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,240
And it was done to improve vitamin D
synthesis in cool climates where people

184
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,074
wore clothes.

185
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,030
Skin color is therefore
a superficial trait.

186
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,920
It's coated by a small number of
genes and it can evolve quickly.

187
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,930
It is caught in a trade off between the
benefits of Vitamin D and the costs of

188
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,270
skin cancer and fully depletion.

189
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,630
So to summarize,

190
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,950
we've evolved changes in many traits of
medical significance since our shared

191
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,320
ancestors with chimpanzees and Bonobos,

192
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,560
we emerge from Africa about 100,000
years ago. We are all Africans.

193
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,150
As we moved into environments
with different diets and diseases,

194
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,050
we've all genetic differences in disease
resistance and in drug metabolism.

195
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,680
Both of them are quite now quite variable.
Now among patients,

196
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,860
race isn't mostly a social construct,
it's not a biological reality,

197
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,270
but there are genetic differences
because the genome is so vast,

198
00:13:55,271 --> 00:14:00,271
there are genetic differences associated
with ethnicity that do contain useful

199
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,450
medical information.

200
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,950
So we need a nuanced view of what we can
learn from the fact that someone comes

201
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,360
from Africa who comes from Europe.
