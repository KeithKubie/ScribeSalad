00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.611
( applause )

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.416
Trip Jennings: I was thinking
about what to say about risk

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.719
and why we take it,
preparing for this presentation,

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.054 line:0%
and I remembered a moment

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.957 line:0%
when I thought a whole lot
about that question,

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.859 line:0%
"Why do we take these risks?"

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.028 line:0%
I was dangling
from a very thin rope,

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.897
not a climbing rope
but a throw rope

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.432
that you use in a kayak,

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.500
trying to rappel

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.635
to the bottom of the
Pandi River Canyon

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.739
in the very remote jungles
of Papua New Guinea.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:40.974
Here's a shot of the river

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.277
as it flows out of the mouth of
the Pandi River.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.012
And the evening before,

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:49.082
I had had the most terrifying
experience

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.683
I've ever had in a river.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.886
I was 100 feet down into
the canyon...

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.855
...when I reached the end
of my rope.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.090
Still 40 feet
from the very bottom.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.693
And, so, I had to wait
for like an hour

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.562
while my friends
walked through the jungle

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.164
to get some more rope
to lower down to me.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:07.266
So, that was a
pretty good moment, right,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.768
to kind of think about...

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.703
"Why do we take these risks?

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:11.805
How did I get here?"

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:14.040
And so,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.008
we'd come to Papua New Guinea
to paddle the source

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.477
to sea descent of the
Pandi River.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.180
Right, it was a river that had
never been explored in a kayak.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.181
The reason
we'd chosen this river

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.050
was that it was slated

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.818
to be logged and clear-cut

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.320
for an oil palm plantation.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.588
So we wanted to use
our adventure story

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.724
to tell a story about a culture

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.793
and ecosystem
on a brink of change.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.563
We started at the
underground source of the Pandi,

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.830
deep in a cave.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.432
And we made our way down

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.600
through some
of the most beautiful

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.536
and amazing white water
I've ever seen,

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.805
through some small waterfalls,

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.406
and some large waterfalls.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:50.209
And towards the end of the day,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.745
we got to a point where

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.547
the whole Pandi River
poured off of a 20 foot cliff

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:59.318
into this cauldron where all of
the water re-circulated back

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:03.222
upstream into a cave
behind the waterfall.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.523
It was way too dangerous to run,

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.824
even though
it wasn't a big drop,

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.760
but it was
way too dangerous to run.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.595
Because that's not
a good place to be;

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.430
behind a waterfall, stuck.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.600
And so,
it was almost dark,

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:20.072
and the canyon walls were
100 feet vertical on all sides.

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.674
There's no way out but down.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.677
That's the worst place you ever
want to be in a kayak, right?

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.946
That's like
every kayaker's nightmare.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.314
And so we decided
what we would do,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.450
is we would make our way
on to this small cliff

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.418
as far downstream as we
could on river right.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:36.121
We'd hop in our kayaks
and slide off of the cliff

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.124
into the river
and if we did it just right,

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.794
we'd be downstream
of the upstream flow.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.196
The re-circulation area.
We'd make it out all right?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.601
So, I went forth
in the twilight, almost dark.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.536
I caught--
It went fine.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.371
I caught the very first eddy
that I could,

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.808
so I could stop and run safety
for Matt Fields-Johnson.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.010
He was our photographer
on the expedition

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.046
and the least experienced member
of the crew.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.049
And I watched him
slide off of the...

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.185
the sort of cliff,
the precipice there,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.489
and watched his boat
turn sideways in the air,

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.259
land, flip
and get sucked upstream

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.563
behind the waterfall into,
kind of, the worst place to be.

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:20.266
And,
he rolled a few times,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.302
lost his paddle,
flipped over again

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.805
and swam out of his kayak.
His kayak went downstream

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.474
and he was stuck
in this really turbulent pool,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.541
barely able to breathe,

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.177
every now and then
getting a breath.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:35.381
And, thankfully, Brian Eustis
was still on the cliff.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.783
He hadn't gone yet.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.684
He tried again and again
to toss him a rope, right,

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.654
to get him anything to help him
get out of that spot,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.990
and he just couldn't because
the cliff was so overhung.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.593
And so, after a few minutes,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.263
Matt was fa--
was floating

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:51.531
face down,

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.332
totally out of air,

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.267
totally out of breath and
totally exhausted.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.571
And I was watching
my friend Matt drown.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:01.574
And I couldn't do
anything about it

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.843
because the current separated me
from where he was.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:07.847
And so, at the very,
sort of, very last resort...

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.149
...Brian lowered
all of the rope.

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.652
He just tossed all of the rope

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.120
and held on to
the very end of it

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.656
and let it circulate around
and around in the pool

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.158
in that turbulent,
sort of, cave.

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:20.960
And finally,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.296
a bit of it grazed
Matt's knuckles

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.031
and he grabbed--
grabbed the rope,

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.231
he pulled up on it,

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.067
he got a breath using his
last little bit of oxygen.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.905
And, he and I had worked at
a summer camp for years

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.340
together and we had always
taught the kids,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.777
"Oh, this is how you do this
cool trick knot,

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.345
a one-handed bowline,

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.080
and if you ever fall off
a cliff,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.516
- with one hand on the rope...
- ( audience laughter )

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.050
...it'll save your life."

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.520
And so that was how we got
kids to get excited about it.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.988
And we never-- We always
thought that was total BS.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.692
- ( audience laughter )
- Until he pulled himself up,

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.628
threw one handed bow
and then fell back into the rope

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.830
and Brian was able
to pull him up just enough

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.699
and Matt clawed his way back up
onto the cliff, right?

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.502
And I was watching this with
my flash light at this point,

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.237
my head lamp,
because it was dark.

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:07.907
So, Matt passed out
from total exhaustion

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.575
just a few minutes later.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.911
Well, sort of,

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.213
separated from his boat,
separated from his gear,

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:17.116
with nothing on
but his kayaking gear

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:21.054
to shiver and snuggle with Brian
all night long.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.856
And... So the next morning,
the rest of our job

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.759
was, kind of,
to get up and around...

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.862
...to a place that we could
rappel down

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.296
into the river canyon.

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:33.265
Make sure that
he could swim safely,

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:35.434
run safety for him,
as he swam

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:37.203
across the river upstream
of the rapid

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:39.371
that had nearly killed him
the night before.

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:42.708
And so, that's where
I got to the end of my rope.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.646
And I was sitting there
thinking to myself:

00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:50.683
"How did I get here,
why...

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:51.884
why do we do this?"

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.854
And few of the reasons
that really...

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.623
...stuck out in my mind,

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.725
I think
are really important lessons

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:02.662
that I bring with me
on and off the river.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.464
And I want to share a few,
a few of them with you.

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:07.533
So, when you are deciding

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.401
whether or not to
run a rapid, right?

00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:10.736
That's one of the
most important decisions

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:12.337
you can make as a kayaker:

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.206
when to run and
when to walk around it.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.442
And so, what I first want to do

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.511
is I want to look at
all of the hazards, right?

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.313
I want to look at all the things
that are terrifying

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.048
and dangerous about that,
that particular rapid.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.116
Or maybe it's an expedition

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:25.384
or any risk you want
to take, right?

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:27.186
I want to look at the
dangerous things.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.854
Look at the--
I want to know where they are,

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:30.923
what they are and
what they might do to me,

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.191
if I mess up
and how to get around them.

00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:36.628
And I, kind of, like to hold
those things in my fear hand.

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.931
And then I like to think about

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.400
why I want to paddle this rapid,
right?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.968
There's good reasons to do it.

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:46.472
I love being immersed in this
beautiful river

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.609
and working with it
to get myself safely

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.243
through a hard spot.

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.679
But there's also other reasons,
right?

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.481
Maybe we want to
impress our friends.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.016
Maybe there's a really good
photographer on the trip

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.351
and you want to get
that awesome image.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.019
Maybe you've got some
camera courage going.

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.087
And...

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:05.191
I like to think of those things
as, kind of, the ego

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:08.160
and I like to hold those things
separate, right?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.295
So that I can, kind of,
acknowledge them

00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:11.364
because they are there,
they are real,

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:12.999
they exist for all of us.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.133
But I don't want them to be part
of my decision making process.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.369
And so, once I've separated
those two out,

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:19.171
I've got a look inside.

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:22.107
I've got to, kind of, listen to
my gut and my intuition, right?

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:25.411
And say,
"Can you run this rapid safely?"

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:29.915
And...
there's this, kind of,

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:34.320
beautiful moment, right,
when you really decide,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.556
when you are able to separate
out these things.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.559
We like to say that

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:43.462
running hard white water
is 60 percent mental,

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.265
and 40 percent actually
being strong and paddling

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.100
and having it balanced
and knowing the strokes.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.502
Because this is
a hard process to fake,

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:52.404
to really be honest
with yourself.

00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:56.141
About why you want to do this,
and can you do it, right?

00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:59.311
And so,
once you've reached that point

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:03.382
and you've really separated out
the fear and the ego

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.751
and you've checked in
with your gut,

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:09.021
there's this beautiful moment
of clarity

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.290
and, kind of,
freedom that I feel.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.694
And it's kind of, it's this
euphoric and rare thing.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.762
And as you take
that last stroke,

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.898
you paddle out of the eddy,

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:22.401
that stroke that commits you
into paddling a drop,

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:26.738
into a decision that you've made
wholly on your own

00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:29.775
to run this,
to take this risk

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:30.976
and to paddle this rapid.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:33.045
That's one of the
most empowering feelings

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:35.514
I've ever had
in any experience in my life.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:40.719
Because that is where we really
unlock our true passion.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.656
We unlock and, we sort of,
are able to get in touch with,

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:46.759
you know,
what makes us tick,

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:49.094
in our really--
our true potential.

00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:51.430
We are able to do, you know,
what we are here to do.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:55.334
And so, what I needed to do
at that moment

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.802
was get that rope

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:59.304
and get to the bottom
of the Pandi River Canyon,

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:00.405
which I did.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:04.076
Matt was able to swim across,
no problem.

00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.345
He got up, he got out.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.646
We got him to his boat

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:11.083
and we paddled for the
rest of the week downstream

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.051
to complete the first source

00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:14.887
to sea descent of the
Pandi River Canyon.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:18.691
And, as I think about
that expedition,

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.825
and as I, sort of,
reflect on that,

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:22.995
I think it's clear to me now,

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:26.932
seven, eight years later
and many expeditions later,

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:30.202
that, you know,
I let that ego get in my way.

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:33.739
I really wanted the photos
that Matt would take

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.240
because he is a
great photographer.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.075
And so I invited him
on an expedition

00:09:37.075 --> 00:09:39.311
he probably wasn't ready for.

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:40.579
And...

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.649
You know,
I got him into a situation,

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.350
we all got into a situation,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.319
that he couldn't get out of
on his own.

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:49.588
And almost paid
a really big price for that.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.022
And that's something I,
kind of, carry with me

00:09:51.022 --> 00:09:53.158
in my decision-making processes
in life

00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:54.427
and on the river.

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:58.163
I think if I'm going to
risk my life

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.632
to tell a good story,

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.902
I want to make sure that that
story is really worth telling.

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.770
That means telling a story

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.873
that really helps us
as individuals,

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:10.075
and as a society,

00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:13.045
decide how we want to relate
with each other

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.980
and with the ecosystems

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.648
that make life on this
Earth possible.

00:10:16.648 --> 00:10:18.484
So, I hope that everybody will

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.886
challenge yourselves
to be risk takers

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.021
and make it to the end.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.622
Make it to the sea.

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.057
Thanks a lot.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.526
( applause )

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:30.062
