00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:05.232
- So I have the number 235,
and we can think of that as

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:07.357
2 hundreds, we have a
2 in the hundreds place

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:10.696
so 2 hundreds, 3 tens, we
have a 3 in the tens place,

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.623
so 3 tens, and 5 ones, we
have a 5 in the ones place.

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:16.186
And over here I've actually drawn it out

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:20.599
with that many boxes, this is 235 boxes.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.412
So you have 2 groups of a hundred boxes,

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:28.051
so this is 2 hundreds,
then we have 3 tens, 1,2,3.

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:30.160
And then we have 5 ones.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.585
Now let's try some
interesting things here.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.830
So what happens if I were to add 10 here.

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:42.592
Well adding 10, we're just adding 1 ten.

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:46.086
We're just adding 1 ten.

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.494
So if we add 1 ten,
what's going to happen?

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.193
Well, over here I need to add one more 10,

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:52.815
I've got to add this 10.

00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:54.097
So what's it going to look like?

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:56.469
Well that, the next 10 is
going to look like this.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.986
Let me see if I can draw it pretty fast.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.117
So we have one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:06.529
six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:08.084
One, two, three, four, five,

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:10.300
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.178
So I just added a ten.

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:14.118
So what does that leave us with?

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:18.755
Well if I had 3, if i had 3
tens, and I have 1 more ten now,

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:23.146
now I'm going to have 4 tens,
now I'm going to have 4 tens.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.909
I'm gonna do that in that yellow color.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.838
So now I'm going to have 4 tens.

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:32.741
I'm still going to have 5 ones, 5 ones,

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:35.359
I'm still gonna have 5 ones,
I'm not adding any ones there.

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:39.845
So I'm still going to have 5 ones, and

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:40.882
I'm still going to have 2 hundreds,

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:43.540
I'm not adding any hundreds there, so

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.491
I'm still going to have
2 hundreds, 2 hundreds.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.079
So now it's going to be 2 hundreds,

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.792
plus 4 tens, plus 5 ones.

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:54.585
2 hundreds plus 4 tens plus 5 ones.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:56.432
Well what's that going to be?

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:01.432
Well, 2 hundreds, plus 4 tens,

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:06.103
plus 5 ones: 245.

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:06.860
Let's do one more.

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.489
Instead of adding a ten,
let's add a hundred.

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:10.979
So let's do that, let me see

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.827
if I can clear all this stuff out, so...

00:02:16.257 --> 00:02:20.416
So instead of adding 10 lets add 100 here,

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:25.516
so I'm going to add, so plus, let's add

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:29.579
1 hundred, 1,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.698
I'll actually do it in yellow and in blue.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.261
So I'm adding 1 hundred,
0 tens, and 0 ones.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.747
So essentially just adding 1 hundred.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:44.978
So this is going to be
equal to, so plus 1 hundred.

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:51.274
So plus 1 hundred, so
what's that going to get me?

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:54.483
Let me draw it out here,
let me copy and paste.

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.038
I have 2 hundreds before but
now I'm going to add 1 hundred.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.025
So let me just copy that,
and let me paste it.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.470
So now, how many hundreds do I have?

00:03:07.573 --> 00:03:10.352
How many hundreds do I have now?

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:13.832
Well now i have one, two, three hundreds.

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:16.322
I have 3 hundreds.

00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:19.057
So over here, I had 2 hundreds,

00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:21.511
I'm adding one more
hundred right over here

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.107
so now I have 3 hundreds.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.469
Over here I could say that
now I have 3, 3 hundreds.

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:31.405
Now, are the number of
tens, have they changed?

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:34.260
No, I had 3 tens before, and
I'm not adding tens this time

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.810
so I'm still going to
have 3 tens, and I had

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.652
5 ones before and I'm
not adding any more ones

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.559
so I still have 5 ones.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:45.001
So I have 335, which is the same thing as

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.139
3 hundreds plus 3 tens, plus 3 tens,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.040
plus 5 ones, plus 5 ones.
