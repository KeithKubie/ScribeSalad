00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
than the second half actually all that
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 align:start position:0%
than the second half actually all that
buildup<00:01:17.280><c> is</c><00:01:17.490><c> great</c><00:01:17.790><c> and</c><00:01:18.090><c> then</c><00:01:18.210><c> in</c><00:01:18.509><c> the</c><00:01:18.630><c> end</c>

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 align:start position:0%

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.109 align:start position:0%
buildup is great and then in the end
like<00:01:19.049><c> see</c><00:01:19.439><c> now</c><00:01:19.619><c> I'm</c><00:01:19.890><c> the</c><00:01:20.100><c> opposite</c><00:01:20.610><c> I</c><00:01:20.759><c> actually</c>

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 align:start position:0%

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
didn't always work because it's such a
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.330 align:start position:0%
didn't always work because it's such a
