1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.460
Okay,
welcome back.
Hope you had a good break.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.420
Can you remember back to when we before break,

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.520
we were talking about the last thing we did was this a gyroscope bicycle wheel

4
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:19.941
precession to show what would happen to a nucleus that was spinning in a

5
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.480
magnetic field or um,
uh,
an electron for that matter.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.130
Just to rehearse it a little bit,

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.390
remember the idea of a pulse of 90 degree pulse.
If you,

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
if you have a big magnetic field,
the blue one,
they are really enormous.

9
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.850
And then the little magnet of the,
um,
of the nucleus,
uh,

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
precesses at a hundred megahertz,
for example,
in a certain field,

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.610
right?
And that gives rise to a constant vertical field,

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.420
but a rotating horizontal field from that one.

13
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.410
So the question is whether that rotating horizontal field,
which is UC,

14
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.810
it will be going back and forth and back and forth,

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.540
will act as an antenna and give you a signal.
You should,

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.500
you should be able to pick up a radio signal at 100 megahertz.
Indeed,

17
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.710
you should be able to accept that there's not just one proton.

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.660
There are lots of protons and they're in different phases of precession,
right?

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
So although they all add vertically and you have a substantial vertical

20
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
magnetism from those,
they're horizontal components cancel,

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.150
right?
So you don't see anything.
In fact,

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.410
the energy is so small of the interaction of each of these magnets with the

23
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:33.180
field,
that there are one's pointing the opposite direction with higher energy,

24
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.100
almost exactly the same population.
Just a tiny,
tiny difference.

25
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.930
But we'll look just at the excess.
Obviously one's down,
we'll cancel ones up,

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
okay.
But if we look just at the net ones up,

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.810
even they cancel because there are different phases of rotation or a precession

28
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.710
about that access.
Okay?
But you can do a trick.

29
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.770
I remember we could,
we could,
um,
uh,

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.870
consider that we're rotating with them so that they look like they're standing

31
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.230
still.
And then in our frame,

32
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.910
we'll put on a little bit of a magnetic field that's horizontal,

33
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.080
a very weak field.
And now as far as we can see,

34
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.730
we don't care about the big field anymore because we've compensated for it by

35
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.550
orbiting around this thing is we're looking at it,
right?

36
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.910
But what we see is that these will begin to precess in our frame around that

37
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:33.480
horizontal field.
So they'll do a slow precession all of them in that direction.

38
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.810
So there'll be going like this,
I'll start here,
they'll go there,

39
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.200
then they'll go down and they'll go back and then back up again,
right?

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.180
But we're going to put on a pulse only long enough of this field so that they go

41
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:49.170
down to here.
Okay,
that's called a 90 degree Pauls.

42
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.480
And they'll rotate down like that.
And now forget the rotating frame.

43
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.440
They'll look like they're just pointing out toward us in the rotating frame.

44
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.860
But if we go back to the real frame,
the laboratory frame,

45
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.510
what we see is this whole bunch priestessing around the field,
right?

46
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.280
And now as they precess around the field in the laboratory frame,

47
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.860
right?
There will be a net horizontal field that they're generated,

48
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.240
magnetic field and that will be the antenna that broadcasts a signal that we can

49
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.560
hear.
Okay.

50
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.550
And what will determine the frequency of that signal that's going to be coming

51
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:32.020
out from going back and forth and back and forth or around what will its

52
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.080
frequency be?
How rapidly are they processing

53
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.010
says a hundred megahertz and what determined the 100 megahertz,

54
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.340
the strength of this big magnetic field.
Remember,

55
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.060
the more you twist on something,
the faster it precesses,
right?

56
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.450
So we could make it a hundred megahertz.
If we had half as big a big field,

57
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:56.290
it'd be 50 megahertz or twice the field,
it'd be 200 megahertz and so on.

58
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.240
Okay.

59
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.740
So we get a signal that's a hundred megahertz radio frequency in the laboratory

60
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:06.100
frame that we could detect with an antenna,
okay.

61
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:10.180
But in time it will relax.
This is a non equilibrium situation.

62
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.840
When we put the energy in to make you go down and in time it'll come back to

63
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:17.290
equilibrium.
And that process is called relaxation.

64
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.840
And there are various things that control how fast that happens,
right?
But,

65
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.430
but it will reestablish equilibrium and it will be very important later in the

66
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:30.640
lecture about this relaxation.
And you'll see why.

67
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.530
Okay,
so in 90 degree,
pulse makes the Spinning Nuclei,

68
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:40.531
protons are see thirteens broadcast a frequency that tells what's their local

69
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.320
magnetic field is.
The higher the field,

70
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.050
the faster they precessed the higher the frequency.

71
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.540
Now let's first look at this as,
as it arises in magnetic resonance imaging,

72
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.870
where the purpose is to locate protons within the body using a nonuniform

73
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.730
magnetic field.
Now the idea of tomography is important here.

74
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.130
I've taken this from a Colorado physics 2000 page,
okay?

75
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:13.630
So this is a slice through somebody's body,
show their ribcage,
spine,
and so on.

76
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:17.890
And they're wearing some sort of jacket that's opaque to x-rays.
Okay?

77
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.300
And we're interested in,
in finding what it looks like inside.
Okay,

78
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.410
where are these things are?

79
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.300
So what we do is we take x rays and send an x ray beam straight through and see

80
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:29.470
how much gets through.

81
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.650
And we scan the xray from top to bottom and see how much gets through it.

82
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:38.500
Every different x coordinate.
So we do a scan and it starts at the top,
but oops,

83
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.530
there's something there and there's even more there and lots then a little bit

84
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:46.390
more and when we hit the spine there's going to be quite a bit right and so on.

85
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.430
But that's just a one dimensional picture of the density,
okay?

86
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.820
Now what we're going to do is take that same picture and just smear it out to

87
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.680
the right,
okay,

88
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.520
so that's the profile top to bottom or stomach to back,

89
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.850
right of this particular slice through the body of bones or whatever it is,

90
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.120
okay?
Now the neat trick is that you rotate that,

91
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.480
rotate it by 15 degrees and now do the same thing again and super impose the new

92
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:23.171
one on the old one and now rotate another 15 degrees and do the same trick scan

93
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:25.311
top to bottom.

94
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:30.311
And I had it up and do it again and again and again and again and again,

95
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.440
again,
again and again and see what you got.
Now

96
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.760
when you super impose all of those,
you get what it looked like,

97
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.570
the two dimensional slice through the thing,
so that's called Tomography.

98
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.530
If you can tell,

99
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560
if you can get a one dimensional projection and do it in lots of different

100
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.830
directions and add them together,
you can get the two dimensional,
Laura,
in fact,

101
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.130
a three dimensional picture of what's going on inside.

102
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.000
So that's the trick that's used,
except you want to do it for protons,

103
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.770
not for bone.
Okay?
So we want to find protons in the body.

104
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.970
For example,
let's find where there's fluid water in the body,
okay?

105
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.520
So there's a body,
okay?

106
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.820
And we put it inside this cylinder and wrapped the cylinder with special wire

107
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.270
that if we cool it to liquid helium,
temperature is superconducting.

108
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.410
So essentially we've made a big solenoid magnet,
okay?

109
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.680
That goes along the body's axis,
okay?

110
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.010
Now what will happen?
Well,

111
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.860
suppose that field is 1.5 Tesla,

112
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.450
which means 15,000 cows.
A Gaussian,

113
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:44.510
remember is about the size of the earth's magnetic field,
more or less.
Okay,

114
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.670
so 15,000 times as strong as the earth's magnetic field.
Okay?

115
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.940
So what will happen to the protons in there?
Well,

116
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.730
they're gonna precess,
right?

117
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.570
And in that field at 15,000 cows or 1.5 Tesla,

118
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.110
they'll precess at 63 megahertz,
right?

119
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.310
So if we put an antenna in there and give a 90 degree pulse,

120
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.350
we're going to hear a signal at 63 megahertz,
right?
Our radio.
We'll pick that up.

121
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.780
Okay,
so we know there are protons in the body,
right?
Surprised.

122
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.000
No.
Okay.

123
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.290
The question is where are the protons in the body?
Okay.

124
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.610
Now here's an analogy to,
to figure this out.

125
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.210
Suppose we had a cricket in this room and wondered where it was,

126
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.340
but I'm blind.
I can here but with only one year,

127
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.540
so I can't hear it.
I don't have spatial resolution with my ear.

128
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.770
How can I find out where the cricket is in this room?
Anybody got an idea?

129
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.790
Well,
I have one bit of control over the room.

130
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.680
I can make a temperature gradient in the room,

131
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.170
make it cold in front and warm behind.

132
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.130
Suppose I can do that now.
How can I find the cricket?

133
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.400
What they're at?
Different speeds and different.
You hear Chirping,

134
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.900
you count how many there are in 13 seconds and add 40.

135
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.720
Right?
If you go to,
you establish a temperature gradient,

136
00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:19.620
then you listen with a stopwatch.
And if you go to Snopes,

137
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.750
you can see that this is not an urban legend or a rural legend.
It's true,
right?

138
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.170
That you can do that.
And they actually show this picture of,
of uh,
of uh,
uh,

139
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.780
Dr Lamone from Boulder,

140
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:35.781
Colorado who actually did this with crickets and showed that it gives a very

141
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:37.500
good measure of the temperature.

142
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.910
So if I could establish a temperature gradient from front to back and count for

143
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.490
13 seconds and had 40,
and knew what the temperature is,

144
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:46.950
I know how far from front to back,
what would I do next?

145
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.950
If I want to find the cricket,

146
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.600
I'd fiddle with the air conditioning controls and make a temperature gradient

147
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.730
from left to right.
Right?

148
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.360
And I could even make one from top to bottom and then I'd know how,

149
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.540
what it's excellent.
It's Y and z coordinates are okay,

150
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.790
so I could find the cricket that way.

151
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.000
So we're going to do the same thing with the protons in the water in the body.

152
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.930
Okay?
So back to the body here.
Okay.

153
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:17.850
What I need is not a uniform field where all the protons are going at 63

154
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.720
megahertz.
I want to make them faster in some regions than others.

155
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.560
So what I do is I put two coils around this solenoid,

156
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.980
and in the one near the head,
I make the current go that way,

157
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:33.300
which reinforces the field.
And in the one near the feed,
I make it go that way,

158
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:34.890
which subtracts from the field.

159
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.850
So now I've generated a gradient along the body,

160
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.500
and it turns out to be that what's actually used as about 40 micro Tesla per

161
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:47.880
millimeter,
right?
So if I went like,
uh,
uh,

162
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.520
25 millimeters about an inch,
right?

163
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.420
That would be a thousand micro Tesla.

164
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.180
That is a Milli Tesla,
right?

165
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.150
So it'd be about one part in 15,000 or pardon me,

166
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.810
one part that's a milli Tesla out of a one and a half Tesla,

167
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.340
right?
So about a part per thousand,
right?
Difference.
Okay.

168
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.380
So that means if I,
if I,
um,
if I sliced,
uh,

169
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.600
if I sliced the body there or they're on the first slice,

170
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.970
remember there's a gradient from foot to head.
So they're the,
they're there.

171
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.890
We have the average 63 megahertz.

172
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.960
There's going to be a signal coming out from protons that are in that first

173
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:31.794
slice.

174
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.070
But in the second slice they're going to be at 63.05 about a part per thousand

175
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.310
higher,
right?

176
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:42.660
Because there's a higher field near the head and that if I did another slice,

177
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:46.110
another inch or so along,
it'd be 63.1 megahertz.

178
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.860
So if I had an antenna and could hear all these different frequencies and how

179
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:51.240
strong the signal was,

180
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.690
I'd get a profile of the proton distribution from foot to head.

181
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.320
So just like we did with the x rays scanning down,

182
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.700
I now how know how much water there is at different places along the height of

183
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:07.630
the body or the length of the body.
Okay.
What do we want to do next,

184
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.700
<v 1>Matt?
[inaudible]</v>

185
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.160
<v 0>so we want to make a gradient in a different direction.</v>

186
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:24.120
So I stopped the current of those green coils and put on yellow coils with

187
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:28.530
current going that way,
which adds to the the big field on the right,

188
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.410
right?
And then I put other coils over here,

189
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.190
which the current goes that way and makes it subtracts from the current on that

190
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.420
from the field on the left.
Right?
And when I do that,

191
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:42.270
I get a gradient from right to left,
right?

192
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.250
So then I can do a slice and find out how water is oriented that way.

193
00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:51.330
And then I can put coils on the top and bottom analogous to these and get a

194
00:12:51.331 --> 00:12:53.250
vertical gradient and get it that way.

195
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.300
And in fact by putting a certain amount of current in all of these coils at the

196
00:12:57.301 --> 00:12:59.430
same time,
different amounts of different coils,

197
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.750
I can make a slice that goes any direction I want to and find out how much is

198
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:05.010
there.
Right?

199
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.870
So now in three dimensions I can do one of these tomographic reconstructions and

200
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:14.130
get where,
where,
where the water is in the body.
Okay.

201
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.170
Now much more interesting than that,
which is itself very powerful is functional.

202
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.680
And Mr. Our MRI,
magnetic resonance imaging,

203
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.260
where you locate protons,

204
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.280
who's signal strength is being fiddled with.

205
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.890
So for example,
we talked about relaxation,
how fast the signal goes away,
right?

206
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.550
If you measure this for d for the different signals you were getting,

207
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.140
how fast they went away,

208
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.740
then you'd know something about a difference from one part of the body to the

209
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:47.610
other that the protons in this part,
there signal is going away rapidly,

210
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:49.620
whereas here they're not,
okay.

211
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.830
So you could get something about how the protons are behaving,

212
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:57.240
not just what their local field is.
Okay?
So for example,

213
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.900
blood oxygen level dependent or B,
O,
l,

214
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:03.240
d bold imaging,
uh,

215
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:08.390
you can do this and you get a spatial resolution of about one millimeter,

216
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.990
right?
And the temporal resolution of about two seconds.

217
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.360
So every two seconds you can get where this,
where oxygen is in the body,

218
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.630
unusual amounts of oxygen.
Now how is that relevant?

219
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.180
Because if you have cell activity,

220
00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:29.181
it increases the blood oxygen supply and that speeds the relaxation.

221
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:32.580
How fast the signal goes away,
right?

222
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.610
So now these are very weak signals.

223
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.350
So the way you tell something about them is to take a difference.

224
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.130
Where did we see a difference map before?
Do you remember?

225
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.050
Remember,
what do you want to look?
Look for bonds in X-ray.
We look at the,

226
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.140
the observed electron density minus what you'd have for the atoms.

227
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.140
And that different signal tells you how that's shifted for bonds.

228
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.320
Well you do a similar kind of thing here.
You get a different map.

229
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.140
Now this is a bunch of different slices through the brain.

230
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.210
And what's lit up is where there's relaxation.

231
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.830
That is where there's oxygen,

232
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:18.130
where the brain cells are active under one circumstance minus how active they

233
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:23.540
are under others.
On some other circumstance,
it's a difference,
right?

234
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.780
So the brain is working harder when it's in one state than the other.

235
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:32.960
Now what are the two states?
It's the,
the uh,

236
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:38.170
subject being shown donuts minus the signal when the subject is being shown car

237
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.454
keys.

238
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.170
So these are places where the brain lights up when it sees donuts but doesn't

239
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.050
light up when it sees car keys.
Okay.

240
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.820
Now this particular subject had recently been fed,
right?

241
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.960
And they did it also for someone who had,
who had not been fed,

242
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:01.820
who was fasting and their brain really lit up when they saw donuts versus car

243
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:06.060
keys.
So you can imagine that this is very,
very popular with the,

244
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.730
with psychologists and so on,

245
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:10.400
people interested in brain and all sorts of things where you can,

246
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.240
where you can use this trick of differences to see where something's happening

247
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.740
in one case versus another.

248
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.160
So that's MRI and of course it's not fundamentally are different.

249
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.280
Our business here to talk about MRI except we want to see things happening in

250
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:26.600
molecules.
Now,

251
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:30.830
why can't we do exactly the same trick with molecules to find out where protons

252
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:31.910
are in a molecule?

253
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.750
How do we know what that something is here rather than here rather than here in

254
00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:42.821
the brain we establish a magnetic gradients so that you get a different field

255
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:46.130
here in here and you get different frequencies and you can distinguish where it

256
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.540
is in the brain.
Okay.

257
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.810
What's the problem with doing that for a molecule and looking at different

258
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:52.100
protons and molecules?

259
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.600
What's the difference between my brain and a molecule?

260
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.690
There are lots of differences,

261
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.880
but one of it is that I hope my brain is an awful lot bigger than a molecule,

262
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.440
right?

263
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.000
So you can't establish a gradient big enough across the small dimensions of a

264
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:18.320
molecule so that protons in different regions will have different frequencies,

265
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.990
right?
Within any one molecule,

266
00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:24.320
it should all be the same field for practical purposes,
right?

267
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:27.160
So we do this trick,
or can we,

268
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.900
so we want to locate protons within molecules and now we want to have not a

269
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:38.410
gradient.
We want to have a uniform field.
We can't,

270
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.800
if we could make the gradient big enough,
maybe that would be useful,

271
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:43.150
but we can't make it big enough.

272
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.570
So let's go the other direction and make it absolutely the same everywhere.

273
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.320
A uniform field.
Okay.

274
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.890
Now and then what we're going to do is listen,

275
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.340
right until we hear and put up one of these pulses in,

276
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.000
and here are the frequency with which these protons,

277
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:02.970
if they're protons there in the sample,
we'll hear them.
Of course,

278
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:07.380
more still Ganek substances have protons in them.
So it doesn't surprise you.

279
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.750
That is,
I scan the magnetic field,
right?

280
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.410
Increasing the magnetic field,

281
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.240
which changes the precession frequency while listening with a radio that's tuned

282
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.540
to just one frequency.
As I go along,
at some place,

283
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:24.840
I'm going to have the right frequency and the protons are going to give me a

284
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:27.570
signal,
okay?
Of course,

285
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:30.570
if I had different nuclei in there that were different magnetic strengths,

286
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.600
then I'd get signals at different places,
right?

287
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:38.490
But I'm going to only look at pro only listen for protons.
Okay,
so there it is.

288
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.260
Bingo,
protons,
protons,
again,
protons.

289
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:46.680
Again,
there are different signals for protons.

290
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.890
Not all protons are equivalent,
okay?

291
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.660
Now the difference here between this signal and this signal and how big the

292
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:57.900
magnetic field is,
is very,
very small.

293
00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:59.910
It differs by only that fraction,

294
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.000
2.48 parts in a million.

295
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.780
They're almost exactly the same,
right?

296
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.250
But they're a little bit different.
Just parts per million different.

297
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.220
Now this,
when this was discovered,

298
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:19.221
it was an annoyance for the physicists who are mostly interested in things like

299
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:21.840
measuring how strong the magnetic moment was,

300
00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:25.050
how fast the precession was for protons,

301
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.530
but they put something in there that has protons and they find out there are

302
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:33.170
different protons,
which one is the real proton?
Right?
So the,
the,

303
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.770
they called this the chemical shift because these differences had something to

304
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:40.170
do with the chemical environment,
right?

305
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.530
But this was a gold mine for chemists because since the beginning,

306
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.140
people have been introduced since 1850 at least people have been interested in

307
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:51.030
chemical structure,
right?

308
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.320
But the only way they could do it was convert one molecule to another account.

309
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:58.800
Isomers as we discussed last semester with Kerner and so on,

310
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.810
and try to use logic to figure out what structure would be consistent,
right?

311
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.740
For the,
for these various transformations,
chemical transformations.

312
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.130
But now there was the pos and of course then there was X-ray,

313
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.350
which really did show where Adam's were.

314
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.980
But here's something that could work in liquids,
right?

315
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:20.340
Not everything can be a crystal.
So this looked really,
really promising.

316
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.220
Now this sample turned out was ethanol.

317
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.530
Now what do you think the three different signals are in ethanol?
Well,
one might,

318
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.600
one must be the Oah.

319
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.810
One must be the ages of the ch two and one must be the H's of the ch three right

320
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:43.220
now this requires doing such an experiment requires that the field be very,

321
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.450
very uniform.

322
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.240
Because if as you go from one part of your sample to another,

323
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.180
the field changes by a couple of parts per million,

324
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.340
then the methyl protons in this part of the sample will appear the same place

325
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.510
that the ch two protons appear in this part of the sample or the Oah does in

326
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.360
this part of the sample.
Even if this,

327
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:09.220
even if the gradient across the sample is only a part per million or so write a

328
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.900
couple of parts per million,
right,

329
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.740
and that's one of the reasons is these peaks are not infinitely sharp.

330
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:18.610
One of the reasons they're broad is that the field is a perfectly uniform,

331
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.820
but it's very good.
It's within a fraction of a part per million.

332
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.370
Okay.
Now in the late 1950s is it says here,

333
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:31.240
chemistry departments began buying commercial NMR spectrometers.

334
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:34.960
This one was called the variant a 60.
And it's the one I learned to operate.

335
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.840
Uh,
and they,

336
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.100
and they had to have fields that were homogeneous enough to determine molecular

337
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:42.661
structure.

338
00:21:42.661 --> 00:21:46.990
So they had to have fields that were different that didn't vary by more than a

339
00:21:46.991 --> 00:21:50.380
small part of a part per million.
Okay.

340
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.710
So that you could tell things about chemical shifts and spin,
spin,

341
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:56.410
splitting switch we're going to be talking about in the rest of this lecture.

342
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.940
But of course these things were expensive and many different people were using

343
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:05.800
them.
So it was a challenge to keep the field homogeneous,
to obtain sharp lines.

344
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:05.981
Now,

345
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:10.240
there were knobs in there that you could turn the current to coils to make the,

346
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.350
to cancel a gradient in one direction or another,
another,
another.
Right.

347
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.060
And most of them were hidden behind that door and the door said on it,

348
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:21.130
do not open,
right?

349
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.480
Because someone who knew what he was doing and came in at the beginning of the

350
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.400
day and turned all those knobs just right.

351
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.240
So the field was very uniform and if anybody else came in and twiddled them,

352
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.060
then the next guy to come in was really up a creek.

353
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.110
I so do not touch these gradient knobs.
In fact,

354
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:43.000
there was one there the why gradient,
which would have its own special sign,

355
00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:47.530
do not touch this.
Okay,
now this was fine.

356
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.690
Uh,
but across the,
across new haven or across the long island sound,

357
00:22:52.691 --> 00:22:57.520
here you see the smokestacks at Port Jefferson and the medical building at State

358
00:22:57.521 --> 00:22:59.320
University of New York at Stony Brook.

359
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.220
And there was a physical chemist at stony brook who fiddled with them.

360
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.170
His name was Paul Lauterbur.

361
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.740
And in 1972 he would take over this machine every night and he'd just wreck the

362
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:16.240
field homogeneity.
And of course,
late at night before he left,
or early morning,

363
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:20.140
he would turn all the knobs back cause he was really an expert of Nmr.

364
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.800
But the reason he did this was to establish gradients in different directions so

365
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.690
that he could locate within,

366
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.410
he had a sample tube and he filled it with d two o not protons.

367
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.030
And in it he put two capillary tubes,
right?
That had water in them.

368
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:42.130
So he did exactly the kind of experiment we were talking about and in nature in

369
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:43.210
1973,

370
00:23:43.211 --> 00:23:48.211
he published this re scanned in one scan vertically and got this and uh,

371
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.830
horizontally and got this scanned at 45 or minus 45 and got those and could find

372
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:59.390
out where these water samples were inside the D two o.
Okay.

373
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.440
And he called that Zig zagging photography.
Right.

374
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.330
But the name didn't catch on.

375
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.610
But the good news was that 30 years later he got the Nobel prize in physiology

376
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:15.170
or medicine for inventing Mri and that's when he worked on the rest of his life.

377
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.310
Okay.
So it was a chemist who invented MRI.

378
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.120
Uh,
so,
uh,

379
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:28.630
there are lots and lots of magnetic resonance spectrometers and I already showed

380
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:31.880
you some ex-ray defract Tom butters around,

381
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.230
which have put classical structure proof by chemical transformation.

382
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:41.231
The kind of thing that we talked about current are doing and even I are mostly

383
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:42.320
out of business,

384
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:45.770
although there are still things for which I are is as good or even better than

385
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:50.360
Nmr.
Okay.
And in fact there was a Yale before I came here,

386
00:24:50.361 --> 00:24:54.230
there was a organic chemistry professor who was in the field called natural

387
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:57.860
products where the job was to take something that came from nature and figure

388
00:24:57.861 --> 00:24:59.210
out what its structure was.

389
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.920
And the way to do it in those days was to do these chemical transformations and

390
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.330
try to make it from something or make it into something who structure you knew,

391
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.003
okay,

392
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.960
so these were great puzzles and it was really a big operation.

393
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.570
But when Nmr came along,

394
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:21.680
he abandoned organic chemistry and took up fundamental research on quantum

395
00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:26.090
theory.
And in fact later he became a professional studio photographer,

396
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.140
right?
He was just wiped out by Nmr coming along,

397
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:32.480
which is the way people know structures.
Now,

398
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.670
we haven't really talked about that much about how people,
Newt,

399
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.130
we've talked about different structures,

400
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:41.840
but not really how people figured them out except when they used x-ray.
Right?

401
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:45.620
But this is an even more common way of determined structures routinely as

402
00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:50.030
spectroscopy and in particular nowadays,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

403
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.690
So a couple of years ago I took a tour through the department and took

404
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:57.140
photographs of magnetic resonance spectrometers to show you here.

405
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.020
So across from your lab you may have noticed this door,

406
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:02.390
which is says chemical instrumentation center.

407
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.070
And it says warning over here about magnetic fields.
So if you have a pacemaker,

408
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:08.480
be careful.
Okay.

409
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:12.110
And you go inside there and some of these have now been moved since I took the

410
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:16.750
pictures.
But you see these things sticking up like here and here,
okay.

411
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.510
And if you,
if you go around,
you see these big,
big cans,
right?
Warning,

412
00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:23.570
strong magnetic field.
Here's another one.

413
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.990
Here's another one that's a 500 megahertz spectrometer.

414
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.890
Here's a 500 megahertz spectrum and here's the 600 Megahertz Spectrometer.

415
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.570
Here's another 600 Megahertz Spectrometer and out in the courtyard behind your

416
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:38.180
lab,
there's this special little building that was,

417
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.230
was a constructed,
especially for a big magnet,
right?

418
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:46.320
And it has this one,
which is an 800 Megahertz Spectrometer,

419
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.650
which turns out to be eight to the third power that is 512 times as sensitive as

420
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.410
a 100 Megahertz Spectrometer,

421
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.680
not dimension other advantages that we're going to talk about below right now.

422
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.400
Why is it eight cubed?
It's because of the Boltzmann factor.
Remember,

423
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:09.120
this signal comes because they're more that point with the field against the

424
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:12.240
field.
We only see the difference between those two,
right?

425
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.370
And if you have a bigger energy difference,

426
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:18.300
you'll get a bigger population different.
So you get eightfold factor from that.

427
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.440
But the energy quantum that you're dealing with and going from one level to

428
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:26.300
another becomes eight times as big.
That's,
that's uh,
that's,
uh,

429
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:31.260
an advantage in your signal and the sensitivity of the electronics when it's

430
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:32.940
eight times vigor is also better.

431
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:37.710
So all of these things go together to make it 500 times better and even bet more

432
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:41.430
than 500 times better when you consider the,
what we'll talk about soon,

433
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:42.750
the chemical shift advantage.

434
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:47.480
So that's why one pays the big bucks to have a machine like that here,
here,

435
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.550
just some others that I took around.
And now the uh,

436
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.500
by the cross hall there next to your lab when you walk down there and on this

437
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:56.334
side of it,

438
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.480
there's a room that has electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometers.

439
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.630
So this is a much smaller magnet one,

440
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.070
not one of these big liquid helium cooled things.

441
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.280
And the reason is that this is the study free radicals which have magnetic

442
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:15.900
electrons,
mostly electrons come in payers and their magnetism is cancel,

443
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.470
right?
But in certain molecules,
free radicals,

444
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:23.040
there's an odd electron who's magnetism is detectable.

445
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.950
So this is the study free radicals,
right?

446
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.310
And the electron magnet is 600 to 660 times stronger than the proton,

447
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.030
right?
So you don't need such a big field to make it precess,
right?

448
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.110
So,
so you can use just 0.3 Tesla instead of,

449
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.490
instead of several Tesla for electron paramagnetic resonance.

450
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:48.180
So there are two of those spectrometers and in fact we don't have one of these,

451
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:52.470
but there's now a commercially available a 1000 Megahertz Spectrometer,

452
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:56.250
which is 23.5 Tesla.
Okay.

453
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.790
And at the Florida State University natural at national high field magnet lab,

454
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.910
there's a field that's pulse that goes to 45 Tesla and it's a national lab.

455
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.770
You don't pay to use it,
but you have to have a great experiment that builds,

456
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.850
be assigned time to do things there.
Okay,

457
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:16.170
so there are lots of these things around.

458
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:19.230
Now let's go back and see why it's so good.
Okay.

459
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:21.300
We have these three signals and as we said,

460
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:24.030
we're interested in which peak is which set of protons.

461
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:26.460
Now how do we know which is which?
Right?

462
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.830
Can anybody see a way of figuring out which is the ch three which is a ch two in

463
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:33.410
which is the Oah.

464
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.150
Any guesses?
Yeah.
Ah,
if you,

465
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.820
if you have twice as many protons,
there should be twice as strong a signal.

466
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.260
You measure the strength of the signal by how much area is under it by

467
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:51.094
integrating it.

468
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:56.430
So if we measure the integrals we see there in the ratio of one to two to three.

469
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.240
So it's clear that that's the one that's the two.
And that's the three.

470
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:07.170
Now we couldn't do this and I are right because we had these normal modes and

471
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:12.100
and I had for example,
CEO and remember as the COO vibrated,

472
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:15.910
something else vibrated at the same time and other things and they could cancel

473
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.330
or reinforce.
So the signal intensities were very,

474
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:22.960
very different for different groups,
right?
But here,

475
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.770
the protons are all essentially exactly the same.

476
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.450
They differ only by a part per million or a few parts per million,
right?

477
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.830
So the intensities are proportional to the number of protons because the diff

478
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.150
differences,
so subtle.

479
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.940
So you can count protons by the area under these,
under these peaks.

480
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.011
That's what it says here.

481
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:48.040
The number of pro is proportional to the number of protons because they're so

482
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:51.660
similar.
Not like IRP.
Irps.
Okay,

483
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.230
now how can you use this?

484
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:57.430
Here was one of the very first uses of a subtle organic chemistry question.

485
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:02.470
This was an advertisement by the very end corporation in 1955 who are trying to

486
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:05.650
sell those machines.
I showed you that the guy over it,

487
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.280
Paul Louder or messed up the field on every night.
Okay.

488
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:11.470
So this was a example number 20,

489
00:31:11.471 --> 00:31:14.650
the use of integrated intensities and structural analysis.

490
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.910
So there's a question of the structure of c seven h eight,

491
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.530
whether it's this or this,

492
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.670
and notice that those two are related to one another because if we shifted the

493
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:28.060
electrons like that one would go to the other.
So it's a,

494
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.110
you can imagine them going back and forth by an electrocycle like reaction.

495
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:35.020
And the question is,
which is it really?
Well,

496
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:39.370
you could try to figure out by chemical transformation and people did that.

497
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.260
Okay,
so which is it?
Well,
let's try Ozu analysis.

498
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.490
Now.
Do you remember what happens with Ozo analysis and then oxidation,

499
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.300
you cleave cc double bonds and make carbon eel groups there and acid from,

500
00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.840
uh,
from,
uh,
make a carboxylic acid group.
When you add the h two o two.

501
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.110
So these would give different products.

502
00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:06.100
Noticed that on the left you would cleave three bonds.
On the right,

503
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:10.770
you'd cleave only two double bonds,
right?
So on the left,
uh,

504
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.480
you would get that dye acid.
On the right,

505
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:17.680
you'd get the dye acid that has two more carbons,
okay?

506
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.690
Now in fact,
that acid on the right was known,
it's called sis carbonic acid.

507
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.930
And that's what you got.
So what's the conclusion?

508
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.070
The conclusion is that the structure must be be not a,

509
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.410
so that's a classical structure,
proof by chemical transformation,
okay?

510
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.800
But here's a completely different way of going about it.

511
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.420
Take the Nmr spectrum and count the protons.
Okay?

512
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.970
So the group on the left,

513
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:51.080
there are protons that are attached to double bonded carbons and on the right to

514
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.540
single bonded carbons.
Okay?

515
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.180
And now notice that the compound B has four of each kind,

516
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.440
but compound day has six of one kind and two of the other.

517
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:07.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:09.330
<v 0>And if you integrate,</v>

519
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:14.190
you find that those ratios are 2.9 to one three to one.

520
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.540
So,
which isn't,
it must be a,

521
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.500
that you're taking the spectrum of,

522
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.143
<v 1>okay,</v>

523
00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.470
<v 0>that's the one,
that's three,
two,
one.
Okay.
So it must be that,</v>

524
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:30.610
that's the structure,

525
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.140
but then how do you explain this misleading chemical transformation?

526
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:36.610
Right?

527
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:41.610
It must be that there's an equilibrium between these two things that lies to the

528
00:33:41.981 --> 00:33:44.620
left.
So when you take the spectrum,

529
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:47.170
that's the stuff you see that's most of the material,

530
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:52.390
but it's not as reactive with ozone as the stuff on the right.
Okay?

531
00:33:52.391 --> 00:33:55.810
So that little bit of stuff on the right is what reacts with ozone and gives the

532
00:33:55.811 --> 00:34:00.490
product.
So the,
the chemical transformation was misleading.

533
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.350
And this is the kind of thing that made this a Yale natural products,

534
00:34:05.351 --> 00:34:06.550
organic chemistry professor,

535
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:10.510
pull out his hair and become a quantum chemist and then a studio photographer

536
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.520
that you couldn't do what he was trained to do anymore.
Okay?

537
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.840
So spectroscopy took over in determining structure and we're going to talk a

538
00:34:19.841 --> 00:34:22.330
little bit about how you do this now.

539
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.520
And Chemistry to 20 website has a bunch of Nar bar problems.

540
00:34:28.091 --> 00:34:32.900
There are,
uh,
there are,
uh,
40 problems there.
And this,

541
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.180
I took this from one of them and fiddled with it a little bit.
And in fact,

542
00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:41.380
let me just see,
I think I left an extra,
well,

543
00:34:41.381 --> 00:34:45.220
I'll go through here and there's going to be an extra slide in hearing it.
Okay.

544
00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:49.750
So we can integrate and see that there are two and three and three,
right?

545
00:34:49.751 --> 00:34:54.130
So we know that the two must be that ch two,

546
00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:58.990
but there are two ch three groups.
One is one and one is the other.
Okay.

547
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.160
That's a low resolution where the field isn't so uniform.

548
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.070
But if you make the field really,
really uniform,

549
00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:10.330
if you tweak those knobs just right so that the peaks don't get broadened by

550
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:14.950
having different fields in different parts of the sample and in fact spin the

551
00:35:14.951 --> 00:35:19.951
sample so that a given a given molecule actually is going around and sampling

552
00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:25.240
different parts to average the field to make it even more uniform.
Right?

553
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.220
Then you see this thing with sharp peaks.
So it's the same three,
three,

554
00:35:30.221 --> 00:35:33.790
two,
but they look a little different here,
right?

555
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.753
Uh,

556
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.280
so peak with does about three parts per billion,
right?

557
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.770
And that's as you see a single peak there.

558
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.580
But this next one is a little different.

559
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.890
That's a triplet one to two to one right?

560
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.900
So that's one of those ch three groups,
but which ch three group.

561
00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.910
Oh at four pardon me?
I got it backwards.

562
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.930
This was a ch three group and it turns out to be this one.

563
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.040
This ch three group is splitted the three and it's that one.

564
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:10.860
Now why is it not a single peak?
What's different?

565
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:12.163
<v 1>Right.</v>

566
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.800
<v 0>Okay,
well that's splitting is 0.029 parts per million.</v>

567
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.490
I obviously blew it up in order to be able to see it clearly here.

568
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.550
And this is a 250 megahertz spectrum.

569
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:29.260
So it means that splitting the difference in frequency of protons in one

570
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.680
environment and the other is 7.3 hertz.
Right?

571
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.010
And it's exactly the same.
They're 7.3 hertz

572
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.103
<v 1>right?</v>

573
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:42.300
<v 0>Now,
if you look here,
that's a quartet,
right?</v>

574
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.720
And those are 7.3 hertz as well.

575
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.450
<v 1>All right.</v>

576
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.100
<v 0>Now,
what's that last signal?
This little tiny one down here.</v>

577
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.900
We'll notice that the solvent is c d c l three.
Now,

578
00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:59.280
why would they pay the bucks,

579
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.780
the big bucks to get deuterium rather than just using normal flora forms?

580
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:05.580
C H C l three for a solvent?

581
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.720
What would it look like if the solvent were CHC,
l three,

582
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:18.360
you'd have an enormous peak from the solvent that hydrogen at the solvent,
right?

583
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:21.790
It would wash out the other things.
So you make it do pterygium,

584
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.880
but it's not 100% duty area and there's a tiny,
tiny amount of protium in there,

585
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.380
right?
So that tiny signal comes from a little bit of ch three on the solvent.

586
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.383
Okay.

587
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.720
So the 90 degree Paul's makes the spinning nuclei broadcast of frequency that

588
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:43.170
tells their local magnetic field,
right?
In a uniform field.

589
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.410
Now there's the big uniform field,

590
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.780
but what the nucleus sees is an effective local magnetic field,

591
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.770
which is of course the big field.
That's mostly it,
but little,

592
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:58.860
little tiny differences due to the chemical environment.

593
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:03.480
And let's see what those,
how we do it.
Okay.
Just to back up a first,

594
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.700
uh,
you could make the applied field in homogeneous as an MRI,

595
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.600
and then you make it in the field can be,
for example,
a three Tesla,

596
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.680
two Tesla,
30,000 gals with a gradient of four gals,

597
00:38:17.681 --> 00:38:20.700
percent of meter for human samples.
And if you have a tiny thing,

598
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:23.100
you can make a bigger gradients.
So for small animals,

599
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:26.850
you can get 50 gallons per centimeters and do the imaging that we talked about.

600
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:31.620
But in chemistry it's different.
In chemistry,
you make it really homogeneous.

601
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:35.710
So the only differences come not from where the Proton is in the sample,

602
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.860
but from where it is in a molecule.
Okay.

603
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:44.310
And now we're interested in a molecular field that's added to or subtracted from

604
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:49.330
the big field.
And mostly it's subtracted from,
as you'll see.

605
00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.980
So these molecular fields then tell you about the molecular environment,

606
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.720
these tiny shifts.

607
00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:01.240
So there are two sources of these local magnetic fields besides the enormous big

608
00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:05.470
field that you put on.
One is electrons orbiting.

609
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:10.810
Now the electrons come in,
payers that tend to orbit in opposite directions,

610
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.180
right?
So they tend to cancel,

611
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.500
but there's a little bit of excess for reasons we don't need to go on to have

612
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.210
one orbiting over the other.

613
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:23.260
So you get effects from electron orbiting and the,

614
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:28.350
the magnitude of this shift is about 12 parts per million for protons or 200

615
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:33.250
parts per million per carbon.
The different,

616
00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.480
the range of values you can get from that.
Right?
Which is,

617
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.980
so this is grossly exaggerated.
It should be only parts per million of this,

618
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.240
not,
you know,
like a,
a 20th or something like that,

619
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.260
or a 10th okay.
So one thing about the environment,

620
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:52.510
how many electrons are around doing this orbiting.

621
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.860
The other thing is there are other magnetic nuclei nearby who have fields too.

622
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.740
So if you're this proton or listening for this Proton,

623
00:40:02.741 --> 00:40:05.020
it's field is not only going to be the big field,

624
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.840
not only what's coming from the electrons orbiting,

625
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.970
but also what's coming from other nuclei that are in the vicinity being oriented

626
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:15.580
either this way or this way.
Okay.

627
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.580
And those we measure in Hertz and you'll see why we measure one in parts per

628
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:25.390
million.
And the other in hurts very soon.
Okay.

629
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.670
So anyhow,
when you add all those things together,

630
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:31.510
you get an effective field and that's what determines the frequency of the

631
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:34.240
signal you're going to hear.
Okay.

632
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.910
So first we're going to talk about the chemical shift.

633
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:39.430
What happens from orbiting?
Okay,

634
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.020
so electron orbiting gives this little red B,

635
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:49.620
but the reason the electrons orbit is because of the applied field and the

636
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:54.790
bigger the applied field,
the bigger the orbiting.
Right?

637
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.260
So that says the Redfield is proportional to the blue field.
If you may,

638
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:03.760
if you spent the money to get a bigger magnet,
you'd get twice as much orbiting.

639
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.890
So the red would be the same.
So that says that,
uh,

640
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:12.880
so what you measure then is a fractional thing because it's not a standard

641
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:15.280
difference.
It depends on how big your magnet is.

642
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.720
If you make your magnet twice as big,
the shift is twice as big.

643
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.760
The red field is twice as big,
so it's a fraction of the big ones.

644
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:27.640
So you measure it in parts per million,
right?

645
00:41:27.641 --> 00:41:30.340
In a fractional unit rather than an absolute unit,

646
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.800
like an energy unit like hurts.
Okay,

647
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:37.970
so here's a scale of parts per million.
Let's see what different values we have.

648
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.440
Okay.
Now the standard that's used is called tms,

649
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.140
Tetra Methyl siling.
Now,

650
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:48.800
why you such a weird molecule is your standard.
Well,

651
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:52.280
it's a small molecule and it's volatile,

652
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.620
so you can add a drop to your sample,
but you can easily get it out.

653
00:41:57.621 --> 00:42:01.820
Again if you want to recover your sample because it evaporates easily.
Okay?

654
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.240
Now all it has four ch three groups,

655
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.650
but they're all identically situated.
So it will just give one peak,

656
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.000
okay?
Rather than a more complicated molecules.
So that's good.

657
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:19.450
But the thing that's really special is that the silicon is being a metal is

658
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:23.510
partially plus,
and the methyl is largely minus,

659
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.080
which means they're more electrons around the protons,

660
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.900
which means there's a bigger shielding.

661
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.530
This B is bigger than it would be if there were fewer electrons around.

662
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.730
So it shifted all the way to one end of the spectrum.
So it doesn't overlap.

663
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:40.070
Other things that you might have in your sample.

664
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.230
So you have a standard then that you can use to call what to do with high

665
00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:49.490
electron density around the protons,
which defines zero,
right?

666
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.560
And now you get another peak from your sample and see where it is compared to

667
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:58.820
this.
For example,
if you have a carboxylic acid,

668
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:03.410
the h on a carboxylic acid is way what's called downfield.

669
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.670
Why?
Why is it very different from the hydrogen in tms?

670
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.140
Anybody see why the Coh hydrogen might be different?

671
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.360
The environment of it,
right?

672
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.920
The OAH is electron withdrawing,
especially with the carbon eel group on it,

673
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.210
right?
So the electrons get stepped away from the hydrogen.

674
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.380
You don't have as much of that red shielding effect.

675
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.790
So it's,
it's shifted way down to the other end.
Okay.

676
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.530
Now,
so on the right,
it said to be shielded.

677
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.150
That is the electrons around the proton cancel the big field,

678
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:49.190
but only a teeny bit of it.
Only a few parts per million.
Right?
Okay.
Whereas,

679
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.460
and it's called up field and it's also a place where there's high electron

680
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:59.600
density and it's what called a low chemical shift.

681
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:04.520
This scale is,
is the chemical shift numbers.
And that's defined to zero.

682
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:09.320
So it's a very low number,
right?
And it's also low frequency,

683
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.720
right?
Because we have lots of electrons,
relatively big value here.

684
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.520
There is very small,

685
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:21.200
relatively small electric magnet effective field,
relatively small,

686
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:25.550
so a low precession frequency,
not such a big field.
Okay.

687
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.350
By contrast,
the Oah is called de shielded downfield,

688
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.690
low electron density,
high chemical shift,
that high frequency.

689
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.250
Now if you have a car,
a proton that's attached to a normal carbon,

690
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.420
not one that's attached to silicon,
which is giving electrons away,
right?

691
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.140
Then it comes around one or between a half and two.

692
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.580
And the way these were found just by putting different known samples in and

693
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:53.640
seeing where the peaks came,
okay,
okay?

694
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:59.030
But if you have oxygen halogen or nitrogen attached to the carbon in the same

695
00:44:59.911 --> 00:45:02.820
way that silicon donated electrons,
the carbon,

696
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.270
these electronegative atoms take electrons from the carbon,

697
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:10.710
which take electrons from the hydrogen,
which make the smaller,

698
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.500
which shifted downfield.
So in that region,

699
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:17.940
between two and a half and four and a half.
Okay?
Now,

700
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:19.920
if you have,
if it's attached to,

701
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:24.150
if the carbon to which the hydrogen is attached is itself attached to a carbon,

702
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.070
not to one of these electric negative elements,
but that carbon has oxygen on it,

703
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.690
then the oxygen is such sucking electrons from carbon,
from carbon,
from hydrogen.

704
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.400
So it shifted down a little bit.

705
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.350
So a hydrogen on a carbon attached to a carbon eel is inbetween there,

706
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.520
right?
If you have a carbon attached to a double bond,

707
00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:47.310
it's shifted down still further.
Now,
why should a carb,

708
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:51.470
why should a hydrogen attached to a double bond be different from a,

709
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.530
from a carbon,

710
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:56.220
with a double bond be different from a hydrogen attached to a carbon with only

711
00:45:56.221 --> 00:46:00.810
single bonds?
What difference?
Maybe

712
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.610
it's not the p.
Well,
actually to tell you the truth,

713
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.160
it probably is the Pi Bond,

714
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.270
but that's not the explanation that people usually give.
What other difference,

715
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:16.680
what differences there in the sigma system,
Leon?
Pardon me?

716
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:21.750
The hybridization,
right?
This is an SP squared,
right?

717
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:26.370
More s more electron withdrawing,
whereas these carbons are Spq,

718
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.850
right?
So as you pull electrons to the carbon away from the hydrogen,

719
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.820
you shift down.
That makes sense.
In fact,

720
00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.290
this you might expect would be the same.
It's shifted even a little further down.

721
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.090
All of these things were discovered empirically just by putting known samples in

722
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:45.540
and finding out where they come.
But you and then an Aldehyde is,

723
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.760
you won't be surprised to hear is still further down because it has the ox,

724
00:46:48.761 --> 00:46:51.450
it's not only double bonded,
it has an oxygen pulling away.

725
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.490
So all of these things more or less make sense in terms of electron withdrawal

726
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.110
or donation to the hydrogen.
Okay.
Uh,

727
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.990
but it's fact,
it's a little more subtle than that.
Now,

728
00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.580
r o h uh,

729
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.430
is funny because it can come at lots of different positions depending on

730
00:47:11.431 --> 00:47:14.550
concentration and depending on temperature,

731
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.340
why would concentration have anything to do with it?

732
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.910
Why would it have come in a different place if you had more ROI?
H Lauren,

733
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.370
if you have hydrogen bonding and that affects the chemical,
higher concentration,

734
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:34.870
more hydrogen bonding,
higher temperature,
less hydrogen bonding.
Right.

735
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:35.704
So that's,

736
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:40.690
so the o h comes at lots of different positions depending on those factors.

737
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.161
Okay.

738
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:46.210
So you can already see from this that if you take a spectrum and see peaks in

739
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.920
different positions,
you can try to say,
Aha,
this,

740
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.050
it looks like it has a hydrogens that are just attached to carbons that are all

741
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:56.800
single bonded.
It has doubled hydrogen on double bonded carbons,
blah,
blah.

742
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:01.060
You measure the integral and see how many of each kind there are and that you

743
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:06.061
can then do puzzles like the ones in that webpage that I mentioned,

744
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.560
uh,
to try to figure out what structures are.
Now,
let's see.

745
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:12.700
If you've learned from this,

746
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.730
where should you expect the hydrogen that it's attached to?

747
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:19.090
The carbon of an acetylene?
Where would you expect it to come?

748
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.813
<v 1>What's special?</v>

749
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.050
<v 0>No.
Well you got any idea on this?
What's special about it?</v>

750
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.873
<v 1>It</v>

751
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.410
<v 0>the triple bonds.
So now how's the triple bond Gunno effect things?</v>

752
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

753
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.550
<v 0>Hi.
It'll affect the hybridization and in what way?</v>

754
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.613
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

755
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.130
<v 0>it'll be s p right?
It'll be an sp hybrid,</v>

756
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:50.140
which is more electron withdrawing then sp squared,
then sp cubed.

757
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.480
So it should be pulling electrons away.
D shielding,
as you say,

758
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:56.950
because the electrons are shielding.

759
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.090
So it should shift to the left compared to the double bond funds.

760
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.620
<v 1>Right?
Wrong.</v>

761
00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.520
<v 0>Okay.
It actually comes up there.</v>

762
00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.260
So there's more to it than what we're saying now.
What is this more to it?

763
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.040
Uh,
unfortunately that the clock is wrong,

764
00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:19.730
so you're going to have to wait for tomorrow to find that out.
