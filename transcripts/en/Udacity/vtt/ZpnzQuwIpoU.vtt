00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.630
So Matt, I'd like to take a look at another

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.290
category of reports that come out of your genome. And

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.700
I, those are called inherited gate conditions. And those include

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.130
things like cystic fibrosis and bloom syndrome, and sick cell anemia.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, I, I know I'm not a carrier for

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.640
sickle cell anemia. But that makes sense, because I have a mainly

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.570
European background. And sickle cell anemia isn't prevalent of those with

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
European descent. However, in sub Saharan Africa, it is is more prevalent.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.140
And you guys may remember

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.220
[FOREIGN],

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.466
who's from Kenya.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.020
[FOREIGN],

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.619
Has anyone in your family ever been affected by sickle cell anemia?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.060
&gt;&gt; No. No one in my family has been affected by

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.260
sickle cell anemia. But I am aware of people around me who've

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.300
had it. Okay. Well, why don't we go take a look

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.440
at your results to see if, by any change, you're a carrier.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.300
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.015
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. Alright. So, now that we've logged into your profile

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.350
we need to go up to my results, and look for the inherited conditions section.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.605
&gt;&gt; And what does it say for you,

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:55.780
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.750
Let's find it.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.150
&gt;&gt; We'll scroll down until you find the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.150
sickle cell anemia report. There. Is that it?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.690
&gt;&gt; This is it here. What does it say?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.660
It says variant absent.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.640
&gt;&gt; Variant absent. What does that mean, Joanna?

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190
&gt;&gt; So, that means that you do not

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.910
carry a, one of the variants that's linked to

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.100
sickle cell anemia. So now we're looking at

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.370
the report itself, and there's some background information. Let's

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.390
scroll down to find your actual results and then we see, that is. It says you do

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.740
not have the s version of the HBB gene,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.880
which is linked to Sickle Cell Anemia. Okay so,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.240
it says here that a person with one copy

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.390
of the S version, typically does not have sickle cell

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.570
anemia, but can pass mutation to offspring. So does

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.700
that mean that the S allele is dominant or recessive?
