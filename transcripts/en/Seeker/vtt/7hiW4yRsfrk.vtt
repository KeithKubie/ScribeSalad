00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.870
We've got an addiction to oil in this country.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.870
Coconut oil.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.560
It's good for your hair, for your skin, for
cooking, for mental health, for … FOR EVERYTHING.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.000
But is this real?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.340
Or just another fad.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.210
Is it just Facebook, Twitter and everyone
I know or are people are actually coo-coo

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.970
for coconut oil?

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
In the 1980s, coconut oil was considered terrible
cholesterol-causing junk.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.960
Yet in 2002, the New Statesman published,
"People who eat coconut oil in place of other

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.120
vegetable oils" are free of degenerative diseases,
have a healthier BMI, and live longer.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.079
And there's a rumor it can even cure Alzheimers.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.059
Lucky for us, science has spent some time
looking into it.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.980
A coconut isn't a nut (or fruit, or seed),
it's a drupe, like a peach or apricot.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.570
Coconuts on trees are fleshy bits, each containing
a single brown pit or stone, which is what

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.719
we call the coconut.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.399
Coconut oil is exactly what you think it is,
a result of processing the white meat of a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.660
coconut, the endosperm, to extract its oil.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.221
There are a handful of ways people accomplish
it, but they all end up drying, boiling, or

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.470
pressing its flesh.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.720
The change from the 1970s and 80s to today,
is coconut oil production has gotten better.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.490
Virgin coconut oil wasn't available then,
and instead it was a highly processed oil

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.490
product.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.350
But is today's product really better?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.590
Processed coconut oil contains 92 percent
saturated fat; butter is only 64 percent,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.510
and both beef and pure LARD are only 40 percent.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.210
Unlike animal fats, coconut oil doesn't contain
cholesterol.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.770
Instead, it influences cholesterol in the
body -- which is manufactured by the liver.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.530
Saturated fat causes inflammation in the blood
vessels, so we should keep an eye on it because

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.690
consuming a little coconut oil is going to
have a large impact on saturated fat intake.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.590
Coconut oil ALSO contains medium-chain triglycerides,
or MCTs -- which are ALSO processed by the

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.820
liver, the main MCT in coconut oil is called
lauric acid, which is associated with increases

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.060
in HDL cholesterol (the good kind) and is
associated with decreased body fat, but it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.610
also raises LDL cholesterol (the bad kind
which causes heart problems).

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.800
According to Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard
School of Public Health, "overall effects

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.120
on health can’t be predicted just by the
changes in LDL and HDL."

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.530
And there just hasn't been enough time to
do long-term studies to figure out the true

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.570
benefits or drawbacks of the oil.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.610
In 2011 a molecular biologist from University
of California Davis told the New York Times,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.311
"there is no concrete scientific data yet
to support" the health benefits of coconut

00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:33.311
oil.

00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:37.510
So far this new coconut oil fad seems to be
driven by hype more than actual information.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.790
People hear the media spout its health benefits
and throw it on ALL their foods; but moderation

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.340
is more important.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.890
Chances are too much is going to cause more
harm than good.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.150
Sure, the HDL boost is nice, but both soybean
and olive oils lower LDL and raise HDL; and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.110
there are other compounds in the dregs of
this drupe which may affect the body in other,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.830
as yet unknown, ways.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.300
With regard to Alzheimer's, coconut oil has
no scientific evidence to support it, only

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.400
a book written by a pediatrician about her
husband's experience with Alzheimer's.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.510
What we DO know, is coconut oil works for
baking as a substitute for butter, vegans

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.170
have tested that for us, but while coconut
oil might be better than the saturated fats

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:36.700
in meats and butter, its benefits are not
as proven as all-mighty olive oil.
