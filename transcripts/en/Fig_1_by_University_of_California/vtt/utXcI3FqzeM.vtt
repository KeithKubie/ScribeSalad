00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:09.460
it's interesting when we design our
studies we provide diets that are high

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.909
in starch and then we take away that starch and replaced it with sugar why do

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:25.819
we even see such unfavorable effects
when we replace pasta or bread with a fructose sweetened beverage

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.460
or let's even
say high fructose corn syrup sweetened

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.690
beverage well to answer that question
we're gonna start first with the glucose

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.449
the grains that we eat and we call carbs
are pretty much pure glucose and it goes

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.940
into our bloodstream slowly cause it takes a while for those enzymes in the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.620
intestine to break it all down the
glucose leads the intestine in what we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.489
call the portal vein and that veins
first stop is the liver if the liver

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.130
needs energy that liver is going to pull
the glucose in if the liver has enough

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.750
energy most of the glucose bypasses
the liver and is delivered to the rest

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.430
of the body it gets to be used by any
other place in the body that needs

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.479
glucose now with fructose its different
we're talking about fructose in the fructose

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.140
sweetened beverages are subjects
consumed but we're also talking about

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.460
the fructose in sodas because high
fructose corn syrup contains fructose

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.680
so fructose is in the intestine and it too is
delivered directly to the liver however

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.859
there's an enzyme there that's always
turned on so it takes any fructose it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.690
can get its hands on even if the liver
has enough energy

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.080
very little fructose gets delivered to
the rest of the body so what we end up

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:12.570
is this fructose overload in the liver
it needs to start storing it as fat when

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.020
you increase your levels of liver fat
you're gonna have more fat heading out

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.150
into the blood with more fat heading out
in the blood

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.340
you end up with higher levels of
triglycerides and cholesterol both of them

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.870
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.880
risk factors for cardiovascular disease
there's another problem we believe liver

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.120
fat decreases insulin's ability to do
its job thats increases your risk of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.550
diabetes

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.370
there's another problem when your
insulin isn't working well it also

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.140
causes more fructose to be turned into
fat and it is also going to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.040
increase the amount of fat that liver
sends into the blood there's another

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.000
problem this group that consumed fructose tended to gain that weight within

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.750
the abdominal cavity this is what we
call visceral fat that makes us apple

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.170
shaped

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.459
so what we have is this vicious
cycle going on that's really why

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:30.250
metabolic syndrome tends to be a group
of problems they make this little

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.100
vicious cycle where one makes the other
worse and they just go around in this

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.130
circle what we all need to do is get to
the point where sugar is a special

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.349
occasion food it's not a staple and
that's where we need to think about our

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:55.360
foods and what they can be doing to our
health are you wondering how much sugar

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.680
