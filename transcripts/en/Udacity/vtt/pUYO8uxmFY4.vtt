00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When we think of a mass on a spring, there's only two numbers initially that we really care about.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One is the mass of the block and the other is K,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is a constant associated with the spring that measures its stiffness.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, a rubber band sort of spring. And it would have a very low K since it's not very stiff.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The springs in your car on the other hand would have a very high K

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because they're very stiff and hard to compress.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now right now this mass spring totally in equilibrium. This is exactly where the mass wants to be.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's imagine displacing this mass from equilibrium. So let's move the center of mass over to here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So we've displaced our spring from equilibrium by a distance

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that I'm going to call Xmax, and you'll see why I called it that in a second.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now if I pull this mass back to Xmax and release

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what's going to happen is it's going to undergo a series of oscillations.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In fact, if we assume that this surface is frictionless it's going to oscillate forever.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Of course that would never happen in real life but let's talk ideal-wise here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, this mass will swing through the equilibrium position here

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and all the way back to distance of -Xmax from the equilibrium.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So now you can see the reason why called this max is because as these

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
oscillations continue this is the farthest from equilibrium that the mass will ever reach.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now what I want to do is analyze this spring in terms of energy,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which we talked about a ton in the last unit.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Well it turns out that the potential energy stored in the spring

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is equal to half the spring constant K times xÂ².

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
X in this case would be whatever the current displacement from the equilibrium is.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So when the mass is at the equilibrium, x will be 0. When the mass was over here, it will be Xmax.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Maybe here it would be 1/2 of Xmax and so on.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And so if we looked at let's say three possible positions for where the mass could be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in its back and forth oscillations.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So the position 1, equilibrium. Position 2 and this is sort of midpoint. And position 3, Xmax.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So you need to tell me for each of these three positions as the spring is oscillating back and forth

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
what kind of energy does it have at each of these positions?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Check all boxes that you think apply.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And remember we're talking about kinetic energy, the energy of motion

00:02:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and potential energy, which in this case is spring potential energy and not gravitational potential.
