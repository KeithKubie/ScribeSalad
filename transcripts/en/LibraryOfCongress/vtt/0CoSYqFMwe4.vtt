00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.310
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: So,
good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.760
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
A special thanks to the Library of
Congress and The National Endowment

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.150
for the Arts for giving us this
opportunity to meet together

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.820
for those of our peeps
in the back there.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.260
My name is Mohamed Sheriff.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.970
I'm a literature specialist at The
National Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.560 position:56%
where I manage the translation and
Creative Writing Fellowship program.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950
And I have the distinct
honor and pleasure

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.810
of welcoming today these
two phenomenal authors,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.580
Peter Ho Davies and Lisa Ko.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.130
If you guys are not familiar
with who these authors are,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.630
Peter Ho Davies, a two-time
NEA Creative Writer fellow.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.060
Wrote the short-story
collections "Equal Love"

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.640
and "The Ugliest House
in the World."

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.640
His novel, "The Welsh Girl" is
set near a prisoner of war camp

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.250
in North Wales after
D-Day, was long-listed

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.620
for the Man Booker of Prize.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.160
"The Fortunes" this lovely thing
right here, his most recent novel

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.760
and the one we'll be
discussing today,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.500
follows four Chinese-American
characters

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.670
from the 1860s to the present.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.120
Peter is joining us from
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.450
Lisa Ko is the author of her
debut novel, "The Leavers."

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.430
Which won the 2016 PEN Bellwether
Prize for socially engaged fiction.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.430
The novel tells the story of Deming
Guo, who was abandoned in the Bronx

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.500
by his undocumented Chinese mother.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.420
And is raised by a
white couple upstate.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.510
Lisa joins us today
from Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.890
All right, we have a
few housekeeping rules.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.570
Just for the Library of Congress
and respect of these authors,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.620
please silent your phones.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.140
We're going to take
questions at the end.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.850
Maybe the last 15 minutes or so.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.220
But just remember,
this is being recorded.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.290
So, if you come up to the
mic, you have now agreed

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.470
to be recorded and
publicized, I guess.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.630
So, let's get started.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.930
Lisa.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.230
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.530
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Peter, welcome.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050
Thank you, guys for joining us.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.830
Is this your first time in D.C?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.140
First book festival?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.050
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: This is my first
national book festival.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.830
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: And
how's it been so far?

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.730
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: It's been pretty rainy.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.030
[ Laughs ]

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.330
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yes.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940
It is. Pretty terrible
day to come out.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.270
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: And
I'm mostly feeling .

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.390 position:56%
. . I like the emphasis on national.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
We talked a lot about the American
story in the last day or so.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.830
But as a Brit, I'm feeling slightly
embarrassed [inaudible] to be here.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.130
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Yes.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.870
So, I guess so that the
audience has a sense

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.640
of where you guys are
in your career.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.060
Before we get to the book, you
guys can take us to where you are

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.280
and how you got to these books.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.900
Lisa, this is your first novel.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.850
And you came out of the
gate just grabbing hearts

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.340
and dragging it across the page.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.880 position:56%
And Peter, this is your fourth book.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.330 position:56%
Maybe you guys can talk a little bit
about your process and how you came

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.510
to your writing career and
how you got to these books.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.530
And the importance of them
right now in your career.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.410
Little stuff.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.710
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Yes.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.750
Little stuff.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.560
Well, what I'm admiring Lisa

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.350
for is writing a first
book that is a first novel.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.590
Because it took me several
efforts to get to that point.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.190
I had to write a couple of
short-story collections.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.890
And I love that form.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.540
But I know that I struggled
mightily transitioning

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.160
from being a short-story
writer to being a novelist.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.200
I used to joke that my first
novel, "The Welsh Girl"

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.040
which is this World War II novel
took me seven years to write.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.760
Which is longer than the
second World War lasted.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.700
It's a little embarrassing.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670
And with the fortunes.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.480
And I thought the second novel
might be a little easier.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.390
But "The Fortunes" also took
me seven or eight years.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.580
And the joke for that
one, is that it's partly

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.920
about the Chinese building
the transcontinental railroad.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.820
And it took me longer
to write the book

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.210
than it took them to
build the railroad.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.340
There were more Chinese on the
railroad, it should be said.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.640
It took me so long to write it,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.800
that that joke is now
in the back of the book.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.600
But I think for me, that
movement from one form

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.410
to the other was a struggle.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.680
I still am drawn to both forms.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.390
And in some ways, I suppose
the four-part structure

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.020
of "The Fortunes" is
a kind of hybrid form,

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.700
somewhere between a novel
and short-story collection.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.070
And while I'm sure that's
somewhat to do with my limitations

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800
as a writer or the
fact that my center

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.110
of gravity is still
slightly with the short form.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.870
I guess I like to retrospectively
claim that hybrid forms speak

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.350
to the hybrid identities
of the characters.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.020
Because the nice version
of that, right?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.470
A nice idea.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.800
It wasn't exactly in my mind as
I was writing it, I have to say.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Right.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.780
Awesome. Lisa?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.160
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: To be fair, "The
Fortunes" does span like 200 years.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.450
So, you could have spent
10 to 12 years writing it.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.750
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: That's true.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.050
Yes. [Laughs] I like that.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.350
It's quicker than yes.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.650
That's good.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.950
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: It's also
funny that you mentioned

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.450
that the you thought the
second novel would be easier.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.750
But it actually wasn't.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.580
Which is kind of depressing
to hear about now.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.940
As I'm starting to think
about the second novel.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.240
And . . .

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.540
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: The
one thing that was good

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.910
about the second novel is
that I knew that at points

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.310
in writing the first novel,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.050
I had thought I will
never finish this book.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.450 position:56%
And so when I arrived at that point,
writing the second novel, I thought,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.720
well, you can never know you're
never going to finish it.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.020
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Right.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.320
At least one was possible.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.620
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: That's right.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.920
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: You got there once.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.680
And I try to keep that in mind,
too, as I'm kind of returning

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.980
to the writing process, again.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.090
But it is really interesting
because it's like, you know,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.630
while it took me seven years to
write and publish "The Leavers"

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.660
and I was working on short
stories at the time, too.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.060
Unlike, Peter, I never actually
finished a short-story collection.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.890
But I often cheated on the
novel with short stories

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.870
and published them here and there.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.120
But it's also been
fascinating to think about how,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.730
even after publication and the
success that comes with publication

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.640
and marketing the book, at the
end of the day, you still have

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.510
to sit down and keep writing.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.250
And you're kind of just
left with yourself again.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.270
And so, working with
the second book,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.770
I'm like, well here we are again.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.820
Like, back to kind of
starting from scratch.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.880
Back to facing my own limitations
and kind of like dealing

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.850 position:56%
with the blank screen or blank page.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.450
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: I think that's
important for us to sort of talk

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.180 position:56%
about the structure and the process.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.160 position:56%
Because you both ended up writing in
these four parts, four -part novels.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.060 position:56%
And I'm wondering how much
research went into this period book.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.180
Because it so much
heavy with research,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.270
it almost reads like
historical fiction.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.760
I mean, it is historical
fiction in many parts.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.890
And Lisa, the motivation
for your book, I'm sure,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.220
had to do a significant
amount of research as well.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.620
So, you guys let's talk about that,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.100
what went into actually
building this.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.070
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: In my case,
a lot of it is book research.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.680
The first part of the book
takes places in the 1860s.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.290 position:56%
The second part is the 1920s and 30s

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.750
about the Chinese-American
movie star Anna May Wong.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.070
And the third section is set
in the 1980s during the period

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.760
when Vincent Chin was a
hate-crime victim in Detroit.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.630
And it oddly, each of those
represent a certain different

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.640
research challenges.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.710
There is a fair amount of material
about the building of the railroad,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.220
the transcontinental in the 1860s.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.190
But less about the life of
the Chinese who built it.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.620
It's not an accident, of course.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.470
Their lives are less
documented, less well known.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.790
So, there were lots of
gaps to sort of fill,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.270
imaginatively in various ways.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.140
With Ann May Wong,
on the other hand,

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.310
she was a global celebrity
in her day.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.590
So, there was almost
too much material.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.210 position:56%
For a while I worried that there was
so much factual material out there,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.000
that I wasn't sure where the
fictional space was to invent.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.700 position:56%
And I only really was released from
that anxiety when I figured in a way

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.720
that she's like any
global celebrity today.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.450
She's like Angelina Jolie today.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.430
What she might say in a public
interview might not actually be the

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.730
absolute truth.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.380
So, there's a public image and
a private life beneath that.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.460
That the fiction can probe a
little bit that's not as accessible

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.730
to the historical record
in some ways.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.560
And with Vincent's story, it's
a lot more recent allowing

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.860
newspaper research.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.070
I got to visit some of
the sites of the attack

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.160
because I live near
Detroit, as well.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.350
So, it was mixture of various
books, newspaper accounts

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.250
and some site visits, as well.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.510
And I did actually go, I should
say, to travel the railroad

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.560
across the Sierra Nevada's
where the Chinese did a lot

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.860
of work on the railroad.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.380
Of course, it's slightly
different route now.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.170
And I'm still doing it more
than a 100 years later.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.510
But there's still some sense of the
landscape, the color of the sky,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.680
the temperature, some of the
flora and fauna being common.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.190 position:56%
So, while I can't go back in time,
there is real pleasure in being able

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.020
to go to those locations.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.320
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Absolutely.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.620
Lisa.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.650
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: I also, like you
Peter, I took the real-life stories

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.860
as the initial starting
point of the book.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.110
But kind of felt like I needed to
sort of push beyond that in order

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.720
to let the story open up.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.790
So, "The Leavers" was initially
inspired by these stories

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.490
that I was reading in the news
about undocumented mothers

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.400
who had their U.S. born
children, who are citizens,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.580
taken away from them and
adopted by American families.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.890
While the mothers were
being deported or detained.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.310
So, I was really just
kind of horrified

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.910
and interested by these stories.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.610
And sort of what they said about
us as Americans and about identity

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.270
and family and class and race.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.720
But I definitely felt intimidated
by the subject material at first.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.610
You know, I'm not an adoptee, I'm
not a parent, I'm not from China.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.740
So, I did a lot of research.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.230 position:56%
There were several years that I kind
of allowed research to, you know,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.320
let me procrastinate writing.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.620
I traveled to China.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.950 position:56%
Found where my characters were from.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.250
Read a lot.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.550
Spoke to a lot of people.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.460
And then sort of had to figure out
how to separate that from the story

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.250
and let the characters
do their thing.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.070
Beyond trying to prove to
myself that I did the research.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.370
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
Well, that's fascinating.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.590
Because the research question
can be about historical material

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.990
but it can also be about, I
think, for both us that feeling

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.350
of cultural research
in a certain sense.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.080
That while we have Chinese roots.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.480
It's still this feeling of I still
need to, being of mixed race,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.660
I felt like I had to go learn
about that culture and go

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.320
to some of those places as well.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.980
And so that's almost an internal
research in a certain sense.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.280
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Absolutely.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: To make yourself
feel that you have the right

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.880
to write about the material.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.180
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.480
That's a great way to say it.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.780
I think internal research
is a huge part of writing

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.330
that we never really talk about.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.800 position:56%
Which it's almost, to me, feels
like the bulk of the work sometimes.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.520
It's very psychological.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.130
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Lisa,
you mentioned something

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.460
about the characters and
feeling them authentic.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.220
Right? So, two characters that you
guys sort of created in this world

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.500
where women as the
minority is Polly, Anna May.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.160
And they sort of stick out in my
mind because they're dreamers.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.530
They're strivers.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.350
There is so much pulling at
them, pulling down on them.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.890
Yet, they persevere.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.890
And you guys both created
those characters.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.150
Right? And I was going to
say that the other women are

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.130
on the periphery but
they're really not.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.220
They encounter them all the time.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.610
Anna May even has prostitutes
taking her name.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.570
So, to the extent to where
they're so intermingled.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.970
But can you guys sort of
talk about your relationship

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.770
to those characters and why it
was important for them, for women,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.440
to be represented and to be
that sort of juxtaposition

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.350
between the timid Asian
or the prostitute

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.040
and all the different things
and how you both sort of came

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.190 position:56%
to have these upstanding characters?

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.660
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: I mean Polly was
sort of initially inspired,

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.390
again, by these news stories.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.980
But it was mostly the frame work
were the facts surrounding her.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.480
I knew that she was
undocumented immigrant

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.960
from a certain part of China.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.260
That she was a mother.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.280
And that she and her son
had gotten separated.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.640
And that she was living in New
York and she would get deported.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.570
So, I was trying to figure out
what to write around those facts.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:08.860
What would a person have to be
like and want in order to kind

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.560
of risk their life
migrating to another country

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.040
as an undocumented migrant.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.880
Having to take the risks of paying
$50,000 to come to New York.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.100 position:56%
What would it take for this
character to have to survive working

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.010
in New York paying this debt
back, raising her child.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.750
Right? So, I think all of
these things kind of fed

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.030
into her character in terms
of making her strong willed,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.420
very independent minded, kind
of having that adventure spirit.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.150
And it sort of became
kind of her storyline.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.040
Like she's, throughout the book
she's kind of constantly looking

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.330
for a way to kind of figure out how

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.290
to live beyond all
these expectations

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.620
that people are putting on her.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.440
So, she's, as a woman anywhere,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.560
she's encountering
sexism and the patriarchy.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.890
And she's kind of figuring
out how to be a mother,

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.140
how to be a woman on her own terms.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.440
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Yes.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.130
I think for me, you know,
I stumbled a little bit

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.780
on to Anna May's narrative as I was
in the midst of writing the book.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.270
The first part drew me
to the transcontinental.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:15.140
I was actually interested in the
idea, at least, that an early wave

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.910 position:56%
of Chinese immigration into the U.S.
was something of a bachelor society.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.980 position:56%
It was a lot of male labor for the
railroads to work in the gold mines.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.710
And there's mentally had very
difficult and challenging lives,

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.180
which is what the first part of
the book addresses to some degree.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.170
But in the research, it became
very clear that the lives

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.590
of the smaller number
of Chinese women,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.310
I think there was one Chinese woman

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.760
for every 20 men who
came in that period.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.940
But those lives were, because many
of them worked as prostitutes,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.180
were in many ways much,
much harsher.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.460
Much more desperate than men who
were working on the railroad.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.030
And so I felt like it was
incumbent upon me to sort

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.560 position:56%
of address their lives a little bit.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.350
Began to think about
that space in many ways.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.850 position:56%
And I think my interest in Anna May
comes a little bit out of that sense

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.490
that for all that some
of the male figures

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.980
in the Chinese-American history
have had a very difficult time.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.940
The women have almost
consistently had a difficult

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.240
and challenging time in some ways.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.540
And I think in the context

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.520
of the narrative they
represent the strongest figures

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.000
in the book to my way of thinking.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.090
Because they're the
survivors, I think in many ways.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.010 position:56%
And I think for me that felt very
important in the context of learning

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.310
about Chinese-American history

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.830
and to some degree
about Chinese culture.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.510
Because certainly from the period,
at least where the book starts,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.910
the valuation in Chinese culture
of men and women, boys and girls,

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.850
is so distinctly unequal
in various ways.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.070
It felt as though I wanted to think
about that question and address it.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.550 position:56%
And I was very conscious even from
the get-go that we move from a space

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.040
where we think in the
1860s of a largely male,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.010
bachelor society, Chinese rivals.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.920
And we think in a more
recent context of a lot

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.700
of adopted baby girls
arriving from Chine as well.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.990
So, it felt interesting to think
about those two gendered groups

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.890
of immigrants at different ends
of the historical spectrum.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.190
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Absolutely.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.500
I would like to go back
to the male component.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.900
And sort of do this again.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.470
I'm thinking of Ling and John.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.860
Who, interestingly struggle with
attractiveness and, you know,

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.640
actually being able to sleep
with these prostitutes.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.620
Which [inaudible] because they
won't sleep with Chinese men.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.890
And John being the sort of,
you know, and he's searching

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.190
for his identity as well.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.220
And his attractiveness
and how he appeals.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.000
And then there is this overarching
patriarchy that's happening.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.300
Lisa, you sort of .

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.070
. . you have that in every aspect
of how Polly relates to her father,

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.660 position:56%
to Leon, to all these different men.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.670
There is this don't do this
because you're a woman.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.970
You're unappealing.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.270
Never work out for you.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.570
You know, all these
different things.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.870
So, can you guys talk
about the male characters

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.170
and something like their struggles.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.460
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Let me think about.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.760
[Laughs]

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.900
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: As the
designated male, Chinese male.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:05.400
I think Anna May Wong character
made me think quite a lot

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.960
about this question.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.360
She's globally famous
for being Chinese.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.190
And famous for playing
exotic characters.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.720
The Madame Butterfly characters,
the Dragon Lady characters,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.010 position:56%
all the stereotypes we think of now.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.380
And she's one of the agents

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.140
of creating those stereotypes
in some way.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.930
She becomes successful and
famous for portraying those.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.260
And while she's famous in
the west for those roles,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.840 position:56%
she's also somewhat reviled in China

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.010
for undertaking those
roles, I think.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.030
But I do think there is a kind

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.930
of Western exoticization
classic instance of Orientalism,

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:45.410
in which Asian women, Chinese women
are sexualizing some of these ways.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.320 position:56%
And Anna May seems like she was a
very specific early example of that.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.240
Although there are
precursors as well.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.750
And the sexual visibility in
those ways of Chinese women,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.110
those stereotypes, also
creates other stereotypes

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.620
that were banned upon the males.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.800
Right? So, the women are,
if they're Dragon Ladies,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.600
then the men by comparison,
the Chinese men

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.950
by comparison can seem
effeminate, I think.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.850
And so this goes partly to the
way those images are constructed.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:15.680
But it also goes back even to the
earliest periods of the Gold Rush

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.980
and the transcontinental.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.080
The Chinese men arrive.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.330
They're wearing cues, which
to Westerners look like a kind

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.190
of female kind of way
of wearing the hair.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.630
They are thought to
be smaller and weaker.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.600
And that's one of the
things that they're work

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.590
on the transcontinental
sort of pushes back upon

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.080
as a stereotype in various ways.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.710
So, there are a number of factors
that'll play into that space.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.860
But it does feel like sort of
ironic, sort of tragic tandem

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.430
that both male and female
identities, at least sexually,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.530
are exaggerated in
opposite directions.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.450
And it does feel as
though there is a kind

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.890
of binary at work in this regard.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.390
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: And Lisa, Leon
is sort of contradictory to that.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.430
Because he's in a loving
relationship with Polly.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.790
And he's sort of a
strong, brut of a man.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.690
He's the complete opposite of that.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.990
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.290
He's definitely .

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.590
. . I mean he's Polly's boyfriend.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.890
He's a meat cutter.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.850
He's kind of this beefy muscular
dude who is kind of like silent

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.270
and macho in a lot of ways.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.560
I mean, we're all products
of the world we live in.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.440
Right? And Daniel .

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.820
. . or Deming, he kind of goes by
both names throughout the book.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.730
Who is my protagonist is also a
male, Chinese-American character

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:34.260
who has sort of an
interesting, plays character-wise,

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.160
as a male adoptee of
two white parents.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:44.200
In contrast, his foil is
sort of this female adoptee,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.300
his friend Angel, who
is a Chinese adoptee.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.600
And sort of fetish .

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.260
. . She's kind of fetishized in her
own ways by her adoptive parents.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.560
And that's something
that I think I saw

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.860
in "The Fortune" that
I really enjoyed.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.690
That was kind of like this role
that we put on Chinese girls.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.620 position:56%
Like what does it mean in terms of
kind of fetishizing girls over boys.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.030
What does that say about
the expectations that we put

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.180
on Chinese-American girls
over Chinese-American boys.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: I think it's one
of those ironies, if we come from,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.230
at least historically
a cultural space

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.920 position:56%
in which boys are valued over girls.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.860
One of the odd narratives of the
Chinese-American experience is

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.060
that in these context, sometimes
girls are valued over boys.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.220
So, the movement from China to
the U.S. in some ways invert some

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.900
of those gender valuations.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.200
I think in some ways, too.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.360
It's ironic and it doesn't serve
either gender particularly well.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.890
But the flip seems
interesting to me.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.890
And it seems like a potential way,

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.540
a little mode of conflict
to address in the book.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.260
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: So, I
think we would sort of be .

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.960
. . if we didn't go into subject
of identity and you guys have sort

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.160
of touched on it a little bit
as you're explaining things.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.410
Something that struck in a
heavy way as reading this.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.940
And I thought you guys
handled it so well.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.300
And it was beautiful.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.320
Is this loss of identity and
this gaining of a new identity

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.930
to sort of lose identity again.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.060
Or be lost within that
weird middle place.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.320
So, I'm thinking Deming
becomes Daniel.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.910
Palon [assumed spelling]
becomes Polly,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.170
losing the cues, dressing
more western.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.700
You guys do these symbolic
things that signify a loss

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.000
of identity, a loss of self.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.590
And then this real self, you guys
have this interesting you guys move

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:19.890
to in different ways.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.980 position:56%
Where the real self gets buried down

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.760
and the character is
almost revisited

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.850
as a way of touching themselves.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.760
And realizing that there is loss

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.200
and can measure how lost they
are from their real selves.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.190
So, can you guys talk
about this identity theme

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.330
and how it's playing
an importance of that.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.560
And then we'll get
to this middle space

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.660
of being hyphenated
American whatever it,

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.960
nationality American thing.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.860
Because I think it leads to that.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.160
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.460
That was something that I felt

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.760
like something I wanted
to explore in my book.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.110
And that I also really enjoyed

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.170 position:56%
in "The Fortunes" was this
Asian-American double consciousness.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.550
Where the characters in both our
books, I think, are being seen

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.210
by other people in certain ways.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.020
That are at odds with
how they see themselves.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.940
But yet, how they're being seen
effects how they see themselves.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.420
Right. So, there's this kind
of constant back and forth.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.720
And I really also wanted to resist
having it be this simplistic either

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.600
or between western and
eastern, or American or China.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.760
Because I think that also
negates the Asian-American

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.060
or the Chinese-American experience,
which is really important.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:27.650
And at the center to my character
as them trying to find a way

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.830
to forge their own identities,
outside of their families,

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.210
outside of whatever other
social pressures there are.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.050
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: And it's
interesting, too, because for both

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.810
of us the attention to
names, western names,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.860
Chinese names play an
awful lot of part in it.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.390
And speech is sort of
doubling of the identity

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.690
that we've been talking about.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.280
But yes, it does always feel
to me, and even when we talk

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.540 position:56%
about Chinese-Americanness, it feels
as though that hyphenated identity.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.970
And I think this is true for a
number of hyphenated identities.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.540
Seems to imply a kind of choice.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.070
Which side of the hyphen to lead?

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.370
Where do your loyalties lie?

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.490
And that feels always like
a no-win choice to me.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:11.700
If one cleaves too much to one's
heritage, then there is a, what,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.320
failure to assimilate
into the mainstream

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.960
of the country that
one is living in?

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.160
If one assimilates too
much is that a betrayal

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.720 position:56%
of the heritage that one comes from?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.450 position:56%
So, when we think of it as a choice,
as a duality, it feels very much

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.540
as though it's just lose-lose.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.620
And I think that's
at the heart of some

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.910
of the anxieties of inauthenticity.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.940
People in this culture
can experience.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.830
But I think the idea, and Lisa's
talked about this very too,

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.100
that the hybrid identity is
its own identity in some sense.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.260
This is one of the
reasons that I chose the

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.950
"The Fortunes" as a title in end.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.780
Because the fortune cookie, while
we know it not to be Chinese,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.380
but we don't go to
Chinese restaurants

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.850
and have fortune cookies.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.570
Where, of course, the food is
also not called Chinese food.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:51.870
It's just food.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.170
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Right, it
came from California.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.470
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Yes.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.240
Right? But it somehow also
feels like a very specific

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.400 position:56%
and somewhat humble Chinese-American
signifier in some ways, as well.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.990
It's not of one culture
or the other.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.600
But it's somewhere in
that middle ground.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.940
I wouldn't suggest there
was authenticity even

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.240
in the hybrid identity.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.540
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Right.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.840
I agree that it's like .

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.140
. . it is hybrid to
think of its itself.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.430
Whereas if we're saying, we're
choosing between Chinese-American,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.010
it's almost saying that
I'm not an American.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.280
You know. Like, American
culture doesn't look like me.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.390
And I think that's
completely incorrect.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.780
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Well, I
think for me that it was .

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.040
. .I mean I grew up in Britain.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.800
And certainly, when I was
younger I was very conscious

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.970
of not looking British.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.630
Britain has become
separate to Brexit,

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.970
and much more multicultural
community in the time

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.830
that I've lived, I've
been away from it.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.400
But my face did not
look particular English

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.990
as I defined Britishness
when I was growing up.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.880
And so, I always had this idea
that if I went other places.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.340
If I went to China, or if I
went to Singapore or Malaysia,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.540 position:56%
where my mother's from, that I would
potentially belong in those spaces.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.320
But even that feels .

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.770
. . I can remember living in
Singapore for a little while.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.840
And enjoying the anonymity
of walking down the street

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.140
and looking like everybody else.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.440
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Until you
open your mouth.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.590
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Until
you open your mouth.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.660
Right. [Laughs] In fact, once
I remember getting into a cab

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.040
in Singapore and I
hadn't said very much.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.080
I don't think the accent had given
me away as yet to the cab driver.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.450
But he said to me,
you're not from here.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.750
And said, well, okay.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.050
How can you tell?

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.350
He said, you're too short.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.650
And that was really interesting.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.950
Because I was shocked by that.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.600 position:56%
Because I'd internalized stereotypes
that all Chinese people are short.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.570
He was like, no, obviously
not in Singapore.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.900
Many are much taller than me.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.120
So, it was just a reminder
in a sense not fitting

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.700
in there made me feel like I don't
fit in either of these places.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.680
So, maybe we have to find some
combination of those identities

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.070
that is my own in some
ways so that I can fit in.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.370
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Lisa,
can you also speak to that?

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.640
Because I feel like no one
embodies that more than Deming.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.550
Because he wants his name
stripped away from him.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.850
He's still harking back.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.170
And he wants this ideal world.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.470
That he fits in.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.830
That he can speak Cantonese
with others.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.570
Sort of has this secret
language with other people

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.190
who speak Cantonese
in that restaurant.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.760
And then he becomes Americanized.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.340
And then goes over to China.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.840
And feels alienated there, too.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.640
So, can you speak to that?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.940
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Absolutely.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.380
Yes. that was definitely
something that I wanted to examine

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.040
with Deming's journey
throughout the book.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.790
Where it's kind of
like he's being brought

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.730
to this new town by
his adoptive parents.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.030
They change his name.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.040
They want him to assimilate
in a certain way.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.670
And it's not the right
choice for him.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.920
It's not really taking his
own needs into account.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.910
And, as you said, he goes to China.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.280
And he's like, well, I
was born in New York.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.950 position:56%
I'm not really part of here, either.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.490
So, it's kind of, his journey is
really trying to find his own way.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.470
That he eventually finds with other
Chinese-Americans in New York City.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.790 position:56%
So, it's kind of saying, again, like
that's the place where we can belong

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.340
and not really have to ascribe to
either of those kind of simplistic,

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.790
white-middle class
America versus China.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.880
There is a very vast space
in between those two.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.180
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: I love
that section in the book

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.560
with Deming back in China.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.930
But I also found myself envying
him because he speaks Chinese.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.740
His Chinese rusty but he gets
better the longer he spends there.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.590
And so he begins to be able to
navigate that space much better.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.780
And I don't speak any Cantonese,
as my mother's language.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.700
I don't speak any Cantonese.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.610
But it speaks to not just the
way look but the way we sound.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:31.320
The language we have access to also
shapes identity for us as well.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.290
So, I had felt both a kinship
with his experience of feeling not

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.720
at home in the place that he
might have thought was home.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.250
But I also envied his
ability to adapt to that home.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:42.550
Better than I could.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.850
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.150
I think he has much more of agility

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.450
of like code-switching,
than I do too.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.520
Because I can't speak
fluently either.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.100
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: So, there is
this one thing that I really wanted

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.430
to talk about with you two.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.730 position:56%
Something that I noticed throughout.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.450
So, the white characters.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.220
So, I'm thinking Peter, Kay,
Elaine, Jim, Mr. Crocker.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.660
They all have this eye
of invisibility, right?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.630
Where regardless of what happens
and amount of experiences they have

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.810
with certain immigrants, they never
fully see them or enter that space

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.660
where they begin to see
them where they are.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.180
Right? Even to the point
where Deming is in China,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.580 position:56%
and they're Skyping on his birthday.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.510
And his Mom yells out,
his name is Deming.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.810
Not Daniel.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.330
Right? And it's just like
they still don't get it.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.770
It goes over their head.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.790
Why the choice to leave
them in that sort

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.390
of ignorant space, or blind space?

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.880
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
That's a good question.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.180
I'm looking at Lisa.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.550
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: I mean, yes.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:44.490
Kaya and Peter [assumed spellings]
are Daniel's adoptive parents.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.840
And I really saw them
very much as a product

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.850
of their socioeconomic class.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.690
Their upper middleclass academics.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.040
Their sort of liberal,
well-meaning, white people.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.550
They're like a lot of people
that I've met in my life.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:03.140
And to them, it's sort of like
their journey is really part

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.420
of his journey as well.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.230
So, him coming to his own, finding
his own home, his own family kind

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.270
of means that he has to reject
both his adoptive family

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.110
and his birth family
to find his own family.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.840
So, story-wise, that's kind
of why they end where .

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.140
. . the story where they are.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.440
And where he is.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.420
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: It seems
as if they are, you know,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.010
and I think about some of the
figures in "The Fortunes" now

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.260
that you mention Charles
Crocker the railroad magnet

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.160
who employs my character Ling.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.850
And while that's not an
obviously a parental relationship,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.210
it's kind of quasi parental.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.110
Ling is Eurasian.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:44.410
He sort of looks at Crocker as
a father figure in certain ways.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:48.420
But, in a way, there's a kind of
individuation question going on.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.650
There's that feeling of the
parents, or the parental figure,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.460 position:56%
sees the character in a certain way.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.770
Into kind of a white gaze,
I suppose in those regards.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.680
And for the character to be able to
understand himself or see himself,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.700
he has to sort of step
away from that, I suppose.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.220
So, it almost feels as
though the, in a sense,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.790
ultimately the white
characters do, I think,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.130
fail to see what the
Chinese characters

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.580
or the Chinese-American characters.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.870
But maybe that's the point.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.950
Because the Chinese-American
characters have to figure

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.670
out who they are separate
to the gaze from outside.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.870
And again, we go back to that
tension we talked about earlier

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.790
between our identities being
built in some kind of negotiation

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.400
between how we're seen and how
we see ourselves internally.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.910
Right? And how do those line up?

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.710
And which do we lean into more
or less at different times?

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.010
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Right.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.620
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: So, just
sort of open it up a little bit.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:40.250
So, I read this, both these
books as a Liberian-American.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.850
Right? And found myself
in a lot of these pages.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.700
And I'm thinking about
the section with Vincent

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.870
where Vincent gets murder because
they believe he's Japanese.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.200
And then all these other Asian
groups start to get together

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.040
and they realize they're
Asian-American.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.270
But they also feel sort of
weirdness because they're

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.840
like Civil Rights wasn't
exactly for us.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.940
Right? And so, and so I started
thinking of this interplay

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.220
between these two novels.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.730
These two novels are very
much centered in a Chinese,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.030
Chinese immigrant experience.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.640
Chinese-American experience.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.940
But there are a lot of things

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.740
that are relatable to
a broader everything.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.520 position:56%
In all types of marginalized groups.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.180
So, how do you guys see this
sort of effecting readers

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.300
of all different spheres?

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.530
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
That's a great question.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:30.990
I think with the Vincent Chin case
is sort of the space where I think

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.330
about that the most in
the context of the book.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:39.680
Because, so Vincent gets
killed in a bar room brawl

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.740
by some white auto
workers in Detroit in '82.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.540
This is in a period of
deep economic anxiety

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.300
where Japanese imports are
being blamed for the decline

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.000
of the auto industry in Detroit.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.910
They mistake him for a Japanese,
get into a fight at the club.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.230
Chase him outside.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.860
Hunt him down for about half
an hour and then beat him

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.160
to death with a baseball bat.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.460
It's a terrible, terrible case.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.370
And for that, those two
men received fines of $3000

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.990
and no prison time at all.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.050
So, it's an enormous injustice.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.700
Thus, speaking of strong
female characters,

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.430
Vincent's mother Lilly Chin,
is instrumental in sort

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.920 position:56%
of fighting for justice for her son.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.480
And in doing so, sort of
brings together a coalition

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.230
of Asian-American activists
and protestors.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.030
And one of the great ironies, of
course, is that Lilly is Chinese.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.970
Has come from China to the U.S.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.010
in the aftermath of
the second World War.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.270
Fleas China in a sense because
she can't stand to live there

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.780
or having seen the Japanese
aggression during World War II.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.260
And then her son is mistaken
for a Japanese and killed.

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.260
And then she finds herself
making political common cause

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.270
with the Japanese to try
and get justice for him.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.160
So, the circularity for those
things are [inaudible] grizzly.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.460
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Right.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.760
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
But in the process

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.890
of getting the case reopened, it
has to be pursued as a hate crime

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.790
in the Federal Legislation
that has been brought

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.870
into the civil rights movement.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.020
And hasn't previously
been applied to Asians.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.400
So, there is this question
of whether there is a kind

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.700
of user [inaudible] of rights

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.940
that blacks have worked
very hard to achieve.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.230
And fight for themselves.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:14.730
I think that it leans into
a much larger conversation,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:19.060
which is a problematic one.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.680
I forget how we rank the struggles
of various immigrant groups

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.800
and various ethnic and racial
groups within the U.S. So, I think,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.310
we want to resist, I
certainly want to resist,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.340
the kind of ethnic Olympics here.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.080
Your case is much worse than
my case, and vice versa.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.540
I'm very conscious of
it at the same time.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.740
While trying Chinese work on
the transcontinental railroad,

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.050 position:56%
worked under terrible conditions
and worked for less pay than whites.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.350
They were paid.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.770
Right? So, there are a
significant differences

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.360
in the various circumstances of
different groups have suffered

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.110 position:56%
in the history of the United States.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.560
But I also think there is a way
in which, one of the reasons I'm

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.870
so interested in stereotype.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:02.480
It feels as though
one of the issues,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.510
one of the burdens
facing Chinese-Americans

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.140
and Asian-Americans more broadly,

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.020
is this idea of the model
minority in positive stereotypes.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:15.070
And in some ways positive
stereotypes, by their very nature,

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.900 position:56%
we might be less inclined to resist.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.960
But in many ways, I actually
feel that's an even greater duty.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.910
We have to resist positive
stereotypes in order

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.850
to resist negative
stereotypes, as well.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.920
And if we accept positive
stereotypes, we're acceding

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.480
to the logic of stereotype.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.270
That affects not only our own
group but all other groups as well.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.920
So, it does feel important to push
back even on positive stereotypes.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.570
Because they are all narrowing.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.870
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.230
And there is a way that the model
minority is always has historically

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.000
and continues to be used sort of
as a wedge between white America

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.090
and other Americans of color.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.470
So, it's kind of set
up in a way that is

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.830
like look Asians have succeeded.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:54.020
In a way it serves to
delegitimize our own anger

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.550
and our own active
racism against Asians.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:01.180
On the other hand, it also is used
to perpetuate racism against Black

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.290
and Latinos, by saying,
well, Asians have succeeded.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.590
Why haven't you?

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.720
And it kind of ignores all
these larger, historical

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:15.770
and political facts about why
we've ended up in this place.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.760
I think Vincent Chin is a really
interesting character, too.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.060
Because he's still being used.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.840
This is like over 30, 35 years ago.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.370
And he's still being
used as a catalyst

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.290
for Asian-American political anger.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:28.590
So, I'm always .

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.890
. . I don't know if
you read this article

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:31.710
about Asian-American fraternities
that was out by Jay Caspian Kang?

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.010
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: I did.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.310
Yes.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.610
3

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.910
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: I was super
fascinated by it.

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:39.430
It just sort of, we're going
off on another tangent.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:43.670
It's this great in-depth study
about Asian-American frats.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.550
In particular, one hazing
incident that resulted in the death

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.860
of a young man in New York City.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.940
But what I didn't know is
that the frats are sort of .

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:57.570
. . having these kind of
Asian-American history 101 lesson

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.070
as part of their hazing rituals.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.370 position:56%
Where they learn about Vincent Chin.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:04.080
And that sort of what kind
of gets these young men

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.900
to feel politically empowered in
a place that they haven't before.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.300
And it's a very ethnocentrus
[spelling] view

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.600
of political empowerment.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.690
It lacks a lot of context.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.890
But there's still this
need for, like, you know,

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.870
these young men feel the
need to connect to that case.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.350
And then, so, the question is why?

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:29.910
Why? What are we lacking in
terms of our own, I guess,

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:36.870
access to a more complex and
contextual Asian-American identity.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.350
That that case still
feels so meaningful

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.280
and fulfills a certain
need for these young men.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.580
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: Ironically,

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.880
one of these that that
article is fascinating.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.590 position:56%
It was in the New York Times
Magazine about two, three weeks ago?

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:54.530 position:56%
I mean the case, the hazing death,
has been prosecuted for a while now.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:55.830
It's an extraordinary story.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:00.990
The young man in question, I think,
was killed in a hazing ritual

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.350
that was called the glass ceiling,
which is very poignant as a detail.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.720
And I would also argue,
I'm not sure about this,

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.760
but I have some residual sense
that some part of the violence

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.900
of that hazing plays into some

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.070
of the questions we
talked about earlier.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.720
The way we see Asian
males and their potency,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.670
their strength, their masculinity.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:30.050
It almost feels as if this is
an over compensation for them.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.800
The violence of the hazing ritual

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.100
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.520
It's a very macho, violent.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.950
East-Asian male centric view.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.780
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
They become perpetrators

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.320
of their own victimhood,
in a certain way.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.420
[inaudible]

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.890
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: So, before
I open it up for questions.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.790
I have like one more.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.150
So, I'm curious about the
reception of these novels.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.300
Especially now.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.090
How has it been?

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.390
And you guys are writing
about very relevant topic.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.400
What's that been for you guys like?

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.560
Are you now the representatives
of the .

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.860
. .

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.160
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Yes.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.460
I am. I speak for all Asians.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.760
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Right.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.060
You speak for all.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.360
[Laughs]

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.660
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Across the world.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.960
Apparently.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.260
The largeness.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.560
The largest population.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.860
[Laughs] Yes.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.160
You know it's been
interesting because so much

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.190
of the reception has been,
this is super timely.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.950
Because now we have
Trump as our President.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.260
We have this very violently,
anti-immigrant administration.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.130
And the deportation.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.720
The tension in the news in a way

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.020
that they might not
have been before.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.160
But what's interesting is that
I did start the novel seven

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.460
or eight years ago.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.700
So, it was based on stories that
were happening back in 2008, 2009.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.750
And now, they're sort
of being stepped up.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.340
Right? In the news even more.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.590
It's been an interesting place
to be and an interesting year

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.080
to come out with a first novel.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.150
And also about this topic, as well.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: It's fascinating
to me the way this actually happened

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.040
when I was writing my last
novel, "The Welsh Girl" which was

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.640
about German prisoners of
war held in allied hands.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.190
And I began that before 9/11.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.270
But it was an historical novel in
which the present and the treatment

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.240
of prisoners of war places like Abu
Ghraib, and Guantanamo get caught

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.910
up with the past in a strange way.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.310
And it's certainly been
true with "The Fortunes"

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.730
with that Vincent Chin section.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:18.350
Where we think about the way
economic anxiety and some unbridled

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:24.230
and unfortunate rhetoric associated
with it fuels a hate crime.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:28.130
And I must admit since I've been
touring with the book, I've more

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.000
and more been reading that section.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.120
Because it feels as though
it speaks to the time.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.210
And it feels cathartic, I hope,
for both me and for listeners

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.510
who want to hear that section.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.130
One of the ironies,
the bitter ironies,

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.500
is that each of the sections of
the book has a brief epigraph.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:50.410
And the epigraph from that
section was from then,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.620
not quite even candidate Trump,

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.520
in about 2012 when he was
first contemplating a run.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.610
And about a year ago, my
editor and I talked about that.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:06.170 position:56%
It was a line, I won't quote it
here, because it's fairly offensive.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.580
Not surprisingly.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.440 position:56%
In regard to the Chinese and it used
an epithet that is an important one

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.270
in the context of the
Vincent chin killing.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.700
And about a year ago, my editor
and I, well, more than a year ago,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.820
18 months ago now,
were talking about it.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.720
And she said, this seems
really timely right now

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.160
but it might be very
dated very soon.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.490
Of course, all we can say
at this point is, if only.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.260
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Okay.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.120
So, we have about 10
minutes left for questions.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.340 position:56%
So, if you have a question come up
to these two mics we have over here.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.110
And ask them.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.510
Not all at once.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:48.810
[ Applause ]

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.520
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for
doing this panel.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.540
I've just finished
"The Leavers" recently.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.740
And "The Fortunes" is
on my good reads list.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.770
So, in the context that
you've just been talking

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.090 position:56%
about today's political environment.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:08.670
What would you want Americans to
understand about the experience

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.810
of your characters and the
experience of people who risk

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:16.200
so much to immigrate
to this country?

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.900
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: I mean, I feel like,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.190
as a writer I'm writing
a lot to post questions.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:26.600
So, ideally, I want my readers
to either identify in some way

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.360
with the characters or sort of
question their own thinking.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.150
Or sort of, you know, kind of
raise questions in their mind

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.030
about what it means to be American,
what it means to an immigrant.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.330
What kind of questions about
culture and identity mean.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.780
And that's sort of where I'm at
with the book and being a writer.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.140
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: It
is hard to generalize.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.910
But I think one of the things that
I'm struck by, not just in context

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.730
of writing the book, but in my
own life and experience, too.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:05.970
Is that people who immigrate
here really want to be here.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:10.350
They value this country and what
it stands for, what it means.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.910
They are patriotic
before they get here,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:20.650
because of those aspirational
values.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:25.110
It would be nice to
welcome them in that spirit,

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:30.780
I think, is what I would suggest.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.180
&gt;&gt; Actually, I think you
just answered my question.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.030
Thank you.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.460
&gt;&gt; I want to follow up on what you
just said about immigrants wanting

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.180
to be here and the values that
they identify with in America.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.720 position:56%
And kind of go back to what you were
talking with hyphenated identity.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.030
And I was curious like what
those American values, you see,

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.920
that immigrants identify with.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.930
And how it's possible to
reconcile them with really holding

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:02.140
onto both sides of hyphen?

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.700
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: For me, I
feel like I just want

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.810
to add more context
regarding immigration.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:12.110
Right? Like the idea that .

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.100
. . I don't want to feel like
so much of the way we talk

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.920
about immigration is really in
this kind of strange vacuum.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.310
Like we're not really
looking at how,

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.090 position:56%
why people necessarily want to come.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.120
A lot of it is because the U.S. has
been involved in other countries.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.180
Right? It's like we're here
because you were there.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.490
We've been involved with wars.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.000
We've been involved
with colonization.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.920
So, there's sort of this
reason for migration.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.990
People come out of
because of economic need,

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.950
for the most part, I would think.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:47.190
And because their homelands have
been untenable for many reasons.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.280
So, yes. This is really
answer to your question.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.580
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies:
It's economic need.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.970
It's also economic aspiration.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:43:01.420 position:56%
And so that sounds like people are
coming for your money and your jobs.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.170
But I think they're also coming
for a country that values

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.510
and allows for economic aspiration.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.460
So, that's the more
positive way of seeing that.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:16.240
Something that we all
notionally share, I think.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.540
It's funny.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.840
So, we're on a panel.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.000
We're talking about
what could be described

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.890
as immigrant literature
in some ways.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.090
For myself, and I realize that
my own context is very different

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.610
from that of many immigrants.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:36.000
One of the ways I immigrated
before I arrived was

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.820
by reading American literature.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:44.590
So, literature written by
the American cannon is one

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.120
of the things that brought me here.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.220
So, literature is an
invitation or was an invitation.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.300
I think it helped me adapt
and made me want to come.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.660
It made me excited
by the possibilities.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.670 position:56%
And we talk about opportunities and
it sounds like economic opportunity.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.940
But even for me, coming
from Britain,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.940
it feels like cultural opportunity.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.500
It's the opportunity to
reinvent oneself, I think.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.170
I could not have been a writer
if I'd stayed in Britain.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.120
I'm pretty confident about that.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.580
So, those are some of
those aspirational things.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.180
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Come up.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.480
Come up.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for
talking about this

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.350
and for writing about
your experiences.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.160
I wanted to ask a question
regarding sort of the then

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.770
and now of the immigration.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.960
Some people come here, immigration,
looking for, as you say,

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.250
more prosperity, leaving
an economic situation.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.900
Some people come here because
they don't want to come here.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.830
They're refugees from
wars and other issues.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:52.620
And your book has a lot
to do with the railroad

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.280
and before the Communist
state, basically.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:01.460
So, there's a whole different
psyche of the people who wanted

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.440
to come here post cultural
revolution.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.170
And I think that your book
probably is more about that group.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.880
So, what about that?

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.750
What about the before and
after immigrants that came

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.110
to the United States,
why they're here

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.380
and how their identity
is attached to that?

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.730
&gt;&gt; Peter Ho Davies: I
mean, there's no denying

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.360 position:56%
that there are different
historical circumstances of arrival.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.590
And certainly, when the first
Chinese came for the gold rush

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.180
and even to work on
the transcontinental,

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.340
they saw themselves as
sojournic [spelling] community.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.640
They would come.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.940
They would make their money.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.240
They would take it home.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.540
And that was one of the
sources of resentment, I think.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.670
One of the things held against
them by other new arrivals

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.430
in U.S. who came to settle.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:50.240 position:56%
So, that was one of the gaps between
them, I think, in various ways.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.760 position:56%
And yet, I think, one of the things
I thought about a lot in the context

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.410
of writing "The Fortunes"
and sort of looking at that,

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.990
100 to 150-year history of the
Chinese in America was to think

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.060
about how even later arrivals,
even though they arrived

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.700
for different reasons,
in flight from war,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.590
for flight from Communist
regime in many ways.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.150
Their reception is shaped by
those who come before them.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.280
Right? The stereotypes that
are attached to men who arrived

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.380
with cues attached to Chinese
who come in the 50s and 60s.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.940
So, there is still the way,
there is a kind of hangover.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:31.340
So, if the reasons, the rationale,
may be different for the immigrant.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:35.530
Their perception by the space
in which they enter is shaped

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.010
by those who come before them.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.310
There is almost a failure

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.920 position:56%
to understand those
distinctions, I think, in some ways.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.590
Of why it's such a great question.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.930
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: And that's an
interesting point, too.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.160
Because it's like who gets
to be seen as a settler.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.820
And as an adventurer or a pioneer?

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.490
And who gets to be seen as
the foreigner, the invader?

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.270
Right? I think that's
something that has been timely

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.130
across all of U.S. history.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.030
And there is a way
that, in particular,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.720
for many Asian, Asian-Americans.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.380
There's that stereotype of
being perpetually foreign.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.590
Even if you're fourth generation.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:13.960
And that says a lot about, I
think, how we're seen in the U.S.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.550
&gt;&gt; And what about within
the community?

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.270
Like, I'm Armenian and I'm
actually writing a book

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.290
about the Armenian
immigrant experience.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:25.390
There is a pre-Soviet
thing going on.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.080
And a post-Soviet thing going on.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.640
So, there's the people who were
here first that the real Armenians.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.940
Who were here first?

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.240
Now the post is like .

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.240
. . so for the same thing for
every ethnic group, really.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.180
So, there's an established
immigrant community.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.980
And then a new wave comes in.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.480
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: An access to language,
fluency, citizenship, money,

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.460
you know, all that
stuff comes in to play.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.870
&gt;&gt; So, how is that in your book,
because yours is more modern?

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:56.520
Like, your story is more modern?

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.180
How did you approach that part?

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.140
Did you approach that part of it
or did you want to incorporate?

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.870
&gt;&gt; Before you answer that.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:11.620
So, we don't have time for you
to answer this last question.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.920
Sorry.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.490
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: My family, my
characters are undocumented,

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.140
working class, very
recent immigrants.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.830
So, because of that and their
own access to citizenship status

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:24.670
and fluency, and money,
they are kind of located

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:29.130
within a certain community within
Chinese people in New York.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:31.100
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: All right guys.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:36.050
Thank you so much for coming out.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.350
I hope you learned something.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:38.650
&gt;&gt; Lisa Ko: Thank you.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.270
&gt;&gt; Mohamed Sheriff: Thank you
guys for giving us your time.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.930

of the Library of Congress.
