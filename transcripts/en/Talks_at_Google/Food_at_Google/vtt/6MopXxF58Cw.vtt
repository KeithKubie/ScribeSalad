PETE: So we're extremely
excited to welcome

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.690
our speaker today, Sophie Egan.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.670
Sophie grew up here
in the Seattle area,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.250
and she currently works at the
Culinary Institute of America

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.010
as the Director of Programs
and Culinary Nutrition

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.000
for the Strategic
Initiatives Group.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.380
She graduated from
Stanford where

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.220
she studied math and history and
competed on a triathlon team.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.560
She completed her master's
in public health at Berkeley.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.170
Since then, she's been writing
for "Sunset" magazine, "Wired"

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.320
magazine, and "The New
York Times'" "Well Blog."

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm personally excited because
I found her book fascinating.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.390
It was full of things that
were relevant, interesting,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.980
and that I hadn't heard before.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.410
And I had problems putting
it down the same way

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.750
I have problems putting down
a science fiction novel.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.770
So let's welcome Sophie.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.850
SOPHIE EGAN: Thank
you so much, Pete.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.960
Can you hear me?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.126
Can you hear me in the back?

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:49.730
Yes.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.730
Thank you so much, Pete.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.610
That's a terrific
introduction, and certainly

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.524
the highest praise
I could hear is

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:56.940
to be compared to
science fiction.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.110
I also-- with the
title of the book--

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.040
hoped that with all of the fan
fiction around vampire books,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.090
maybe someone would accidentally
buy my book thinking that it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.790
was about vampire romance.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.210
So in any case, I'm
really excited to be here

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.220
at Google and just
back in Seattle.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.160
As Pete mentioned,
I'm a Seattle native.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.870
I swear this place gets
more spectacularly beautiful

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.930
every time I come home.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.843
And I'm really
thrilled to take you

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:25.700
on a little journey
today, a journey

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.220
into the American food psyche.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.180
So as we know, the
United States is home

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.450
to innovations of all kinds.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.310
I mean, we're sitting
at Google, right?

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.000
We invented the polio
vaccine, the iPhone,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.619
and the Doritos Locos taco.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.160
For those of you
who don't know, this

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.035
was actually one of the
bestselling fast food

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:49.030
items of all time.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.530
We collectively as Americans
ate 100 million of them

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.600
in 10 weeks.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.840
It took McDonald's 10 years to
reach that number with the Big

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.140
Mac.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.540
And we sustained that pace
at about a million per day

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.620
through the first year.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.400
And so all of the R&amp;D that
took place down at Taco Bell,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.170
three times the length of
the normal new food product,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.177
really paid off.

00:02:12.177 --> 00:02:14.760
I actually had the pleasure of
visiting Taco Bell headquarters

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.426
and met with some of
the food scientists

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:21.276
behind this offspring of
Frito Lay and Taco Bell.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:26.060
In the US, we are also known
for our pioneering spirit.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.390
It's things like
this that encourage

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.750
us to defy the odds of the
human capacity for engineering,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.000
whether it's the Golden Gate
Bridge in my home of San

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.340
Francisco, the space
shuttle, and the Snackadium.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.150
For those of you who
have not participated

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.570
in the annual
tradition, this is where

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.110
you make a giant structure out
of your Super Bowl party food.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.780
Usually that's filled with
guacamole or pigs in a blanket

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.390
or whatever your favorite
Super Bowl party items are.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.870
In all seriousness,
though, I wrote this book

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.150
because I was really
driven by this question.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
What unites us as
eaters in America?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.800
We are known for our diversity,
and without question, that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.800
is one of our greatest
strengths as a country.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.000
But it also can leave
us feeling like we're

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.410
so divided that nothing
could be said about us

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.690
as a country as a whole.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.440
We're also very open-minded--
again, one of, I think,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.890
our greatest strengths.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.370
But it means that our food
culture is constantly changing.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.359
It's a very unstable
set of norms

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.400
that are very different
from other cultures where

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.110
maybe the same types of
traditions and ways of eating

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.574
and recipes are passed down
from one generation to another.

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:44.740
So in the midst of all that,
though, as I mentioned,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.360
I wanted to find
out what unites us

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.370
and what can be said about
American food culture.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.680
So this book really
holds a mirror up

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.390
to our daily behaviors.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.840
In talking with
Pete a little bit,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.550
I have the sense that that
certainly came true for him.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.260
And it really asks us to pull
the lens back and see the ways

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.200
that food is a really powerful
mirror for who we are on a much

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.930
deeper level as Americans.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.720
Throughout my research, I found
that three core values thread

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.370
across our history as a people
and today shape our food

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.690
habits in ways that
are pretty stunning.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.920
These three values are
work, freedom, and progress.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.860
And they're so deeply
ingrained in our psyche,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.890
as I describe, that
sometimes we don't even

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.950
realize how powerful
they are, how much they

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.970
affect our daily
relationships to food.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.960
They are things, though,
that are very much part

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.480
of how we're trained in school.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320
And if you're like me, some of
the stuff is kind of abstract,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.330
feels a little fuzzy
without any examples.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.600
So we'll dive right in.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.570
So with work, for
example, today in the US

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.450
we are taking less vacation
than at any point in the last 40

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.100
years.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.310
We are outworking
even ourselves.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.560
And that's saying a
lot because our work

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.060
ethic is a huge part
of our national brand

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.040
around the globe.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.370
Today we work about
200 more hours per year

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.780
compared about a generation ago.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.800
And all of that
time spent working

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.590
has led to bringing a lot
of food into the workplace.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.910
Google, I would, say is
one of the best places

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.560
to be eating at the workplace,
but not everyone is so lucky.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.900
And many of us have
been victim of what's

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.324
been called sad desk lunch.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.740
Raise your hand if you've been
a victim of sad desk lunch.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.727
How about sad desk breakfast?

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:32.010
Yes.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.250
You know where you're
hunched over the keyboard.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.460
You're kind of spewing
crumbs all over the place.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.530
But our premium on
productivity, this

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.930
is such a huge part
of our self-worth.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.060
It leaves us very
much feeling like we

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.740
have to eke out every bit of
efficiency throughout the day.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.700
And it's very normal.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.800
Everyone around you kind
of does it, so why not?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.290
And the other way that
our working all the time

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.970
affects our food choices is,
it doesn't leave a lot of time

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.420
for other things.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.430
Namely, we eat on the run.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.570
"Gobble, gulp,
and go"-- this was

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.700
proposed by a European
traveler in the 1800s.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.580
This person was observing
Americans and said,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.750
hey, you know, wow, you guys
really just-- food is fuel.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.180
You get on with it and
onto whatever else you've

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.720
got to do in your busy day.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.660
And today, this is
more true than ever.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.340
We, actually, as
Americans not only spend

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.160
the least amount of time of
any of the major developed

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.970
countries cooking food, we spend
the least time eating food.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.090
So "gobble, gulp,
and go" is certainly

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.110
an apt name or characterization
of our food culture today.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.940
We also snack more than
we ever did before.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.130
There used to be
times where you ate

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.960
and times where you
didn't eat and places

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.940
that you ate and places
that you didn't eat.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.830
And I don't know if any of you
have observed this as well,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.400
but today all the
lines are blurred.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.350
I recently saw a
woman in DSW-- that's

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.370
the shoe store--
with a hand submerged

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.810
in a bag of snap pea crisps.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.090
That was a new one for me.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.250
But today, we're eating--
most of us, about 90% of us--

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.300
will eat multiple
snacks per day.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.810
And a lot of us have
the idea that, oh,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.920
it's this mentality
that's been spread,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.315
that it's healthier because
you kind of maintain

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.100
an even metabolism.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.090
And that's great in principle,
but only about 7% of people

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.690
who snack eat snacks
instead of meals.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.010
In reality, we're adding
it to everything else

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.850
we would normally eat anyway.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.330
And as a country, we're
eating about 400 more calories

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.580
then about a generation ago.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.830
So it's a little bit of
intention versus action.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.400
Protein is at the heart
of so many of our snacks.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.940
Lunchables, many of you probably
have seen Lunchables or eaten

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.170
Lunchables as a kid.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.300
These have now been rebranded
as portable protein pack.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.530
You can learn more at
proteinproteinprotein.com.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.590
I'm not making that up.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.460
All kinds of products
are adding protein.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.140
Cheerios now has protein.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.010
I recently saw protein water.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.840
And it very much has to do
with this mindset of producing,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.272
deliver deliverables,
and protein

00:08:15.272 --> 00:08:16.730
is the fuel that's
going to get you

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.570
through everything on your
super, crazy, hectic, long list

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.160
of to-do items.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.240
It's the macronutrient du jour.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.370
And they're packing protein
into every bar imaginable, which

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.222
is a little silly in
reality because almost

00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:32.555
no one in the United States
fails to get enough protein.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.039
Freedom is the second
core value that

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.650
really shapes our food choices.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.940
In the United States, we may
not realize how unusual this is,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.060
but we have an
independence-oriented society

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.880
as opposed to an
interdependence-oriented

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.750
society.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.420
I, Sophie, look at how
distinct, and unique,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.490
and separate I am from others
around me, as opposed to sort

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.140
of part of a larger collective.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.790
And what that results in is
all kind of interesting things

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.270
for our food habits.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.660
I feel it is my
birthright as an American

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.240
to eat when I want,
how fast I want,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.890
with or not with
whomever I want.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.330
And when you walk up to
the Starbucks counter,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.780
you are actually
joyously, intentionally

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.310
deviating from a prescribed box.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.400
It's that meaningful.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.940
It really is.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.331
Anyone know what
this number means?

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.997
AUDIENCE: The different
number of drinks

00:09:30.997 --> 00:09:32.080
you can get at Starbucks?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.580
SOPHIE EGAN: It is.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.420
It's also the
population of Kirkland.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.180
Fun coincidence.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.560
So yes, it is really a bold
statement about your identity,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.501
that you are not
going to be getting

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.750
the same thing as the person
next to you in that line.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.166
We have the same
kind of feeling--

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:51.890
I don't know how many of you
have had this yourselves where

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.155
if you order off the
menu, right, it's like, oh

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:56.180
that was like made just for me.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.810
And that's, again,
very different from

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.790
if you're sharing from, perhaps,
a large stew or something

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.070
that is much more communal
around a table that

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.750
happens in other cultures.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.910
So customization
and personalizing

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:13.260
our good experiences really
stems from this individualism.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.780
We also share an affinity
for the Burger King

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.100
slogan, "Have it your way."

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.270
This is credited
sometimes with sort

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.020
of setting off the marketing
around a lot of this.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.180
But in reality today, fast
casual chains and customize,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.730
build your own assembly
line models like Chipotle

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.920
actually enable this
having it your way in ways

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.910
that never actually
happened at Burger King.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.670
But we definitely-- that
message resonates with us.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.890
We also, as I mentioned,
eat alone a lot

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.210
as a result of this.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.670
See this guy?

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.350
This would never happen today.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.270
This photo is
clearly pre-iPhones.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.330
This is taken from 2000.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.800
Because this is eating alone
today, with your iPhone, right?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.870
You maybe check in.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.946
You take a picture of
yourself or someone

00:11:01.946 --> 00:11:03.820
else comments on what
they would have ordered

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.195
and what they're
currently eating

00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:07.140
at the time, and all
sorts of other things.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.740
Technology in a
fascinating way has really

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.440
enabled more alone eating
because you feel less alone.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.190
40% of smartphone users actually
like eating by themselves

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.580
because it feels like a way
to catch up on social media

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.040
or read something.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.860
So it's this fascinating
combination, I think,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.990
of an ingrained, sort of a
long held value as Americans

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.710
with this new technology.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.880
The last one is progress.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.280
And we rightfully
are very proud of

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.690
our scientific breakthroughs.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.100
Science and the
pursuit in general

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.490
of innovation or our
entrepreneurial spirit

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.350
is, again, one of our
greatest strengths.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.550
But it affects our eating
in some strange ways.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.860
Mainly, we are very
nutrient-centered when

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.050
we look at foods.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.980
We look for the
label on a package

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.899
to sort of signify
that it's safe.

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:01.690
You can plow ahead.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.850
Or oh, this means it's
bad, therefore banish it

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.120
at all costs.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.140
It also leads to all
kinds of weird fad diets.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.400
So we jump on these latest
bandwagons with great whimsy.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.440
And we'll see a news headline
that really often misinterprets

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.900
the science that is
actually very rigorous, very

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:25.140
slow, may have results that
are something as unexciting

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.810
as we need more info.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.090
But it's a lot less attention
grabbing to have a study

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:37.150
or to have a headline
about a study that says--

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.870
or, sorry, it's more
attention-grabbing to have

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.370
a headline with a study
saying new research says,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.440
you know, broccoli
leads to blindness

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.870
as opposed to new study says
broccoli is still good for you.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.240
That's not going to
get news attention.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.050
So there's this reliance
on processed foods and food

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.340
labels, also the sort of
susceptibility to a lot

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.010
of the different fad
diets that are peddled.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.510
And it's a humongous industry.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.790
Lastly, this pride in
progress leads to all kinds

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.220
of novelty seeking.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.850
So this quote from Vanessa Wong.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.569
"You may never thought you
wanted a blank flavored chip.

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:15.110
But Pringles is
betting you're either

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.876
curious enough or powerless
enough to give it a try."

00:13:18.876 --> 00:13:20.625
Anyone want to guess
what that flavor was?

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.780
Hot diggity dog.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.750
A hot dog flavored chip.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.590
These are what I describe
in the book as stunt food.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.610
This is the retail equivalent.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.450
And these are absolutely
powerful marketing strategies.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.130
They often play on
the limited time

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.750
only, creating a false sense
of scarcity in the market.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.220
You know, hurry in
now or your life

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.095
is ruined because you
didn't get the shamrock

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:46.650
shake in time or McRib.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.470
Or Doritos Locos
tacos, as I mentioned,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.230
are another great example.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.680
So this is an incredibly
powerful food environment

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.850
that we're often swayed by.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.370
It leads us very-- it means
it's a lot easier said

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.560
than done to just rely
on the commonsense notion

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.970
of everything in moderation.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:15.290
So amidst this often daunting
food environment, the food

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.770
landscape, my hope is
really to empower readers

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.930
to gain a bird's eye
perspective on themselves

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.930
within this environment
and to start to call out

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.480
some of these marketing tactics
for what I feel they really

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.760
are, which is stunts.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.460
And also to start
to take more control

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.790
over our eating habits, our
daily relationships to food.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.510
And with that, I
hope that you'll

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.440
be left feeling more in the
driver's seat of your food

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.720
choices.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.900
Hopefully, though, not actually
consuming those food choices

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.051
while in the driver's seat.

00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:50.550
That's it.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.299
Thank you so much.

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.510
PETE: So what we're
going to do now

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.760
is a bit of moderated session.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.430
I've prepared some
questions for Sophie,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.380
which I'll go ahead and ask,
and she'll give us some answers.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.755
And we'll leave
time for Googlers

00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:03.010
to have questions at the end.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.170
So we set up a mic over there.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.086
And as soon as it's time,
I'll let y'all know.

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:07.340
Sound good?

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.860
So Sophie, you said
that our American values

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.850
that you chose to highlight are
work, freedom, and progress.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.184
How do those affect what we eat?

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:16.099
SOPHIE EGAN: They aren't
things that have just

00:15:16.099 --> 00:15:17.627
appeared all of a sudden.

00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:19.710
And a lot of things have
appeared all of a sudden.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.060
But they're traits that go back
to our founding as a country.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.460
And what I was aiming
to do with this book

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.010
was get us out of the mindset
of A, blaming individuals,

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.500
like you're lazy or you
don't have enough willpower

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.020
to resist, and really to get
us to look at root causes.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.230
In the public health world, this
is considered looking upstream.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.880
And it's saying,
well, what is actually

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.840
driving these food choices?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.490
Not just individually, but the
powerful physical environments

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.650
of marketing but also
culturally-- what is normal?

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.470
What is being reinforced
to you on a daily basis

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.090
as something people do?

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:03.230
Because what's socially normal
and acceptable is often-- we

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.870
both shape it and
are shaped by it.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:11.390
So these three-- work,
freedom, and progress--

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.040
we're continually
exhibiting them to others

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.900
and continually watching
others do those things as well.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.099
Again, though, it's often
on a subconscious level.

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:21.765
PETE: So tell us a
little bit about what

00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:22.910
you call fast casual.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.990
There's a chapter
on it in the book.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.490
Could you tell us
what that's about?

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.520
SOPHIE EGAN: Sure,
so fast casual,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.940
I explain it as-- in the
story of the three bears,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.820
it's like the just right.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.150
You have fine dining
on one end, and you

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.870
have fast food on another
end, and fast casual

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.900
is essentially an in-between.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.140
It's a higher level of quality
or at least higher perception

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.980
of quality.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.960
Some of the most prominent
brands are Panera.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.310
Chipotle, certainly,
has led the trend.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:00.450
And there's been countless new
companies or new food brands

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.069
that call themselves like
Chipotle of whatever type

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.849
of cuisine.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.220
So we now have pizzas
where you build your own.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.109
You have endless noodle bowls
and other kinds of grain bowls.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.780
And the whole point
being that it's

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.800
about the same amount
of time that you

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.880
would hope to get fast
food, grab and go,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.710
but the sourcing is usually
more ethically-- something

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.619
you can feel a little
bit better about.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.183
The core is much more appealing.

00:17:26.183 --> 00:17:28.349
Usually people actually
will eat it there instead of

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.250
take it to go.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.800
And it almost always
relies on what

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.810
I call the book "cheffing,"
which is what one Consumer

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.860
Insights researcher
actually refers

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.090
to when you're kind
of pointing at what

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.500
you want on the counter.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.530
And it feels like you're
really participating

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.250
in the making of the food.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.490
That goes a really long way
in how fresh and how valuable

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.860
we feel-- or how
much value we think

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.654
we're getting in whatever
dish we're getting.

00:17:56.654 --> 00:17:58.820
PETE: So if we're so time
stressed that we're always

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.903
eating at our desk, how
come so many people go out

00:18:00.903 --> 00:18:02.480
for brunch on Sunday?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.940
SOPHIE EGAN: Yeah, I
found this fascinating.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.304
Who in the audience
is a brunch goer?

00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:08.804
Anyone?

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:09.304
Brunch?

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:09.860
Brunch?

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.360
Sorta.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.290
Maybe brunch maker?

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.800
No.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.311
OK.

00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:14.810
So I just thought
it was interesting

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.440
that during the week we
go to extreme lengths

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.230
to minimize the amount of time
spent obtaining, preparing,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.740
and consuming food, to the
point where we will actually

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.690
buy a microwaveable meal that
takes four minutes to microwave

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.450
instead of five minutes.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.760
There's endless
delivery apps, right?

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.900
But on the weekend,
it's really the time

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.230
we put the pause button on.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.800
And so many things
happen at brunch

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.440
that are different from
our normal weekday rhythms.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.544
You're more likely
to cook yourself.

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.210
Actually among the
most searched recipes

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.360
online are
breakfast-type of foods.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.300
You likely aren't
watching the clock.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.240
So we kind of-- it's all
about the pursuit of the meal,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.860
not getting through the
meal and onto whatever

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.460
else you need to do.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.610
It's also one of the more
social meals that we have.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:12.350
In the United States, actually
a lot of the social scientists

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.060
are finding that social
isolation in the US

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.500
has increased dramatically.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.070
People report feeling that they
have fewer close ties than they

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.480
did about a year ago.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.230
And so we're sort of
socially starving.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.470
And I consider brunch a sign
of this like silent rebellion,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.240
a kind of grabbing onto
something that is felt

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.820
as kind of a dying concept.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.170
I mean, the dinner party
doesn't happen nearly as much

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.240
as it used to.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.260
A lot of times I think it's
because the last minute bail

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:50.450
text, and that often also was
that very communal experience

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.920
of making and eating food
with other people, which

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.310
seems so simple.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.440
But these concepts of
[INAUDIBLE] or conviviality,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.730
as they're called,
they're dying.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.900
So I feel like brunch
and all the things that

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.680
go with it are the antidote.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.740
And they're very
much a sign of how

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:17.960
deprived we feel of these
more slow and social and real

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.410
food experiences.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.830
PETE: So what recommendations do
have for Americans as a whole?

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:29.400
SOPHIE EGAN: Well, on
the individual level,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.010
my hope is that people
can start to find

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.210
what works for
them to bring more

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.180
real food into their lives.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.680
I don't think that
everybody's going

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.120
to start-- I'm not
suggesting that we

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.840
go back in time and everybody
make all of their food.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.660
We're specialized.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.560
That is the nature
of our economy.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.720
But I think there
are opportunities

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.610
for people to have
more practice,

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.340
gain more culinary competence.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.012
You know, in the kitchen, play
around with different foods.

00:20:56.012 --> 00:20:57.970
What happens to them at
different temperatures?

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.420
What flavors go together?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.610
Food literacy is a term
that I describe in the book

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.616
that I feel many
of us are lacking.

00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:08.490
So find what works for
you to just bring that

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.310
into your routines on
a more regular basis.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.550
I've seen some great
examples like #mealprepsunday

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.020
is a hashtag on
Instagram that has

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.190
got all kinds of great
ideas, you know, jar salads.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.010
And you make them on
Sunday, and then you

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.321
have your lunches for the week.

00:21:24.321 --> 00:21:25.820
Sunday is the time
that people don't

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.120
feel as strapped for time.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.006
So it's more likely that
you'll eat your homemade meal

00:21:30.006 --> 00:21:31.630
on Wednesday if you've
already made it.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.770
A lunch bunch is this
great idea I saw.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.550
Actually there was a campaign
called Not Sad Desk Lunch

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.330
that Food 52 ran.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.110
And a lunch bunch was
this idea that you

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.000
and-- again, Googlers
maybe wouldn't

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.420
need to do this as much,
but others certainly-- you

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.930
find four friends or coworkers.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.290
And you rotate
cooking for other.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.130
So you only have to
cook one day a week.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.190
But that means five lunches
that were made with love

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.930
and they're homemade.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.040
Ideally, you'd then maybe
eat them together and kind of

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.640
have the strength in
numbers of saying we're

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.750
taking a real lunch break.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.000
On the, I would say,
institutional level,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.080
I would love for us to start
to ask employers to make it

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.000
more of a cultural
norm, just the simple--

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.250
the break that used to happen.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.880
It actually does really
boost productivity.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.360
And also though, seeing this
in the context of not just

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:38.110
workplaces but schools, I don't
know if this happened to you,

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.770
any of you growing up, but
kids get about 10 minutes

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.370
to scarf down a hot dog.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.167
I don't understand how
we can have them trained

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:46.750
in that kind of
environment and go out

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.775
into the world with the
sense, oh, food matters.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.590
It's mixed messaging.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.700
So I would love to see
institutions like schools

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.850
as well start to
carve out more time

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.970
and place a greater
cultural emphasis on food.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.600
PETE: Cool.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.100
Thanks.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.220
So what about us Googlers?

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.240
We've got access to
free food all day long.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.132
What do you recommend for us?

00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:11.590
SOPHIE EGAN: Well, the great
thing about working at Google,

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.006
I would say, in
terms of the food,

00:23:13.006 --> 00:23:15.190
is it's very, very high quality.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.470
And the people making
the food are exceptional.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.710
I mean that not only in
terms of the quality,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.120
and I should say,
full disclosure, I

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.260
work with many Google
food folks-- I don't know

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.640
if you know but Google
food actually follows

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.650
the menus of change principles
of healthy, sustainable menus,

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.960
which I am the director
of that initiative.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.345
And that's with the Culinary
Institute of American

00:23:39.345 --> 00:23:42.370
and Harvard School
of Public Health.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.540
So in any case, there is just
a tremendous amount of thought

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.550
that goes into the
food at Google.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:51.740
This is my way of saying
most of the things in here

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.390
have been curated
and prepared in ways

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.470
that are not the same as
everywhere else in the world.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.780
Here, however, because
it is abundant and free,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.530
it does create all kinds
of interesting habits.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.920
We've heard of the
so-called Google 15.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.180
Hopefully none of you
have succumbed to that.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.160
Or you realize that
the food is still

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.270
going to be there tomorrow.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.310
But it's very powerful.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.960
I completely get it.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.790
But there is also a
good number of folks

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.190
producing the food at
Google who are actually

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.190
behavioral economists.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.830
I was getting into
the micro kitchen,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.610
seeing some examples
where just to encourage

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.750
more mindful eating.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.780
So that if you are
eating your three cookies

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.120
that no one I will
say in here ate,

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.750
if you are eating
those cookies, you're

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.565
doing so because
you're like, you

00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:46.010
know, I really
want three cookies,

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.540
not that you went through
the day and all of a sudden

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.130
couldn't even recount what you
kind of mindlessly grazed on.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.200
So if it's a treat,
really enjoy it.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.892
Take a moment.

00:24:56.892 --> 00:24:57.600
Maybe go outside.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.912
Stare at the gorgeous view.

00:24:58.912 --> 00:25:00.370
Think about the
flavor, whatever it

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.320
is that's going to make it more
of an intentional, purposeful

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.020
food experience.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.770
And they're also doing
all kinds of things

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:13.780
to encourage you to make
healthy choices, the old fruit

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.010
basket with the fruit out
and beautiful display.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.730
That actually is really
effective in getting people

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.050
to grab more fresh
fruits and vegetables.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.100
So I would say know that
you're in good hands.

00:25:26.777 --> 00:25:28.610
Know that there's a lot
of thought behind it

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:34.900
and it's not that you should
feel guilty for enjoying it,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.320
but also that it should
be done with thought.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.050
And I think the reason that
I hone in on sad desk lunch

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:49.550
is I think that's the ultimate
example of mindless eating.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.610
And again, many
of us do it, but I

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.500
don't think it's the kinds
of ways of incorporating food

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.640
into our daily lives that feel
good or are very good for us.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.390
PETE: So is there
anything we as a company

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.492
can do to help others?

00:26:05.492 --> 00:26:07.450
SOPHIE EGAN: Well, yeah,
so one of the greatest

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.890
things I've seen at Google
is the teaching kitchens.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:15.930
So have any of you taken
classes at the kitchen sink?

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.080
Awesome.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.760
So I love that this
can happen, and I

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.650
would love to see Google
share the positive results

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.160
to the employees
with other employers.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160
Imagine not only at
Google, but let's

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.580
say you're an hourly worker
or low income workers,

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.950
if they could come home
with a meal prepared

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.930
for their family that
day or just learn

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:41.210
skills, whether it's for
grocery shopping or for cooking,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.530
to sort of replicate
this type of model

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.000
where the employer
can-- Google, I think,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.050
has a philosophy that employees
are the bridge to families.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.545
And so if all the Googlers
have a lot of culinary literacy

00:27:00.545 --> 00:27:03.007
and are very skilled
at cooking, then they

00:27:03.007 --> 00:27:04.840
can share that not only
with their families,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.673
perhaps with their
neighbors at the pot luck

00:27:06.673 --> 00:27:09.940
and so on, and not
only, as I mentioned,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.630
to try to get as
the larger culture

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:17.350
greater importance
on food but also

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.740
just that you can
sort of be ambassadors

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.420
for the skills
that you've gained

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:28.090
or for the ways that it's
maybe empowering you to make

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.180
more of your own meals
at home when you're not

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.849
inside of Google.

00:27:31.849 --> 00:27:33.390
PETE: So next, you
recommend learning

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.590
to cook ourselves more.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.285
And we have the teaching kitchen
called Kitchen Sink, which

00:27:37.285 --> 00:27:38.410
we were just talking about.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.470
We also have a big
mindfulness program.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.050
In fact, they even combined
the two with a mindful cooking

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.110
class.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.660
We put soda behind the frosted
glass on the lower shelf.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.360
We hide the candy inside things.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.332
You have to find the
candy to know where it is.

00:27:50.332 --> 00:27:51.790
Is there something
else the company

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.040
could do to help
employees have a better

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.998
relationship with food?

00:27:53.998 --> 00:27:55.730
Or is that enough?

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.080
SOPHIE EGAN: It's certainly
more than other employers.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.090
Not all, but Google
is absolutely

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.495
a leader in that realm.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.710
I think that the main area that
some companies are starting

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.470
to go in, I don't know the ins
and outs of Google's sourcing,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:18.440
but is starting to use their
purchasing power in communities

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:25.650
to support the food grown in the
ways that matches their value.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.720
So because Google feeds a
lot of people-- the same way

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.490
that a college or a university
or a hospital, these

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.740
are called high volume
food service settings--

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.630
they actually have tremendous
power on their growers.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.490
And they can actually
work with whomever is

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.120
supplying the different foods.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.440
They can select vendors that
have really high standards,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.160
whether that's organic or
it's local or it's meat that's

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.630
raised without antibiotics
or whatever it might be.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.880
But if their vendors aren't
exhibiting those practices

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.450
and they think
that in other ways

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.380
they're doing things
right, they can actually

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.400
give that feedback to them,
work together collaboratively,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.890
to raise the bar for
their land management

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.860
practices, their water
usage, all of those things.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.900
So I think that that's
not as much something

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.550
that necessarily employees
can do other than express

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.390
if that's of interest to you, if
you want to encourage your food

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.600
team to do that, I think that's
certainly a role that Google

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.590
can play-- this office can play
in the Pacific Northwest area,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.280
and so on with the
different offices

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.447
that it has all over the world.

00:29:39.447 --> 00:29:41.530
PETE: So I think I remember
you saying in the book

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.530
that diets don't work
because we end up always

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.050
gaining all the weight back.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.050
So if diets don't work,
what's a good approach?

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.740
None at all?

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.460
SOPHIE EGAN: This is
such a tricky issue.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.565
And it was in the news
quite a bit last week also.

00:29:53.565 --> 00:29:54.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.378
SOPHIE EGAN: Yeah,
you probably saw that.

00:29:56.378 --> 00:30:00.900
It's the "Biggest Loser," this
big study that corroborated

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.070
this data that I had cited.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.320
And, I mean, there have been
many, many, many examples

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.050
of this, where,
unfortunately, most diets,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.690
if they work in the
short term, they

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.120
don't work in the long term.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:20.330
And unfortunately, this
just absolutely shocked me,

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:25.460
having been on a diet is often
one of the greatest predictors

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.000
for future weight gain.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.340
And I find that
just incredibly sad

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.610
because obvious anyone
who's going on a diet

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.920
is trying to do the right thing.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.400
The main issue
with most diets is

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.470
that they throw you out of
whack with, as I mentioned,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.100
the everything in moderation.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.430
So if you're banishing
entire food groups,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.600
often a craving will
build over time,

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.170
and they find that a lot of
people who deprive themselves

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.920
of something for a
period of time, there's

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.800
like a way later
binging of that.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.530
It doesn't mean that every
single person or that no one

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.030
can sustain a diet
in the long term.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.810
It just means
generally speaking,

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.920
diets are extremely
difficult to sustain.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.920
So the advice that
I give in general,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.920
and I was very encouraged by
actually the latest dietary

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.910
guidelines-- the first time
ever, this is huge-- really

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.870
encourage people to develop
healthy eating patterns.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:27.300
That seems like,
hmm, kind of how

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.531
is that different
from the word diet?

00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:30.030
But it does.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:35.580
It means that instead of having
really strict rules on yourself

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.960
or there's a lot of shaming
with diets, like you strayed,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.350
therefore you must be punished.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:46.020
It's this idea more of just,
OK, throughout your lifetime,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.650
how can you develop routines?

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.720
It doesn't mean to the
same thing every day,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.230
but in general for breakfast,
you eat whole grains and nut

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.470
butters and yogurt.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.020
I don't know.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.360
Fresh fruit.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.330
You have sort of a group of
foods that collectively make up

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.970
a pattern that over your
life will basically give you

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.530
the best chance at not
just living long but living

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.020
a high quality of life.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:18.250
And so I think the more that we
get away from instant results,

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.080
and a lot of the diets
are about how quickly

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.240
they're going to work-- there's
these kind of guaranteed.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.710
Anything that
promises, guarantees,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.890
like instant results is probably
just in itself those things

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.060
are a red flag.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.960
It's very, very difficult,
but I feel like that the more

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.350
that you allow those occasional
kind of straying-- or again,

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.849
just the less rigid it is, the
easier it will be to follow.

00:32:45.849 --> 00:32:47.640
And I actually found
a really fascinating--

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.480
so the US News and World
Report produces a best diets

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.300
list every year.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:58.780
And last year paleo
diet, which, according

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.780
to our Google searches
is our most popular diet.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.990
I think most of us believe
our Google searches reveal

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.999
a lot about who we are.

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:06.290
That was the most popular diet.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.640
But it was ranked the
lowest of 35 diets

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.340
in terms of best
overall for your health.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.460
That's pretty shocking, right?

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.030
The biggest reason it
said, well, for one,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.280
it leads you to eat just
obscene amounts of meat.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.720
But secondly, they said that
it's very hard to adhere to.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.230
So again, that, I think, is
the biggest common thread

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:30.710
across different diets is
how frustrating it can be

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.995
and how difficult they
can be to maintain.

00:33:32.995 --> 00:33:34.620
PETE: In the book
you talk a little bit

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.674
about an experiential CV.

00:33:36.674 --> 00:33:38.840
Can you tell us a little
bit about that, what it is,

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.070
and how it applies to food?

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.819
SOPHIE EGAN: Sure.

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:43.271
Yeah, this was a
really fun finding.

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:47.400
It's this idea that the same
way that you might collect

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.620
seashells or shot glasses,
whatever you like to collect,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.700
we aim to collect
life experiences.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.920
So in the same way you kind of
accrue professional experiences

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.360
for your CV or
your resume, people

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.380
want to feel that they've
lived a full life.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.220
It's this bucket
list idea, right?

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.969
And it leads us to choose foods
like Doritos Locos tacos, stunt

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:14.440
foods, because it
feels like sort

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.790
of checking a box on
your list of like,

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.270
I have lived a full life.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:25.530
I ate a bacon sundae or
drank-- ate a bacon sundae.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.250
I had to think about
that for a second.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.889
And so you'll will
even choose things

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.400
that you think will
be less enjoyable

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.840
but that are more
memorable and distinct.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.489
So for example, they did a study
of people going on vacation

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.719
and found that they actually
would choose staying in an ice

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:51.050
hotel over like a really
warm, pleasant beach vacation

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.170
because you'd be able
to brag about it.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:57.840
It would feel probably
easier to recall compared

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.360
to other things you've
experienced in your life

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.170
unless you live in an ice hotel.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:09.380
And this affects this pension
we have for seeking out novelty

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.630
in our foods and collecting.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.340
And actually,
interestingly, Taco Bell,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.170
in marketing the Doritos Locos
taco, really played to that.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.120
They must have seen
the same research.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.260
Because the timeline
was "Live Mas."

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.430
And it was this idea of we've
got the way with the DLT

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.440
for you to live mas.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.910
So they're offering the
solutions to something that,

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.800
again, probably subconsciously,
but most of us--

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.816
I certainly want to
live a full life.

00:35:41.816 --> 00:35:45.890
So Doritos Locos tacos for all.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.260
PETE: So a number of years
ago, I got "Muscle &amp; Fitness"

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.800
magazine, and they
said you can only

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.510
absorb like 20 grams
of protein per meal.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.060
So the recommendation
was that you

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.420
have five or six small meals
or really big snacks instead

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.610
of like three big meals.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.110
Is that a good
idea or a bad idea?

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.700
SOPHIE EGAN: So
I certainly would

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.650
steer clear of giving specific
dietary advice to anyone.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.120
And I'm actually
not a nutritionist.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.570
But I can say that
our behavior shows

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:24.640
that it's not really working
as it maybe is intended to.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.370
Because the snack is defined as
something to supplement a meal.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.360
And most likely it's
complementing the meals,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.650
as I mentioned.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.810
I think it certainly
can maintain a higher

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.290
energy for some people compared
to, say, like the quote,

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.340
unquote like "gut bomb."

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.770
You skip breakfast and
then you eat a giant lunch.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.850
So there's probably definitely
some at least anecdotal

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:53.960
illustrations of where
that's a better approach.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.390
But it's just the
difference-- in reality,

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.214
we're eating so much
more altogether.

00:36:59.214 --> 00:37:01.130
And the other thing is
a lot of these products

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.300
are very expensive.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.330
So you mentioned protein.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:08.782
A lot of the products, your
total budget might go up.

00:37:08.782 --> 00:37:10.240
Or you might feel
like, oh, I can't

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.630
buy as many fresh foods because
of my huge KIND Bar budget,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.680
just speaking personally.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.900
So no, I'm certainly
guilty of that myself.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:27.540
But I think we have this
mindset of-- for any athletes

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.456
out there, the term is bonking.

00:37:29.456 --> 00:37:30.955
Like, oh god, I
don't want to crash.

00:37:30.955 --> 00:37:32.850
I have to get through
all this stuff.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.750
And the beef jerky in my
purse or the Nature Valley bar

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:42.390
in the car console is
going to get me through.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.480
And I think we need to
calm down a little bit

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.640
about that side of things.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.040
And for people, if they feel
a lot better when they're

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.020
eating a few snacks
throughout the day,

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.570
I'm not going to tell people
specifically not to do that.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:01.250
But I would encourage
people to actually

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:06.777
be honest about-- are they
skipping meals altogether?

00:38:06.777 --> 00:38:08.360
And also the other
thing I want to add

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.080
is it's probably not
that much fun to be

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.050
eating on your own schedule.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.530
It sort of goes to the social
eating that I was describing.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.527
Because if you're
eating in your car

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.110
and at your desk and
all those things,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.410
maybe metabolically speaking
you're a little bit better off,

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.470
but your happiness might
suffer because you're not

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.830
eating with friends or family.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.840
And this might sound kind
of fuzzy, but it's real.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.344
Happiness is one
of the-- there's

00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:34.760
all these different happiness
researchers out there, which

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.790
sounds like a really fun job.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.670
But they have found that
actually social connectedness

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:44.480
is one of the single greatest
predictors of happiness.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.890
And I don't think I'm
overstating the importance

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.312
of social eating.

00:38:50.312 --> 00:38:52.520
PETE: So something that
happens to me-- it's probably

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.710
a little bit unique, but maybe
not as unique as I think--

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.310
is I'll come home
at night and my wife

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.550
has already fed the kids.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.050
Guess what?

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:58.810
You're on your own.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.670
Nothing's made for me.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.610
So I'm going to have to
make something for myself.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.520
So for people like me
who end up coming home

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.228
and have to make
something for themselves

00:39:05.228 --> 00:39:08.270
and don't know ahead of time,
so they can't like run out

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:09.416
and grab something fresh?

00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:10.540
Do you have any good ideas?

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.380
I've been doing like
pasta and sandwiches,

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.380
but I've been doing so
many pasta and sandwiches

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.580
that I'm ready for other ideas.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.210
SOPHIE EGAN: Yeah, definitely.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.770
AUDIENCE: Sad home dinner.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.591
PETE: Exactly.

00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:19.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.419
SOPHIE EGAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:20.419 --> 00:39:21.460
I know, that's a new one.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.630
PETE: It's not that sad
because I can sit with my iPad

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.796
and connect with my friends.

00:39:24.796 --> 00:39:25.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:28.210
AUDIENCE: Sad home dinner.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.954
SOPHIE EGAN: He's feeling
really connected to others.

00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:33.120
No, that's a great question.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.174
And this definitely-- I think
you're probably not alone.

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:37.590
One of the more
interesting things

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.589
that I found-- or more
surprising things I found

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:41.980
in the book-- was this
family dinner a la carte,

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.500
where even families who
are eating together,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.710
over half of families are
eating different things

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:51.820
from each other, different
dietary preference or very real

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.172
medical concerns.

00:39:54.172 --> 00:39:56.380
But it's sort of a short
order cook situation, right?

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.770
And it leads actually
to many families

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:03.440
eating more prepared foods,
cooking less, et cetera.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.410
As for your
particular situation,

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.320
I think there are things that
actually relate to the meal

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.550
prep Sunday idea.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.800
So you could make a bowl or
make a whole batch of quinoa

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.640
or farrow or any
kind of whole grain

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.441
like a wild rice or something,
a brown rice, on Sunday

00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:21.690
and make it in different ways.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:25.130
Maybe you make a wrap one
night or the next night

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.950
you just have it as a bowl.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.580
I also feel personally
like any number of meals

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.020
can be built around an avocado.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.980
So I just always keep avocados.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:40.920
Because I might make an avocado
toast with some kind of-- all

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.890
I have at home is
bread, cheese, avocado.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.579
And you add some sriracha.

00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:47.120
My husband really
likes the sriracha.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.070
Like, that's dinner.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.080
So keeping some of those
things like on hand

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.295
at the beginning of
the week, but then so

00:40:54.295 --> 00:40:55.670
that you don't
feel like, oh, I'm

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.810
eating the same thing
every day, having

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.137
some of those extra items
that you can build in

00:41:01.137 --> 00:41:01.970
in different layers.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.340
And I also would say
that like sriracha,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.960
having any number
of sauces and flavor

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.360
enhancers at home
that you really like,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.955
dijon mustard actually
goes a long way,

00:41:13.955 --> 00:41:15.830
can definitely help when
you don't feel like,

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.496
oh, I can rush out
to the grocery store.

00:41:17.496 --> 00:41:19.350
Or maybe you can't even
predict that you're

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:24.137
going to need to be eating
sad home dinner that night.

00:41:24.137 --> 00:41:24.720
PETE: Awesome.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.030
Thanks.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.030
That will help a lot.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.464
SOPHIE EGAN: I'm sure.

00:41:27.464 --> 00:41:30.130
PETE: So the next question, so I
think I showed you in the micro

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.380
kitchen beforehand how we have
those little candy jars like

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.350
with the rooster, and you
have to realize it's there,

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.850
and open it up, and reach
down to grab the little packet

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.530
of fun size M&amp;Ms. Is
that helping or hurting?

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:43.260
I mean, if we have a craving for
M&amp;Ms and we're just not getting

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.920
the M&amp;Ms that we need, is that
going to make us binge later?

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.628
SOPHIE EGAN: The M&amp;Ms
that you need, yes.

00:41:47.628 --> 00:41:50.990
You need those
M&amp;Ms. I don't know.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.020
I'm sure there are some
unintended consequences of some

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.580
of these little tricks.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.080
These come out of--
most of the work

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.172
is Brian Wansink, is this
really fascinating researcher

00:42:03.172 --> 00:42:04.630
at Cornell Food
and Brand Lab who's

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.963
come up with a lot of the
things like the frosted glass.

00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:10.215
Or if you put
something opaque, like

00:42:10.215 --> 00:42:13.510
you have to take that
extra step and, oh, hmm,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.225
how do I get into this thing?

00:42:15.225 --> 00:42:20.940
And take off the top, as opposed
to if it's just sitting out.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.650
From reading his
research, I haven't

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.410
seen him necessarily
describe in great detail

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.190
the kind of unintended
consequences

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.760
that you're wondering about.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.260
But I would say
psychologically it

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.740
sounds like there can be
some sort of built up,

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.080
like, I know that's in the jar.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.590
So if I were Google food, I
might mix up what's actually

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:50.720
in the jar so that you aren't
always wondering about the M&amp;Ms

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.220
that you need.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.070
Instead maybe one day, it's like
apples or it's fruit leather

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.490
or it's nuts.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:04.100
And instead of it being the
thing that you can't have,

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.052
sort of tempting
you or taunting you,

00:43:07.052 --> 00:43:09.260
if it were different things,
then you'd just be like,

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.110
oh it's the mystery box.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:13.140
Back to work.

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.515
That's not a very
helpful answer.

00:43:14.515 --> 00:43:17.080
Sorry.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.080
PETE: OK, so I think it's
time for us to open up

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:19.955
the mic for Googlers.

00:43:19.955 --> 00:43:21.380
So we have a mic
set up over here.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.175
So please make a line
and ask questions.

00:43:24.175 --> 00:43:26.190
AUDIENCE: We also have
Mike setting up the mic.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.640
SOPHIE EGAN: Mike
setting up the mic.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.440
AUDIENCE: In the
blurb for your talk,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.880
one of the things
that was mentioned

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.640
was gluten free,
which made me think

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.020
it seems to me that
there's been an explosion

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:47.160
over the last couple of decades
of people self-diagnosing food

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.880
restrictions.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.380
The gluten-free
thing is probably

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.540
the most extreme where there
is this actual condition called

00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:03.310
celiac disease, and people who
have it can't deal with gluten.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.810
But there's 10 or 100
times as many people

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:12.320
as have celiac disease that have
decided by themselves, largely,

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.590
without the aid of
medical professionals,

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.460
that they're gluten sensitive.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:23.302
And you see the same thing with
people deciding on their own

00:44:23.302 --> 00:44:26.450
they're lactose intolerant
or various other things.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.630
I wondered what you make
of this and why we seem

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.590
to be overwhelmed by this now.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:32.490
SOPHIE EGAN: Yeah.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.240
Thank you for the question.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.156
It's a great question.

00:44:34.156 --> 00:44:35.480
It comes up a lot.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.210
I actually have a
piece coming out

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.610
very soon about this very
topic because I've been asked

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.120
about it a number of times.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.040
There definitely is a lot
of self-diagnosis going on.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.030
The numbers, you're very close.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:52.675
It's about 1% of people have
celiac disease, very severe

00:44:52.675 --> 00:44:57.770
autoimmune condition that
damages the small intestine.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:02.340
About roughly 7%-- though
they really don't know--

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.200
appear to have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.080
Fully a third of Americans
are trying to avoid gluten.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.727
And that really speaks
to what you're saying,

00:45:12.727 --> 00:45:14.810
I think, in terms of this
getting really blown out

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:15.642
of proportion.

00:45:15.642 --> 00:45:17.100
The other concern
I have is that it

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:21.000
is miss-- it's kind of
like misappropriating

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.279
the real cause of gluten free.

00:45:23.279 --> 00:45:24.820
Because the real
cause of gluten free

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:26.270
is that this is a real sickness.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.250
And most people now
in the wake of a lot

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:31.940
of these different diet
books and the whole segment

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.990
of the grocery store
that's been opened up,

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.750
it's become about weight loss.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.760
And if I eat gluten
free, then I won't

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.960
have these stomach problems.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.250
And I'll lose
weight, and I'll have

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.041
more energy and all of
the different things

00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:46.370
that are associated with that.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:49.890
There is not scientific
data to support the idea

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.280
that gluten-free diet
makes you lose weight.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.520
And the way that I
interpret what's going on

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.960
is a couple of things.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.630
First to the
self-diagnosis point,

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:05.600
I see a lot of that
with-- what does

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.700
really going on a
gluten-free diet mean to you?

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.366
If you are all of a sudden more
conscious in general of what

00:46:10.366 --> 00:46:12.240
you're eating because
you're checking labels,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.370
maybe you're slowing
down, maybe you're

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.950
checking the portion size
or things that you before

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.450
didn't give another thought
to-- there's definitely actually

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:25.020
some science that shows that
the people have better results

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.527
merely when they're paying
more attention to whatever

00:46:27.527 --> 00:46:28.610
it is that they're eating.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.590
Second is that if
going gluten free

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.560
means you're eating less
cookies and less chips

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.090
and you're drinking less
beer and you're also

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.840
eating healthier things,
then you probably

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.300
feel like a million bucks.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:43.450
And a lot of people do
report some of these results

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.146
and miss-attribute
it to the gluten.

00:46:46.146 --> 00:46:47.520
I'm not saying
all the people who

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.250
feel that way don't have
non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.890
But it's a real murky
area, particularly

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:59.130
with that one, the non-celiac
gluten sensitivity.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.000
Not that much is
known about it yet.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.990
And there isn't really
a way to test for it.

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.406
But I did find it
very interesting

00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:07.150
that Celiac Disease
Foundation actually

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.670
is pretty clear on their
website about this.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.530
They say do not self-diagnose.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.180
Please consult with
your doctor before going

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.310
on a gluten-free diet.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.890
And that seems to be a message
that's getting overlooked.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:23.940
A lot of people are OK, now
I'm gluten free for life

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.300
or whatever it is.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.820
And a lot of it also spreads
from one person to the next.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.480
I describe in the
book this phenomenon

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.700
that gluten free is not
the first example of this,

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:38.690
but there's this diet
evangelism, a kind of "join me"

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.570
mentality of whatever
it is that you're part.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:45.619
And it doesn't mean, again, that
some of the people genuinely

00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:46.910
really need to be on that diet.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.800
But for the proportion
of the population that's

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.990
paying attention to it,
it's just the latest example

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.670
what I describe also in
the book as selling absent.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.440
It's valuing foods
based on what they lack.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.580
And we saw this with fat free.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.050
And what happens, unfortunately,
is that all these products

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.830
get reformulated.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.600
And you have to replace
the gluten with something.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.090
So do you ever look
at the ingredient list

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:12.796
of a lot of
gluten-free products?

00:48:12.796 --> 00:48:13.670
They're excruciating.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.580
And they have all kinds of
potato starch and tapioca

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.140
powder and whatnot that are not
any better, and in some cases,

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.870
are actually worse than
the original product.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.870
And again, this
happened with fat free.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:28.210
So it really depends.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.230
I think people
have been surprised

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.280
how long this trend has lasted.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.730
Part of it is that
a lot is still

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.577
unknown about digestive health.

00:48:37.577 --> 00:48:39.910
Gut health in general is
becoming a much more mainstream

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.090
topic.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:46.740
Self-diagnosis and then
also just that more products

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.210
are available than ever before.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.620
And the market always
responds to these things.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.810
So we have to, I hope, keep
a little bit of a level

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:57.960
head for those of us--
I, personally, do not

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.379
have sensitivity to gluten, so
I think we need to keep a level

00:49:05.379 --> 00:49:06.420
head about a lot of this.

00:49:09.634 --> 00:49:10.300
PETE: Thank you.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.383
Do we have more questions?

00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:16.450
AUDIENCE: I have a couple
small comments and then

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.040
one larger question.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.037
SOPHIE EGAN: OK.

00:49:19.037 --> 00:49:21.120
AUDIENCE: So one comment
is you were talking about

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.050
with fast casual dining, this
idea of like you're picking out

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.900
your food.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.800
Have you heard of
the IKEA effect?

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.630
You mentioned behavioral
economics earlier,

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:30.330
and this is--

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.830
SOPHIE EGAN: No,
tell me about that.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.646
AUDIENCE: Well, so briefly, the
name just comes from the fact

00:49:34.646 --> 00:49:36.770
that when people assemble
their own IKEA furniture,

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.760
they tend to value
it more highly

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.917
than had they
purchased it premade.

00:49:40.917 --> 00:49:43.250
And this gets people around
the fact that generally it's

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.020
made of, you know,
MDF or particle board

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.320
or whatever else, right?

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.540
But they're still very proud
of their IKEA furniture.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.040
Similarly, my burrito
bowl at Chipotle,

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.545
I care about it more
because I have hand-selected

00:49:53.545 --> 00:49:54.800
each and every single bean.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.415
SOPHIE EGAN: You
were a participant.

00:49:55.415 --> 00:49:55.914
Exactly.

00:49:58.605 --> 00:50:00.230
AUDIENCE: The other
thing that I wanted

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.090
to comment on very quickly
was on the gluten-free stuff.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:06.142
I have a friend who has celiacs,
and he's commented both like

00:50:06.142 --> 00:50:07.350
on the pros and cons of this.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:08.250
He said, and one
thing that's great

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.300
is I can go to every restaurant
that my friends go to

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.420
and find something I could eat.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.836
He said, on the
other hand, no one

00:50:12.836 --> 00:50:14.460
thinks I have a disease anymore.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.085
They think I'm just
like a fad follower

00:50:16.085 --> 00:50:19.660
even though I've known I've
had celiacs for 15 years.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.500
So he said that was
also really frustrating.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.280
SOPHIE EGAN: That's
a great point.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.170
AUDIENCE: My bigger
comment and question

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.170
is one of the things you
talked about a lot with work

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.680
in particular was this
time crunch, that everyone

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.262
feels very rushed all the time.

00:50:33.262 --> 00:50:34.970
I think it's actually
interesting to note

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.761
that in the US, it's
not only that we spend

00:50:36.761 --> 00:50:39.450
200 more working hours per year
than we did 10 or 20 years ago.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:40.950
SOPHIE EGAN: About
a generation ago.

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:42.720
AUDIENCE: A generation ago.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.230
But that we actually do so far
more than any other country

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.030
in the entire first world.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.280
We just work way more,
and as you noted,

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.010
have to spend a lot
less time cooking

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.940
and eating than other first
world nations, similarly.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.720
Do you think that the
problem here is not

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.280
simply one that can just be
dealt with in food policy

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.450
but is simply a kind of
national epidemic of how

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:05.895
we view productivity and
work-life balance in general?

00:51:07.569 --> 00:51:09.860
SOPHIE EGAN: Thank you for
that comment and a question.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.580
I absolutely think it
is that larger picture.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.770
And I get into this a little
bit in the book about how

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:25.810
linked a lot of the policies are
in other progressive indicators

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:27.250
that really affect eating.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.809
So for example,
also in that list

00:51:28.809 --> 00:51:30.350
of all the major
developed countries,

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:35.240
we're the only one with
no paid maternity leave.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.650
And there's a whole bunch of
different social indicators

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.110
or social measures
where what I'm

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.160
seeing it's really interesting
is actually employers

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.100
are sort of-- I this is
not the point of the book,

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.950
but I'm seeing a
lot of different--

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.770
especially in like Silicon
Valley type companies,

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.520
where they're saying there
isn't a national policy of this,

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.402
so I'm going to give six
months of paternity leave.

00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:04.610
There's some companies in
Germany where they actually

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.600
shut off email after 6:00 PM.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.422
It just doesn't work.

00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:11.630
And they said, you know what?

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.445
As a country, we want
people to go home

00:52:15.445 --> 00:52:16.570
and be with their families.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:17.903
We want them to be well-rounded.

00:52:17.903 --> 00:52:20.200
I also am really
fascinated by have

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.360
we become less interesting?

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.840
Do people do less
hobbies because they--

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.850
it's sort of more
one-dimensional.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:34.210
We're so specialized and
so deep into the work.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.922
I'm like, well,
learn a language.

00:52:36.922 --> 00:52:38.380
I don't know, take
a ceramics class

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.920
or just play with your
kid or whatever it is,

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.750
sort of having more dimensions.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:46.280
I'm wondering how that--
I don't have the evidence.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.900
I don't know who's
studying that.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.380
Travel [? board ?]
or the leisure people

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.820
out there who--
magazines and things,

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.330
but that I definitely
think is very interesting.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:04.550
And I'm very intrigued
to see what levers

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:09.140
can be pulled because this is
not about individually you suck

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.800
because all you do is work.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:15.386
It's our individual choices
as not only with food

00:53:15.386 --> 00:53:16.510
but with how much you work.

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.939
I mean, I work all the time
because I feel I have to.

00:53:19.939 --> 00:53:21.230
I have these deadlines to meet.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.890
And I have these
things I have to do,

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:27.110
not because I love just
working all the time.

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:29.680
So I think that the only
way this is going to change

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.751
is when there are policies
that make it, again,

00:53:31.751 --> 00:53:34.000
the same way with food, that
make it not only socially

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.450
acceptable but socially normal
to sign off at a certain time

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:40.610
or to eat during the workday,
as I mentioned, carving out

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.850
that time for yourself, so
whatever those things might be.

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.760
And I'm staying tuned.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.260
PETE: Let's all give Sophie a
great welcome and a thank you.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.010
SOPHIE EGAN: Thank you, guys.
