00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.100
8) Lets talk about Lemmings

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.450
When you hear the word “lemmings” you
might think of two things:

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.280
This video game and some sort of small creature
that suicidally leap off cliffs when its population

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.280
grows too large.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.070
In case you didn’t know lemmings are real
and adorable and not suicidal.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.160
The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but
the video game lemmings may have done a lot

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060
more to convince a younger generation that
lemmings are willfully suicidal – and extremely

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.520
frustrating to micromanage thus deserving
of mass extermination.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.480
7) Daddly Longlegs

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.259
These wispy-looking things have earned the
reputation as the most poisonous of any spider.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.911
But they’re also pretty common so, you might
wonder why more people don’t die from daddy

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:35.520
longlegs bites every year.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.150
Like a good conspiracy theory, this myth,
covers its own tracks by also saying that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.530
their fangs are too small to penetrate human
skin.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430
You could score one for team human except
that this misconception is a triple whammy

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.430
of wrongness:

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.110
1) Daddy Longlegs don’t have fangs because

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600
2) They don’t produce venom because

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.329
3) They aren’t even spiders

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.010
6) Ostriches

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.180
Let’s review the properties of these flightless
birds, shall we?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.130
They’re up to nine feet tall, up to 340
pounds, aggressive, with sharp beaks and long

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.130
claws.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.940
Essentially an ostrich is the closest thing
to a living raptor you’re ever going to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.940
see.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.780
(That is our genetic engineering technology
gets better – common dinopocapolipse!).

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.110
Anyway, keeping these facts in mind, if you
decide to threaten an ostrich do you really

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.460
think it’s going to stick it’s head in
the sand and wait to die?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.070
No, of course not, if you’re lucky it will
run away at 40 miles an hour and if you’re

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.500
not, it’s fatality time for you.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.049
Ostriches have no reason to hide and especially
not in the stupidest way ever.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.140
If they did they would have survived about
as long and another species of flightless

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.140
bird.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.409
While we’re talking about flightless birds,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.560
5) Baby Birds

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.640
A mother bird won’t abandon her baby because
you’ve touched it any more than a human

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.090
mother would abandon her baby if a bird touched
it.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.340
If you find a baby bird and can easily reach
the nest, it’s perfectly fine to put it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.340
back.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.630
4) Goldfish Memory

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.009
Goldfish do have memories longer than three
seconds or seven seconds or whatever other

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.060
made up number always accompanies this fact.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.429
They can actually be trained and will remember
what they learned for months.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.090
Which is more than can be said for many humans.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.979
On an unrelated note, Goldfish are also delicious.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.240
3) Dog Vision

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.450
Poor dogs, forever living in their sad, monochrome
worlds.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.549
Except, they don’t.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.749
Dogs do see color, but not quite like us.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.919
Most humans see three primary colors, red
blue and green, but dogs are limited to two:

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.240
they can see blues, but the rest of the color
spectrum they can’t tell apart.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.149
Which they don’t mind, until you buy them
a red toy and throw it into the green grass

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.140
and act like they’re stupid for not finding
it.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
It’s easy for you to see because your ancestors
spent several million years foraging for red

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.791
objects on a green background and so got quite
good at it – unless they didn’t which

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.230
in that case they died – but canine eyes
are not monkey eyes and to your dog, if it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.769
isn’t blue it’s all the same color.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.290
So next time you’re at the pet store, get
rover a blue toy.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.360
And, while we’re talking about vision lets
talk about

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360
2) Bats

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.510
Which, if you’ve ever looked at one, it
should be immediately obvious they’re not

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.459
blind because they look right back and you
– with their eyes – that they use to see

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.459
things.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.060
But they do one better by having an additional
sense called echolocation that allows them

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.469
to navigate the world in complete darkness,
something you can’t do.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.090
So from the bat’s perspective you’re the
blind one.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.849
1) You Can Boil a Frog to Death if you do
it very slowly

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:47.849
This one is true…

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.849
sort of.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.920
Friedrich Goltz, demonstrated that a frog
will remain blithely in a pot of water brought

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.409
to boil if the temperature is raised slowly
enough.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.780
However, the rather salient fact that is often
left out of the retelling is that Goltz cut

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.530
out the frogs’ brains before placing them
in the pot.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.159
Which rather puts them at a disadvantage.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.530
Goltz also showed that if you don’t lobotomize
the frog first then – surprise – it jumps

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.530
out of the pot.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.140
It seems likely – but please don’t try
this at home – that removing the brain of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.260
any animal would rather hinder their instinct
of self preservation.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.599
And also make them more gullible about common
misconceptions.
