00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.490
For much of the early history of photography
smiling in photographs was almost unheard

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.340
of for various reasons.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.450
(See: When Did People Start Smiling in Photographs?)

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.740
Despite this, a photo of a Chinese man, dubbed
by the masses on the internet, “the happiest

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.760
man in China”, occasionally makes the rounds
purporting to be of a 19th century Chinese

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.120
man who unabashedly displays a wide, toothy
grin for the camera.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.899
This, in addition to the man’s remarkably
photogenic appearance and near flawless smile,

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.480
has naturally led many to dismiss the photo
as fake- seemingly just a picture someone

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.870
recently took and digitally touched up to
appear like a photo from the 19th or early

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.929
20th centuries.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.149
So is the “happiest man in China” photo
a fake and who is the smiling man?

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.600
As for the latter question, very unfortunately,
nobody knows.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.750
We do, however, know the photo is genuine
and how it survived through today.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.920
Officially titled “Eating rice, China”
(and originally captioned “Chinaman eating

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.760
rice”), the picture is one of originally
143 photographs (105 of which can be seen

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.640
here) collated by famed sinologist (more or
less “expert on China”) Berthold Laufer

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.049
who, in 1904, returned from a landmark three
year trip to the Orient with about 7,500 objects

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.770
intended to showcase the day to day life of
the average Chinese individual at the time.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.920
As to this little adventure, Laufer, who did
not take a camera with him, was sent on behalf

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.549
of the American Museum of Natural History.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.540
According to a 1902 letter written by anthropologist
Franz Boas, the main objective of the expedition

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.540
was to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.729
bring together collections which illustrate
the popular customs and beliefs of the Chinese,

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.750
their industries, and their mode of life…
to bring out the complexity of Chinese culture,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.439
the high degree of technical development achieved
by the people, the love of art, which pervades

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.130
their whole life, and the strong social ties
that bind the people together.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.500
In bringing together collections bearing upon
these points of view, we desire to illustrate

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.170
the needs of the Chinese and the products
of their industries.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.600
These will demonstrate the commercial and
social possibilities of more extended intercourse.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.870
We also wish to imbue the public with greater
respect for the achievements of Chinese civilization.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.150
Our object has not been to bring together
a collection of Chinese works of art- this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.849
matter belongs more properly to the scope
of an art museum- but to emphasize the general

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.530
characteristics of Chinese culture…

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.110
The ulterior motive here, as alluded to in
the letter, was to explore the potential for

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.599
various business dealings with China, which
is how the museum and Laufer got banker Jacob

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.090
H. Schiff to fund the expedition; Schiff was
partnered with various businessmen including

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.819
railroad magnate E.H.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.170
Harriman, former senator Calvin Brice, and
J.P. Morgan, all of whom were looking to expand

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.200
their business dealings into China.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.980
Over the course of his travels, Laufer set
about collecting literally thousands of random

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.071
objects he felt were representatives of Chinese
culture and life, resulting in, as the museum

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:06.290
itself notes:

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.049
an extensive collection of representative
objects used in daily life, agriculture, folk

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.370
religion, medicine, and in the practice of
such crafts as printing, bookbinding, carpentry,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.099
enamelware, ceramics, and laquerware.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.750
Laufer also collected numerous musical instruments,
costumes, articles of clothing as well as

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.659
wax cylinder recordings of traditional Chinese
songs and plays.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.750
Due to his interest in Chinese theatre, he
also ended up returning to the States with

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.400
the “most extensive collection of Chinese
puppets in North America including shadow

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.299
puppets, rod puppets, and glove puppets in
several regional styles”.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.970
It’s not clear where Laufer acquired many
of the objects he collected, though in most

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.769
cases it appears he simply bought the items
either from antique dealers or the market

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.579
stalls found in the hutongs of major cities.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.260
Although Laufer would claim in a letter home
that during his journey “there is no path

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.030
I do not walkover, no cave I do not enter”,
in reality he spent the majority of his time

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.129
in Peking and despite repeated request from
the Museum to interview actual Chinese people,

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.849
tended to gather his quotes from books.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.819
This all brings us back to the photos he acquired
during his trip.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.870
As he didn’t take a camera with him, it
is thought that Laufer himself didn’t take

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.540
any of the pictures he sent back to the museum.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.310
The approximately 143 photographs he did collect
were largely purchased from unknown sources,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.500
with the American Museum of Natural History
admitting that many of the photos Laufer found

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.020
“are known to be widely-distributed images
available for purchase at the time”.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.240
Among these images depicting various facets
of Chinese life and culture is the aforementioned

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.180
unknown happy man eating rice.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.430
According to the museum, the photo is, as
previously noted, a genuine picture from the

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.050
turn of the century and in their opinion was
likely taken between 1901 and 1904- the dates

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.390
of Laufer’s trip.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.090
While it’s sometimes claimed that the man
was having his photo taken at Laufer’s request

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.750
in order to demonstrate the eating of this
staple of the Chinese diet, there is no documented

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.090
evidence that this is actually the case.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.850
Further rumors that the man struck his happy
pose as he had no knowledge of etiquette in

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.120
photography at the time can likewise not be
substantiated by any documented evidence we

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.160
can find.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.930
All we can definitively say based on available
evidence is that the photo isn’t part of

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.160
some elaborate internet ruse, it was taken
sometime around the end of the 19th or early

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.970
20th centuries, and it was collected by Laufer
and sent back to the American Museum of Natural

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:50.599
History during his 1901-1904 expedition.
