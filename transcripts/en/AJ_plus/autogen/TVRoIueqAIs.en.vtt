00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.267
Students at the University of Missouri are making a mark on a billion-dollar industry in

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.400
the United States: college football.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.567
In a sport where coaches have multimillion-dollar salaries and universities make millions

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:19.100
from TV rights, merchandising and ticket sales, the players get paid nothing.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.533
This week, though, the University of Missouri's football team proved they aren't

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:27.433
powerless. After several weeks of protests by fellow students, the football team issued

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:32.400
an ultimatum: They wouldn't practice or play until university president Tim Wolfe stepped

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.900
down. 48 hours later, he did. This is what the team's captain had to say:

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:42.500
"It is not about us. We just wanted to use our platform to take a stand as fellow

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.733
concerned students on an issue."

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.633
So what are the issues?

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.033
There's been growing tension between students and the administration at the

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:51.067
university for months.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.200
Some were upset that the university hadn't taken a stand during events in Ferguson

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.967
- only two hours away -  after Mike Brown was killed by a police officer.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.133
Students were also disgruntled over decisions to cut health insurance subsidies

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.467
and a long-standing relationship with Planned Parenthood.  And then a series of

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.100
racist incidents on campus turned into several weeks of protest.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:15.500
These included the student body president being called racial slurs on campus, and

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:19.667
someone smearing feces in the shape of a swastika on a dorm bathroom wall.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.933
Protesters say the administration hasn't done enough to make minority students feel

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.533
safe.

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.533
One student, Jonathan Butler, announced he was going on a hunger strike until the

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:29.500
president resigned.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:32.733
But it was the actions of the football team that tipped the scales.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.367
Over the weekend, several black players announced that they wouldn't practice, lift

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.700
weights or play a game until the protesters' demands were met.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.833
And that was a huge risk.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:46.900
You see, football is big business at Mizzou. In 2014 the football team alone brought in

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.167
over $35 million for the university.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.367
The protesting players could have been disciplined by the coaching staff or lost their

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.967
scholarships, which for some are their only chance at a college education.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.767
But the next day, coach Gary Pinkel tweeted this photo of his entire team, saying, "We are

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.233
behind our players."

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:07.400
If the team refused to play the upcoming game against Brigham Young University, the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.300
school would have been fined a million dollars.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.867
Now the game is back on. Jonathan Butler has suspended his hunger strike.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.200
And the administration is promising changes.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.367
And while many students say there's a long way to go to end incidents of racism on

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:25.033
campus, around the country, people are noticing the power that unpaid athletes have by

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:25.833
refusing to play.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:30.400
In the last couple of years there have been athlete protests against racism at several

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.567
universities, including at the University of Oklahoma and Georgetown.

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:38.400
As one Missouri football player put it, "Let this be a testament to all other athletes

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.733
across the country that you do have the power."
