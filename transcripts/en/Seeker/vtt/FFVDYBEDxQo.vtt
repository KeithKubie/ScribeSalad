00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.590
Male grass gobys may be small, but some of
them are masters of manipulation when it comes

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.070
to the composition of their ejaculates.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.949
Grass gobys are bottom-feeding fish endemic
to coastal waters of the mediterranean basin.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.970
These small fish have an external fertilization
system - meaning the sperm isn’t deposited

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.849
inside the safe and secure space of a female’s
body.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.780
Females deposit their eggs in small depressions
on the sea bottom, which males then fertilize,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.940
directly exposing the sperm to the danger
of the open ocean.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.670
But there’s more than one way for a male
goby to be reproductively successful...

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.379
There are two different types of goby males:
territorial and sneaker.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.030
The territorial males are large and strong,
whereas the sneaker males are small and quick.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.100
The territorial male guards an area where
a female lays her eggs, and he fertilizes

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.250
them once they have been deposited.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.180
Sneaker males, on the other hand, hide nearby
and dart out at the exact moment that the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.229
territorial males are fertilizing, and they
deposit some sperm of their own!

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.310
Ejaculates of territorial VS sneaker males
vary greatly in their composition.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.780
Territorial males create a viscous, abundant
spew that is high in substances that help

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.030
the sperm to swim faster through the seawater
to the eggs.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.550
The sneaker can take advantage of the speed-enhancing
compounds by mixing his ejaculate with the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.040
territorial’s.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.909
Any eggs that the sneaker male fertilizes
will then be protected by the larger, stronger

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.310
territorial male.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.430
And by exploiting the benefits of the high-quality
ejaculates, the sneaky sneakers save energy.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.770
Because,let’s face it - they are much smaller
and they don’t have any extra energy to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.060
spare!

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:08.970
Take that tough guy!
