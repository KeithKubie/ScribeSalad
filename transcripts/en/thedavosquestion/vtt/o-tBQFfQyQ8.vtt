Yes, Africa will certainly benefit from the
2010 soccer World Cup. We should have been

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.480
in South Africa firstly. This is the first
time that the World Cup is held in Africa.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.300
And but secondly, the economic benefit, particularly
in the region, as well as all countries in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.720
the continent that will be participating to
a large extent. So there will be benefits.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.950
From the beginning we knew that this was not
just for South Africa only, but it was for

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.840
Africa as a whole. I thank you.
