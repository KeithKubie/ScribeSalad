and she takes a shit,

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.212
like she's dropping the mic.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.581
She's like,
"My job's done here.

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:18.083
Try to lose your virginity now,
after that."

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.624
I'm Ari Shaffir, and tonight
the topic is "bloodline."

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:09.101
- So my sister's the
coolest person in my whole town.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.402
And let me explain a little bit

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:12.238
about my sister--
I got to go back.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.241
My mom used to work
training monkeys

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.577
as aids
for quadriplegics.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.179
[laughter]
So--

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.581
So like Seeing Eye dogs,
they help the blind.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.084
They tried to get these monkeys
to help quadriplegics.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.921
Turns out monkeys are
very unhelpful.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.757
They're--they really don't
want to be helpful,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.460
they're not interested
in being helpful.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.096
Um, and so like,
the quadriplegics would have

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.833
a little straw to
blow into to release a treat

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.867
if the monkey did
a good behavior,

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.435
like, uh, you know, give them--

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.471
like, turn a page in a book,
or something.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.440
But the monkeys realized
that if you just

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.842
take the quadriplegic's head

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.444
and jam it down
onto the straw,

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:57.149
then they'll breathe out,
releasing all the treats.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.886
Why work, with--
if that's what you can do.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.522
So, um, so my mom realized
this wasn't a great program,

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.458
sort of at the same time
that her favorite monkey,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.227
her test monkey, um,
was on the brink of death.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.729
She was gonna die.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.631
And she was in this horrible
cage in a laboratory.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.133
And my mom was like,
"I want to give her

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.668
"a peaceful place to die.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.971
"I want to have a funeral for
her like Princess Diana.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.907
"I just want it
to be very dignified,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.575
I'm leaving this program."

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.178
So my mom, what she did is she
signed the monkey out as dead,

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:27.413
she took her home,

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.482
and she fed the monkey
bagels and lox.

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:34.320
And then the monkey proceeded
to live through the weekend,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.990
and then for 30 years.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.826
For 30 more years

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.996
in the house
with my family.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.497
So everyone says,
"Oh, my gosh,

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.866
"you have a monkey as a sister,
that's my dream!

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.334
That's so cool!"

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.002
It's not cool,
and it's not a dream

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.104
'cause she was a huge bitch.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.941
She's very abusive
and mean.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.010
And, like, I would tell,
you know, my--my--my, uh,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.512
second-grade teacher,
"Oh,"

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.348
like, "my collage
got ripped up by my monkey."

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.417
And she'd think
that I was, um,

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.452
uh, disturbed,
and I had to go to

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.887
the psychologist--
the school psychologist

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:13.525
'cause my mom didn't bother
to bring a monkey in or explain.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.561
Or the monkey,
she's really diabolical.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.563
So she would, like,
take my favorite

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:20.633
holographic, magic 8-ball Pog
and, like,

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.102
tear off the top of it.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.938
She knew,
and she would, like,

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.939
pee on my dolls.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.241
Or she would, like--she
had these like long, monkey,

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.310
Crypt Keeper fingers,
and she would,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.445
uh, unscrew the peanut butter,
which is my favorite,

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.581
and she'd, like,
run her fingers through it.

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:39.885
And just, like, look at me
like, "What are you gonna do?"

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:42.955
Nothing, 'cause
she was my mom's favorite.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.225
Um, and actually, do you guys--
you--do--do you want to see her?

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.593
You want to see
a picture of her?

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.061
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.330
Okay, so I have my little helper
here, oh, thank you very much.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.665
So here's, uh,
here she is

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:56.302
in a, in a terry cloth, uh,
beach robe.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.338
<i> Nice.
 There she is, Amelia.</i>

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:02.475
This is Amelia, she has--
she's eating challah

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:06.144
<i> with an eye infection.
 Ooh.</i>

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:08.982
<i> Nice, on the kitchen table.</i>

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.817
<i> Very sanitary.</i>

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.919
I'd come home like,
"Mom, I got an A!"

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.753
And then everyone would be like,
"Oh, my God, look,

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.857
Amelia's eating spaghetti
with her feet, oh!"

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.258
You can't beat that.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.293
And here, this is what I showed
to my therapist

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.195
very recently, um.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:26.866
I don't know if you can see,
so--so--

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.603
<i> I'm in a--some sort of crate?
 Um...</i>

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:34.807
<i> And she gets to be drinking
 my bottle, so that's great.</i>

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.876
And she's having freedom,
so that's all nice.

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.712
Thanks, Ameli--um.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.515
So things got even worse
when I went through puberty.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.617
Dogs just want--to be--
you're the master.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.118
And they want you
to like them,

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:49.988
but monkeys have this
very rigid hierarchical system.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:53.226
And when she sensed that I was,
like, becoming a woman,

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.560
she would, uh,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.628
she would attack me
and she would, like,

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:59.965
lurk behind a darkened doorway
for--she was like a Gremlin.

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.735
It was like
living with a horrible goblin.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.870
She would lurk for me
to come by the doorway,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.472
and then she'd like
jump out and, like,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.006
bite my Achilles tendon
and she'd laugh,

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.876
and monkeys laugh like this,
they're like--

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.711
[breathy laughter]

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:16.649
Which is way creepier
with no sound.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.051
Or she would, like,
wait for me to be

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.053
carrying something
really hot or heavy, like pasta,

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:22.388
and she would attack me.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.757
Or the worst is
I would be on the toilet--

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.426
you just want some solitude,
you want to be by yourself,

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.895
have some relaxing time.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.997
Um, and she would
come and attack me.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.667
Oh, she was also
very jealous of my boyfriend.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.368
Um, she was
really flirtatious,

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:38.003
and this is how--
here, you help me out.

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:39.572
I'll--I'll do monkey flirt
with you.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:42.441
Ready?
Imagine I'm drooling a lot.

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:43.676
And then she would--
she would go like this.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.077
She'd like rub her tummy
at him,

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:46.779
and he'd be like,
"That's so cute."

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.514
And I would say,
"No, you don't understand!

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.117
She--she ripped up
all my homework."

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:55.254
Um, and she--
she particularly

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.022
didn't like my laugh, um.

00:05:57.022 --> 00:05:58.391
You guys are smiling,
it's awesome.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.959
Laughing, great.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.894
Don't do that to a monkey
'cause it's--

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.596
you're baring your teeth,
that's a sign of aggression.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.031
So anytime I laughed,
she'd be like,

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:08.100
"Oh, you want to go?"
Like, "I'm down!"

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.969
Like, "Bring it!"

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.705
So I was so in love
with my boyfriend.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:16.775
Uh, and we were ready,
when I was 16,

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.944
to "do it,"
and I was so excited.

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.547
And I planned it,
um, 'cause as the ladies

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.417
in the audience know, like,
ambience is very important

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.718
when you're gonna
lose the V card.

00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:29.288
So I got princess
mosquito netting,

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:33.426
and I got votive candles,
candles, um...

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.960
Always in style.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.929
And I laid them all around,
and it was so perfect.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.665
And we waited for my parents
to be out of the house,

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.134
across the street
at a holiday party.

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:43.569
Oh, my gosh.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.905
And so we were making out
and fooling around

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.472
and it was like getting,
like, hot,

00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:49.775
and he took off his shirt
and like--

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:51.611
[exhales]
It was so steamy.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.080
And I was giggling 'cause
I was a little bit nervous.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.416
And all of a sudden, like,
we--we're getting naked

00:06:57.416 --> 00:07:00.619
and then we hear--bam!
Bam!

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.188
And the door busts down,

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:05.290
like the Gestapo
has come to town.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.826
And we look

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:09.094
and it's Amelia,
and she's heard the laughing,

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:11.997
and she's like,
"Oh, it's on," like.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:13.666
"Yeah.
Yeah!"

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.934
[stammers] She thinks that
I've been sitting in the bedroom

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.604
just like, "You fucking bitch,"
and like, "I'm gonna..."

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.206
She's super pissed.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:22.141
And she's jealous 'cause
I'm with my boyfriend.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.043
And so she runs onto the bed,
and she's like,

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.511
"Ra, ra, ra, ra, rah."

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.846
And my boyfriend covered up
his junk with a pillow.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.348
And I'm like trying to
shoo her away,

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:30.950
but she's really fast.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.784
So she runs
and she gets tangled up

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:34.953
in the mosquito netting,
and she's like re--

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:36.622
she's a ball of rage
in a net.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.624
And I think, like,

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.625
"Okay, at least now,

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.127
she's like contained."

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:43.228
But she pull--
she's so strong she pulls down

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:44.697
the mosquito netting,
and now she's, like,

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:47.165
running with a big net
behind her.

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:50.335
And what I now know
about mosquito netting

00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:52.871
is that it's quite flammable.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:57.343
So she pulls it through this,
like, row of votive candles.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.810
And it catches on fire.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.746
And now she's trailing fire
like a comet,

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.481
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna, like,

00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:03.983
burn my sister to death,"

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.418
and I'm naked
and my boyfriend's screaming.

00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:09.388
So we, like, put it out
with pillows.

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:11.056
And there's, like, smoke.

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:14.159
And my parents have heard
all this commotion.

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:16.495
And they show up
at the door.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.865
And my boyfriend
is just so stoic--

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.532
he's just like,

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:22.535
"Mr. Friedman,"
like,

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.437
just really trying
to recover it,

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:27.906
um, and Amelia has, uh,
de-tangled from the net.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:31.243
And she goes onto the bed,
she like strolls onto the bed,

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:35.280
and she takes a shit,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.750
like she's dropping the mic,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.086
She's like,
"My job's done here.

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:44.023
Try to lose your virginity now,
after that."

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.557
She strolls out.

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:48.928
And, um, and that was that.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.730
Eventually I did lose my
virginity in a horrible car.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.367
I had, like, seat buckles
pressed--impressions in my ass,

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.867
very romantic.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:57.970
Um, but I went home recently.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.872
Amelia--Amelia passed away
after 30--30 years with us.

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:02.307
She had lived a really
wonderful life.

00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:05.744
And my mom gave her the
dignified Princess Diana funeral

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:06.946
that she always wanted.

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:09.114
It was an open-casket
ceremony.

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:12.585
It was super creepy.
The whole town came.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.654
She was a smoking jacket.

00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:19.157
Never in real life,
but in the funeral, yes.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:21.060
I don't know why.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.828
Um, and since then,
I've gone home

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.630
and I've been, like,
on the toilet, thinking, like,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.064
"Oh, my gosh!
It's--oh, no."

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:27.967
And then I realize she's not
gonna be there.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.402
And I walk into a darkened room
and I realize she's not there.

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:32.571
And I thought I'd be relieved,
but it's--

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.939
it's kind of sad, um,

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.741
and I think about
what I do now,

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.177
like, I get to tell, like,
cool stories to people like you,

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.412
and I think about the people
who said, "Oh, it's so cool

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:41.913
you had a monkey
as a sister."

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:45.250
And I think, "Maybe they
were right, and I was wrong."

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.253
[cheers and applause]
