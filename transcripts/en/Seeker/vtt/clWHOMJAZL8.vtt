00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.400
California is in the 4th year of a severe
drought, but it’s right next to the biggest

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.780
ocean on the planet.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.630
Some of our viewers want to know, why aren’t
they just using that?

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.800
Hey everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710
California is thirsty.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.349
On top of having almost 39 million residents,
California grows an unbelievable amount of

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.349
food.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.800
With agriculture being a 36 billion dollar
industry in the state, it’s more than twice

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.439
as big as any other states.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.500
And that means that in 2010 the US Geological
Survey estimates California used almost, I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.780
hope you’re sitting down for this number,
52 trillion liters of water.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.760
That’s 142 billion liters a day.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
But California hasn’t been getting the precipitation
it needs for the past 4 years and now they’re

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380
scrambling for new sources of drinking water.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.710
Los Angeles county is offering to buy water
from Sacramento valley farmers.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.700
The state is urging people to conserve water
and was threatening to fine people during

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.960
the ice bucket challenge.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.970
But, hello, guys.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.140
the pacific ocean is right there.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.630
Saltwater minus salt equals water, let’s
go, do I have to think of everything?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.540
Actually San Diego county had the same idea,
they’re currently building the biggest desalination

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.579
plant in the western hemisphere to the tune
of 1 billion dollars.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.979
When it’s finished next year it will make
204 million liters of potable water daily

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.409
and sell at a dollar for every 616 liters.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.299
Wow, we’re in the clear.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.109
Eh, not so fast.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.780
While it sounds like a lot of cheap water,
the opposite is true.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.580
That price is 80% higher than San Diego pays
for treated water outside the county, and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.090
even though this plant is huge it can only
make 10% of the county’s needs.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.920
And it’ll use a lot of energy because it’s
forcing pressurized water through a membrane

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.740
to separate the water from the salt in a process
called reverse osmosis.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.899
It’s drought-proof and doesn’t rely on
recycling a resource we’re running out of

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.810
but as a practical way to solve California’s
water woes, it’s more of a small puzzle

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.439
piece than the ultimate solution.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.499
To put it in perspective, there are countries
where water desalination is crucial.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.609
Israel is one such country, and their desalination
plants provide 35% of their drinking water,

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.899
or enough for 2.8 million people.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.840
California’s population is 5 times the size
of Israel’s, and the agriculture industry

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.540
is 32 times bigger.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.100
4 desalination plants may be fine for Israel,
but it’s not enough for the west coast.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.100
Not by a long shot.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.700
California also needs water urgently, so focusing
more on conservation and recycling may be

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.680
a better strategy than building desalination
plants that won’t come online until at least

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680
next year.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.599
Like I said, we covered this topic because
we got comments asking about it on our other

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.599
video about California’s drought.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.599
See, we listen to you guys.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.599
We love you guys.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.340
If you want to check out said video, here
it is right down here.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.290
And while you’re at it if you have any other
questions you want us to answer or topics

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.770
you want us to elaborate on, feel free to
tell us in the comments.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:52.900
I’m also on the twitters @JHug00, and until
next time, thanks for watching DNews.
