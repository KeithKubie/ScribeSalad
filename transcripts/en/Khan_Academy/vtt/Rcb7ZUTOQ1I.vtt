00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.550
If we know some circle
has an area of 36pi--

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.700
so it has an area
of 36pi-- can we

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.060
figure out what the
circumference of this circle

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.580
is?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.340
And I encourage you
to pause this video,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.420
and try to think
about that question.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.850
Well, from the area, we could
figure out what the radius is,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.830
and then from that
radius, we can figure out

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.410
what its circumference is.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
So we know that the
area, which is 36pi,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.530
is equal to pi r squared.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.110
And so if you look at it on
both sides of this equation,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.800
if we divide-- let me rewrite
it so it's a little bit clearer

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.920
in a different color.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.280
So we could set up an equation
pi r squared is equal to 36pi.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.960
Now, if we want to
solve for the radius

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.626
the first thing that
we might want to do

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:51.590
is divide both sides by pi.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.430
Then, we're left with r
squared is equal to 36.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.024
Now, if we just solve this
as a pure math equation,

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.440
you might say, OK, we could
take the positive and negative

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.460
square root of 36.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.030
r could be plus
or minus 6, but we

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820
need to remember
that r is a distance,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.700
so we only care
about the positive.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.070
So if we take the principal root
of 36, we get r is equal to 6.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.740
From there, we can use this to
figure out the circumference.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.260
So the circumference
is equal to 2 pi r.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.460
Circumference is
equal to 2 pi r.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.250
And in this case,
r is equal to 6.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.500
So it's equal to 2
pi times 6, which

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.970
is going to be equal to 12pi.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.290
So that's straightforward,
area 36pi, we leverage pi r

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.420
squared to figure out
that the radius was 6,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.530
and then from that we
were able to figure out

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.628
that the circumference was 12pi.
