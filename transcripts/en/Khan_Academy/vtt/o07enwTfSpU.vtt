00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.290
- [Instructor] We are told

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.840
that figure two is a
scaled copy of figure one.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.220
And we can verify that by
comparing corresponding sides.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.870
Corresponding sides are sides

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.790
that have the same relative position,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760
the same, they're playing
the same role in each

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.330
of the diagrams even if the
diagrams are scaled versions

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.690
of each other, even if
they are different sizes.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.880
So for example, if we were

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.190
to compare segment ea right over here,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.753
it looks like it
corresponds to segment op.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.260
And the length of ea is three,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
the length of op is one,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.710
And so for this to be a scaled copy,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.760
the scaling factor from,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.830
what from the corresponding
side in figure one

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.860
to the corresponding side

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.920
in figure two, should be a factor of two.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.570
So it's times two right over there.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.020
So let's just answer their
questions that they're asking us,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.110
and then we can also verify
that it is a scaled copy.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.920
What point on figure one corresponds

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.990
to the point q on figure two?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.070
All right, pause this video

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.570
and see if you can figure that out.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.450
All right, so point q on
figure two is right over there,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.240
so what point on figure
one corresponds to that?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.120
Well, it would be playing the same role.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.550
It would be in the same relative position.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.730
And so it looks like this
point right over here,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.400
point b, is in that
same relative position.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.730
So point b corresponds
to point q on figure two.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.320
Identify the side of figure two

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.030
that corresponds to
segment dc in figure one.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.930
Pause this video again and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.310
All right, so segment
dc in figure one, that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.750
is that right over there,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.560
and your eye might've
immediately catched that hey,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.550
the segment that's playing
the same role in figure two

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.860
is this one right over here.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.100
And so that is segment nm.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.470
Put the line over it to make sure

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.930
that I'm specifying the segment.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.870
And we can once again verify
the scale factor to ensure

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.580
that this is a scaled copy.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.630
For these two to correspond to each other,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.010
and for these to be scaled
copies of each other,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.570
dc has a length of one, two, three, four.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.870
And nm has a length of one,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.780
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.940
So once again, we are verifying

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.113
that our scale factor is two.
