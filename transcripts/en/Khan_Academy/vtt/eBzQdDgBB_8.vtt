00:00:01.053 --> 00:00:03.491
- [Voiceover] This circle
represents one whole.

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.660
This circle right here
represents one whole.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.828
If we know that, we can
answer what fraction

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:11.153
of the circle is shaded in blue below?

00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:12.233
So down here.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.277
What fraction is in blue?

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:16.579
Let's start back up here with the whole.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.079
This whole is divided into one, two, three

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:26.083
equal size pieces, so
it's divided into thirds,

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.786
three equal size pieces.

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:31.334
And each of those pieces,
each of those pie pieces,

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:34.667
is 1/3, is one of the thirds.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.410
So knowing that, let's go
down here to these ones

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.193
and lets see how many of these 1/3 pieces.

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:46.360
Here's 1/3, another 1/3,
another 1/3 shaded in blue,

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:50.805
another one and another one.

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:54.638
So we have one, two,
three, four, five thirds.

00:00:57.094 --> 00:01:00.761
We have 5/3 shaded in blue below.
