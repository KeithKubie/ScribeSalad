1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.650
Batting first producer Tim Howard. Well wait,

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:08.030
I'm just gonna get my level here that, that popped up at Purdue.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.490
It is such a beautiful day. Beautiful.

4
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:13.910
I think it's gotta be like 75 degrees out or something. Sunny. Um,

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.170
this is Patrick perdon.

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.250
He's a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School and works at mass

7
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:22.090
general hospital. Yeah. You want to just tell me where we are? We're,

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.960
we're standing right now, uh,

9
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.620
in front of the Bulfinch building and I went up to talk to him because in that

10
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.620
building is a, this is the one with the ether dome. You did go miss.

11
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.090
Inside this building is,

12
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.250
it's got like the story of the day that you could say humanity emerged from the

13
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.870
dark ages. Oh, you laugh now. Just wait.

14
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.300
Okay. Here we go. On the fourth floor,

15
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.560
it's on the fourth floor of this building.

16
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.540
We headed in up three flights of stairs into this room.

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.270
What a cool room. Oh my God. Is this like,

18
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.730
how would you describe, I've seen any amphitheater, right?

19
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.590
It's also got this awesome,

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.120
don't miss this beautiful domed room with lights streaming down from above.

21
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550
Like the acoustics in here are crazy. It must have been terrifying though.

22
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:15.340
If you actually hear somebody screaming, I mean, it's so resonated here.

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.620
The screams would have been deafening and and absolutely would have been

24
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.520
terrifying. What is this place? Well,

25
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.610
this was an operating room and back in the 18 hundreds when this room was really

26
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:27.400
in use,

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.650
<v 2>being in an operation was so painful,</v>

28
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.310
it was often permanently damaging to a patient's emotional state.

29
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.610
<v 0>This is Julie. I'm Julie Fenster. I write about American history.</v>

30
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.290
She wrote a book called Ether Day,

31
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.840
which goes into a lot of detail about the dark,

32
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.280
dark days of surgery in the early 18 hundreds back then during surgery,

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.310
there were no painkillers and patients were awake,

34
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.150
probably more awake than they'd ever been in their whole lives.

35
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.990
<v 2>Some of the patients who remembered the sound of their limb dropping to the</v>

36
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:00.770
ground or the saw going through their sinew and bones.

37
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.410
<v 1>Mm.</v>

38
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.310
<v 2>The smell of their own body being cut into.</v>

39
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.100
Usually the surgeon would employ six burly men to hold a patient down and

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.150
instead of having an operation,

41
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:19.860
some people committed suicide before they would face going into an operating

42
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:20.160
room,

43
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
which were usually located on the top floor of a hospital in part because the

44
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:27.840
hospital really didn't do itself.

45
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.980
A lot of good to have the screams heard by passers by.

46
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.880
<v 0>This is such a cool room. Here we are at the top of the ether dome,</v>

47
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.580
but then everything changes.

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.770
October 16th, 1846 it's a Friday morning.

49
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.000
I assume the room is full. The the room is absolutely false.

50
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.850
Students were all lined up to watch crowded in the bleachers because they'd

51
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:55.850
heard something big was going to go down and right there in the middle of the

52
00:02:55.851 --> 00:03:00.280
room is the most esteemed surgeon in America,

53
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 2>Dr. John Warren, about to do an operation.</v>

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.880
He brought in a piece in who needed a tumor taken out of his neck and he was

55
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.930
just about to slice into the guy just about to start the surgery.

56
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.950
When this mustachioed fellow bursts in a dentist,

57
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.780
William TG Morton,

58
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.500
and he basically said to warn something that must have sounded completely nuts.

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.000
I can erase that man's pain. He didn't actually use those words.

60
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.390
He actually had an appointment with Warren. But according to Julie,

61
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:32.930
he did have a bag. He had a bag filled with gas,

62
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.200
a gas called ether. And, um, Dr. Warren,

63
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.050
who had the scalpel raised, he puts it down,

64
00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:42.980
stands aside and says with great sarcasm. Well, sir,

65
00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:45.770
your patient is ready. They second, had he ever tested this,

66
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.860
he claimed to have tried it out on some dental patients and on his dog,

67
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.400
on himself and on his goldfish. Nice.

68
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.660
So Martin gets to work

69
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.330
<v 3>more than sets up his gear, fills up the inhaler, puts it up to the guy's face.</v>

70
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.164
And actually,

71
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.410
because the valve system had just been constructed and he hadn't tested it,

72
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.411
he actually literally had to manually operate the valves with every inhale and

73
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:15.250
exhale of, of the patient. So he administers the ether using this inhaler.

74
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.120
After about three or four minutes, uh,

75
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.400
the patient becomes unconscious and just at that moment,

76
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.310
Morton turns to Warren and says,

77
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.970
<v 2>you are a patient, sir.</v>

78
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.940
Dr. Warren brings a scalpel down to the patient's neck and cuts.

79
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.740
And really for the first time in that room,

80
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.030
you could hear the scalpel. You could hear the breathing.

81
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.210
The silence was far more deafening than all the screams that had ever been heard

82
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:50.360
in that operating theater. No squirming, no moving,

83
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:53.360
no bulging eyes, no clenched fists.

84
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.300
It must've felt like a miracle.

85
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.840
This a, the news of the operation went around the world as fast as anything.

86
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.980
News of, you know, war or peace didn't travel faster than this.

87
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.470
By the end of the year,

88
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.750
doctors in Europe are using surgical anesthetics and basically the blink of an

89
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.790
eye, the most painful,

90
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:24.740
horrible experience possibly imaginable became routine,

91
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.450
even forgettable, but also deeply peculiar. Uh,

92
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.350
as was made clear to us when we talked a while back with one of our regulars,

93
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.860
Carl Zimmer, well, my wife and I, we were watching this movie one night.

94
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.820
It was called birth started with Coke Kidman. You. Did you like it? I hated it.

95
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.790
No, it's one of my favorites. Well, okay,

96
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.360
I'm sitting there and I'm hating the movie. You're hating this movie. Well,

97
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.380
I'm just wondering like why am I reacting so negatively to this movie?

98
00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:56.330
I'm just in such a bad mood. I'm feeling lousy. And I think it's the movie.

99
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.210
And I stand and I say, oh, wait a minute.

100
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.100
My abdomen is an incredible pain. Oh, so it's not the move. It's not the movie.

101
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.350
It's me. Appendix about to burst.

102
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.700
We go to the hospital and um, maybe four in the morning, five in the morning,

103
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.360
they're prepping me for surgery. They, you know,

104
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.420
put an IV in me and then they're like, okay,

105
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:18.580
now we're going to be putting in the anesthetic, you know,

106
00:06:18.581 --> 00:06:21.040
so just relax and this'll be taking effect.

107
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.960
But he says it didn't seem to be working.

108
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.950
So I start thinking about what they're going to be doing to me. Half an hour,

109
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:29.690
they're going to like take these knives and they're going to cut me open.

110
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.550
They're going to rip my intestines apart.

111
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.160
They're going to pull off this inflamed appendix.

112
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:35.900
They're going to sew up the intestines,

113
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.810
they're going to zip everything back up and all this is going to happen.

114
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.050
Supposedly without me being aware of it and I,

115
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.620
and I'm not having any part of it. I just said,

116
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.950
I was just lying there saying, I don't think this is working.

117
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.270
I'm not feeling anything. You're going to have to do something more.

118
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.520
I just want you to know that I'm not,

119
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.520
and then I was in another room and there was no one else there.

120
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.960
Where did they all go? Like they'd all left and then,

121
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.510
and then it occurred to me like, no. Oh, oh, oh,

122
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.960
the whole surgery is already happened. Wow. That is weird.

123
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.680
I just happened to me, if they spliced time,

124
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.790
take the time that you were in and the time that you are in subsequently,

125
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.810
and the middle is totally missing. No experience whatsoever.

126
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.590
It's not like sleep. No. There was no like, oh, I'm getting sleepy.

127
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.400
I was arguing with my doctors that they didn't know how to do their job and the

128
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:41.590
next thing I'm in a hospital room with my appendix out and it's 10 hours later.

129
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.220
It sort of implies that it's like a switch. Yeah, it is and that's what happens.

130
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.060
I mean when you raise the level of anesthesia in someone,

131
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.810
they've done studies on this, it isn't a gentle gradation down. You just,

132
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:56.940
you raise it up, you raise it up and then from you are into this other state.

133
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.840
Do do people who do this for a living know exactly why this happened.

134
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.380
You'd think that something that's been around since 1846 would be hammered out

135
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.820
solid, but it's still almost a philosophical kind of mystery.

136
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.373
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

137
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:36.370
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

138
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.370
<v 2>there's a term for this in physics it's called a black box refers to a system</v>

139
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:42.670
where you can see what goes in,

140
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.360
you can see that something different comes out and you wonder like what happened

141
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:49.720
there in the middle, but you can't see it. Yeah, it's a mystery.

142
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.660
It's black and it's closed up. Therefore, the box,

143
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.220
I mean it might not literally be a box, but we have three different

144
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.230
<v 0>attempts to open three very different black boxes. It's starting with the box.</v>

145
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.540
It's in front of us now. That gap that Carl talked about, where you go, Oh,

146
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.370
you're gone, and then suddenly you're back.

147
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.400
What happens in that gap? That's what's crazy.

148
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.810
It's been almost 170 years since William Morton did his thing in front of those

149
00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:18.830
med students. And we moved way beyond ether. So here we got Provo fall,

150
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.940
we've got CVL fluorine,

151
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.700
dex matters how many Caribbean we've got all these new drugs,

152
00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:25.070
but we still don't know exactly how they work,

153
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.300
which for Patrick is a very practical problem.

154
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.900
It's very difficult actually to figure out when people, you know,

155
00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:36.020
aren't conscious, cause they can always be internally conscious to some degree.

156
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:36.590
Right.

157
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.090
And in the 1950s and sixties he says this became a real issue because doctors

158
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:45.020
started giving patients neuromuscular blocking agents paralyze their muscles

159
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:48.200
during surgery so they wouldn't flop around, which is a good thing.

160
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.020
But then you'd have these situations,

161
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.833
<v 5>oh,</v>

162
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.380
<v 0>once in a blue moon. Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.010
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

164
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:02.060
<v 0>where a patient would wake up in the middle of surgery, literally trapped, um,</v>

165
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.290
unable to move, eyes closed, totally still know, fully awake,

166
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.590
but no one would be able to perceive it because they couldn't move.

167
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.670
And that's the nightmare that, you know,

168
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.660
may even be worse than having six strong men hold you down. I, yeah.

169
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:18.820
We don't have to dwell on that. Well,

170
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.590
I actually did find a bunch of these stories. I don't want to hear them.

171
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.650
I know they're great. I mean, they're, they're, um, they're amazing. But, um,

172
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.310
all right. I'd like to hear about it. No, I'm just saying, Hey,

173
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.160
I'll just play you one. No, I didn't know. All right. All right. All right.

174
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:34.250
You aren't going to regret it. Well, anyway,

175
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:38.690
the larger point is that if you can understand how and why anesthesia works,

176
00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:42.920
then you're not going to be able to explain why every so often it just doesn't

177
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.230
work. Okay. How often is every so often? Um,

178
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.460
I've heard different numbers anywhere between one and 10,000 to much more often,

179
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.640
like one in 1000. Wow. But luckily,

180
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.610
let's take a look at these brain signals. In the last few decades,

181
00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:02.390
scientists have begun to shine a little pin light into this black box,

182
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.870
and Patrick and his team in particular have found something pretty cool.

183
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.920
This experiment that we did in the, I guess, late 2000 so a couple of years ago,

184
00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:11.900
they wanted to know what happens in the brain,

185
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.410
right when that phone switch flips. So they got a bunch of volunteers,

186
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.000
all the volunteers, they hook them up to an ivy and started to very,

187
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.630
very slowly give them propofol. Slowly the admitters to the drug,

188
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:26.420
which is a big anesthetic, and as they did,

189
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.580
they told the subjects to click a button.

190
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.900
Every time they heard a sound or a word chair, a library that they recognize,

191
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.210
submarine, you know, something like that. In addition,

192
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:38.330
we had the subject's name too, Tim p, Patrick.

193
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.420
So the subjects would just sit there and listen and care library on and on.

194
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.210
Patrick and every 15 minutes that gave them a little bit more propofol. Yep.

195
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.430
<v 6>Big 10 Michael</v>

196
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.670
<v 0>until eventually they just stopped responding altogether.</v>

197
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.020
They were just out cold. Now throughout this whole time,

198
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.680
Patrick and his team were measuring the brain waves of the subjects.

199
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.573
That's the key.

200
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.860
And he says what they saw right at the moment that that switch flipped right at

201
00:12:15.861 --> 00:12:19.010
the moment of loss of consciousness. There was just one really,

202
00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:21.260
really clear motif that appeared.

203
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.560
They saw this wave of electricity sweeping across the brain

204
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:25.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:30.890
<v 0>this really low frequency oscillation about one cycle per second or less</v>

206
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.500
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

207
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.460
<v 0>And in addition to that, there was this higher frequency piece,</v>

208
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.080
an Alpha wave that appeared at the front of the head at that loss of

209
00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:43.940
consciousness moment.

210
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.170
<v 1>No.</v>

211
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.490
<v 0>So when people went under,</v>

212
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:52.080
their brains just started to ring like a bell basically. And why would those,

213
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.720
what are those waves doing exactly?

214
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.120
It seems like those waves might be imposing a kind of deadly order on the brain.

215
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.690
This is the thing that's very counterintuitive.

216
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:08.280
You think that consciousness is order and synchrony,

217
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.740
but it turns out that it's kind of the opposite.

218
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.670
That consciousness is actually chaotic and noisy. It's all of those

219
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.890
<v 2>different parts of the brain, you know, facial recognition,</v>

220
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.970
touch sound language engaged in this crazily complicated,

221
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:24.780
multilayered conversation. You know, it's one person talking,

222
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.100
the other one talking back,

223
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.840
this is Carl Zimmer again and he says,

224
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:35.680
one of the hallmarks of the conscious brain is that you see a kind of

225
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:39.970
conversational logic of back and forth between the different parts. Yeah,

226
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.770
my turn, your turn, my turn, your turn,

227
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.920
the things you're seeing create signals in the back of your head.

228
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.090
They would go to the front of your head back again,

229
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.500
forward and back and forward and back and forward and back and forward and back.

230
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.390
And you can use this eavesdropping to calculate how connected the brain is,

231
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.090
what they call conductivity. And when you're awake,

232
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.430
you have a lot of connectivity. When you're dreaming,

233
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.970
you also have a lot of connectivity. Um,

234
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.120
and then if someone gives you anesthesia,

235
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.390
<v 0>like in a matter of a second, your connectivity just collapses.</v>

236
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.980
What happened to you? It just curved. Your connectivity got cut. It did.

237
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.900
And here is the weird part.

238
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.570
Scientists will like play a sound to somebody who's under with anesthesia and

239
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:32.170
they can see that actually the part of the brain that processes sound,

240
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.810
the auditory cortex is active. It takes in the sound.

241
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.280
So your brain is hearing sounds. Um, that's spooky. Yeah.

242
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.430
So what could be happening is that when you're under anesthesia,

243
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.910
all the different parts of your brain to, to some degree that could be awake.

244
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.070
It's not, not your brain is just stopping. No.

245
00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:52.370
All those parts of the brain are still talking.

246
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.550
They're just not talking to each other very well anymore.

247
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.700
And that somehow knocks you out.

248
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.510
So lots of Chit chat amongst the different parts of my brain.

249
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:06.590
Make me conscious and not so much chitchat equals unconsciousness, you know,

250
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:11.240
that's the idea. And how do the slow waves, uh, relate to that?

251
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.780
Well, Patrick thinks of it in sort of in baseball terms,

252
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.480
<v 7>right? So actually I was at a red sox game, um, uh,</v>

253
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.690
the other day it was the last one that they had a, uh, with the,

254
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:24.540
with the Yankees, uh, at Fenway park this year. And, um,

255
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.260
at some point the wave started.

256
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.000
So some part of the stadium decided to to go into the wave and here,

257
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:31.461
here you go.

258
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:34.190
The waves coming around and coming around and you're watching it and it keeps

259
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:36.710
coming around and coming around and you know,

260
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.760
after a while it gets really tiresome because you're sitting there and just

261
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:45.140
like, okay, I've got a um, a wait for the wave to come. Okay, here's,

262
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:48.110
here it is like a kid stand up, raise our arms and sit back down. And,

263
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.560
and just a moment later and like, oh my God, I got to stand up again and,

264
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.060
and you're waiting. Oh dude, it's back again. And, and the thing is that when,

265
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:57.050
when the wave is going on in the stadium,

266
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.210
you can't really carry on a normal conversation.

267
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:00.530
You can't have a normal interaction.

268
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.900
You may not even be able to have a normal thought because the thing is just

269
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:05.480
coming by every couple seconds to interrupt you.

270
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.600
That is sort of the rationale for how these oscillations disrupt brain activity.

271
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.100
<v 0>I dig the analogy, but I'm not quite following.</v>

272
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:20.020
It helps to to zoom in on the brain and look at a smaller number of neurons.

273
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.390
Okay. Which is what he did. Now check this out.

274
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.100
We conducted this study where we measured brain activity and individual neurons.

275
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.370
They got some patients planted these tiny little electrodes deep into their

276
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.560
brains so they could hear the individual neurons.

277
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.561
So let's imagine that we zoom in to like tens to hundreds of neurons firing

278
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.690
and um, he says when they give that patient propafol and anesthetic,

279
00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:51.310
what we notice is that right at the point of loss of consciousness, sure enough,

280
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.800
they see those big slow waves sweeping through. And just like in Fenway,

281
00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:59.590
when the wave hits you, you have to stop your conversation.

282
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.510
But what that wave is really doing is it's only allowing each little cluster of

283
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:07.390
neurons to talk. Once in awhile.

284
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.750
They can only fire at a particular moment in this slow oscillation.

285
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.790
Like, you know, other wave goes up and down,

286
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.520
up and down or round and round and round. If you're on Penway,

287
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.830
it's only at this moment,

288
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.480
say that one group gets to talk problems. His buddy,

289
00:17:25.481 --> 00:17:30.481
he can only talk at this moment and the neurons next door or they can only talk

290
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:34.870
in this moment. Next group, same deal.

291
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.120
Everybody gets a turn to talk,

292
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.680
but they can't talk to each other because on slightly different schedules when

293
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:43.870
they're talking, the others can't listen.

294
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.600
So there's still a lot of talking going on.

295
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.630
But consciousness seems to be the talking and listening to itself.

296
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.090
So when that slow wave rolls around the neurons cat all fire at the same time

297
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:00.330
and talk to one another and in that state it would be impossible to be

298
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:03.120
conscious. It might be early to say,

299
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:06.660
but it does it feel kind of like you cracked the code? Well,

300
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:11.490
I think we are in the process of cracking the code for a anesthesia.

301
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.570
You don't ever want to get too far in limb, but honestly,

302
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.800
I mean I feel if we can educate people about these rhythms, I I, you know,

303
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:22.290
I'd be willing to say it. Sure. I, I think we have,

304
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:25.980
I mean I think this is going to be huge. I'm not going to lie to you.

305
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.370
I think this is just going to be absolutely huge. Yeah. Oh,

306
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.310
I'll take the bait on that. Sure. Frack the coke. Really that's,

307
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.630
that's a little bold. Well, what it means to Patrick

308
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.100
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

309
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.770
<v 0>is that in very practical terms, he can now peak into that,</v>

310
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:51.700
that black box of the brain. Okay. Here I am and wearing my scrubs. For example,

311
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.530
Patrick and his colleague Emery Brown.

312
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.510
I'm an anesthesiologist here at mass general.

313
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.290
They let me watch a couple of surgeries and I met a woman named Doris.

314
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.320
<v 2>Good morning. What kind of a surgery are you having today</v>

315
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.710
<v 0>that you know, 107 years ago would have been unthinkable, but here she is</v>

316
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.083
<v 2>not too worried.</v>

317
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.410
So they were about to give her the first anesthetic first anesthetic protocol.

318
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.050
That's right. Yet. And as she starts to go on there,

319
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.460
deep breath doors and stuff, some,

320
00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:26.450
I'm going to just switch over the,

321
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.200
the spectrogram display and see what it shows.

322
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.310
Deep breath doors on one of these monitors. Oh, look at that.

323
00:19:31.311 --> 00:19:34.850
Did you see the change? It's this color display. You can actually see it happen.

324
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.720
You can see the slow ways right now. Now she's got some slow oscillations.

325
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.830
If you imagine the screen is like this field of blues and yellows and Greens,

326
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.580
suddenly these bands of red just extend right along the bottom.

327
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.570
And considering that for the last hundred and 60 years,

328
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.790
anytime somebody like Doris has been put on a table and cut open,

329
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.470
the doctors basically couldn't be sure what was going on in their head.

330
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.280
Are they awake? Are they okay? And so with that in mind,

331
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.630
being there in the operating room and seeing that band of red appear on the

332
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:12.710
screen and hearing Emery brown declare without hesitation,

333
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.010
this patient is unconscious. It's kind of cool.

334
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.820
And you say that with a a w what percent confidence?

335
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.413
99.9

336
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.513
(999) 999-9999

337
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:51.443
[inaudible].

338
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.170
<v 8>And then I was in another room.</v>

339
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.000
Where did they all go?
