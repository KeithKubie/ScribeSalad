00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.089
It may be hot in the summer where you live,
but here’s a question: how hot is too hot?

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.300
Like, at what temperature does your body ACTUALLY
start to break down?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.470
That escalated quickly.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.300
Well, so have the world’s seasonal temperatures.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.980
In Death Valley, one of the hottest places
on earth, the average temperature for July

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.080
2018 was a whopping 42.3 degrees C. That’s
the warmest single month that’s ever been

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.680
reliably measured.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.790
In the WORLD.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.300
Seasons are getting more severe, especially
summers, which are accompanied by heat waves

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.169
that can be seriously deadly.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.909
In the U.S., extreme heat now causes more
deaths than all other weather-related hazards.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.609
Heat waves around Europe have been killing
record numbers of people, most notably since

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.879
2003, when unprecedented summer temperatures
resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:46.879
across Europe.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.379
And it shows no signs of slowing down, with
all-time high temperature records being broken

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.420
across the world.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.249
A new study is the first to project heat-related
mortality into the future.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.249
The conclusion?

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.839
If we don’t adapt to climate change, deaths
due to heat-waves will increase all over the

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:03.839
world.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.500
But how does heat actually kill you?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.100
Your body normally cools itself down by transferring
body heat to a cooler environment.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.560
We do this one of two ways: our blood vessels
dilate, bringing warm blood to flow close

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.020
to the surface of our skin where the heat
can be transferred to the air*--this is why

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.960
some people may appear flushed when they’re
hot.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.159
Alternatively, we lose the heat by sweating--the
liquid we release as sweat helps cool off

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.849
our skin and takes some of our body heat with
it as it evaporates.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:32.799
.
But our internal body temperature sits at

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.000
around 37°C.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.829
If the air surrounding us is as warm or warmer
than we are, we can’t transfer our heat

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.509
anywhere outside our bodies as we warm up.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.039
If humidity is high AND temperatures are high,
sweating doesn’t do as good a job at cooling

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.499
us off because it can’t evaporate--the air
around us is already too full of moisture.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.070
And when these conditions occur, as they do
in heat waves, it’s kind of amazing how

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.880
fast everything breaks down.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.369
If your body is starting to overheat, the
first thing you may notice is that you stop

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.579
sweating altogether . This means your hypothalamus,
the region of your brain that controls heat

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.520
regulation, has been compromised and has stopped
working properly.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.380
You now don’t have a way to give off heat,
and your body temperature may be rising.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
You may be feeling fatigued, your brain telling
your muscles to slow down, and you’re at

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.170
high risk of dizziness and even unconsciousness.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.660
Past 41°C, your body starts to shut down
in earnest.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.910
You may experience seizures or fall into a
coma as your tissues stop functioning properly

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.430
on a cellular and even protein level.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.080
Your organs start to leak toxins into your
body, and if left unchecked, this process

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.940
leads to multisystem organ damage, then failure,
and swiftly thereafter, death.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.510
And the thing is, temperatures don’t even
have to be that crazy--they just have to be

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.740
significantly greater than what that area
is typically used to.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.310
A 105 degree day in Arizona may not be that
different from the norm, but a 90 degree day

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.410
in Scotland could be deadly.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.910
Heat waves are also magnified in urban areas,
whose asphalt and metal buildings soak up

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.660
and store more heat than surrounding areas,
making cities even hotter than the heat waves

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.660
base temperature.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.501
And the places in the world that are hotter
to begin with will be hardest hit with the

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.590
highest temperatures--new projections estimate
that by 2100, countries in South Asia may

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.630
be too hot for people to survive.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.680
So could we adapt?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.180
New studies say probably not.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.860
If the projected warming does take place,
the amount of land rendered uninhabitable

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.170
because it’’ll be too hot for the human
body to handle could dwarf the amount of land

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.730
lost even to sea level rise, another huge
impending climate change concern.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.680
Just to reiterate, this means that some parts
of the world will eventually be so hot that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.220
we can’t live there because our bodies will
actually break down.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.280
Things are undeniably heating up. So, how do we get our way out of this one, guys?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.340
Like this one here that’s about a group
of surfer scientists who invented a new device

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.630
that monitors climate change from the surf
break.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.850
Also, we have some exciting new changes coming
to the channel and we can’t wait to show

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.850
you!

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.550
It’s gonna look a little different around
here guys, but it’ll be good, stay tuned.
