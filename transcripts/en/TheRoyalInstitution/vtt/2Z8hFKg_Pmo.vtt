00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:19.400
Human beings are a curious, inquisitive, exploratory
species.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.029
I think that has been the secret of our success
as a species.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.889
We now have reached a point in human history,
when all the Earth is explored;

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:34.960
there are no new places to explore on the Earth.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.059
At just this moment, these spacecraft permit
us, in a halting, tentative, preliminary way,

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.050
to leave the Earth and examine our surroundings in space.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:01:00.699
An enterprise which I believe is in the truest
human tradition of exploration and discovery.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.859
We are at an epochal moment.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.339
Our machines, and eventually ourselves, are going out into space.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.979
I believe that the history of our species
will never again be the same.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.970
We have committed ourselves to space, and
I do not think we are about to turn back.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.250
Artefacts from Earth are spinning out
into the cosmos. I believe the time will come

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.810
when most human cultures will be engaged in
an activity we might describe

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.420
as a dandelion going to seed.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.110
(An enterprise which I believe is in the truest
human tradition.)

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.929
(A dandelion, going to seed.)
