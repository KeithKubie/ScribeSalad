00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.610
Simplify x to the
third, and then that

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.410
raised to the fourth
power times x squared,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.160
and then that raised
to the fifth power.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.640
Now, here we're going to use
the power property of exponents,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.090
sometimes called
the "power rule."

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.305
And that just tells us
if I have x to the a,

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.610
and then I raise
that to b-th power,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.220
this is the same thing as
x to the a times b power.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.701
And to see why that works,
let's try that with a-- well,

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.200
I won't do it with
these right here.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.616
I'll do it with a
simpler example.

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.860
Let's say we are
taking x squared

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.515
and then raising that
to the third power.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.140
Well, in that situation,
that literally

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.080
means multiplying x squared
by itself three times.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.610
So that literally
means, x squared

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.360
times x squared times x squared.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm taking x squared and I'm
raising it to the third power.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.910
Now, what does this
mean over here?

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.750
Well, there's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.890
You could just say, look,
I have the same base,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.780
I'm taking the product, I
can just add the exponents.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.850
So this is going to be
equal to-- let me do it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.650
in that same magenta--
this is equal to x to the 2

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.500
plus 2 plus 2 power, or
essentially x to the 3 times 2.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.810
This right here
is just 3 times 2.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.692
So we get x to the sixth power.

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.150
And if you want,
you say, hey, Sal,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.170
I don't understand why you
can add those exponents.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.836
You just have to remember that x
squared-- this thing right over

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.900
here, we could
rewrite as x times x

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.850
times x times x--
in parentheses,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.190
I'm putting each of these x
squareds-- times x times x.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.950
And this is just x
times itself 6 times

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.780
x times x times x times
x times x times x.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.160
This is just x to
the sixth power.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.940
So that's why we can add
the exponents like that.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.210
So let's just use
that power property

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.130
on this expression
right over here.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.870
We start off with we have
x to the third raised

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.120
to the fourth power.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.140
So that's just going to be x
to the 3 times 4 power, or x

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.840
to the 12th power.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.900
Then, we're
multiplying that by x

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.330
squared raised to
the fifth power.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.350
Well, that's just going to be
x to the 2 times 5 power, or x

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.880
to the 10th power.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.940
And now we have the same base,
and we're taking the product,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.530
we can just add the exponents.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.490
This is going to be equal
to-- this whole expression

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.100
is going to be
equal to x to the 12

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.120
plus 10th power, or
x to the 22nd power.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.004
And we are done.
