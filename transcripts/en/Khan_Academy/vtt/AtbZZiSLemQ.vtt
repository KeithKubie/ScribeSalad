00:00:00.502 --> 00:00:02.970
- Let's remind ourselves,
give ourselves a review

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.853
of the Comparison Test,
see where it can be useful,

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:08.972
and maybe see where it might
not be so useful, but luckily

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.569
we'll also see the Limit Comparison Test,

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.520
which can be applicable in a
broader category of situations.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.053
So we've already seen
this, we want to prove

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:20.748
that the infinite series from
n equals one to infinity of

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:24.594
one over two to the n plus one
converges how can we do that?

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:28.025
Well, each of these terms are
greater than or equal to zero,

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:30.179
and we can construct another series where

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.255
each of the corresponding
terms are greater than

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.151
each of these corresponding terms.

00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.603
And that other series,
the one that jumps out at,

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:40.901
that will likely jump out
for most folks would be

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:45.118
one over two to the n,
one over two to the n is

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:50.118
greater than, is greater
than, and all we would

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.484
have to really say is
greater than or equal to, but

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:55.093
we could actually explicitly say it's, oh

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:57.110
I'll just write it's
greater than or equal to,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.119
one over two to the n plus one for,

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:06.085
n is equal to one, two, all
the way to infinity - why?

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:08.085
Because this denominator
is always going to be

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.719
greater by one if you're
denominator is greater,

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.602
the overall expression
is going to be less,

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.719
and because of that, because
each of these terms are,

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.836
they're all positive, this
one, each corresponding term is

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:26.267
greater than that one, and
by the Comparison Test,

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:28.700
because this one converges,
this kinda provides an

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.602
upper bound, because this series
we already know converges,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:35.368
we can say, so because this one converges,

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:38.652
we can say that this one converges.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:41.650
Now, let's see if we can
apply a similar logic

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.532
to a slightly different series.

00:01:44.532 --> 00:01:46.233
Let's say we have the series

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.826
the sum from n equals one to infinity of

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.730
one over two to the n minus one.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.863
In this situation can we do just

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:58.030
the straight up Comparison Test?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.562
Well no, because you cannot say that

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:03.447
one over two to the n is
greater than or equal to

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:05.573
one over two to the n minus one.

00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:07.662
Here, the denominator is lower, means

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:10.107
the expression is greater,
means that this can't,

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:12.940
each of these terms can't provide
an upper bound on this one.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.138
This one is a little bit larger,

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:17.307
but on the other hand you're
like, 'Ok, I get that.'

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:19.939
But look, as n gets large,
the two to the n is going to

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.724
really dominate the minus
one or the plus one, or

00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:26.724
this one has nothing there,
this one just has two to the n.

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:28.591
The two to the n is
really going to describe

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:30.591
the behavior of what this thing does.

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:32.756
And I would agree with you, but we just

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.474
haven't proven that it actually works,

00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:39.092
and that's where the Limit
Comparison Test comes in helpful.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:44.092
So let me write that down,
'Limit, Limit Comparison Test,

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:50.093
'Limit Comparison Test',
and I'll write it down

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:52.109
a little bit formally,
but then we'll apply it to

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.120
this infinite series right over here.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.318
So what Limit Comparison Test tells us,

00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:01.543
that if I have two infinite series,

00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:06.474
so this is going from n equals
k to infinity, of a sub n,

00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:07.525
I'm not going to prove it here,

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:09.792
we'll just learn to apply it first.

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:14.394
This one goes from n equals
k to infinity, of b sub n.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:18.761
And we know that each of
the terms, a sub n, are

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.728
greater than or equal to zero,

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:23.428
and we know each of
the terms, b sub n, are

00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:25.935
actually we're just going
to say, greater than zero,

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:26.997
because it's actually
going to show up in the

00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:28.281
denominator of an expression,

00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:30.213
so we don't want it to be equal to zero,

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:32.313
for all the n's that we care about.

00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:37.313
So for all n equal to k, k plus one,

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.804
k plus two, on and on, and on and on, and,

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.314
and this is the key, this
is where the limit of

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:47.466
the Limit Comparison Test comes into play,

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:52.466
and, if the limit, the limit
as n approaches infinity,

00:03:55.674 --> 00:04:00.674
of a sub n over b sub n, b sub n

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:05.281
is positive and finite,
is positive and finite,

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:12.890
that either both series converge,

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.698
or both series diverge,
so let me write that.

00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:20.536
So then, that tells us that either,

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:24.520
either both series converge,

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:30.458
or both diverge, which
is really really useful.

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:32.768
It's kind of a more
formal way of saying that,

00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:36.220
'Hey look, as n approaches
infinity, if these have similar

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.779
'behaviors then they are either going to

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.102
'converge, or they're
both going to diverge.'

00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:42.473
Let's apply that right over here.

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:45.777
Well if we say that our b sub n

00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:47.836
is one over two to the n, just like

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.664
we did up there, one over two to the n,

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.864
so we're going to compare, so these

00:04:51.864 --> 00:04:54.422
two series right over
here, notice it satisfies

00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:58.301
all of these constraints,
so let's take the limit,

00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.864
the limit as n approaches infinity

00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:05.187
of a sub over b sub n, so it's going to be

00:05:05.187 --> 00:05:10.187
one over two to the n minus one over

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:15.288
one over two to the n, and
what's that going to be equal to?

00:05:16.723 --> 00:05:18.458
Well that's going to be equal to

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:23.098
the limit as n approaches infinity, of

00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:25.617
two, if you divide by
one over two to the n

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.426
that's just going to be the
same thing as multiplying

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:28.962
by two to the n, so it's going to be

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:33.893
two to the n over two to the n minus one.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.856
Over two to the n minus
one, and this clearly,

00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:39.605
what's happening in the
numerator and the denominator,

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:43.055
these are approaching the
same, well we can even

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:45.096
write it like, we can
even write it like this,

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:47.002
divide the numerator and
denomiator by two to the n,

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:48.602
if you want, although it's probably

00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:50.274
going to jump out at you at this point.

00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:56.181
So, limit as n approaches infinity,

00:05:56.447 --> 00:05:58.063
let me just scroll over
to the right a little bit.

00:05:58.063 --> 00:06:00.199
If I divide the numerator by two to the n,

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.996
I'm just going to have one.

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:04.064
If I divide the denominator
by two to the n,

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:09.064
I'm going to have one minus
one over two to the n.

00:06:09.325 --> 00:06:11.624
And now it becomes clear,
this thing right over here

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:13.245
is just going to go to zero, and you're

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:15.112
going to have one over one.

00:06:15.112 --> 00:06:16.945
The important thing is that

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:21.530
this limit is positive and
finite because this thing is

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.530
so this thing right over
here, is positive and finite,

00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:30.941
the limit is one is positive and finite,

00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:33.675
if this thing converges and
this thing converges, or

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:35.826
this thing diverges, and this diverges,

00:06:35.826 --> 00:06:39.357
well, we already know
this thing converges,

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.391
it's a geometric series where the

00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.091
common ratio is less than
one, and so therefore

00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:50.091
this must converge as well,
so that converges as well.
