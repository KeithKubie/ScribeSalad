00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.180
Most likely, the best answer for this, are the

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.990
individuals that share five shorter segments. Now this was

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.010
kind of a tough problem and you really could

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.210
have gone with either answer, depending on how long, the

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.680
long segment is between those shared individuals. For the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.690
single segment to be ranked higher than the five short

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.790
ones it would have to roughly be about five

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.240
times bigger than any of the short segments by themselves.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.656
Assuming that they're all about the same size. Identity

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:31.198
by decent or IBD detection algorithms have a threshold

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.047
from which they consider a segment to be long

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:37.610
enough to be reported as Identity by Decent. So the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.365
single segment would have to be pretty big. Now,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.030
due to the fact that recombination occurs on every chromosome

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.480
in each generation, it's unlikely, very unlikely that a

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.280
long segment would be transmitted along one chromosome and nothing

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.190
on the others. But, how unlikely this is depends on the size of the segment.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.090
Either way, if you were to see

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.040
a difference or comparison like this, you definitely

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.940
have to go back, examine your code

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.849
and think about the genetics behind what's going

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.480
on to best represent the outcome that should

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.210
be true. Computational biologists are really smart people.
