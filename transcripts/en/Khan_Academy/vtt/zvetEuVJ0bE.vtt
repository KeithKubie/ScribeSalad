00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.240
- So we have the number 35, which is 3 tens,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.459
because we have a 3 in the tens place,

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.130
so we have 3 tens,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.597
and we have a 5 in the ones place.

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.400
So, this is the ones place,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.814
I'll do the ones place in that same purple color.

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:18.370
This is the ones place,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.272
and we see it represented here as 5,

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:22.828
as 5 ones.

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:24.961
So 35 is the same thing as

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.651
3 tens and 5 ones.

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.119
3 tens and 5 ones.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.393
Now, what we wanna do with this video is subtract 8 from 35,

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:34.883
and I encourage you to pause the video and

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:37.795
try to figure out what 35 minus 8 is.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.126
Alright, so let's think about it.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:44.375
We have 5 ones, and we wanna take away 8 ones from there.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.255
Well, we don't know how to take 8 ones if we only have 5.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.414
We could take away 5, but then we're all out of ones,

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:51.527
so how do we take away 8?

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:53.617
Well, this is where regrouping is valuable,

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.425
because we don't only have 5 squares.

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.864
We actually have 35 squares.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.675
We have 3 groups of ten squares,

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.765
and then we have the 5 ones.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.574
So what if we were to take one of these groups of ten,

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:07.384
right now it's in the tens place,

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.916
and we were to regroup it into the ones place?

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.610
So let's say we were to take this group right over here,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.257
if we were to take this group of 10,

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:18.136
and instead of expressing it in the tens place,

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:20.390
let's put it in the ones place.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.479
So let's move it over here,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120
and in the ones place, it would be,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.961
so 1 ten is the same thing as 10 ones,

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:30.744
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:35.160
7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.920
So what just happened there?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.801
I took away one of the tens,

00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:41.680
so now I only have 2 tens,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.745
and I took those 10 and put them in the ones place.

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:46.718
So I have the original 5 ones,

00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:48.692
and then I have the new 10

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.457
that I just took from the tens place.

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:52.686
So 5 plus 10 is going to be 15,

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:57.167
so I now have 15 ones.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.837
And now I can take away 8.

00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:02.647
So, if I take away 8 now,

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:05.380
I would take away 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.900
5, 6, 7, 8, just to be clear.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.773
I'm taking away 8.

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:12.537
And so what am I going to be left with?

00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:15.580
Well, I'm gonna be left with 2 tens,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.296
I'm gonna be left with 2 tens,

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.983
and how many ones?

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:24.589
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ones.

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.609
7 ones right over here.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.246
Now how do we do it if I didn't wanna

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.243
draw all of these things?

00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:33.210
Well, you would've said: Alright, I have

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.831
3 tens and 5 ones, this is where we started,

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.952
but I took one of those tens,

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:41.442
I took one of those tens away so I only have 2 tens now,

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:45.151
and I took that group of 10 and put it in the ones place,

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.660
so it's 10 ones.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.145
So the 5 ones, plus another 10 ones,

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.420
give us 15 ones.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.952
15 ones.

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:57.132
And so you can say I have 15 ones minus 8 ones is 7 ones,

00:02:57.132 --> 00:03:00.383
which we see over here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:03.308
so after doing the subtraction, we have 7 ones,

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.396
and then I'll have 2 tens left in the tens place.

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:10.780
So 2 tens, 7 ones. 27.
