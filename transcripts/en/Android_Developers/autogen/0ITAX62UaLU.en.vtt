00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.960
 MARK BENNETT: My name is Mark Bennett. 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.730
 In fact, I am still a newcomer on the Google and Google Play teams. 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 Because I just got started in January this year. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.270
 But this year I really benefited a lot. 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.125
 Play is a passionate and challenging business 

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.050
 I am honored to witness some of the things that happened. 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.117
 Our agenda today is quite compact 

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.700
 Today, everyone will still hear 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.190
 Let's introduce more cool content 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.410
 My task is simple 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.450
 It is about the development of Play and Android in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.690
 Then let's get started. 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.790
 Let's first talk about our Android platform. 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.740
 Android platform since its release 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.750
 Has achieved rapid growth in the past 7 years 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 Last year we announced a milestone with amazing numbers. 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.560
 That is, the number of effective devices currently exceeds 1 billion. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.882
 This is incredible 

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.620
 Another incredible number is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.350
 The number of activations per day reaches 1.5 million 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.870
 Obviously, this reflects Android 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.350
 Success in the field of smartphones and tablets 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.480
 In addition, Android is also constantly expanding to other platforms. 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.680
 Such as Android TV, wearable devices 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 Even a car 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 As the ecosystem continues to expand 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.340
 The number of OEMs working with us will also increase 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.260
 More than 200 OEMs have developed Android products. 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.000
 This number is also amazing 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 The last part about the ecosystem 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.850
 Operator partnership 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.280
 We and the world 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.260
 More than 330 operators cooperate to sell Android devices 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.840
 Play users can also purchase devices from them 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.570
 Then, when it comes to market share, it’s also a great achievement. 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
 This is Android's market share in the smartphone market in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.430
 Share a good news with you here. 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.970
 That is, our market share has been growing since last year. 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 This is the result of our collaboration with a research company called Canalys. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.350
 This share has increased from 72% to 77% 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.800
 It can be said that our development momentum is booming. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.760
 And our development on the tablet is also very good. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.800
 Currently, three-fifths of tablets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are powered by Android. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.170
 The same is a strong development momentum 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.390
 And the future is bright 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.610
 Forecasts show that in the next 5 years 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.960
 The number of smartphones will double 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.940
 By 2019, smartphones in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will exceed 1.25 billion 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.400
 You can see the biggest share of this growth. 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.910
 Will come from Android 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.690
 To mention, this is the big piece of green in the bar chart. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.950
 So that everyone didn't notice 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.560
 The development trend in the next few years is worth looking forward to. 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.160
 Because Android will continue to open up new markets. 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.225
 Especially worth looking forward to 

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.700
 These emerging markets 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.870
 Last year, we talked about Android One. 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.310
 At the time, our product director Michael Siliski 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.540
 Announced the plan 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.561
 That is Google wants to expand Android's market share in emerging markets. 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.710
 Even though we have achieved the above growth 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.280
 But only a quarter of the world’s people own smartphones. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 And Google’s ambition is to let the remaining 5 billion people 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.530
 Can also access the Internet via mobile devices 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.940
 Android One is our OEM 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.080
 A plan jointly launched by chip manufacturers 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760
 Designed to deliver high quality hardware at a very low cost 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.480
 Pushing to these emerging markets 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.920
 About Android One, I guess what is most expecting everyone. 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910
 Or the things that everyone is most interested in. 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.550
 No, these devices are equipped with the latest version of the Android system. 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.860
 We all know that this is very important 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.639
 Last year, we announced 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.930
 Bring Android One to market 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330
 I am very happy to tell you here. 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.310
 So far we have launched Android One in several countries, including India, Pakistan, Thailand 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.350
 Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria and Turkey 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.990
 In addition, Android One is expanding its market in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.170
 We promoted it to Egypt, Ghana, Kenya 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.620
 Spain, Morocco and Egypt 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.000
 I seem to have said Egypt twice. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.120
 The growth momentum is amazing 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.530
 We are really happy to see Android One 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.840
 Can make more users in emerging markets 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.525
 Enjoy a truly high quality experience at a low cost 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.480
 The size of the Android market is so big, I think 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.100
 It’s no exaggeration to say that Android is the world’s largest application platform. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.230
 More than 1 million apps are currently available in the Play Store. 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.360
 The number of downloads has reached 50 billion, which is really amazing. 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.230
 Android users can be in nearly 200 markets 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.230
 Download your app 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.250
 And it’s important to pay for these apps in 134 markets. 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.680
 We all know that paying is the key 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.850
 In the past year, we have been in 32 markets. 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.750
 Added 61 payment methods 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.160
 This makes more than 400 million Android users 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.110
 Ability to purchase apps on Play with a new payment method 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.850
 In addition, we have increased payment methods in some key areas. 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.430
 Allow users to shop on Play with different payment methods 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.050
 The market that supports DCB payment methods has increased from 25 in 2014 to 37 today. 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.870
 Just a few weeks ago 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.710
 We talked to Russian telecom operator MTS about a big deal. 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.530
 Now we are in the Russian market 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.920
 Almost all operators can be deducted 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.350
 The market for gift card payments has increased from 18 in 2014 to 28 today. 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 The last thing to say is the Paypal payment method we just launched last year. 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.652
 Now available in 21 markets 

00:05:29.652 --> 00:05:31.110
 Such as in the German market 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.120
 It has greatly promoted our business development 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.820
 We are very happy to see this February 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.770
 Annie mentioned the scale of Google Play development in Germany 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.550
 More than Apple's App Store 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.690
 Therefore, increasing the payment method will help promote the development of the entire ecosystem. 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.730
 The good news is that our developers are like everyone here. 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.050
 Can get a return 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.860
 In 2014 we announced the amount paid to developer partners 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.460
 From $5 billion in 2013 and $2 billion in 2012 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.380
 Increased to $7 billion today 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.670
 It can be said that our development momentum is still booming and the business is also developing rapidly. 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.700
 The outlook is a good one. 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.320
 Today, everyone will hear about many topics. 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.270
 Let you know how we keep listening to everyone’s opinions 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.810
 And how to build a better platform for you. 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.090
 For everyone to distribute their apps, discover and monetize customers 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.260
 And I will talk about three important topics today. 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.230
 Including more effective ways to explore business opportunities 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.150
 That’s how we can help you discover users in your app. 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.620
 Use more tools to help you publish your app with confidence 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.810
 And help you find and retain users more easily 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.710
 First, let's talk about how to find business opportunities in a more efficient way. 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.480
 Play platform allows you 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.280
 Products that are built and released to the market by themselves 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.750
 Connect with users with the same interests, enthusiasm, and needs 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.330
 One of our key tasks is 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.500
 Strive to create a personalized and tailored store experience 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.600
 So that users are constantly coming to us. 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.974
 Let them find the ideal application 

00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:06.860
 And the games that they can’t put down 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.140
 Feel happy 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.220
 First, let’s make the Play Store very personal. 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.080
 We have begun to take full advantage of Google’s expertise in machine learning. 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.050
 To provide a more personalized service 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.320
 Display recommended content that meets your needs immediately after the Play user logs in to the store 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.800
 In addition, we are creating more app collections 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.170
 And will add more types of personalized services 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.950
 Because we know to provide users with recommendations that meet their needs. 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.770
 Can double the number of app downloads in the store 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.960
 We also added a guided search function 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.380
 In this way, users who access Play only need to search 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.530
 Generic terminology 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.210
 Like "photography" 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.960
 The system will then display a list of related applications. 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.820
 Various apps that match the search terms like "photography" 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.300
 Will be displayed together 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.960
 Taking "photography" as an example, the system will display the photo editing application and the collage application for the user. 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.020
 we all know 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.430
 We know that when a user searches for a particular word 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.505
 Give it a wider range of applications 

00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:09.492
 Can increase downloads 

00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:10.950
 the last one 

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.699
 We are more concerned about the field of development 

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.900
 Is a topic-based discovery feature 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.310
 We feel that topic-based recommendations are more interesting to users. 

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.980
 Rather than casually judging 

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.530
 Recommend some apps to users 

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.860
 For example, put together a series of applications 

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.540
 For popular search content types for the weekend 

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.945
 There are also games that users can enjoy. 

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:30.570
 We think this is the way 

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.230
 Can also deepen interaction with Play Store users 

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.200
 The family has always been a field that Google values. 

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.150
 I believe everyone has seen that Google has put a lot of effort into it. 

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:45.130
 Ensure that our products and services are more closely linked to home and home security 

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.000
 The same is true for Play. 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.840
 We have been with many people before the I/O conference. 

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.660
 Started cooperation on content grading and submission 

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.600
 To classify your applications into the family experience. 

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.410
 We have previously announced this measure. 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.620
 Now you can see relevant navigation information in the Play Store. 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.450
 Convenient for parents according to different age groups 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.180
 Search by batch, even by popular characters 

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.300
 To find content that suits you and your family 

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.900
 This is a very crucial step for us. 

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.270
 We found a home browsing experience 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.637
 The number of applications has risen sharply 

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.490
 So if you have a family-friendly app 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.210
 Be sure to classify them appropriately and include them in the “Family” section. 

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.520
 Also, besides letting our users 

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.190
 Find quality apps and games more easily 

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.980
 We are constantly listening to your opinions and building more powerful tools. 

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.510
 So that you can publish apps and get users. 

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.890
 More important is to let you know how you can optimize your product. 

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.290
 To retain these users 

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.240
 As you can see, the number of tools and features 

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.630
 Growing year by year 

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.520
 We will also introduce to you 

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.310
 More upcoming cool features and services 

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.100
 Help you build better apps 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.630
 In the months of communication with developers 

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.130
 One topic I have been hearing is 

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.420
 That is, Play can help you make repeated improvements. 

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.470
 Let you get your product to market quickly 

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.730
 Select user groups to test to find possible and infeasible designs 

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.270
 It's easy for you to decide how to invest to get users 

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.730
 And learn how to lose before users 

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.380
 Retain these users 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.280
 Before I start introducing my theme 

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.526
 I want to share three examples. 

00:10:39.526 --> 00:10:41.400
 The first example is Wooga 

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.150
 I was lucky enough to travel to Berlin early this year. 

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.180
 Visited Wooga employees in their great office 

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.680
 I know that some of them have come today. 

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.060
 I am very happy to hear them again how to use them. 

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.390
 Beta test, phased release 

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.320
 Understand what aspects of the app are loved by users 

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.126
 And why users give up using their apps. 

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:03.250
 They are the first to make repeated improvements on the Android platform. 

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.780
 This makes me very happy 

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.880
 Everyone should have noticed an application in today’s opening video. 

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.880
 Olivier, founder of RogerVoice, shares an exciting entrepreneurial story 

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.950
 This application has revolutionized the telecommunications industry 

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.830
 It allows people with hearing impairments to communicate by phone. 

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.850
 He is the same as Wooga 

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.650
 Also make repeated improvements on the Android platform. 

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.840
 In fact, it is also preferred to release the app on the Android platform. 

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.370
 Finally, I want to share a good case. 

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.100
 This case comes from our developer My.com in Russia. 

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.030
 They developed an excellent war game "Might and Glory" 

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.710
 They’re giving priority to publishing this game on the Android platform. It’s really super wise. 

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.430
 This is the end of my speech. 

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.190
 I hope everyone on Google Play on the Android platform. 

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.000
 A deeper understanding of business scale, success stories, and bright prospects 

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.620
 Today our purpose is mainly to provide more information for everyone. 

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.060
 But also to listen to everyone’s opinions. 

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.770
 Get more feedback and let us know how we can 

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.920
 Make Play a better platform 

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.676
 Therefore, I am very much looking forward to discussing with you as much as possible today. 

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.100
 thank you all!
