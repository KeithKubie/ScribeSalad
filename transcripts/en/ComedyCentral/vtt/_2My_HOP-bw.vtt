00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:03.504
- [Nathan] My mission was
to make Oak Glen Petting Zoo

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:07.015
a destination, what they
needed was a star animal.

00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:10.861
The plan to create a hero
pig by staging a viral video

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:13.565
in which he rescues a
baby goat from drowning.

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:15.097
- Oh, okay.

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:17.321
- So I think if you had a
video like that people would

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.119
come from places as foreign as Japan

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.087
and even more foreign like China.

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:24.254
Just to see your hero pig.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.690
- That would be great.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.850
- The first step was picking our animals.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.423
Vince would be our hero pig

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:32.877
and Gangsta the goat would be our victim.

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:35.375
The zoo had a large trout pond
so this would be the setting

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.736
for our rescue.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.327
But when I brought Vince near the water

00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:40.477
I realized he was an incredible coward.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.188
(pig squealing)
Okay, okay.

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:44.436
So we hired some animal
handlers to bring in

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:47.599
a professional movie pig that
looked identical to Vince.

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:50.207
The question now was how do we get a pig

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:51.972
to rescue a goat on camera?

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:53.705
Answer, you can't.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:56.976
So I decided to have two scuba
divers secretly submerged

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:59.692
beneath the animals guiding
the pig towards the goat

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.962
to make it look like a real rescue.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:04.369
During the first couple
attempts the pig kept slipping

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.841
out of the diver's hands.

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.775
So we decided to build an
underwater track out of PBC

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:11.041
to guide the pig like a bowling ball

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.499
going down a bumper lane.

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.955
This worked a lot better and
I was hopeful it would fool

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:18.664
the internet audience into
believing this video was real.

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:21.027
But as the amount of people
involved began to grow

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:24.672
including animal trainers,
stuntmen and Humane Society reps,

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:27.669
I started to get worried after
all word couldn't get out

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:30.295
that this was fake or it
would be a disastrous scandal

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:31.724
for Oak Glen.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.121
So I asked everyone on set to
sign non-disclosure agreements

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.908
stating that they swore not to tell anyone

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.358
the rescue was fake or
else they would face

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:41.827
the death penalty even
though my lawyer said

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:43.976
the death penalty clause
was not enforceable,

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.306
I still wanted to keep it in there

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.313
so people knew how serious I was.

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:49.961
After several failed attempts

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:52.985
we finally got the rescue on tape

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:55.485
(goat crying)

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:59.415
(dramatic music)
