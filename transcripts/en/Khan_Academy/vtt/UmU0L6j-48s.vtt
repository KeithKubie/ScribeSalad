00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Voiceover] "At time t is
greater than or equal to zero,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.550
"a particle moving along
a curve in the xy-plane

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.290
"has position x of t and y of t."

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.460
So its coordinate is given
by the parametric function

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.640
x of t, and y-coordinate by the
parametric function, y of t.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.990
"With velocity vector v of t is equal to,"

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.090
and the x component of the velocity vector

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.730
is cosine of t squared,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.570
and the y component of the velocity vector

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.920
is e to the 0.5t.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.660
"At t equals one,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.198
"the particle is at
the point 3, comma, 5."

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.200
Is at the point 3, comma, five.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.387
All right.

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:39.467
"Find the x-coordinate of
the position of the particle

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.683
"at time t is equal to two."

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:45.709
All right, so how do we think about this?

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.640
Well, you could view the
x-coordinate at time t equals two.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.600
So let's say, so we
could say x at time two,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.276
which they don't give that to us directly,

00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:01.270
but we could say that's
going to be x of one

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.540
plus some change in x

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.130
as we go from t equals
one to t equals two.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.218
But what is this going to be?

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.920
Well, we know what the velocity is.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.500
And so the velocity,
especially the x component,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.180
and we can really focus on the x component

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.740
for this first part
'cause we only wanna know

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.472
the x-coordinate of the
position of the particle.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:26.010
Well, we know the x component of velocity

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.160
as a function of t

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.160
is cosine of t squared.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.000
And if you take your velocity
in a certain dimension

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.737
and then multiply it times
a very small change in time,

00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:41.800
in a very small change in time, dt,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.450
this would give you your
very small change in x.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.610
If you multiply velocity
times change in time,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.092
it'll give you a displacement.

00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:53.000
But what we can do is we can
sum up all of the changes

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.930
in time from t equals one to t equals two.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.855
Remember, this is the change in x

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:02.510
from t equals one

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.115
to t is equal to two.

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:06.570
So what we have right over here,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.160
we can say that x of two,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.013
which is what we're trying to solve,

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:11.860
is going to be x of one,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.160
and they give that at time equals one,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.600
the particle is at the
point three, comma, five.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.454
Its x-coordinate is three.

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:20.950
So this right over here is three.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.930
And then our change in x from t equals one

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.940
to t equals two is going
to be this integral.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.540
The integral from t
equals one to t equal two

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.420
of cosine of t squared, dt.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.330
And just to make sure we
understand what's going on here,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.800
remember, how much are we
moving over a very small dt?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.000
Well, you take your
velocity in that dimension

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.800
times dt, it'll give you a
displacement in that dimension,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.030
and then we sum 'em all
up from t equals one

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.022
to t equals two.

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:49.730
And in this part of the AP test,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.360
we're allowed to use calculators

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.494
and so let's use one.

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:54.902
All right.

00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:57.808
So there's my calculator.

00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:00.590
And I can evaluate.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.192
So let's see, I wanna evaluate three

00:03:03.192 --> 00:03:05.050
plus the definite integral.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.470
I click on Math,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.732
and then I can scroll down

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:11.680
to function integral, right there.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.865
The definite integral of,

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:15.790
and I make sure I'm in radian mode,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.172
that's what you should assume,

00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:19.900
unless they tell you otherwise.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.050
Cosine of t squared, now
I'll use x as my variable

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.900
of integration, so I'll say cosine of x,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.707
cosine of x squared.

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.370
And then my variable of integration is x,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.290
so I'm really integrating
of x squared, dx,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.280
but it'll give the same value,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.515
comma, from one

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.903
until two,

00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:44.390
and now let the calculator
munch on it a little bit,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.207
and I get approximately 2.557.

00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:51.950
So this is approximately

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.541
2.55,

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.197
2.557.

00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:00.620
Let me make sure that I added the three.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.180
Yeah, three plus that definite integral

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.040
from one to two.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.810
2.557.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.920
And I just rounded that.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.040
So there you go.
