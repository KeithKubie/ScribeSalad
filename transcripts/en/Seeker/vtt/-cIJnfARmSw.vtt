00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.940
Usually the older you get... the harder it
is to remember some things...

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.240
And we know a little bit about what goes wrong
in the aging brain.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.920
But is this inevitable?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.210
Everyone knows that one old person who is
90 but acts like they’re still young.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.309
But HOW?

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.779
For answers, scientists are looking at people
known as superagers..and checkin’ out their

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.779
brains.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.279
The term was coined by this guy.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.039
Neurologist Dr. Marsel Mesulam

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.083
In this group there’s something that prevents
the loss of brain substance

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:29.499
we found actually over an 18 month period
the shrinkage in the brains of superagers

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.350
is less than average elderly”
Until this term was coined, researchers had

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.120
been focused on so called successful agers...

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.239
But what does that mean??

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.250
It’s not specific!

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.109
Successful aging could mean you’re physically
fit or just have a positive outlook - the

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.170
meaning was so broad it was hard to quantify
and compare research.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.540
Now researchers are being more specific--
Superagers are people older than 80 with memories

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.200
just as good as someone in their 50s or 60s.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.780
But we need to know: what makes their brains
different?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.659
Were they bigger to start with?

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.839
Did they shrink but just not as fast?

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.799
Or did they actually get bigger over time?

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.479
Do genetics factor in?

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.799
What about personality?

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.700
Usually as humans age brains atrophy or shrink..

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.290
But researchers found the cortices of superager
brains are not as thin as expected.. and most

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.060
surprising... one part is thicker.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.369
For reasons that we don’t understand there
is a little patch in the cingulate cortex

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.530
that seems to be thicker in superagers not
just compared to average elderly individuals

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.460
but compared to 50 and 60 year olds this is
pretty astounding

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.140
And within the thicker anterior cingulate
region of the cortex was another difference…

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.649
the superager brains had 3 to 5 times more
von Economo neurons…

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.490
These neurons are believed to help process
information faster and they’re linked to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.520
higher social intelligence… animals like
whales and elephants and apes all have von

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.180
Economo neurons.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.810
Beyond the anterior cingulate cortex… other
research shows 2 more areas that may be protected

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.969
in superager brains.. the midcingulate cortex
and the anterior insula were just as thick

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.770
as the younger control group … with no signs
of that thinning that usually comes with aging.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.510
So… superager’s brains don’t seem to
atrophy as much as regular brains.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.900
Though we don’t know why… but we haven’t
even talked about Alzheimer’s.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900
On the one hand...

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.870
A recent study found superager brains had
about 90% fewer neurofibrillary tangles -- twisted

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.230
protein fibers that block information transfer
-- and 90% fewer f -- protein clumps that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.410
damage healthy brain cells -- both are markers
for Alzheimer’s disease.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.750
On the other hand the latest research shows
some superager brains had major signs of Alzheimer’s

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.410
-- in the form of tangles and plaques -- but
they had no symptoms.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.560
In this area, somehow, superagers defy the
odds!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.670
Their brains could be more resistant to Alzheimer’s
or just more resilient.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.270
There’s a lot we still don’t know.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.040
So, what do you and I have to do to become
a superager?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.030
Some researchers at Massachusetts General
suggest that working hard may work.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.810
Both physically and mentally.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.860
They admit it’s just a best guess theory.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.170
But there is a lot of research suggesting
exercising the body may protect the brain…

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.490
But, when it comes to mental exercise… they
say simple brain games are not enough.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.900
They believe you have to work until your brain
feels a little crappy.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.750
You know that feeling when it hurts to think..

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.860
That’s a real physical condition!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.580
A study in mice found that prolonged concentration
depletes glucose in the brain and may play

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.610
a role in that foggy feeling.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.670
We obviously don’t have all the answers
or superagers wouldn’t be so super.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.770
More research is needed.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.200
What’s the internet doing to our memories…
making better .. worse..

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.450
Find out in this video.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.650
Do you know any superagers?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.190
your grandma or grandpa?
