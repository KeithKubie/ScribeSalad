00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.120
Use the real 0's of the
polynomial function y

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.230
equal to x to the third plus
3x squared plus x plus 3

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.020
to determine which of the
following could be its graph.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.800
So there's several ways
of trying to approach it.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.320
One, we could just look at what
the 0's of these graphs are

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.350
or what they appear to be and
then see if this function is

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.870
actually 0 when x
is equal to that.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.554
So for example, in graph
A-- and first of all,

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:28.470
as always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.470
and try it before I show
you how to solve it.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.470
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.180
So let's look at this
first graph here.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.630
Its 0, it clearly has a
0 right at this point.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.270
And just by trying to
inspect this graph,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.830
it looks like this is at
x is equal to negative 3,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.860
if I were to estimate.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.360
So that looks like the
point negative 3, 0.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.940
So let's see, if we substitute
x equals negative 3 here,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.650
whether we get y equaling 0.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.130
So let's see, negative 3
to the third power plus 3

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.250
times negative 3 squared
plus negative 3 plus 3.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.730
What does this give us?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.500
This gives us negative 27.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.060
This gives us positive 27.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.650
This gives, of
course, negative 3.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.640
This is plus 3.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.660
These two cancel out.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.810
These two cancel out.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.650
This does indeed equal 0.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.500
So this was actually
pretty straightforward.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.130
Graph A does indeed work.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.265
You could try
graph B right here,

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:36.790
and you would have to
verify that we have a 0 at,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.960
this looks like negative 2.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.965
Another one, this looks like at
1, another one that looks at 3.

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:46.590
And since we already know that
A is the answer, none of these--

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.260
if you were to input x equals
negative 2, x equals 1,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.100
or x equals 3 into this function
definition right over here,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.700
you should not get 0.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.430
And you'll see that
this doesn't work.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.429
Same thing for this one.

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.310
If you tried 4 or
7 for your x's, you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.280
should not get 0
over here, because we

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.160
see that the real function
does not equal 0 at 4 or 7.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.639
Another giveaway that this is
not going to be the function

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.990
is that you are going to
have a total of three roots.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.470
Let me write this down.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.970
So you're going to have
a total of three roots.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.080
Now, , those three roots could
be real or complex roots.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
And the big key is complex
roots come in pairs.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.986
So you might have a situation
with three real roots.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.860
And this is an example
with three real roots,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.360
although we know
this actually isn't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.010
the function right over here.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.190
Or if you have one
complex root, you're

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.940
going to have
another complex root.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.680
So if you have
any complex roots,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.735
the next possibility is one
real and two complex roots.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.859
And this right over
here has two real roots.

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:03.900
That's not a possibility.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.980
That would somehow imply that
you have only one complex root,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.617
which that is not a possibility.

00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:16.950
Now another way that you could
have thought about this--

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.300
and this would have
been the longer way.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.180
But let's say you didn't
have the graphs here for you,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.530
and someone asked you to
just find the roots-- well,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.550
you could have attempted
to factor this.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.040
And this one actually
is factorable.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.110
y is equal to x to the third
plus 3x squared plus x plus 3.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.330
As mentioned in previous videos,
factoring things of a degree

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.490
higher than 2, there is
something of an art to it.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.241
But oftentimes, if
someone expects you to,

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.490
you might be able to group
things in interesting ways,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.670
especially when you see
that several terms have

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.210
some common factors.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.500
So for example, these first
two terms right over here

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.334
have the common
factor x squared.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.750
So if you were to
factor that out,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.160
you would get x squared
times x plus 3, which is neat

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.630
because that looks a lot
like the second two terms.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.710
We could write that as
plus 1 times x plus 3.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.720
And then you can factor
the x plus 3 out.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.510
We could factor
the x plus 3 out,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:21.250
and we would get x plus
3 times x squared plus 1.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.440
And now, your 0's
are going to happen,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.650
or this whole y--
remember this is

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.030
equal to y-- y is
going to equal 0

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.780
if either one of these
factors is equal to 0.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.790
So when does x plus 3 equal 0?

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.630
Well, subtract 3
from both sides.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.575
That happens when x is
equal to negative 3.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.090
When does x squared plus
1 equal 0, I should say?

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.180
Well, when x squared
is equal to negative 1.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.210
Well, there's no real
x's, no real valued x's.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.900
There's no real
number x's such that x

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.440
squared is equal to negative 1.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.686
x is going to be
an imaginary-- or I

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.810
guess I'll just say it in
more general terms-- it's

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.132
going to be complex valued.

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.590
So once again, you
see you're going

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.050
to have a pair of
complex roots, and you

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:27.000
have one real root at x
is equal to negative 3.
