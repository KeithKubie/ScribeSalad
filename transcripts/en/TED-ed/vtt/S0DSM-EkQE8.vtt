00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
What is proof?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.976
And why is it so important in mathematics?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.976
Proofs provide a solid
foundation for mathematicians

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.976
logicians, statisticians,
economists, architects, engineers,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.976
and many others to build
and test their theories on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.976
And they're just plain awesome!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.976
Let me start at the beginning.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.976
I'll introduce you
to a fellow named Euclid.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.976
As in, "here's looking at you, Clid."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.976
He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.976
and he's considered by many to be
the father of geometry.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.096
So if you've been wondering where
to send your geometry fan mail,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.976
Euclid of Alexandria is the guy
to thank for proofs.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.976
Euclid is not really known for inventing
or discovering a lot of mathematics

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
but he revolutionized the way
in which it is written,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.976
presented, and thought about.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.976
Euclid set out to formalize mathematics
by establishing the rules of the game.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.976
These rules of the game are called axioms.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.976
Once you have the rules,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.976
Euclid says you have to use them
to prove what you think is true.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.976
If you can't, then your theorem or idea

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.976
might be false.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.667
And if your theorem is false, then
any theorems that come after it and use it

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.976
might be false too.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.976
Like how one misplaced beam can
bring down the whole house.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.976
So that's all that proofs are:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.976
using well-established rules to prove
beyond a doubt that some theorem is true.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.976
Then you use those theorems like blocks

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
to build mathematics.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.976
Let's check out an example.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.096
Say I want to prove
that these two triangles

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.976
are the same size and shape.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.976
In other words, they are congruent.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
Well, one way to do
that is to write a proof

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
that shows that all three sides
of one triangle

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
are congruent to all three sides
of the other triangle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
So how do we prove it?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.976
First, I'll write down what we know.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.976
We know that point M
is the midpoint of AB.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.976
We also know that sides AC
and BC are already congruent.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.976
Now let's see. What does
the midpoint tell us?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.976
Luckily, I know
the definition of midpoint.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.976
It is basically the point in the middle.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.976
What this means is that AM
and BM are the same length,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
since M is the exact middle of AB.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.976
In other words, the bottom side
of each of our triangles are congruent.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
I'll put that as step two.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.976
Great! So far I have two pairs
of sides that are congruent.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
The last one is easy.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.976
The third side of the left triangle

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.976
is CM, and the third side
of the right triangle is -

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.976
well, also CM.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.976
They share the same side.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
Of course it's congruent to itself!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.976
This is called the reflexive property.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.976
Everything is congruent to itself.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.976
I'll put this as step three.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.239
Ta dah! You've just proven
that all three sides of the left triangle

00:03:02.263 --> 00:03:04.976
are congruent to all three sides
of the right triangle.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.976
Plus, the two triangles are congruent

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because of the side-side-side
congruence theorem for triangles.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.976
When finished with a proof,
I like to do what Euclid did.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.976
He marked the end of a proof
with the letters QED.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.976
It's Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum,"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.976
which translates literally to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.976
"what was to be proven."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.976
But I just think of it
as "look what I just did!"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.976
I can hear what you're thinking:

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.976
why should I study proofs?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.976
One reason is that they could
allow you to win any argument.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.976
Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest
leaders of all time

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.976
used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements
on his bedside table

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.976
to keep his mind in shape.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.976
Another reason is you can
make a million dollars.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.976
You heard me.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.976
One million dollars.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
That's the price that the Clay
Mathematics Institute in Massachusetts

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.286
is willing to pay anyone who proves
one of the many unproven theories

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.286
that it calls "the millenium problems."

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.976
A couple of these have been solved
in the 90s and 2000s.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.976
But beyond money and arguments,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.976
proofs are everywhere.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.976
They underly architecture, art, computer
programming, and internet security.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.976
If no one understood
or could generate a proof,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.976
we could not advance these
essential parts of our world.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.976
Finally, we all know
that the proof is in the pudding.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And pudding is delicious. QED.
