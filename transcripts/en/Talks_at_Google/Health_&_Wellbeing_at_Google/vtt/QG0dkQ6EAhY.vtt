[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:06.850
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.864
And thank you so much to
Karen and to everybody

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.030
who put this together today.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.742
And to all of you, the
catch-22 with my book

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:14.200
is that the people
who need it most

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.270
are often the
busiest, so thank you

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.610
for taking time out of
your work day to be here

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.610
and to share in the
collaboration of making things

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.571
better for new working
parents in the workplace.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.320
So our talk today is
going to be about how

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.070
new parents can revolutionize
America's workplace culture.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.480
So when I was expecting
my baby, my first son,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.840
it was about nine years ago.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.173
I was working at "Glamour"
magazine, a pretty supportive

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:39.280
environment, actually.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.320
And I found that there
was a lot out there

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.680
for the first three trimesters,
which were pregnancy.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.550
And then when I had my son, I
found there was a lot of advice

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.380
for the newborn phase
and for baby care.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.670
And that continues on.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.930
You learn how to
diaper your baby.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.810
You learn how to potty train.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.460
There wasn't anything
for going back to work,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.186
and that was what I
desperately needed.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.810
And I discovered that
there is actually

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.780
a whole other trimester,
a fifth trimester,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.520
and it's when the
working mom is born.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.600
So going back to work.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.360
We're suffering
right now in America

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.930
from a crisis of
expectations for women.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.700
In some ways, it's
served us really well.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.780
We expect the best.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.460
We expect we can do everything,
and often we achieve it.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.940
However, it can bite
us in the rear end

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.490
also because we have all these
expectations of motherhood.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.970
Motherhood is supposed to be so
beautiful and this incredibly

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.080
meaningful experience.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.210
And of course it is,
but when we're not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.990
supported in a larger
way by our culture,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.705
it can also be
incredibly challenging.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.330
So we hope the
transition to motherhood

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.600
will feel as if you're
meditating on motherhood.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.140
And actually, sometimes it
feels like you're drowning.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.330
And that is due to
a lot of reasons,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.680
but primarily because-- and
this is better than most places,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.520
here at Google--

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.380
but primarily because
you're just not

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.570
getting enough time
home with your baby

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.710
before you have to
go back to work.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.590
I know that was my
biggest obstacle.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170
So when you look
at FMLA, which is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.961
what we're offered by
the government, which

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:08.300
is 12 weeks of unpaid
leave, when you get into who

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.400
is actually able
to take that leave,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.860
it gets really unavailable.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.950
So the United States guarantees
12 weeks of unpaid leave

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.550
only if you've been at that
employer for one year or more,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.400
if you work full time,
and if your company has

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.960
50 or more employees.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.600
So once you do the math and
all the Venn diagramming of who

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.590
actually fits in that little
availability to have it,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.140
you end up with only 56% of
working women qualify for FMLA.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.990
That blue area on the
circle in front of you

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.450
is everybody who
doesn't qualify.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.550
But then even of the
people who are qualified

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.690
to be able to take it,
I don't know about you,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.850
but I don't know
that many moms who

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.100
can afford to not be paid
for a quarter of their year.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.200
So many, many don't take it.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.410
And what we end up with is
that 25% of American mothers

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.210
take two weeks or less
of maternity leave.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.350
And then compounding
the problem,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.900
let's look at that
12-week-old baby.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.600
So I mentioned this idea of
the fourth trimester, which

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.120
was how I learned from this
book called "The Happiest

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.180
Baby on the Block," written by
a wonderful pediatrician named

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.516
Harvey Karp, who
establishes this phenomenon

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:14.890
of the fourth
trimester, which is

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.440
the idea that human
babies are actually born

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.434
a whole trimester too
soon because of the size

00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:21.100
of the pelvis and the
size of the brain.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.950
And so to soothe a newborn
baby, you swaddle that baby,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.580
you shush them.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.600
It's all these S verbs.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.266
Anyone who's expecting a baby or
who has a baby in this audience

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.750
probably knows this.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.650
But I remember reading that
book and finding it so helpful

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.880
and also so frustrating.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.610
Because page after
page, he would say, just

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.910
get to 12 weeks.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.285
Get to 12 weeks, and your baby
will wake up to the world,

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:41.830
they'll start to
get on a schedule.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.288
They'll give
something back to you.

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:46.960
And I thought, oh, that's
exactly when I go back to work.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.430
I also have to add--

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.470
back to those
expectations from before--

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.800
that when I was getting
ready to have my first son,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.860
I packed my going
to the hospital bag

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.440
probably three months before
I actually went there.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.836
And I included in it a
little going home outfit

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:02.710
with a giraffe on it.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.918
I'd picked it out especially.

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:04.990
I really loved it.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.720
And even though I had a
full 40-week baby born

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.120
at 6 and 1/2 pounds,
that little outfit

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.662
didn't fit him until
he was 4 months old,

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:16.870
which just gives you a sense.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.519
And I'm the oldest of four kids.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.519
I babysat my whole life.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.102
I know what a newborn
baby looks like.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:23.410
And yet still my expectations
were still so out of line

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.368
for what this tiny baby
was going to look like.

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:27.400
The other thing I
threw into that bag

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.160
at the very last minute
was my yellow work folder,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.280
which was everything I
intended to do while in labor

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.460
at the hospital and
then over the course

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.540
of my entire maternity leave.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.790
Thankfully, my employer
was understanding

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.720
and didn't actually expect me to
send any of that work back in.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.120
But I thought I
should be able to.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.880
So fast forward through
these 12 months of cranky

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.800
baby, who I'm shushing
and swaddling.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.680
And we get to the end of
it, and even at 12 weeks,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.710
that baby is not yet
on a nap schedule,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.810
not sleeping through
the night, not

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.110
sitting up, certainly, not
eating anything but breast milk

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.490
or formula, and is starting
to smile and give something

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.240
back to me and be that
baby that I thought

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.360
I was going to give birth
to, who ended up not actually

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.160
being a real baby
baby until he was more

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.660
like three or four
months old, which

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.590
was when I was back at work.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.850
So I discovered there's actually
this whole developmental phase

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.491
that is missing, and
it's the fifth trimester.

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:22.990
So looking at this
chart, you'll see

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.630
that 8.5 weeks is
the average FMLA

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.340
that most American women use.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.560
12 weeks is the amount
actually allowed.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.180
At 22 weeks-- in
my own research,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.150
and I'll tell you how I
came about this research--

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.100
mom starts to feel
better physically.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.641
At 24 weeks, she starts to
feel better emotionally,

00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:40.390
and you can see what's
happening with baby

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.730
through the same amount of time.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.560
But then of course,
look at that big chunk

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.518
of the fifth trimester.

00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:49.340
She's been back at work by
then for much of this time.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.070
So I realized there is this
whole missing developmental

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.160
phase, and I wrote a book.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.780
In order to write
that book, I knew

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.504
I had to look beyond
my own experience.

00:05:58.504 --> 00:06:00.920
Because my experience, to be
completely honest and candid,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.360
was one of great privilege.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.710
I had a supportive partner.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.900
I was able to take a
couple of my weeks unpaid.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.995
We saved up for it.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:09.900
It was not a big problem for us.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.900
We were able to hire a
caregiver in our home

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.027
who I really trusted.

00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:15.110
And I knew I had to look
beyond my own experience.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.110
Because if I felt
this desperate,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.590
surely women who had less
support felt even more so.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.580
So I decided to
do a giant survey.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.600
It was national, and I
reached almost 800 moms.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.219
And I asked them
all kinds of things

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.260
about their return to work
and about what worked,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.380
what didn't, what was hard,
what kind of support they found

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.850
most beneficial.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.366
Universally, they said
they wanted to help,

00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:38.990
they wanted to
participate, they wanted

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.842
to offer the collective
wisdom that they had,

00:06:41.842 --> 00:06:43.550
and I put it all
together into this book.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.133
And I should also
note that these moms

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:46.340
were from all 50 states.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.224
They were, some of them,
executives and CEOs

00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:50.390
running their own companies.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.181
Some of them were at
Fortune 500 companies.

00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:54.761
Some of them were doctors
and lawyers and nurses.

00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.260
Some of them were shift workers,
some of them were teachers,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.940
some of them were
hourly wage workers,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.794
and they also had
as many approaches

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:02.210
to motherhood as
I could think of.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.570
So there were same
sex parents who

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.640
had carried the baby
and same sex parents who

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.050
had not carried the baby.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.459
There were single moms, adoptive
moms, moms who use surrogates.

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.000
I really wanted to
see what do we all

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.310
have in common, and what
parts of our experience

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.490
can we pull from one another
to be this giant working mom

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.080
mentor.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.420
I also interviewed
dads and partners

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.060
to see their experience
and to get their insight

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.100
into what maybe these
moms couldn't tell us

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.130
about themselves.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.970
How did they see their partners
and wives dealing with it?

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.020
And then I did more than 100
long-form, hour-long interviews

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.460
to really go deeper.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.190
And what I came up with
was a lot of solutions.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.000
So we know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.770
We know from the
research and anecdotally

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.260
and from my own research
that new working mothers

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.380
need longer paid leave,
which positively impacts

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.830
employee retention, job
satisfaction, future earnings,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.880
mom's physical health, mom's
mental health, and baby's

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.104
physical health, too.

00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:59.020
The reason it impacts
baby's physical health--

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.229
and I am very much a
fed is best kind of mom.

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.020
However you feed your
baby is fine with me.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.720
However, breastfed
babies are much less

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.960
likely to have ear infections
and respiratory infections,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.870
and so they're healthier.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.850
Mom's chances of having
a perinatal mood disorder

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.330
dramatically go down if she's
had six months of paid leave.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.100
The six month number
keeps bubbling up.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.960
It's really an important
support for new parents.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.900
But they also need
cultural workplace shifts

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.340
upon their return to work.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.770
They need support
from above and below.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.229
They need support
from their peers.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:34.020
They need the right
degree of communication

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.150
when they're out on leave.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.640
They need a gentle reentry
plan, and I'll tell you

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.000
more about that in a minute.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.370
And they need acceptance
of new boundaries.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.549
So just to look
specifically at what

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.430
a great family leave
policy looks like--

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.730
and this is ever evolving.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.040
Even in the year that I
was researching the book

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.620
and in the two years since
then, since it's come out,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.120
things have changed
dramatically.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.009
A good policy at
this point, and I

00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:57.800
think it will continue
to be improved upon,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.220
is inclusive, fully
inclusive, of same-sex parents

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.690
and adoptive parents.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.840
It equalizes the time offered
to both women and men,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.310
doing away with
this whole notion

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.470
of primary and
secondary parents.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.050
It allows for
intermittent leave.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.150
If you have two
parents, it allows

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.699
you to use each
other as a resource,

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:17.990
and one person can take their
leave a little bit later,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.140
perhaps filling in as the
primary caregiver when

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.020
the original primary
caregiver goes back to work.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.395
And it also offers hourly
and shift workers--

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:28.520
and we've seen this recently
happening at Starbucks

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.990
and Amazon--

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.110
the same paid leave that
their corporate colleagues

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.020
get as well.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.290
So just to give you
a smattering-- and I

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.990
had 50 questions and hundreds
of data points, honestly,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.652
but this is just a smattering of
what I came up with and guided

00:09:44.652 --> 00:09:46.110
the advice that I
gave in the book,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.360
but also guided where I
looked to for expertise.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.400
Because I am actually
not an expert.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.500
What I am is somebody
who is a journalist who

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.270
finds the right
experts and who finds

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.110
women who've been through this
who can offer their expertise.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.790
So here are just
some statistics.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.010
76% of the moms
who I surveyed said

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.410
they wished for a longer leave.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.830
That's a good starting point.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.160
71% of partnered moms fought
more with their spouse

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.599
during their fifth trimester
than they ever had before,

00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:12.390
and that includes during
the newborn phase.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.250
So even when they
were healing, they

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.950
were more able to
communicate clearly

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.380
than they were on the other
side of it, going back to work.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.700
79% said that they spent one
hour or less per week on me

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.680
time.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.300
This guided me
because this wasn't

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.640
a matter of how can I
find you more me time,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.130
it's more like can we talk
to mental health experts

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.190
about how to you
reframe what me time is

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.080
and take more pleasure
in what you actually

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.246
do have to do with your day.

00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:40.620
Because if I could give
you a 25th hour, I would.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.140
Instead, I'm going to help
you try to see the time

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.429
that you have differently.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:46.470
They reported, these
mothers, that their commutes

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.600
were 50% more stressful
after having a baby.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.360
And this actually tied
back into me time.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.880
There was a lot of
correlation between the two,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.300
and how can you use what's
seen as lost time in your day

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.380
to actually be good to yourself.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.620
They spent six minutes
each morning-- this is sad.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.360
This is the point at which
somebody when I gave this talk,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.200
started to cry.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.030
They spent six
minutes each morning

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.959
simply enjoying their baby.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.750
They actually spent
more time getting ready

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.110
than they ever had before but
less time on themselves, which

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.990
helped me realize that we
need to give advice about how

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.009
can you organize your closet?

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.800
Is organizing your
closet an important part

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.716
of going back to work?

00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:22.410
It turns out it
actually is, so that you

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.230
can be more efficient, have
more of that time in the morning

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.839
spent actually
enjoying being a mother

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:28.380
for the bookends of
your day that you

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.120
do have with your children.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.876
I came into this, I will
fully admit, somewhat biased.

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:35.250
I thought I was going to hear
from parents that those who

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.740
had bosses that did
not have children

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.470
were not as understanding
about the transition.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.570
That ended up not
really being true.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.019
Bosses without kids were
only 12% harder to please.

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.060
Again, this becomes much
more about introspection

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.559
and how we feel about ourselves
and how we project ourselves

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:52.860
in the workplace than
it is about the bad guys

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.840
doing bad to us.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.440
Pumping is a really
big deal for a new mom.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.570
81% of moms who pumped
said that work negatively

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.820
impacted their ability
to feed their baby,

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.200
and 32%, including this guy,
described being walked in on.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.104
That's awesome.

00:12:08.104 --> 00:12:09.800
[LAUGHS]

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.680
So in 2018, what does a good
work reentry plan look like?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.840
Because we know that it's
not just about policies.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.060
It's actually about people
being able to use them

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.100
and then being supported
in their reentry

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.310
when they come back.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.157
So it includes a
phase back option.

00:12:24.157 --> 00:12:26.740
And this is starting to happen
largely at law firms, actually,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.620
is where I'm seeing it,
where employees are offered

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.840
full-time salary
for part-time work,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.556
temporarily, just to
ease their way back in.

00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:36.930
Because especially working in
a really competitive field,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.990
like if you're in big law,
if you work at Google,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.090
if you work in tech, going from
0 to 60, which is really more

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.160
like 0 to 80, can
be very startling

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.760
when you're already compounded
by having a sense of self that

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.340
has changed anyway and
certainly a day with a hard stop

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.130
that it may not
have had previously.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.740
A good reentry plan
also includes access

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.740
to high-quality lactation
rooms with privacy,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.750
hospital-grade pumps, and
the ability to work there.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.760
This was really key.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.860
Women reported
that it's not just

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.870
about the logistics
of being able to pump,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.750
it's about that feeling
of the stigma of it.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.000
Of feeling like, ugh, it's
just a break in my day

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.240
when my day is already
shortened by having

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.522
to get home to this child.

00:13:17.522 --> 00:13:19.480
And you don't want to be
seen as a person who's

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.670
taking breaks when your
day's already shorter.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.126
If you can work
through it-- and that's

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:25.250
not an option for everyone.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.490
Some people actually
need to be in the zone.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.960
But once you get
into the groove,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.126
many women reported that
they could work through it.

00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:33.280
So it's also about having
a thoughtfully set up

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.350
lactation room that
allows you to do work,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.230
and then, this is really key,
exiting the lactation room

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.234
with that milk and then
basically announcing, casually,

00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:43.150
that you did a bunch of
work during that time.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.630
It's important.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.260
They also need flexible work
schedules and locations.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.414
And most importantly,
they need a culture

00:13:49.414 --> 00:13:50.830
where employees
feel like they can

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.350
use every one of these
benefits with no stigma.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.860
One quick note in my research.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.110
As I said, I came into it
with some of my own biases.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.420
I shouldn't even really
tell you what they all are.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.410
So I did breastfeed my
babies, and I pumped for them.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.822
We had a nanny in our home.

00:14:07.822 --> 00:14:09.030
I'm very up front about that.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.040
But with the
scheduling, it wasn't

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.900
going to work for
us to use daycare,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.700
but I made sure to
interview a lot of moms

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.830
who did use daycare and
home care and all kinds

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.204
of other child
care I hadn't even

00:14:18.204 --> 00:14:21.960
thought of because I wanted to
see what their experiences were

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.881
like too.

00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.380
That's why I really came into
this deeper interviewing I did

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.470
after I did the surveying
with this idea of breastfeed

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.400
or don't.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.467
Take as little or as
much time as you like.

00:14:31.467 --> 00:14:32.550
This was surprising to me.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.290
There was a breadth.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.456
I talked about all the
different kinds of diversity,

00:14:35.456 --> 00:14:37.770
there was a diversity even
among the women's ambition,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.160
and it did not really
fall along economic lines.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.740
There were women who worked
hourly jobs who were actually

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.580
feeling quite
ambitious coming back,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.130
and there were women in very
high-level, high-paid jobs who

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.290
reported that they kind
of had a blip of ambition,

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.364
and they weren't so sure
about it all anymore.

00:14:54.364 --> 00:14:56.280
So this was really
interesting to look at too,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.340
and it helped me
check my own biases

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.080
about moms staying in or not.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.240
Really more than
anything, I just

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.870
want new mothers to have options
in the workplace and agency

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.380
and to be able to make the right
decisions for their families,

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.670
absent a federal plan
that supports them.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.680
So the other thing
that I realized

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.500
is that these women
could achieve change,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.950
and they reported that they had
achieved change by leaning in,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:23.940
certainly.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.020
Love Sheryl Sandberg.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.550
They leaned into their jobs.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.339
They came back.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:28.380
They moved up the ladder.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.290
And they officially made
policy change from within.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.480
But I also really,
really wanted people

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.110
to know that it counts
just to stumble.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.459
It counts just to show up, come
back, talk about what's hard.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:43.500
I'll tell you a story
about how this was actually

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.600
what inspired the book
for me in the first place.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.620
I had been back for
a couple of months.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.550
I was tired.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.630
I definitely had
circles under my eyes.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.020
I definitely had left
a lot of meetings

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.750
because I needed to pump, and
I was pretty vocal about it.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.210
And after a couple of months,
a colleague, Danielle,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.080
came into my office.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.951
I had hired her a
couple of months,

00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:04.200
maybe, before I went on leave.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.191
We didn't know each
other that well yet.

00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.190
And she said to me, I
just want to say thank you

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.710
for being so open and
honest about your motherhood

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.747
in the workplace.

00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:13.830
And I thought, oh god,
have I been unprofessional?

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.413
I was a little bit
of a young manager.

00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:17.070
I thought, am I doing OK?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.990
And then she went on
to say because you've

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.370
shown me I can do it too.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.810
You've shown me that it's hard.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.240
There are problems to solve,
but that I'll get through it.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:24.740
Thank you.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.520
I know I'm going to
keep with it one day.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.309
And that was eureka moment.

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:29.850
It took me years to
be able to dig in

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.740
and do the research
to be able to produce

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.890
this book and this movement,
but that stuck with me.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.520
So yes.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.990
Stumbling works.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.320
Don't fake it till you make it.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.278
If you fake it, nobody
knows there's a problem.

00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:41.910
If you pretend
everything's OK, how

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.550
can you expect anyone to support
you and help make it better?

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.170
Be comfortable
being seen as a mom.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.637
You have to bring
your parenthood

00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:50.220
to the workplace for anyone to
know that your personal life is

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.490
important to you.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.520
And what I really hope
is that by solving

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.730
this very visible personal
life problem of a pregnancy

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.650
or expecting a baby,
we will actually

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.260
be solving personal
life issues for anyone

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.729
with a personal life,
which is everyone, right?

00:17:03.729 --> 00:17:06.270
Everybody has something in their
life they care about as much

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.680
as you care about that baby.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.990
And by solving our
problems, that's

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.880
going to trickle over into
greater corporate culture.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.960
And as I said earlier, you
need to broadcast successes

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.480
in spite of visible challenges.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.579
This is something that
a maternal mental health

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.650
expert I talked to, a
psychiatrist named Christin

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.856
Drake, tells the mothers that
she works with, who she sees,

00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:26.980
who are struggling through.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.920
She role plays with them
how to go in and ask

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.970
for accommodations
in the workplace.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.330
She tells them,
think contextually.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.850
It is a unique situation
of the American mother

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.300
that we have to ad hoc negotiate
these things for ourselves.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.490
We are left to our own devices
in terms of this planning,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.150
but also, more important,
in terms of the judgments

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.510
we make about ourselves
in the process.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.730
Recognizing that can quiet
the noise in your mind a bit

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.320
as you go into those meetings.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.600
Your new working motherhood
is full of benefits

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.780
to your workplace and your
home, and that's recognized

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.970
everywhere else in the world.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.250
We are assets, not
liabilities, and you

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.630
need to feel that and
negotiate with that in mind.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.730
A word about mommy
guilt. Because I

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.265
will say, the one thing
that I actually invested

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:13.140
in and splurged on, as
I did oh, I'm a very--

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.880
I must do everything
myself kind of person.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.050
The one thing I
didn't do is I didn't

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.091
transcribe my interviews.

00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:19.260
I hired an awesome
single mom in Ohio

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.690
to transcribe my interviews,
and Sarah's the best.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.030
Anyway, I'm so glad that she
sent all these files back

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.490
to me, and I could see that one
word popped off the page again

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.323
and again and again.

00:18:27.323 --> 00:18:29.160
If you were to
make a word cloud,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.170
guilt would be the biggest word.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.480
Every single person I
interviewed talked about guilt.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.530
Only guess what?

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.610
It meant different things
to different people.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.749
Some people felt very
guilty for being at work

00:18:39.749 --> 00:18:41.790
and leaving their baby in
the care of someone who

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.029
they felt was less
capable than they were.

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:45.570
Other people felt
guilty for enjoying

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.440
being at work, which led me
to think, as I was teaching

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.670
my son about
division, if you all

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.030
have the same
common denominator,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.077
let's scratch it out.

00:18:57.077 --> 00:18:58.660
Let's not call it
guilt. Let's call it

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.870
whatever the actual feeling
is and the experience

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.217
is so that we can solve for it.

00:19:05.217 --> 00:19:07.300
So don't just write off
your motherhood experience

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.860
and the challenges
of it as guilt.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.670
You've done nothing wrong.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.887
And if all else
fails, be this lady.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.220
And I think I'm going to have
a conversation with Karen.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.886
Thank you, guys.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.150
KAREN: As I mentioned, I
just loved your book so much.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.720
So I want to read just a short
paragraph to the audience

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.300
to show you guys how spot on.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.150
Especially for those of you who
have just come back from work.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.800
It's at the beginning
of the book, when

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.560
you talk about what
it's like to come back

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.310
to work for working moms.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.350
"In short, it's a mess.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.170
The typical professional
mother in the United States

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.430
goes back to work very,
very sleep deprived.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.890
She's just started getting
positive emotions back

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.120
from her baby.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.970
She's about to experience
the rockiest period ever

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.410
in her relationship.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.140
She has no free time.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.930
Every three hours, her
body makes milk that leaks

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.240
onto her lovely work
clothes if she does not

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.980
do something about it.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.430
And baby and body aside, she's
about to come back to a job

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.080
that other people
have been covering

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.230
for her with various degrees
of happiness and resentment

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.020
about that fact."

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.780
And it goes on.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.550
It's just so good,
and it's so spot on,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.050
and I feel like everyone
should read that.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.820
Whether you're
working mom or not,

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.070
I feel like it's
really hard to express

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.890
what it's like to come back when
you just get back from work,

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.660
and people don't realize all
that you're going through.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.990
So what are your
recommendations on how

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.720
do you even start that
conversation at work

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.530
without making people
feel awkward when you say,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.100
I have to go pump, or this
is what I'm going through.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.800
How do you start that
conversation in the workplace

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.009
and have it stay appropriate?

00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:55.383
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
Well, thanks.

00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:56.970
I think first you
have to realize

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.510
that it's your discomfort
that makes someone else feel

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.630
uncomfortable.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.780
And if you can sort
of flatly say, oh, I'm

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.000
going to go pump now,
like it's no big deal,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.487
it gives them permission to
realize it's no big deal.

00:21:09.487 --> 00:21:11.570
And maybe the first time
it feels like a big deal,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.830
but the second and
third and 489th time,

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.000
it will not be a big deal.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.630
The other thing I tell moms is
that when you're coming back,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.140
you can feel less than.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.050
You can feel-- and this is
not particularly PC to say,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.386
but you can feel like you're
less capable than before.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.010
The research actually
proves otherwise.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.487
You are in many, many
ways more capable.

00:21:31.487 --> 00:21:33.570
You're better at pivoting,
because that baby drill

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.910
sergeant has taught you that
you don't really need time

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.270
between activities anymore.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.120
You can just turn on a dime.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.860
You're better at
prioritizing your time.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.060
You're better at
saying yes to things.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.601
You're better at
saying no to things.

00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.780
You're more
nurturing, of course.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.380
But when you come back to work,
you may not feel all of that

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:49.880
immediately.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.296
Hopefully, if
you've read my book,

00:21:51.296 --> 00:21:52.630
you will, you'll internalize it.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.320
But the one thing you can
really know that you're doing

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.620
and be proud of is broadcast.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.380
Broadcast the stuff that's
hard, and you will actually

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.589
be doing something positive
for your workplace.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.880
You will be helping make
things better for other women.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.006
And I hate to give anyone
a list of to-do's ever.

00:22:09.006 --> 00:22:10.380
There really is
not a single list

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.560
of to-do's in the entire book,
but I would add this one.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.470
Really try your hardest
to know that you're

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.240
going to pay a
little bit forward,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.460
and you will reap the benefits
of the confidence that

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.526
gives you too.

00:22:21.526 --> 00:22:22.260
KAREN: Yeah.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.600
I cannot underscore that enough.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.510
For those of you that
know me and work with me,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.260
I'm pretty vocal
about this stuff.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.100
One, I'm just a
generally open person.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.170
But after reading
this book, I also

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.870
have been trying to be more
vocal about my experience.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.650
And last week, I had
an executive summit

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.200
that was a full day meeting.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.080
And because everyone on my team
knows I use the mother's room,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.260
and I'm just back, and
I'm breastfeeding my baby,

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.760
somebody on my team said,
here's where we need to go.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.070
Here's the agenda for off-site.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.930
Here's the execs
that are coming.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.720
And by the way, here's
the closest mother's room.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.000
And it was a male on
my team that did that,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.490
and I was so touched by it.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.290
It really meant a lot
that of all the planning

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.660
of this big executive
summit, he took the time

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.230
to look up where
the closest mother

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.994
room was to the conference
room we'd be in.

00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:16.410
And it really
helped me save time,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.330
so I just underscore that.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.190
And that's an
example that I've had

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.024
very recently, within
the last couple weeks.

00:23:22.024 --> 00:23:23.481
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
That's amazing.

00:23:23.481 --> 00:23:24.150
That's great.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.410
KAREN: So sleep deprivation.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.790
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Yes.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.160
KAREN: I personally
have a baby at home,

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.530
and I have a 3-year-old toddler.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:37.200
So I'm lucky to get four
hours of sleep in a row

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.650
these days between my
toddler waking me up--

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.380
he just has these
nightmares on occasion,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.480
and then the baby
sometimes wants to eat

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.760
or wants a pacifier
or a little snuggle.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.120
How do you recommend we come
to work and bring our best

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.877
self there when we're running
on empty with very little sleep?

00:23:54.877 --> 00:23:56.460
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
So this is really,

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.560
if you want to just boil
the fifth trimester down

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.680
to one thing, it is
about sleep deprivation.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.180
The women who I surveyed told
me that they were, on average,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.430
starting to sleep
seven hours straight.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.360
Not consistently, but starting
to, at the seven month

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.531
postpartum mark.

00:24:10.531 --> 00:24:12.030
So at that point,
they had been back

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.820
at work for many
months, most of them.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.160
Everything else falls
apart if you can't sleep

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.300
and if you're not sleeping.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.612
All of the other
advice, none of it

00:24:22.612 --> 00:24:24.070
really counts as
much unless you're

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.450
getting a good night's sleep.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.680
There's so many strategies.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.580
Like everything
else in the book,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.390
I didn't really think of it
from the baby care perspective,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.890
because far be it for me to
tell you how to sleep train

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.390
your baby.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.880
My six-year-old slept in
a sleeping bag on my floor

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.230
last night.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.860
But what I can do is I decided
I could interview women who

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.560
are experts in maternal sleep.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.490
So these are PhDs
who study sleep.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.130
One of them also has
a side gig studying

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.610
the military's use of sleep
deprivation as a weapon of war.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.560
She's awesome.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.100
And they basically said--
so I'm not even joking you.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.870
Every expert said,
oh, well, coffee's OK.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.610
Which is true.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.537
A little bit of coffee is OK.

00:25:02.537 --> 00:25:04.120
But there are all
kinds of strategies.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.890
It starts at home, certainly.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.390
It starts, actually, with
parity in parental leave

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.700
and with being able to
lean on your partner

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.290
to take the nighttime shifts
at least as much as you do,

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.160
particularly if your
body is still healing,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.650
and emotionally you're
still getting better.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.120
What the sleep
experts said, it's

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.120
funny that you mention four
hours, because that is really

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.690
the minimum.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.130
What you want to
do if you can is

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.200
take turns with your
partner, ideally

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.690
for two nights in a row,
but at a bare minimum

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.760
for two REM cycles in a row.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.770
And that is
basically four hours.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.620
It's 3 and 3/4 to
4 and 1/4 hours.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.730
And that resets you enough.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.760
If you are coming
back to work after two

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.380
nights in a row of not very
much sleep or fragmented sleep,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.450
you are as impaired,
the experts told me,

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.520
as if you're showing up drunk.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.010
And think of that also
for your work in the home.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.880
If you're on maternity leave,
and you're home with that baby,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.190
and you haven't shared the
night with your partner,

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.390
if you're lucky to have
a partner as a resource--

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.920
And I have to add, the
single moms I interviewed

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.420
were amazing for getting
through all of this,

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.070
but they also just
checked their egos

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.191
and dove into asking every
single thing they needed

00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:15.440
from the people in their
lives in a way that all of us

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.490
should embrace.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.170
But if you have that
partner you have

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.880
to share the wake-up
duties with him.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.700
You have to think of your
job at home the next morning

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.270
taking care of a human baby
as the most important job

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.440
in the world, just as
important as your partner's,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440
who's going off to work.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.320
KAREN: After you
get that sleep done,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.465
my morning starts pretty crazy.

00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:39.840
So I wanted to
ask you a question

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.970
about the transitional times.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.090
Even on a good day, when I
get a good night's sleep,

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.460
my morning is
something like this.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.860
The kids wake up
around the same time.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.790
My toddler is yelling for me
or my husband to come get him,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.320
and the baby starts crying
because she's hungry.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.490
And we'll just kind of like keep
swapping of who is feeding who,

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.740
and who's taking care
of who, and who's

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.500
showering and getting dressed
and putting on makeup,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.030
and it's chaos.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.135
And then I leave in the morning,
as soon as the nanny gets

00:27:11.135 --> 00:27:12.760
there, I'll give her
the baby, and I'll

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.456
run to go pump one more
time before I get to work.

00:27:15.456 --> 00:27:17.080
And then I leave,
and my toddler's kind

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.860
of holding on my
leg, telling me he

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.180
doesn't want me to go to work.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.140
And the baby, who should have
gone back to sleep by now,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:24.699
is crying.

00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:27.240
And I've probably been up since
5:00 or 6:00 in the morning--

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.120
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
You've lived a whole life.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.411
KAREN: I've lived a whole life.

00:27:29.411 --> 00:27:31.820
And I stumble, and I'm like,
I just came out of a storm.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.780
My hair is everywhere, and
I'm holding my pump bag

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.490
and my purse and my computer.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.698
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: That
part gets better, I promise.

00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:41.050
KAREN: And then it's 10:00
AM, and I'm just making it

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.910
to my 10 o'clock meeting.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.110
So for me, my morning
is crazy, and I'm

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:51.040
assuming it's like that for
a lot of parents coming back,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.660
especially moms.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.270
How do you-- what are
your recommendations

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.940
for that transitional morning
time to not lose our minds

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.192
and get to work and feel
like we're ready to go?

00:28:01.192 --> 00:28:03.400
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: So the
transitional times really,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.630
in all of the anecdotal evidence
that I had from these women,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.360
are by far the most
stressful parts of their day.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.430
And it is because it is
the logistics that you're

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.430
describing, and it's also
that emotional feeling

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.360
of being neither here nor there.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.850
You're not fully on
as a mom, you're not

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:20.559
fully on as a worker,
you're in between.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.225
You should be spending
time on yourself,

00:28:22.225 --> 00:28:25.180
but who has time to
spend on herself?

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.030
And it's really hard.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.880
The thing that helps the most is
the thing that I was actually,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.500
I have to admit,
the most hesitant

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.210
to include in the book.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.100
My bias is that I worked at
"Glamour" magazine for years.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.100
I oversaw a lot of the
fashion and beauty pages,

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.940
and so some of the
stuff I just know.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.570
But there's this
thing that happens--

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.028
and this was always
sort of in me--

00:28:44.028 --> 00:28:46.090
but when you have
a new baby, you

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.770
don't feel like
prioritizing this stuff.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.450
It does not feel as important as
it may once have to you before.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.430
instead of lipstick,
you have baby,

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.950
and baby feels a lot more
important than lipstick.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.430
So what I looked at in my
research and with the experts

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.805
that I talked to was not
how do you look better,

00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:04.930
it's how do you feel better
about the way you look,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.660
and how to you compress
your time in the morning

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.600
to make it really efficient in
terms of impacting how you look

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.350
and how you present
yourself to the world.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.020
So there are some
really concrete tips

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.200
that are things like for
your closet in the morning,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.190
don't let your closet
be a torture device.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.520
You shouldn't open the
door and see everything

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.020
that doesn't fit and think, is
that going to work with that?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.350
I don't know.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.040
I don't know.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.873
You actually need to
make a miniature closet

00:29:28.873 --> 00:29:30.989
within your closet of
the six things that fit.

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:33.280
If you see that you don't
have a pair of pants, by God,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.990
go out and buy a pair of pants.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.886
But then every morning, pull
just from that little section.

00:29:37.886 --> 00:29:39.760
And you can add to it
as things start to fit,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.440
or if you're going
on a work trip,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.540
and you need different
kinds of clothes, fine.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.250
But it just simplifies it.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.260
And then in terms
of beauty, there's

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.110
a lot of wanting to cover
up under-eye circles.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.070
And yes, concealer is great, but
the dermatologist I talked to,

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.780
who treats all these
celebrities and who

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.910
knows every trick in
the book, basically

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.970
said it comes down to
washing your face at night.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.800
To make sure to take
that time to do that.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.210
And drinking a lot of water.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.486
And she just really
recommends more than anything

00:30:06.486 --> 00:30:08.860
that you try to take good care
of your skin in those ways

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.984
because then you'll need
less makeup in the morning

00:30:10.984 --> 00:30:11.590
to feel good.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.640
And all of the research--

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.681
I was so hesitant to
include some of this stuff--

00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:16.720
but all the research
really proves

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.140
that when you're back at
work, the way you look

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.200
affects how people think of
you, but it's also largely

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.360
because it affects how
you feel about yourself,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.260
and you project that.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.980
Like it or not, you do, and
it really has an impact.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.130
KAREN: One thing
I noticed for me,

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.900
and you also mentioned
this in your book,

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.530
is that when you're
pregnant, it's visible,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.045
and everybody at work
takes extra care.

00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:42.545
Oh, you can't, I
totally understand,

00:30:42.545 --> 00:30:43.878
you have a doctor's appointment.

00:30:43.878 --> 00:30:45.340
That's fine.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.310
But you get more of
that sensitivity.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.130
Versus when you come back to
work after having the baby,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.540
it's almost more stressful.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.140
Well, it definitely
is more stressful.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.940
But people don't see you
physically pregnant anymore,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.940
so they just assume you're
fine, and you're back

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.530
to your normal self.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:09.760
So how do you think about how
we should speak to our managers

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.570
about that, and what we ask of
them, and what sort of advice

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.540
do you have on how to talk to
our manager about the needs

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.290
that we have when it might
not be as apparent for them

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.810
to have the same sensitivity
as before we left.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.600
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: So this
is a really, really important

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.170
question.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.340
Because for a lot of women, this
is the first big negotiation

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.670
they do, both at home
and in their careers.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.160
And if they do it well, and
they get what they want,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.120
it fuels them to ask for things
in the future that are also

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.370
going to propel their careers.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.942
And I don't really talk
about happiness in the book.

00:31:44.942 --> 00:31:46.900
It's really going to
propel their satisfaction,

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900
because that's what I
think is really important.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.970
So there are some very specific
tips about negotiating.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.230
So first, the earlier in
the process of having a baby

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.540
or expecting a baby that
you ask for this stuff,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.850
the easier it is to
have that wish granted

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.790
and the easier it is
to feel like you're

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.280
contributing to the
greater whole at work.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.530
And you never know exactly
how you're going to feel,

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.530
but if you come back
after having been away,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.420
and you suddenly
then want to adjust

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.220
your hours, your
flexibility, whatever

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.346
it is, it can feel like a
sloughing off of duties,

00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:20.970
and you're asking people who've
been filling in for you to give

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.080
you even more leeway.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.987
Instead, if you can,
you want to really try

00:32:24.987 --> 00:32:27.070
to anticipate, pretty much
as soon as you announce

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.560
a pregnancy or that
you're expecting to adopt,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.180
how you envision
your job changing.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.680
And you may renege
on some of that,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.180
and you may rethink some of it
when the baby actually comes,

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.730
but it allows you to not
just get rid of stuff,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.220
but actually train the
people around you who

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.520
want to grow up into some of
it, and makes you feel like

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.230
and be a good manager.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.330
It also then frees you
up to think, what am I

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.413
going to fill this time
with now, now that I'm not

00:32:51.413 --> 00:32:53.260
going to be traveling
three times a month,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.917
and I have the person
I've been working

00:32:54.917 --> 00:32:56.500
with who I've trained
to go out and do

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.070
that outward facing stuff,
what can I fill my time with?

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.680
And often it's bigger
picture thinking

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.320
and it's bigger projects.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.730
And the other thing is whenever
you're in a negotiation,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.960
obviously, manage up.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.970
You want to think about
what are the-- you're

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.917
going into the conversation
with a plan, not an ask.

00:33:12.917 --> 00:33:14.500
You really have to
tell yourself that.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.327
This is a plan for
how it's going to work

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:18.535
and how you think of things
in terms of deliverables.

00:33:18.535 --> 00:33:20.076
How you're going to
still do your job

00:33:20.076 --> 00:33:23.189
and deliver your job
that you get paid for.

00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:24.730
And then the other
thing that I heard

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.100
from a lot of women
that's incredibly helpful

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.780
is to ask for it temporarily.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.050
To say, hey, can we
please just try this?

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.050
Because what that does is
it just keeps your manager

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.267
from feeling like they're
signing in blood that you're

00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:40.600
allowed to do this forever,
and by the way, then setting

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.670
a legal precedent that they have
to offer this to everyone else

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.510
too.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.900
It allows you to try it, see how
it's going, adjust on the fly

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.590
as you're going.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.810
And then if you've set it
up as a two-month check-in,

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.990
three-month check-in, you go
back in, and you have a baby.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:58.750
You know, baby needs change, if
not by the week, by the month.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.210
And you can come back,
and you might actually

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.720
have other needs at that moment
that you can renegotiate for.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.850
And it becomes much more
of a conversation that's

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.300
ongoing that will serve you
as your children's needs grow

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.830
and change too.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.292
KAREN: Absolutely.

00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:14.500
That's really helpful advice.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.580
I'm going to take some of that--

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.580
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
I wish I had had it.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.270
KAREN: --for a couple of
things I have on my mind.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:24.310
I want to circle back on role
models and peer mentoring.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.679
While I do that, if
anyone else has questions

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:29.889
from the audience, you guys can
start lining up at the mics,

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:32.650
and we'll take questions
from the audience.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.100
So here at Google, we do have
pretty generous maternity

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.389
leaves as compared to other
companies in the United States,

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.740
and even so, there's
still guilt--

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.489
I'm going to just use
that word for now--

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.110
about taking the full leave.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.679
And I've had countless people,
even on my team, come and say,

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:52.929
I don't know if I should
take my full maternity leave.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.010
I have so much going on.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.920
Or maybe I don't need that
month before I go out.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.380
And I remember thinking
the same thing,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.240
even though I've told
everybody on my team,

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.300
no, you have to take it.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.425
This is an amazing benefit.

00:35:03.425 --> 00:35:05.554
You're going to want the time.

00:35:05.554 --> 00:35:07.720
And I remember, when I was
taking my first maternity

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.990
leave, I said, I don't need
to take the whole time,

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.650
not knowing what I
was getting into.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.390
And my boss, who was a male at
the time, said, absolutely not.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.770
You're taking your whole leave.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.830
And he told me to take
it, and I tell everyone

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.394
on my team to take it.

00:35:22.394 --> 00:35:24.520
But I said-- and I was
a director at the time--

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.300
I said, I haven't seen a lot
of other directors taking

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.510
the full maternity leave.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.430
Is that something I should do?

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.961
Because there's so many
people depending on me.

00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:34.460
And of course we're
all replaceable,

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.790
but I just felt like I didn't
want to let anyone down.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:42.450
And he said to me, well,
you are the role model.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.300
You are the one that
has to take your leave

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.180
and show all the other
women and men that they

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.990
should take maternity leave.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.190
And I just think that whether
you have a role model,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:55.230
or we're doing peer
mentoring for each other,

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.100
it is really important
to set the precedent.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.680
And is there anything
else you want

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.280
to share with the group on how
we can do even more of that?

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.150
We can announce
what we're doing,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.556
we can encourage each other,
but if there are other tips,

00:36:08.556 --> 00:36:10.430
I think that's what will
give us all strength

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.230
to ask for things that we need.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.188
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: I
just couldn't agree more.

00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:16.760
I really just could not
agree more with you.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.160
Like I said, I really tried
to check my own biases.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.820
And I did, I was compelled
by a number of women

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.730
who had their own businesses,
worked for themselves,

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.250
and had to take a very
short amount of leave,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.114
whether it was a day,
two weeks, I understood

00:36:31.114 --> 00:36:32.280
where they were coming from.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.850
If you were working, though,
at a corporation that

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.760
has policies that other
people at various levels

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.090
are going to be using, even if
you're not at the tippy top,

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.390
you have to show the people
around you, beneath you,

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:48.770
and above you that this is
a problem worth solving.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.157
And worth is really
the key word.

00:36:51.157 --> 00:36:52.740
You have to show
that you're worth it.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.610
I think the absolute
best way that we

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.910
can solve this problem
is by establishing parity

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.850
for what's available for dads
and what's available for moms,

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:05.600
same-sex couples, whatever
your approach is to parenthood,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.339
you should get and you
should take the same

00:37:08.339 --> 00:37:09.380
as the people around you.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.850
Because the message that
gets sent otherwise--

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.780
and I'm just going to be binary
about this-- but if dad takes

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.750
far less leave than mom
takes, what dad is saying

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.780
is I'm more important at work.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.810
And more important at work
translates to dollars,

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.394
and it gets into
all the other things

00:37:25.394 --> 00:37:26.810
we're talking about
in our culture

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.680
right now about the pay gap,
about the motherhood penalty.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.150
It's real because of this.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.770
The other thing that gets set
up when you have unequal leave

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.360
is that mom, especially
if mom is like us,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.110
and a woman who is packing her
bags three months before she

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.420
goes to the hospital,
mom wants to be

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.160
an expert at being a parent.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.720
And dad probably does too.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.990
But if mom is home with
baby, and dad is off at work,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.970
mom is turning
this into her job.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:53.570
Rightly so.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.700
I certainly did this, and I
understand why everyone does.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.241
You want to know
everything about it.

00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:00.590
You're googling everything,
and so you become an expert.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.510
But then when you
go back to work,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.300
and you and your partner get
home at the end of the day--

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.840
again, this is assuming sort
of a typical work schedule--

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.580
guess who knows how
to do everything?

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.120
You.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:11.750
Dad doesn't.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.192
Even with the best intentions
in the world, when you first

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:17.150
got together, and when
you talked about how you

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.400
planned on parenting together.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.650
If you know everything, he
doesn't know everything, A,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.420
he doesn't know how
to do it, B, you're

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.920
going to have a
harder time trusting

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.256
him to learn how to do it.

00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:29.630
And if you're coming from
different workplaces, of course

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.240
you may just have different
options offered to you.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:38.810
One solution is for the partner
to take intermittent leave.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.640
So when mom goes back
to work, actually

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.400
have dad take a chunk
of leave then and be

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.720
home with the baby for a month.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.790
It allows the baby to
get a little bit older

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:50.450
and less vulnerable being left
in a non-family member's care.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.800
It also lets that second parent
really be in the muck of it,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.130
get it, understand it, learn
these things, and then for mom

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.730
to see, hey, look
who handled it.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.490
It wasn't me.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.470
This is great.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:03.886
And there's actually
research that

00:39:03.886 --> 00:39:06.440
shows that for every month of
paternity leave a dad takes,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.082
mom's lifetime earnings
increased by 7%.

00:39:10.082 --> 00:39:12.290
There's even research that
shows that paternity leave

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.840
impacts dad's relationships
with their children

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.180
when they're teenagers.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.440
It's really pretty incredible.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.080
KAREN: That's great.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.417
Lauren, thank you so much.

00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:24.250
Let's take some questions
from the audience.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:24.540
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Hi.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.165
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
coming and talking to us today.

00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:30.420
I'm actually about to head out
on my second maternity leave

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:36.000
next week, and I really
appreciate all this advice.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.540
So the challenge that I'm
facing is while emotionally it

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.700
was harder for me to leave
my baby, physically it was

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.950
actually easier to get
ready in the morning,

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.380
because he was still a blob.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:54.299
And breakfast didn't involve
a spoon and all these things

00:39:54.299 --> 00:39:54.840
and clean up.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.780
And so it was easier.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.007
I looked better in the
beginning because I

00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:00.840
could take a little bit
more time for myself

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.240
and just play with
him and look at him.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.840
And now that I have a toddler,
I have a two-year-old, that

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.560
is a way more demanding
sort of like contact sport,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.340
it feels like.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.625
And so I was curious what your
10th trimester looked like.

00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:17.679
What your second fifth
trimester looked like.

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:18.720
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Yeah.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.930
I'm in my 30th one
now, and it is--

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.570
bigger kids, bigger problems,
but they can communicate.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.840
So that's the big difference is
that your older child will now

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.847
be able to--

00:40:28.847 --> 00:40:30.930
for better and for worse--
communicate their needs

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.500
and listen to your
directions, too.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.930
I actually found I
was really helped

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.790
by being pretty deliberate
about how I used the time that I

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.500
had on my maternity leave.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.630
As I said earlier, we
had a nanny in our home,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.739
and we were able to keep
her employed and around

00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:50.280
while I was on
maternity leave, which

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.724
was a privilege and a luxury.

00:40:52.724 --> 00:40:54.390
But what that allowed
more than anything

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.840
was for me to take
special time with my older

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.190
child between nursings.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.410
Usually it was about 90
minutes every afternoon

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.510
where I would take him
out to go do something.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.390
And I felt, like
everything else about this,

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.874
it's about kind of pinching
yourself and reminding yourself

00:41:08.874 --> 00:41:11.040
that you are doing this
good thing that you planned,

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.331
that you were capable of doing.

00:41:12.331 --> 00:41:15.420
And so it gave me
time with him alone.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.562
Because my worry going back was
I was not just going to feel--

00:41:19.562 --> 00:41:21.270
I did feel better
about leaving the baby,

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.560
because I'd done it once before.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.684
I was going to feel terrible
leaving this child who

00:41:24.684 --> 00:41:27.180
could now ask me to stay.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.370
And so I really-- he was
only three years old,

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.009
but we talked a lot in that
time about why mommy works,

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:34.050
because I didn't want him
to get used to the idea

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.730
that I was just
going to be home.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.060
And I actually-- I was
lucky to work in a magazine

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.360
where I could show him the
pages of what I was working on.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:47.017
And I remember there
was a bunch of awards

00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:48.850
that we were giving out
to college students,

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.558
and some of them were
inventing all kinds

00:41:50.558 --> 00:41:54.120
of amazing cool technology, and
so he really related to that.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.690
And so for a year,
he would just say,

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.610
oh, my mommy makes a
magazine about women

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.570
who put clouds in the sky.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:00.420
You know.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.310
But it helped me so much
to feel like I was, yes,

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.130
the transition in the morning
was going to be messy.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.990
I was going to have
yogurt on my shirt.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:12.430
And if you plan for that,
you have an extra shirt

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.850
at your desk, if you can.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:18.150
But I felt so much
better and so much more

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.251
full of purpose and meaning
being able to communicate that

00:42:21.251 --> 00:42:21.750
to him.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.384
I think it goes a
long way for the child

00:42:24.384 --> 00:42:25.800
and for the parent
and to help you

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.190
get through the mess
of those early years.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.491
And it does get
easier, I promise.

00:42:32.491 --> 00:42:33.032
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:33.032 --> 00:42:34.600
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
[CHUCKLES] Did that help?

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.030
I don't know if that's
specific enough.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.020
AUDIENCE: No, it did.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.690
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
You don't want the baby

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.560
to get short shrift, yes.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.685
Well also, so that baby--
guess what that baby has?

00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:42.250
That baby has a big sibling.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.420
That's amazing!

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.062
The first kid didn't
have one of those.

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.020
I'm the oldest of four.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.590
I would love a big sibling.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.260
So you have to really
remind yourself

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.130
that what you're giving is
a whole family experience.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:58.690
And somebody asked me once why
I didn't use the word "balance"

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.200
more in the book than I did.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.240
And it's like I think
the word "balance" is

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.690
used maybe twice in 352 pages.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.180
And I said, it's because I
don't feel like anybody should

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.440
feel like they're a fulcrum.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.750
You shouldn't have to
like tighten your core

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.690
and stand like this.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.890
You should be able to lean way
in toward work sometimes, which

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.810
is just the nature of
the work that we do.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.820
I know it's the nature
of a work that you do.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.730
And you should be able
to lean way into family

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.162
sometimes, and not only just
when you're on vacation.

00:43:24.162 --> 00:43:25.870
There may be times
when there's something

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.470
going on with your kid that
requires your full attention.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:33.160
And so it's also giving yourself
the benefit and the grace

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.670
of the long-term
perspective and saying--

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:38.500
I'm even-- I'm
kind of ridiculous,

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.290
but I will even actually
put a date on my calendar

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.430
every three months,
seasonally, as a check-in

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.510
of how has my balance been?

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.300
Do I feel like yes, this
week was really work,

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.290
and this week was really kids,
but overall, does it feel lined

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:54.430
up the way I want it to be?

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.795
And I found--

00:43:55.795 --> 00:43:57.130
I like to control things--

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.840
I found that
control of something

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.390
that seems out of
control really helpful.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.239
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.280
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Sure.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:03.780
KAREN: OK.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.027
Question over here.

00:44:05.027 --> 00:44:06.610
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for being here,

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.287
but also thank you
for all of the work

00:44:08.287 --> 00:44:09.370
that you've put into this.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.550
Because what I can
honestly say is you

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.440
were able to put
data points together

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.350
to help explain emotions and
feelings that when you're

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.440
going through them as a
new mom or a second mom

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.170
or as a mom with a second
baby, third baby, et cetera,

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.030
you don't fully understand.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.340
Your husband will ask you,
well, how are you feeling?

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.335
And you're like, I'm
sad, but you can't really

00:44:29.335 --> 00:44:31.810
say why you're sad,
or you can't really

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.400
explain why you're
over emotional,

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.800
you just kind of are.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.060
And I think everyone
goes towards hormones,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.190
but there's other reasons
as to why you're sad.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.500
So as I was reading
through the book,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.480
there was one quote that
really stuck with me,

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.100
and I sent it to my husband.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.010
So the truth is we expect
more and more from mothers

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.110
without giving them
any more support.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.030
The result is you
have mothers who

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.560
think they should
be able to work

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.750
and have babies and
find that magic balance.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.780
So I found one of the balances.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.820
And then it says, the
result is every mom

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.970
feels like she's failing
and falling behind.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.430
I mean, you go through your
highs and lows, but I will say,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.230
as a new mom, most
the time, I really

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.110
did feel like I was falling
behind in the mom department.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:15.100
So I sent that to my
husband, and his reaction

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.470
was what's your opinion on it?

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.885
And I said, it's 100% true.

00:45:19.885 --> 00:45:20.660
No, no, no.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.805
It's 110%.

00:45:21.805 --> 00:45:24.355
Wait, it's 200% true.

00:45:24.355 --> 00:45:26.800
And his response to me was, hm.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.980
H-M-M-M-M-M. So he can't fully
understand what I'm going

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.570
through all the time, and
I completely respect that.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:41.170
But my question to you is I
felt I connected very much

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.570
to your book, but I
want to understand

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.170
how can I help my
husband connect

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.400
to some of the
topics in the book

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.910
so he has a better understanding
of what I've been through,

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.350
because I don't think I do a
very good job of explaining.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.260
I'm very much the fake
it until you make it,

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.634
until I have an overload,
and all of a sudden,

00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:02.550
we're in a huge fight.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.258
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
Oh, we sound similar.

00:46:04.258 --> 00:46:05.107
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:46:05.107 --> 00:46:06.690
Thank you for reading
that part of it.

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.570
Well, it's funny.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.390
There's so much I've
actually learned

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.446
since I've written the book, in
the speaking and the consulting

00:46:13.446 --> 00:46:14.320
that I've been doing.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.807
And a woman at a
law firm recently

00:46:15.807 --> 00:46:18.182
told me, she was like, I've
got to share with you exactly

00:46:18.182 --> 00:46:19.431
what I did, because it worked.

00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:20.800
And she's amazing.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.350
So before she went back to
work, after having her baby,

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:26.480
she got really, really concrete.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.720
And I think I mentioned
that this book does not have

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.160
very many to-do lists in it.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.620
So she made not a to-do
list, but a what it

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.700
takes list every single
thing that goes into not just

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.780
child care, but who's managing
the paperwork and the bills

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.580
in the house, who's
remembering people's birthdays,

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.750
and got really
granular about it.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.790
And she told her husband
she was doing it,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.350
so it didn't come
out of left field.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.420
And then she said, I want you
to add everything to this list

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.336
that you can think of.

00:46:53.336 --> 00:46:54.834
And she had thought
of most of it.

00:46:54.834 --> 00:46:55.750
He added a few things.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.181
I think she was glad that
he had some things to add.

00:46:58.181 --> 00:46:59.680
And then she said,
let's make a time

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.305
and sit down together
and go through it

00:47:01.305 --> 00:47:03.130
and divide it up evenly.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.570
And you did have--
it takes work.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.570
You have to assign a time
to each of the things.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.950
But the act of doing it feels
so empowering that even if you

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.780
waver from that list,
and maybe you're

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.760
doing the laundry one
night instead of him

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.730
because who knows why,
the fact that it exists

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.700
is something to come back to.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.450
And the fact that from
the very beginning,

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.600
you've established that a
lot of this is in your head,

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.230
this is the mental load problem,
and not necessarily in his.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.540
Getting it on paper is
really good for both of you.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.954
So that's one tip that
I've taken from a reader.

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:47:40.786 --> 00:47:42.410
KAREN: Let's go with
one more question.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much, Lauren.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.706
And I just want to
echo what Heidi said.

00:47:44.706 --> 00:47:46.730
It's awesome to have
you here, and thank you

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.104
for putting all
of this together,

00:47:48.104 --> 00:47:49.990
so us busy working
moms don't have to.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.170
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
It's my pleasure.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.253
AUDIENCE: The question I
have touches on something

00:47:53.253 --> 00:47:56.320
that you spoke about just
briefly, motherhood debt.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.750
So I took my maximum
amount of leave,

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.100
because it was given
to me, and I should.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.960
But returning to work has left
me feeling like I'm behind,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.170
and I'm now scrambling
to take on as many things

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:13.970
as I can to get back
ahead, which then puts me

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.740
in a feeling of being
completely overwhelmed.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.115
And I'm wondering if you have
any thoughts or perspective

00:48:19.115 --> 00:48:20.779
on that that you could share.

00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:22.820
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Well,
I do think some of that

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.860
can be handled
industry by industry.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.360
I can't remember
if I mentioned this

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.940
when I was talking about
the post-leave things

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.000
that companies can do, but
there is so much, especially

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.210
if you're working in a
bonus-driven business,

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.640
in a business that
has commission,

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.860
in a business with
billable hours,

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.220
where it's just so quantifiable
what you've missed out on.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.310
And I think that needs to
be accounted for somehow

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.920
in the leave policy and in
the benefits policy that

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.850
come around having children.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:53.660
Anytime you can put numbers
and dollars to something,

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:58.760
it really does help, and you
internalize that value as well.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.790
But some of it is just
hard, and some of it,

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.414
it just takes time
to get through.

00:49:04.414 --> 00:49:06.080
I will say-- this is
going to sound kind

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.800
of counter-intuitive-- but one
thing that a lot of women told

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.119
me has helped them is--

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:13.660
and again, I don't want to add
anything anybody's to-do list.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.970
But when you come back,
if you can do something

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.790
to help one of your colleagues
who doesn't have children

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.950
or who might have grown
children and is not

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:25.250
near this phase of life
anymore and tend to something,

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.500
do them a favor,
tend to something

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.350
in their personal
life, and you'll

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.600
feel so good, first of all,
that you were able to even

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.430
think beyond your own little
bubble of need right now,

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.090
which is very real, but
it also sends a signal

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.910
that this is not
just a uterus issue.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.190
This is not just a
having a baby issue.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.160
This is a greater personal life
need issue in the workplace.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.980
And it also just sends
this message that yeah,

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.680
you caught that ball for me
for some time while I was out.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.100
I'm going to be here to catch
it for you too if and when you

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.810
have a parent who gets sick.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:00.020
This is just about being a
good person in the workplace

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.600
and bringing that
goodness to work

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.216
and helping it fuel
the work that you do.

00:50:05.216 --> 00:50:06.590
And so that can
feel really good,

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.090
to feel like you're doing
something for someone

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:09.131
else in that moment, too.

00:50:11.766 --> 00:50:14.032
KAREN: Let's take
one last question.

00:50:14.032 --> 00:50:15.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.470
I just have a question
about the language we

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.370
use to describe parental leave.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.535
I find myself even doing
this, but saying, oh,

00:50:23.535 --> 00:50:25.285
Google has a really
generous leave policy.

00:50:25.285 --> 00:50:27.940
And I think that undermines
the business value

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.290
side of why we do it.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.860
This isn't just because you
want to be nice to new moms.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.980
So I was wondering if you could
offer some alternative language

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:41.030
to use and also maybe share
some of the business-side value

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.750
that a company gets from
providing something like this,

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:44.020
other than [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.410
LAUREN SMITH BRODY:
I love this question.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:46.240
I love this question.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:46.906
You're so right.

00:50:46.906 --> 00:50:48.970
It's not generous, it's humane.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:52.510
Because it is actually kind
of the baseline standard

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.200
in every other developed
country in the world and even

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.241
in a lot of developing
countries, too.

00:50:59.241 --> 00:50:59.740
So yeah.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.980
I'm going to change my
lexicon in that way too.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.810
It's humane leave
that's given here.

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.820
So I think the best
thing that you can do

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.540
is to think the way
you're thinking about how

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.785
you express this transition.

00:51:14.785 --> 00:51:16.690
Sorry, tell me again the
second part of your question.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:17.740
Oh, about the value.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.239
OK.

00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:20.830
AUDIENCE: So I think even
different than it being humane,

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.099
but it's also like Google
is doing this because they

00:51:23.099 --> 00:51:24.390
are benefiting from it as well.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.656
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Yes.

00:51:24.656 --> 00:51:25.156
Absolutely.

00:51:25.156 --> 00:51:26.500
So there are studies.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.030
There are plenty
of studies, and you

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.040
have to look internationally
to find them, unfortunately.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040
Well, that's not totally true.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.560
There's good studies
in California

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.270
that show that business has
not suffered and has actually

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.770
improved.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.650
And this was surveys
of business owners

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.790
since they implemented
paid family leave,

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.330
but their paid
family leave is tiny.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.160
New York state, of
course, just unrolled

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.120
its first phase of paid family
leave as well, which is--

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.180
the way it's set up is
a model that is actually

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.155
almost identical to
the Family Act, which

00:51:54.155 --> 00:51:56.530
had been proposed for years
and years on a federal level.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.970
And so my hope is that if
it succeeds in New York,

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:01.650
and if we see it rolling out
reasonably over the next--

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:03.550
it's from now till 2021--

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.310
that it will have
greater national impact.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.744
But to find real data about
what the value of this is,

00:52:09.744 --> 00:52:11.410
you really have to
look internationally.

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:16.420
So Norway is ranked consistently
the happiest country

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.840
in the world.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.644
It also has a huge percentage--

00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:21.310
I wish I had it on
the tip of my tongue,

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.980
and I don't-- of not
just working moms,

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.730
which can be a little bit
of a misunderstanding,

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.740
but full-time working moms.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.650
Huge percentage of moms
in Norway work full time.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:36.430
They have incredibly
humane benefits

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:38.757
around parental leave for
both the mom and the dad.

00:52:38.757 --> 00:52:40.840
And then when you look at
the economic side of it,

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.800
actually, their GDP
average per capita

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:48.850
is the highest of, I think,
the 18 top-developed countries

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:49.730
in the world.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.370
So you have moms and
dads who are home

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.680
with their babies
for this vital time.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.140
They are staying
in the workforce

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.870
in a full-time capacity
and then contributing

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.120
to their countries' economies.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.190
That's really compelling.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.890
The other thing that I
like to tell people about

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.932
is a study that was done
by KPMG for Vodafone

00:53:06.932 --> 00:53:08.890
when they were trying to
look at their policies

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:09.830
in all their countries.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.650
And they're not a huge presence
here in the United States,

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.870
but they're very big in
Europe, in particular.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:18.619
And they looked at the
value of offering, it was--

00:53:18.619 --> 00:53:19.660
I want to get this right.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.340
It's six months of
paid leave-- maybe

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.150
it's 16 weeks of paid leave, but
then also this gentle re-entry

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:29.080
plan of paying for, I think, six
additional weeks of full-time

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.440
pay at part-time
work upon return.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.390
And they found, when
they did the math on it,

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:38.110
that it would save-- if every
private company in the world

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.350
did this, it would
save $19 billion

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.860
in money that is lost
from people leaving.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.690
Retention is
incredibly valuable,

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:52.630
and also it doesn't even put a
price on the reputation boost

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:56.290
that you get from having
these humane policies.

00:53:56.290 --> 00:54:00.291
So it's retention, it's
recruiting, it's reputation.

00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:03.172
All of that, if you
can put a dollar amount

00:54:03.172 --> 00:54:05.380
on that in any way, it makes
a really compelling case

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.970
when you ask for what you need.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:07.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:09.040
KAREN: Thank you.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.100
Well, Lauren is going to
stay and sign some books.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.780
We have books in the back.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.880
And you guys should
all read this book.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.134
It's amazing, life
changing, totally relatable.

00:54:19.134 --> 00:54:20.800
And Lauren, thank you
so much for coming

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.910
to chat with us at Google.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.410
What a treat to have you here.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:25.260
LAUREN SMITH BRODY: Thank you.
