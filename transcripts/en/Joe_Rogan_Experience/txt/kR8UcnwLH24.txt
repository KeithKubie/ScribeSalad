Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Three, two, one and we're back. What's up? How are you are back. I love it. Good. Nice to be back here. When you first came here, you were thinking about running for president and now you're out there. We're all in. It's happening. Yes. Nervous. No. Is it weird? No. No. Not at all. Do you feel like this is like destiny? No, that was enough. Feel weird. I'm on a mission. I'm on a mission. Uh, you know, there, there's a lot of issues I think we're going to talk about, about why I'm running for president, uh, but being out and connecting with people all across this country, bringing this message, um, really of, of ending these wasteful, destructive, a foreign policies that have been so costly on the American people for so long. Cost the, on our troops Casi on our veterans, ending these wasteful regime, change wars, ending this new cold war and nuclear arms race and taking the trillions of dollars that we've been spending on these programs and that we will continue to spend if the status quo is allowed to continue and investing those dollars back into serving the people.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       In our communities serving the people of this country. Things like health care, education, infrastructure, protecting our environment, clean water. There's so much that we need to do. We've got limited resources to accomplish that. These are my favorite things that you talk about. Um, my question is always though, why do we spend so much time and money and at such a titanic human costs. Yeah. For these rigid regime change wars, what do you think is the cause like other than the obvious, if we, you have a dictator that's in place, there's an obvious outcry like Saddam Hussein post nine 11. Other than that, what is, what is the reason why we invest so much time and energy into regime change war? So much so that we've just accepted that this is a part of our gross economy. Like if you're going to take all the money that the United States earns and all the money that goes to taxes, we just automatically put a gigantic chunk of that into investing in these wars in other countries blindly.

Speaker 1:          00:02:08       Why is that? Almost without any kind of traditional real accountability. Uh, six to $8 trillion is what's estimated that's been spent since nine 11 alone on these regime change wars without even taking into account what the cost will continue to be to take care of our veterans, those who have gone and, and fought in these wars and have come home dealing with, you know, visible and invisible wounds that, that they'll have to live with for, for the rest of their lives. Let's start back. You mentioned Saddam Hussein. Uh, I don't think it was necessarily an obvious outcry. Saddam Hussein, uh, and the toppling of his regime was done for oil, right? It was done for financial reasons and the architects of that Iraq war, uh, sold it in the guise of, hey, Saddam Hussein is working with al Qaeda, those terrorists who attacked us on nine 11, and he's going to give them his weapons of mass destruction, both of which turned out to be false false intelligence and lies that were sold to the American people, sold to soldiers.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       People like me, uh, who, who believed what they said. You know, I enlisted after nine 11, like so many people in this country to go after the terrorists who had attacked us on that day killing thousands of Americans and they sold this lie, uh, for financial gain for oil. You, you look at some of the architects of that Iraq war, guys like John Bolton, who today is president Trump's national security council director. And you look at what's happening in Venezuela, almost the very same playbook being used or they're selling this, this regime change effort, uh, threatening to use US military force to go in and topple a regime under the guise of humanitarianism. When in fact in Bolton has said this on national television that well, we really want to make sure that American oil companies are able to go in and access that oil rich country in Venezuela.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       So you think that's why there's so much turmoil in the country right now. This is this battle over regime change because of the fuck they want to control the oil. I think the, the u s coming in and trying to insert itself into what is happening in Venezuela is what is, what is the problem? So they're doing that through a very, very heavy sanctions. Uh, they're doing that through various means and threatening to use our military to go in and topple the regime there rather than taking the approach that I would take as president, which is to recognize that the people of Venezuela, like people in other countries in the world need to be the ones to determine their governance and their future. Just like we wouldn't want any other country to come in and threaten to use their military to topple our government or to tell us who should or shouldn't be the leaders in our country.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       We shouldn't be doing that in their country. There are a serious issues that are causing a lot of suffering for the Venezuelan people. If we really want to be helpful, we should be a force to help move towards reconciliation and peace rather than what this administration is doing, which is, uh, throwing fuel on the flames of a civil war. That will be devastating. Devastating. When you say move towards reconciliation now, well you see there's differences, right? There's the people who are with the current government in Venezuela and there is the opposition. Clearly they have differences on what kind of future, what kind of governance and who should lead that government, uh, going forward rather than threatening to use the United States, the United States coming in and trying to act once again as the world's police. Uh, which by the way, throughout history has not had good results, not for the people in those countries. What to speak of the cost that, uh, we, the American people pay. Okay. Rather than saying, hey, let's, let's work towards peace, try to push for diplomacy and find what are the conditions that would make some form of reconciliation,

Speaker 2:          00:06:08       uh, going forward. Is there an argument, and I'm, I really don't know the answer to this, but is there an argument that these regime change wars, although terrible, we would be way worse off

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       if those weren't in place. I think that's an argument that proponents for regime change wars try to make, but history shows and proves that the very opposite is true. Look at Iraq. You can look at Libya, you can look at Syria, you can look at Guatemala and Ecuador. You can look at other countries, uh, Iran, where in the past we have either overtly or covertly through the CIA, gone in and toppled, uh, leaders of countries are dictators or regimes. And the result has been more suffering for the people in those countries. Their lives have been made worse off, not only in the short term but in the long term. And the cost, once again to the American people has also taken a toll as we see more and more of our hard earned taxpayer dollars going to pay for these wars. Uh, these regime change efforts that are counter to our national security interests, counter to the interests of the American people encountered the interest of the people in those countries.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       So is this one of those things is just a counterintuitive thing where you would think that getting rid of someone like Kadafi would be a good idea? He's a terrible evil person, but they get rid of them. Now. Libya is a failed state. It's, it's horrible what is happening. And Livia as a result of that, as you said, watch slave auctions on youtube. It's insane. Exactly. It's hard to imagine that an era of Youtube and slave auctions exists in a place that, you know, at least some part of the blame has to be on supporting the rebels that went in and took out Kadafi like it's not good to have. See, it's one of those counterintuitive things, right? Where it's not good to have an evil person in control of a country, but it's also not good to kill him. I think. Get rid of them. And then this power vacuum, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       Yeah. It's that, um, it's, it's hard to accept sometimes the reality that there are bad people in the world. Yeah. There are leaders of countries who are doing bad things against, there are people. What the real question is, is we recognize this is the world that exists in reality, not the world that we wish existed. And then the question is for the leaders of our country is what role should the United States play? Does it make sense to try to act as the world's police? As we have been for far too long, both as we look at what is in the best interest of the American people, what's in the best interest of our national security as well as, uh, what impact will our actions have on the people in these countries? And with Libya, not only do we see strengthened terrorist groups, there are terrorist groups all over Libya now failed state.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       The Libyan are suffering, uh, now far more than they were before. But we see the ramifications of that in countries like North Korea where again, John Bolton in the Trump administration is talking about using the Libya model with North Korea as we work towards this objective of denuclearize the Korean peninsula. Uh, one of the leaders in the North Korean government just said the other day, the United States government is talking about using the Libya model with North Korea to get them to get rid of their nuclear weapons. They don't want to end up like Libya or Iraq. Where in Libya is you? Remember the United States went in and told Gadhafi, Hey, get rid of your nuclear weapons program and we're not going to come after you. And he did. He got rid of it. And what happened a very short time later the United States and other countries went in and took him out. So that action in that decision, that policy is directly undermining our national security and our efforts to make us and the world more safe to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       So would the argument for regime change wars being that, would it be that if we didn't go over there and if we didn't have a military presence and we didn't make them fight against us, that they would somehow or another gain more power and they would, we would deal with this evil superpower is this, there's this like the worst case scenario for the pro interventionist foreign policy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even go that far. I mean, the, the argument that's made by people who are advocating for these regime change wars is we've got to do something to help people who are suffering. That's generally the argument that's made a, and they sell this to the American people knowing that, hey, we, uh, we have, we have good hearts and we want to help people if we can. But what they fail to do is to tell the truth and be honest about what they are hiding behind this guys of humanitarianism, right? I mean, if you look at Saudi Arabia for example, and you look at the kinds of atrocities that, that theocratic dictatorship, uh, is conducting against its own people, decapitating Lgbtq people persecuting religious minorities, uh, being the biggest propagator of this, this most extreme intolerant ideology of Islam that is fueling terrorist organizations like isis and al Qaeda waging a genocidal war in Yemen killing tens of thousands of people.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Uh, you know, that murder of the journalists in Turkey, the list goes on and on and on. Yet, what are we hearing from leaders in our government, both Democrats and Republicans? Saudi Arabia is a great ally of the United States, but then you look at what's happening in Venezuela ready to launch our military to go in and take out another dictator ready to go in and launch our military ready to and wage a war against Iran. So this is, this is evidence of the hypocrisy that exists between those who are waging regime change war in some countries, by the way. Usually countries that don't have nuclear weapons and usually countries where they have some other underlying interests and ulterior motive, which is not helping the people of those countries. And then when it's convenient for them, countries like Saudi Arabia sidling up to a country whose leadership directly and indirectly supports al-Qaida the very terrorists who attacked us on nine 11 who we are trying to defeat. W

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       your position on Syria is one the, I think people have misconstrued. Why don't, why don't you tell me that's putting it nicely. That's trying to put as nicely as possible. They've actually said that you are an Assad supporter. I know this is not correct. Yeah. But is that one of those things where people just say that in order to sort of diffuse you to categorize you as a ridiculous person right off the bat where no one can take anything else you say? Seriously? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       It's, it's the usual tactic of, uh, trying to smear or vilify me and my campaign and, and what I'm advocating for, uh, because they don't want to engage on the actual issue itself that I'm pointing out about how devastating and costly their policies are of continuing to wage these wasteful regime change wars of choosing to support terrorist groups like al Qaeda in Syria directly in Syria because they are the most powerful force on the ground who's fighting to take out the regime Assad's government. So they're so focused on toppling this government in Syria that they're willing to actually use taxpayer dollars to provide direct and indirect support to al Qaeda terrorists in Syria. When you think about how crazy this is, uh, it, it makes me angry. I think it makes most people angry. It's why introduced legislation called the stop arming terrorists act. Why we would need to have such legislation is beyond me, but it clearly we do to make it so that we don't have any tax payer dollars going directly to provide any kind of arms or support or, or anything to terrorist groups like al Qaeda, but also to make it so that we're not providing support indirectly through countries like Saudi Arabia who are providing that support to terrorist groups.

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       So what, what has been said of you about Assad then your, your position on Assad? That's just been an outright lie?

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       Uh, virtually everything. I mean, I'll just tell you what happened. I went to Syria, uh, to, to meet with Syrian people, to hear for myself from them about what was happening there. A while there I was offered the invitation to meet with the president of Syria and I took it because I think it's important for us to have the courage to meet with leaders, whether they be friends or adversaries or potential adversaries if our focus is on national security and on piece. So I went and I had that meeting and I asked some tough questions and uh, heard from him his perspective on what was happening and what he was doing in his country and took the opportunity while there to meet with religious leaders, college students, members of the political opposition, small business owners, um, you know, women who are working to, to start their own business, to empower other women, Shia, Sunni Muslims, Christians, Catholics, people of all different religions.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       Uh, it is because of that and that meeting and my staunch opposition to regime change wars in Syria and in other countries that political opponents and others have chosen to try to smear me my reputation and my campaign. Uh, and to label me as you said, you know, she's a supporter of this dictator. Well, if that's true, then anyone who opposed the Iraq war is a Saddam Hussein lover is a lover of dictators and love Saddam Hussein. If you challenge their logic, you see how shallow it is and there's really none there. And, and what's exposed is, um, their refusal to engage on the facts and to stand behind why they continue to put the American people through these costly regime change wars and why they continue to wage these wars that are causing incredible suffering for people in different parts of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       Know it also, when you're having these conversations, which are incredibly, incredibly important globally, when you choose to distort people's positions like this, you're not helping anybody. No. You're making the whole thing more confusing. Yeah. So for someone like me who's on the outside, excuse me, and then has to watch all this go down, I have to go, well, why, why, why do you have reasonable people that make inaccurate statements about someone? Because they feel like if you do not,

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       If you don't refuse a meeting with Assad, there's something wrong with you, right? Yep. To not want to be in the presence of this person. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:05       Yeah. I mean, the, the, um, there's so much hypocrisy around this. You know, a lot of these people are the same people who applauded President Obama when he first ran for president in 2008. Uh, when he, I mean he did, he caused some controversy at that time saying yes, he would meet with the leader of Iran without preconditions that he would meet with leaders of other countries in that pursuit of national security and peace. Yeah. So why the double standard here? That, okay. So in order to keep our country safe, in order to achieve peace, we're only gonna meet with our friends and people who we agree with. That's not how you accomplish that mission. That's not how you accomplish security and peace. It doesn't make sense.

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       Circles, social version of running the world, sadly, sadly. Now, had you ever met anyone like Assad before?

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Um, no. What was that like? No, he was eager to meet. He was eager to be heard,

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       frankly. Does he speak English

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       very well? Really? Yeah. I think he was educated in Europe, um, at dentist, if I'm not mistaken. Uh, it's in the middle. Maybe he's an eye doctor is not in the medical field. Hmm. MMM. And he was, you know, he was open to, to any and all questions that I had both about what was happening, uh, in Syria, uh, you know, serious relationship or the lack thereof with Israel. A lot of the, um, turmoil that we're seeing in different parts of the Middle East of, of Sunni versus Shia. MMM. Chemical weapons being used. Uh, you know, criminal acts being conducted, a whole host of these issues. How do, how, how, uh, the Syrian government is dealing with the, the Kurdish population in the northern part of the country. What's going on in Turkey? There was, there was a number of things that, uh, you know, I, I asked and he answered and he shared his view and perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       And really what came out of that was he's, um, he's very narrowly focused on his country and doesn't want other people, countries, or other people coming in and, and a meddling in their country and what's, what, what there trying to accomplish, which is actually the same thing that I heard from his political opposition when I met with them. These are some of the leaders who, who led the protest that, um, that kind of began this whole conflict in 2011 people who are deeply opposed to the Syrian government, some of whom have been held in captivity by the Syrian government. And they said there are constitutional changes we want to make. Yes, we would like to see Assad removed from government that they don't want to see it done through military means or through other countries coming in and toppling their government. What they want to see is that change coming from the people of Syria saying, hey, this is the kind of leadership that we want for our future.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       I can imagine there's not a single country on earth that wants us to invade and take over. I mean, it just seems like a bad idea for everybody,

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       right? Nor nor would we want that to happen to us. I think that's really what's missing here is, you know, for so long we've seen this imperialistic mentality, um, that still exists in our government where some feel like, hey, well we should go and tell this country who should lead their government and tell them what kind of policies they should have. But no other country should dare even attempt to do that to ours.

Speaker 2:          00:20:37       Well, our position is that we're the best and we're, we're running this country the best way and this is the best country that's ever existed, ever has the most freedoms. It's got the most, it's got a lot of things going on. It's not, they're not good, but yeah. Overall, yeah, we, we feel like we're the shining light of the world. Yeah. Maybe that's not accurate. You know, maybe it's accurate in a lot of ways. And Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       I think the problem, the problems begin when we go into other countries and try to create little mini America. Exactly. And impose it on the people there, whether they like it or not, whether they're ready for it or not. Uh, and, and we ended up seeing what we're seeing across the Middle East.

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       Yeah. I think we just looked at the rest of the world and go, well, I wouldn't tolerate that. Yeah. Why are they tolerating that? Who is that guy? Why does he get the road thing, say should kick his ass? That's literally the American perspective. But you know, we don't want to send our sons and daughters over there to go do that for the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Do you know if I put my tin foil hat? We don't, we, the American people don't. But this is the problem, and this is, this is something that I realized very quickly during my first deployment to Iraq where I was seeing firsthand the cost of war, serving in that medical unit every single day. And I, I wondered how many politicians in Washington who voted for, advocated for champion that war in Iraq. We're laying away at night awake at night thinking about my brothers and sisters who are getting killed in combat, who were getting severely wounded or getting blown up, eds and I, I, I learned very quickly, uh, that they were not, they weren't thinking about the real cost and the ramifications and the consequences of their decisions.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       Jimmy, who are we talking with the other day? We're trying to say that we think that if you want to be the commander in chief, that you should probably have served who was a, is the reason podcast CT Fletcher. Yes. I believe that it was him. Yeah. Who was a veteran as well. Hmm. MMM. That's one thing that you have over them for sure is that you understand from firsthand experience and sacrifice what it means to actually be in war and in, to be in combat. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Yeah. I mean, over, I still serve in the army national guard now over over 16 years. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. And, uh, coupled with my experience in, in Congress serving over six years on the foreign affairs and the armed services committees working intimately on these issues related to national security and our foreign policy meeting with leaders of different countries in the world. Uh, it is these experiences and the understanding that I've gained from them that best equip me to walk in the door, walk into the Oval Office on day one, ready to do the job of president. And most importantly, commander in chief.

Speaker 2:          00:23:24       What hurdles are you encountering that you didn't expect?

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       Uh, you know, a lot of what's happening are things that, that, that we kind of did expect, you know, the, the smear campaigns, the, the misinformation campaigns

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       that someone's doing on purpose or do you think this is team mentality and action where people are supporting a particular candidate and they look at you as being competition, that candidate? Like what do you think is hot

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       combination? Um, you know, I'm, I'm challenging the establishment, challenging the status quo, challenging the foreign policy establishment, uh, and challenging the political establishment in calling things. As I see them calling it straight and, and speaking the truth, whether that be calling out leaders within my own party or leaders of the other political party. And, um, I think that that strikes fear in a lot of people who are uncomfortable with it at a minimum and who are concerned. Because when, you know, we, the people rise up and say, hey, what's really going on here? We're, we're calling out self serving politicians in Washington from both political parties who are putting their own political interests or the interest of their party ahead of the interest of the people where they're putting the interests of, you know, whatever greedy corporation in their lobbyists is writing the biggest checks to there campaigns ahead of the interests of the people. So the more this awareness comes out, the more people stand up and speak out and say, hey, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. Then it's threatening that very power base that they, um, have, have thrived and lived off of for far too long.

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       We should talk about how you're funded to, to so people understand your position. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       People powered campaign. We take no, no PAC contributions, no lobbyist contributions. Every single dollar that comes to my campaign for president is coming from individuals, people across this country, whether it's a dollar or $1,000, people who are giving whatever they can, uh, and joining this movement.

Speaker 2:          00:25:32       There's a great joke. I've, I think it's from Dennis Miller hope I'm not misquoting it, but it's, he was talking about how politicians where patches on their jackets, like Nascar drivers that is like, you should have to know seriously. Yeah. So what should housing claimers there? What if I put my tinfoil hat on when I talk about these interventionists, foreign policy wars and and regime change wars. The, the tinfoil hat thinks military industrial complex. Yeah. People being asked or forced into making decisions that benefit these giant corporations that makes, make weapons and profit off of war. This is the worst case scenario in terms of conspiracy theories. The idea that someone wants war so that they can make money and they don't care if people die even needlessly. This is our number one conspiracy fear, right? If you had to think about of all the things that you hope are not true about the way the world works, that would probably be number one.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       Well, you can take your tinfoil hat off because the military industrial complex is a real thing. This is something that, um,

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       President Eisenhower talked about, which is an amazing, amazing speech.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Has his last speech. Yeah. As president of United States, all the things that he could talk about,

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       he chose to focus on the military industrial complex. Should we, how dangerous though it is. I feel like we should play this just cause it's literally play that clip. It's so crazy in most people have never heard it before. And you hear about the term military industrial complex and one thing that has been done that's really, really interesting is the word [inaudible]. Bureaucracy has become a dirty word and that dirty word or a word that [inaudible] it's, it's easy to make something silly by calling it a conspiracy. Yeah. Even though there are times where people conspire to do things. That's right. I mean that's why that word exists, right? It's not like people don't make plans to do things that are illegal. Yeah, of course they do it. That's why the FBI's around and yeah, but this is from the national archives and this was Eisenhower's speech, has he?

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       He was leaving office leave taking and farewell

Speaker 2:          00:27:40       1961 not getting very much attention when a new press was this Guy Jamie, you picked up the wrong version. Son of a bitch. I'm sure there's a, an actual version of it. Yeah. Here we go. Chill on January 17th, 1961

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       back when everything was black and white, the president of the United States. Good evening, my fellow Americans. We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed for and made your wars among great nations.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       [inaudible] this is a bad one to Jami son of a bite. While he's looking for the right clip. What? I think he's just going to play music in the background. That's all it's gonna do.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       What most people don't know is that his, his first draft of that speech said Congressional Military Industrial Complex.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:28:30       And somewhere between the draft and the speech that was delivered. He took out that word congressional, but he was directly connecting those dots that some may say, oh, well that's just a conspiracy theory, but he was connecting those dots with the influence that the military industrial complex has on leaders in Congress who are making decisions about how our money is spent and where our troops are sent off into battle. Gresham tunnel,

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       congressional military industrial complex.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       Wow, I need extra foil. Get you a new box.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       Well, I know it's crazy. Or they couldn't keep the camera steady back then either voice. Here it goes. Good. Are you doing my brother one? Skip it. I had a couple of seconds. A vital element in keeping the pieces are military. Establish our arms must be mighty ready for instant action. Show that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own disruption. Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peace guy or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or until the latest of our world conflicts. The United States had no armaments industry American makers of ploughshares could with time and as required make sardines as well, but we can no longer risking emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of basketball portion had to do this. Three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment.

Speaker 3:          00:30:17       We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States cooperation corporations. Now, this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is noon in the American experience. The total influence, economic, political, even spiritual is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend. It's grave implications. Our Toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved, so he's the very structure of our society. In the councils of government. We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. Okay. We should take nothing for [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          00:31:31       Right. You can listen to the rest of the speech if you want to online. But it's very chilling. Yes. Because this is the sitting president leaving office and this is what he wants to tell people. And a soldier, yes. He's a guy who had military experience. He's the guy who saw firsthand wearing the uniform and then serving as commander in chief. And this was his final warning to the nation. The military companies are like most companies, they always want to grow. Companies seek infinite growth. They're constantly seek better quarters every year. They want to make more money than it did last year. That's what they're doing there. They're in the business and making money. They're not just in the business of creating things. They, they're creating things for profit and they're gonna have a little wiggle room. And especially with politicians, politicians that are in their pocket and they've spent millions of dollars helping them along the way. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, they're gonna, they're gonna help each other. Yeah. And this long history of helping each other. That's right. That's um, I mean you, you, you see that very directly through contributions that are being made, uh, to politicians by different defense contractors, the

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       corresponding votes that are then taken. Uh, but you also see this corruption that's happening before our very eyes, uh, happening within places like the Pentagon where you either have people in uniform or civilians who are working in contracting, for example, in the Pentagon, laying the groundwork for writing up these contracts, major multimillion dollar contracts with these big defense contractors, and then lay down the uniform or you retire from service either as a civilian or in the military, and then you turn around, leave that door and walk into another door working for the very same contractor that you just wrote the contract for two, this is happening. This is what, this is what we need to change. And we're talking about both campaign finance reform, but also reforming this kind of corruption in this revolving door that's happening in different parts of our government. You see it happening in Wall Street to the SCC regulators.

Speaker 1:          00:33:38       People are supposed to be regulating Wall Street or coming from Wall Street and then going back to Wall Street to work for the very same companies that they were supposedly just charged to regulate. This is a big problem that we've got to fix. It was a fantastic documentary on that called inside job. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. You see when he's confronting these guys who are professors who then go and take these jobs and make millions of dollars with the very regulations that they help put into place. That's right. And it's happening with foreign policy as well. When you look at who, who are the main people who go and testify in front of Congress, uh, coming from think tanks, very well known, think tanks, uh, global think tanks that specialize in foreign policy. Uh, they don't have a placard on, on their desk when they're testifying before Congress saying we receive funding from Saudi Arabia, from cutter, from United Arab Emirates, from all these different countries who are spending a lot of money funding these thing takes that then come forward and uh, push policies or push ideas to leaders in Congress that not coincidentally benefit the countries that are funding them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       What, what could be done to stop that other than someone like you getting into power? Well and what could you do once you get in there? I think, I think two, two things. I mean obviously as as president and commander in chief, you set the tone for the kind of leadership that we have in this country that will put service above self and this is what what I will bring us present and bring those soldiers values of putting service above, self, putting service to the American people in your country first and foremost ahead of everything else, of head of the interest of a political party or a corporation or or a foreign country for that matter and work to pass legislation in Congress that would close these revolving doors that would require this transparency. When you're talking about who is funding and where is this money coming from, I think members of Congress should not be taking pat contributions, should be relying solely on contributions from people in this country so that they know exactly who is funding their campaigns don't really seems like a no brainer.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       Yeah. That one seems like a no brainer and it's something that the people want. It's something that that's starting to happen organically as more and more people, uh, are calling for this kind of reform and saying, Hey, look, if you want my vote, then I expect you to not accept those contributions and to run a people powered campaign. How many people were doing upside to, uh, there's a couple who are running for president. There is a slowly growing number of people who have run for and got gotten elected to Congress. Uh, but look, it's, it's a, it's in the margins compared to where we need to be. Now. One thing that exists now that really didn't exist when Obama was running for president is the impact of social media. It's just tenfold what it used to be. But with that also comes this reality that we're living in right now where there's only a few companies that are controlling the discourse in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       Yeah. I mean, you really have essentially a Facebook, Google, youtube, Twitter, and Facebook owns Instagram. That's right. And there's, you know, a couple of other small ones, but that's the bulk of our discourse. Yeah. What concern do you have about these private companies controlling the vast majority of communication between people on social media? Yeah, it's extremely dangerous. It's extremely dangerous when you think about it. And there's a few things. There's gosh with, with Facebook and Google for that matter. You know, they, they can set their algorithms, uh, Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and said his algorithm to control what information is coming across our newsfeed in Facebook. What are the stories that we're seeing? Instagram, same thing with Google. They can control when you punch in something, what are the first stories that you're going to see a on the first page that pops up? Uh, when you think about that kind of power of influence that has on the American people literally being held within the hands of a couple of people unchecked and without oversight or transparency, it's incredibly dangerous. Talk about free speech. There's just been news recently about Facebook banning certain individuals, uh, from having Facebook accounts because of their speech. They disagree with the speech that they're, they're using are the things that they're talking about, ideas that they're pushing forward, unchecked first amendment rights going completely out the window and monument is a don't apply because it's a private company, right? Yes. But they're trying to get the best of both worlds. Um, the fact that that, you know, they're claiming to say, hey, this is a free space for open communication for everyone. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       While at the same

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       time going and saying, actually, you know what Joe, I don't like what you're saying about this. So we're going to ban you

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       and

Speaker 4:          00:38:41       whoever your friends are from, from this conversation. Um, I think that's, that's a big problem at undermines. It undermines our first amendment rights and you look at privacy, the privacy concerns of all the information that they're collecting and Facebook from us, all the information that they're collecting from us, uh, with Google and how they're monetizing that and selling or sharing that information with other people with really without our, our knowledge or agreement. That's the part, right? The, the agreement that most people didn't understand that your data is a huge commodity. That's right. And we signed up for these things. And who reads terms of service agreements? Have you ever read one? Yeah, I've never read one of them. I just say, okay. Yeah. I started to get through like the first two paragraphs. Like, okay, I'm going to hope it's not ugly. Nothing terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       You know what I think back to there is a south park episode that that is specifically about the terms and conditions. And uh, I just, I hadn't watched it a long time ago, but every time I see one of those things pop up signing the terms things, I'm like, oh man. Yeah, that was Carmen, right? Yes. Yeah. You can't talk about it. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:39:51       okay. But there's, there's a thing that they're doing. There's a couple of things we're doing, but one of the things they're doing with this, um, with your data, they find out what you're interested in and they find out what you're interested in engaging on. Yeah. And for many people, that's outrage. So for many people it's the things that piss you off the most. Like if you have a real problem with Catholic priests getting away with having sex, a little boys, you will think that that's happening every minute of every day, all across the world. Because it's going to be in your news feed constantly because they know that's what makes you engage. Right. So your algorithm, the algorithm is your, your feet is going to be very different than my feet. Yeah. Cause I engage on different things than you do. And the problem with that is even if they're not calculating, if it's not on purpose, they're not trying to get people outrageous.

Speaker 4:          00:40:37       Not only that, trying to rabble rouse, but what they are doing is they, because they have an ad supported model, they gravitate towards the, the outrageous. Because that's what people get excited about. And that's what people make multiple posts about. And that's how they make their revenue. It gets a bad ad model. It's an an ad model that inadvertently supports outrage. Yeah. And it makes people think the world's worst planner and all of that. And this, the tribal boundaries between the, the two sides on these issues are more tense. And you would think that discourse and the ability to freely communicate would kind of open that up and people would kind of understand each other better, but it's not happening. It's like think Twitter is a garbage fire all day long. It's just fire. Like you can't post anything about anything and there's people just jumping on people and yeah, it's, it's a crazy thing that has happened that we gravitate towards the outrageous yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:32       I don't think should be rewarded financially. I think that's not, if this is just what people go to organically, that's one thing. But when you're cultivating feeds, so, or at least your algorithm is cultivating feeds so that people get pissed off, you're making the country a shittier place. Yeah. Like you're literally like making things worse. Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is one of the reasons why, um, I think a couple of things should happen. And, and uh, I think his name is Chris Hughes who cofounded Facebook with Zuckerberg. Saw that. Do you see as article calling for Facebook to be broken up? Yes. And which is crazy. You hear about the person who founded it and he's saying this is out of control. And that's the point right now is seeing how powerful, as you said, guys like Mark Zuckerberg have become and uh, and how out of control things are.

Speaker 4:          00:42:25       Well, some of it just doesn't make sense. Like here's one they just banned Alex Jones. Yep. Not only do they ban Alex Jones, but you can't talk about Alex Jones. If you wrote Alex Jones might be nuts, but damn, is he cute of you wrote that it would, you would get a message that says, only you can see this message. This message is stopped at the border from entering into the Facebook universe. Like what? The fuzzy, you can't just like what have you want to say something funny? You can't say something funny. No, you can only say something if you're criticizing him. Right. This is what they've said. It's telling you how to think, which is fucking insane. It is insane. Because that's not just Frisco. That's not just like a violation of free speech. You're literally directing speech. Yeah. Like that's insane. So you're, you're, you're not even blocking people from doing something hateful or evil.

Speaker 4:          00:43:19       You're blocking people from saying something that you disagree with. That's right. Which is, people have sent me messages that said, uh, God bless Alex Jones and they say, you can only see this message. Facebook sends them a thing blocking that message. Wow. That's fucking crazy. Like the idea that you think you can do that. Yeah. That is nuts. Yeah. I mean, being able to ban anyone arbitrarily without any just violated terms of service. There you go. What does that mean? Yup. Okay. Be specific. And how come, I mean they've, they took a bunch of people out, right? Like Louis Farrakhan was one, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson was like, what did that guy ever do? I mean, people don't agree with them. Like I think what's happening is there was some serious concern that Facebook was used to influence the last election. Again, whether against their knowledge or in a way where they were negligent about the type of filtering they use that stops people from posting propaganda and particularly stops these things like the IRA, the Internet research agency in Russia that literally creates thousands of profiles and pages and they'll have a black lives matter page that's

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       just designed to fuck with cops. And then they'll have a procop page is just designed to fuck with black lives matter. All they want to do is create anger and they're doing this engineering, these arguments. I mean this is, this is 100% proven fact. Renee de Resta, who had been on my podcast went over the details of how it's set up and how they do it and the means and the means that they create. Like this is an organized effort that they channeled through Facebook in particular. And then Instagram and a couple other social media sites.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       You know what's interesting about Renee, she worked for new knowledge, right? I do not think she was the director for new knowledge. MMM. They this company new knowledge that the DNC has tapped as one of their, um, I don't know, disinformation campaign experts in cyber experts was the very same company that created false accounts and pretended to be Russian bots in order to influence a US Senate election

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       in Alabama. Yeah, I'd heard of that. Right. So something that she was not a part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:39       Yeah, I know. I don't know her. She's a director of research, it says at new knowledge. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       Okay. And that, but that's post this happening. Correct. I don't, she sent me an email about it cause I questioned her about it after it happened. Yeah. And I don't think she's full of Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       Yeah. Well, I, yeah, I, I've never met her, but I know that that company is one that is often cited as, as, as a so called expert. And it was a company that was cited, um, uh, to try to smear my campaign as somehow being a, uh, an engine for the Russians or something like that. Which, which to me again, just points to, well, let's look at, let's look at the x, the so called experts that you're citing in this company. New Knowledge and the kinds of actions that they've been taking, the very same ones that they're criticizing others for doing.

Speaker 2:          00:46:25       It's a dirty world out there for a while. The last thing, the Internet, it is a wild west in the sense that, I mean I think there should be regulation like, I mean, I don't think you should be able to put child porn everywhere. I don't think she'd be able to dox people, but it's like where does that border stop? Yeah. Where does that regulation border stop? Yeah, and I think it's a very good question. Do you think that these social media platforms, whether it's Google or Twitter or whatever, Facebook, do you think that they should be treated as a public utility where everyone essentially has the right to use them. You have the right to use water. You don't have the right to take a hose and smash your neighbor's window and flood his house. I do.

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       I do think that they should be regulated like that and they should be subject to the very same antitrust laws that have been used to make sure that we don't have other monopolies in other industries or in other areas, uh, to, to, to break them up. And I think that was something that, uh, that Chris Hughes outlined in his article, the furry first step that could be taken is just to say, hey, you've got a, uh, you've got Facebook needs to let go of Instagram and what's APP? Because that was [inaudible] that that acquisition created an even stronger monopoly that really shouldn't have been allowed to take place in the beginning. And so there are, there are concerns about the kind of power being, um, you know, consolidated into the hands of a very few people, uh, as well as how that's impacting, uh, any kind of a competition and squashing that competition from coming up and saying, hey, you know, you've got Facebook and then you've got this other new tech, not social media technology. They've got better privacy standards and better service for the consumer than Facebook. But anytime that that tries to happen, uh, you know, they're quickly squashed by companies like Facebook or Google for that matter are bought up. Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:48:20       That's the big concern. So there's just not enough variety. And there's also a big concern that I have a big concern that there's a bunch of people that don't seem to understand the consequences of what they're calling d platforming people, which basically censoring people did taking people out of the public discussion. And when you, when you do that and you create a bubble or you create a one party leaning institution, one party leaning conglomeration of human beings, you're going to develop some real anger on the other side. Yeah. And it does the opposite of what you wanted to do. What you want to do is make the world a better place. Let's take some of these angry voices out of the mix and let's make the world a better place. It just makes them more angry.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Then encourage, encourage discourse. Encourage these kinds of conversations where you can, you can engage with people who might have a different view on an issue or might have a different experience that they bring to the conversation and to do so. That actually helps increase the knowledge and understanding that we have. Yeah. I think we have to reward

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       civil discourse as well. I think we have to be kinder to each other and we have to, we have to be more upset at people that are acting like shitheads online for no reason. Like you're just, you think that it's just online, but it, what it is is communication and if you're interested in shitty communication online, you're just a shitty communicator. Okay. All this column, it being a troll and all those different things, all these different labels that people put on to make it cuter and whitewash it. It's not good. It's not good for anybody. Yeah. If people could figure out how to be less angry and their online lives and wow and communicate about issues, I think we'd find that we meet more in the middle than we think we do. I think there's also a problem that people have where they become married to their ideas and they dig their heels in and they, they support their ideology and the very rigid about it. Yeah. And that is only strengthened when you silence people. Yeah. It's, it does the opposite of what you're hoping it's going to do. It makes the world a worse

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       place. It makes look, if people are saying things that you don't like, you don't have to read that. But if you tell people that no one can read that though, they're going to go, why do you get to decide who are you? Who are you? You are a regular person. How wiser you. Yeah. How many steps ahead of you played this game. That's right. Cause I'm looking at this game. I'm looking at civil war. Yeah. I'm looking at worst case scenario. This goes to that. That goes to this, this guy attacks that. That guy attacks this. They can't talk anymore. You got people fight in the streets. That happens. That's a human characteristic.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       That's right. That's right. And that's, that is where this path ends up. This path that we're on of this, this hyper partisanship, this extreme divisiveness where it's either you're in my tribe or you're in the other tribe and the arrows are pointed at each other without any willingness to, once again, just let's just have a conversation. Let me hear where you're coming from here, where I'm coming from. We can disagree without being disagreeable. We can even have a heated conversation and a debate. And I would at the end of it,

Speaker 4:          00:51:25       you're saying is patriotic. Yeah. This is patriotic. And I think it's unpatriotic to be partisan. Yeah. Cause I think we're supposed to be on a team together. Yeah. This is supposed to be team America. Exactly. What do we do? We're, we're fighting over nonsense and missile mis, characterizing people's positions just to suit our own ideas. That's right. It's,

Speaker 1:          00:51:44       it's foolish. It's foolish. And as you said, it's extremely dangerous. And the American people are the ones who, who ultimately lose in all of this. Uh, this has been one of the most frustrating things that I've seen and experienced throughout my over six years in Congress that really started, um, like when I first went up after I got elected, uh, we're after every election happens in new members of Congress. They go and they have what's called new member orientation and they give you these books and here's the maps and here's where your offices and you know, all the, all the administrative and logistical stuff. But very quickly, I would say within the first few days, um, you know, where we first come in together as Democrats and Republicans, Immediately Kate Democrats go this way. Republicans go this way, immediately separated. And what were told right off the bat is, look, this is about, uh, getting wins for our political party.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       And if you work with the Republican, then that's going to hurt the party. Especially if you work with a Republican and the Democratic Party is trying to take out, forget the substance of the idea, forget the substance of the bill. And this happens on the opposite side is while Republicans with Democrats, both both political parties or dif or are, I'm guilty of this, where they're really putting the interest of the political party ahead of the people who just voted for us to go and serve them. And not just the Democrats who voted for me, but yes, the, the independence and the Republicans both who voted for me or who didn't, but who, uh, I serve as part of my constituency. And uh, you just, you continue to have continued to see this where, you know, you'll have a bill that, because it's Democrat, Bill Republicans

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       vote against it. Substance aside or Republican Bill Democrats voted against it just because it's a republican bill. But then, hey, if, if they come in and you know, a month or a year later introduced the same bill or a similar bill, but now because it's a democratic bill, okay everybody, hey, let's go, let's go and support this legislation. You can imagine why there is so much gridlock in Washington, why nothing really gets done. And ultimately how this divisiveness in this hyper partisanship is hurting the ability for the needs of the American people to be served. When you talk about people at yourself that are completely funded by the public and you have this very logical and objective way of discussing this gridlock, do you think that the future is in young people like yourself getting involved in politics, that they, they're not connected to this old world for 35, 45 years, this world?

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       It sounds like this is just what you do. Yeah. I mean I watched house of cards. I get kinda get it sort of what that, that seems like chaos and it seems like there's no way to fix that. It's almost like these people have to stop being politicians. They have to be voted out or die off when done well. I think it's evident where we see those who are very entrenched in this, um, this broken system feel very threatened by the rise of people powered campaigns, individual contributions coming in and supplanting the big money that they get from, um, you know, packs and packs and lobbyists and, and, and there's fear there because they see, um, their whole world being disrupted by people like me or others who are coming in and saying, no, we're not buying into any of that and we're coming in to actually fulfill the mission that we've been charged with by those who voted for us to serve the people, all the people of this country.

Speaker 4:          00:55:26       And would you say that, would you, well this is my position. I think that Trump plays a part of that because I think he was the first guy to camp the, come to come in basically self funded or being funded through his own means and not listening to the rest of the Republican Party saying, Hey, I'm going to take over and I'm going to do this my way. And then knowing that he could do that and knowing that there were so many Republicans against him and knowing that there's so many Democrats against him as well, but yet he's still the president. Yeah. People like Jesus, this is a fragile system or the system is, it's what they've done to acquire power is still very vulnerable. Even though they have this deeply entrenched system of weird little relationships that it's not good enough that if the people do rise up and they decide, hey, we want to put Tulsi in as president, you're going to have a different situation. A lot of you clowns going to be out of work. Absolutely. I mean, and that's really, that's the message that we're carrying to, to living rooms, town halls and communities

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       across the country is, uh, Washington continues to underestimate the power of the people. And it's supposed to work for you. Exactly. And that's the thing is, you know, our founding fathers had this vision for our country that our government would be of the people, by the people and for the people. And instead what we have is a government of the rich and powerful by and for the rich and powerful of the special interests in corporations buy in for the special interest in corporations and you know, we, the people get left behind

Speaker 4:          00:56:54       and they continue to talk to us like they're in control. Yeah. They're one of us and they're supposed to be public. Employees are supposed to be servants. That's right of the public. They don't talk like that. No. They talk like people who are in a position of power and influence and it's not healthy. It's not a healthy perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       DEF, it's evident of that huge disconnect between the bubble that is Washington and the reality of the lives that we live every day. People all across this country.

Speaker 4:          00:57:21       That's always the case though. When people get in control of things though is metal, make it easier for them, make it better for them. What can I do to make this a little easier? Is there another way? How can I help myself here? How can I make sure that when I get out of office I can do these public speaking tours and make a quarter million dollars a pop. Yeah. When I hear about the money those guys make to just go and talk. Yeah. What? Who is paying for that? He was paying to listen to Hillary Clinton getting out of it. Why are you getting out of that? Can I listen? I would love to like pretend to be a banker, to put a lizard skin face mask on and go sit with those bankers and listened to one of those conversations that Hillary Clinton got paid a quarter million dollars to talk to.

Speaker 4:          00:58:00       Yeah. Never released the transcripts for what is that about? Who is, it's some weird sneaky deal that they make where nobody wants to pay that like go to that. A massive scar guards see many tickets you sell. Right, exactly. That their bill and Hillary are doing like the speaking tour thing right now. I am baffled as to who is going to pay to go see bill and Hillary bullshit them. They're doing it together now, right? Yeah. Pell is so old. Why didn't you just come clean? You know, I, I would love to get that guy and just get them drunk and put them on the edge. Just like have him just talk about life. No, you only got like a few years left. Everything's falling apart in your body. What are your regrets? What'd you do wrong? What could you have done differently? Stop all this bullshitting.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       Like w you know, have him on your show. I would love to, I would love to do mushrooms with them. That's what I wanted to have him on the show and do it in Colorado because they did some analyze mushrooms. It's just this role of being the person that is in control of this country is always been this impossible task. And when I see a person like you who wants to do it, I say, listen, you have some of the best ideas in the most healthy perspective that I've ever heard from anyone that's ever running for president. But why would you want to do that to yourself? Those are the two things that I think go because it's not for myself

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       and, and it's not to be in control of the country and the people. It's to serve the people and our country. It's a continuation of this mission that I've chosen for my life to be of service, to find different ways to do that. You know, it started in Hawaii with gathering my friends as a kid and going in and picking up trash off the beach on the weekends and experiencing even then at a young age that that made me happier then than anything else. Then, you know, going and playing video games with my friends or anything like that and that MMM. That mission that that was deeply ingrained in me further with my service in the military, serving as a soldier where, you know, I'm serving alongside people of all walks of life as you know, every race, religion, ethnicity, orientation, everything, every one of us wearing that same uniform, serving that same flag that represents the American people with that laser like focus on putting service above self. And that's what I seek to bring to the White House. To, to restore those values of integrity and honor and respect to make it so that that White House is a beacon of light for the American people to know that that White House belongs to them and represents them and their interests and their interests alone.

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       Does anybody, yeah. I mean, even a person like you who's on the outside, do you think anybody truly knows what it's like to run the country until they get in there? Do they, can you even have an idea of what, how impossible a task it is to be in control of the economy, the environment, the, the infrastructure, the military, our position in the world to get it seems like the most insane duty. Yeah. To require someone to run all those things and be aware of all those things. To be responsible for all of the successes and all of the failures. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       MMM. It's an awesome responsibility. There's no question about that. Uh, and I think it fulfills that, um, that hire, that hire, that higher calling that this is not about any kind of selfish interest. This for me is not about any kind of ambition that I've had. I've never had any kind of thought, well, I want to be president one day, or even I want to be a member of Congress one day. It's always been about how can I, how can I best be of service and how can I make a greater impact? And that's what I've seen throughout my time in Congress where I've served on these committees. I've served on the foreign affairs in armed services committees. I've been been calling for and fighting for an end to these wasteful regime, change wars and end to this new cold war and nuclear arms race. There's only so much I can do as a member of Congress, uh, to be able to serve as president and commander in chief. I know that I can make that kind of impact and see change in our policy that keeps our country safe, that moves us closer to that future of peace and prosperity. And that's where I hope to be able to make a difference

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       if you'd become pros, excuse me, when you become pros, there you go. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       And

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       you do get to change the way we spend money and stop spending money on these regime change wars. What would be the first thing you invested in in this country and how would you go about doing that

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       question? I think there's, um, I'd want to give that some thought because there are a whole host of, of challenges that we're facing. You know, I mean, healthcare is, is among the top of the list. And you know, we've talked a little bit about that the last time I was here. Our crumbling infrastructure continues to be something that's not only just uncomfortable every time we're driving over potholes, it's actually, uh, threatening peoples lives. And wellbeing's uh, I was in Iowa a few weeks ago and we visited this a few communities that were completely inundated and devastated by the flooding. Um, that took place there. Gosh, about three, three, four weeks ago now. Uh, many of them have not been able to return to their homes. We went and helped out one family. We were tearing down drywall and ripping up the floors and underneath the wood in the floors, there was still like tons of water, uh, in place.

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       And they were talking about how even with, you know, the aid from FEMA and s and SBA loans that they, they are unwilling to put a single dollar back into rebuilding their homes because they're hearing from the government and the Army Corps of engineers that it may take two to four years to fix the levees that broke down and caused that flooding. So why would they go and try to pour their life savings back into rebuilding their homes when they could get flooded again in a year or in two years? Because we're not making the kinds of investments in our infrastructure that we need to make. Uh, so there's an education. I mean, there's a whole host of issues, um, that I think we need to look at how we can best provide the resources that are necessary to improve those services, uh, to the American people. And also look at how, how we're doing business and, and fixing the problems that exist within those different agencies.

Speaker 2:          01:04:24       There's always been a call to help countries in need in the world. There's always been a call for the United States to step in and you know, and and, and do something. But yet there's problems in this country that are, that never change. There's bad communities in this country that are impoverished and crime ridden that have been the same way. Yeah. For decades, there was a former Baltimore police officer named Michael Wood who came on my podcast and he was talking to me about the time when he was in the Baltimore Police Department. They found a piece of paper that was documenting various crimes from the 1970s for someone, one of the years from 1970 something and it was the same exact crime in the same exact area that they were having problems with. Now, whether it's homicide, narcotics, whatever it was, they were having the exact same in the exact same places.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       And then he realized like, well, this is, there's no effort put to change this. Yeah, there's no, it is, if you're talking about decades and decades and decades, why wasn't there a money funneled into this community? Why isn't there some community centers that help children? Why isn't there an emphasis on Edrick better education? Why isn't there more police officers or at least some sort of civilian presence that helps out people and stop some of this crime and gives people a better place to live and then fix a lot of this what you're seeing decade after decade. Yeah. If we want to make America better, the best way to do that is to fix the weakest parts. The weakest parts of the people that are born in a shit situation, they don't get a good break. They got a bad break. They're born and crime ridden environment, and then they have to figure out how to be a better person while dealing with all this and then you've got people that are aloof to this that are like, hey, figure it out for yourself. I did like as if we all start from the same spot in this crazy game called life because we don't know those people are in the worst spot. Why can't we fix the worst bot? It seems like we could, if we can help Iraq, if we can invade Syria, if we can do some of the things that people either want us to do or we have done, why can't we do that? Exactly,

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       and that's, that's what I often remind people is that right now, today we spend $4 billion every month in Afghanistan, $4 billion every month, every single month. Imagine what could be done with those dollars in those resources in communities like Baltimore and communities like Flint, Michigan, where people are still being poisoned by their water, where they're being lied to and cheated by their leadership. Where the governor sent in these inspectors and cleared the water saying, hey, everything's fine. What he didn't tell people was that when those inspectors went in, they turn the faucet and let the water run for five minutes before they tested it to clean all the crap out of the pipes and create this false conclusion that somehow the water is cleaned. When the people who live there know that it is still not safe to drink. And for some folks they can't even take a shower in their own homes.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       And so that's why you're not going to hear any other presidential candidates talking about the cost of war and where our money is going and how it is counter to our national security. It's making us less safe. It's counter to the interest of our people and the people in those countries. But this is why I talk about this everywhere I go. Because it's central, it's central to our ability to address these domestic challenges that we are facing. We in this country are facing in communities across the country and dealing with health care, affordable housing. There's a homeless crisis in both urban cities and rural communities. People who are not able to afford to put a roof over there, the people who are working full time, maybe one, maybe two jobs even still can't afford to put a roof over their heads. There are serious issues that we need to address here, but to think that somehow we'll have the resources to do so without addressing where trillions of our dollars have been going now for the last several years, uh, is a lie. It's just not true.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       When you talk about people that are working full time jobs and they still don't have enough money to get by, what could you do to change that?

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       I think there's a, we, there's not one single action that can fix that. Uh, you know, I'm pushing for a living wage. I think it's important that that should be, uh, it's going to be different in different places. You know, I've, I'm a cosponsor of the, uh, congressional legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 at the federal level. Um, you know, there has not been an increase in the federal minimum wage for a very long time. Uh, and I think that's, that's a step that can be taken. But you know, Los Angeles is like Hawaii where a $15 an hour job is not going to be enough to pay the rent because you've got high cost of living. So living wage is going to be higher and in communities like ours than it is in smaller communities or communities in the Midwest.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       What would you suggest for Los Angeles? $20 an hour? I don't, I don't know what the answer is here. It would have to be more, I think so the argument against that would be that small businesses would go under or hire less people. Were that somehow or another it would be bad for business.

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       What is there? I think there's a, uh, you know, I mean the cost of living here is higher. And so what we are paying the employees who work in these industries, in these service jobs, it has to match that. It has to correlate with that higher cost of living. It costs more to go out to eat here than it does to go out to eat in a restaurant in, I don't know, Alabama for example. So I think we've got to, we've got to recognize people who are doing the work, um, that correlates with the higher cost of living that we're seeing already. Um, I'm, I'm really looking at the universal basic income, uh, and seeing how that could be a tool to, um, help deal with a lot of these poverty stricken communities and people who've been struggling and still unable to dig themselves out of a hole there and seeing how that potentially could replace a lot of the bureaucracy, a lot of the money that we're spending on bureaucracy and a lot of social welfare programs perhaps to both save money and to provide support directly, uh, to people who need it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       Uh, so I think that's an option that we've got to consider this. It's, it's not simple. And so I'm doing the research and figuring out how exactly that would work and how exactly we'd pay for it. Uh, but we also have to look at affordable housing. I think not accepting the fact that the high cost of housing is what it is, um, is, is not the solution. MMM. There's a lot of money that goes into our housing and urban development department, but is it really having the effect that we needed to have to make it so that you know, whether it's cops are teachers, are firefighters, people who are working in these public service jobs are able to afford to live, live in the communities where they're working. Now, we were in Malibu yesterday. We had a town hall there yesterday and took a tour with the mayor, city council members, community leaders around a lot of the areas that were completely devastated by the fires.

Speaker 1:          01:11:28       And that was one of the things that they mentioned is that a, they pointed out a trailer park. Um, traditionally where a lot of those first responders live, that's where the workforce in Malibu have lived in that trailer park. And they said that it's not unheard of. That one of those trailer homes go for 1 million bucks, 1 million bucks, and you don't even get to own the land that your trailer sits on. And so this is a real problem that they're facing is people who are teaching in that area at the firefighters who are working in that area. They're not able to afford to live in the community that they serve. But how could that be fixed? That's a supply and demand thing. There's some communities, I mean, you know, there's, there's land in the valleys and, and other areas, but some communities are dealing with this, both in the private sector.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       There's, there's hotels in Hawaii for example, who are recognizing that they can't attract workers to work in the hotels because they can't afford to live near where they work. And they're starting to buy up properties to actually provide that workforce housing at an affordable cost to be able to attract those workers. Uh, some communities are doing the same thing for, uh, for first responders, for firefighters and others. So this is a problem that, that a lot of, you know, city councils and local communities are trying to deal with and solve. But I think it also points to a bigger problem that we have a nationally that there is just not enough affordable, truly affordable housing for working people in the country. But a place like Malibu is always been this exclusive community because there's just not that much Malibu. It's next to the water. So it's more valuable.

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       Yeah. Like if, if is there a way to do anything that would change that? Well, this, that's what I was asking the mayor about and that, and that was, that was one of the things they said that has been, um, you know, people look at Malibu and they're like, well, that's where a bunch of multimillionaire rich people go and buy their beach homes. But there has always been, uh, you know, the, the basis of that community was really founded on those who worked to build the community. Uh, you know, middle, middle class, middle class people who are increasingly being pushed out. If you're not living in the home that, you know, your grandfather, your great grandfather built, then you're not going to be able to afford to stay there. Uh, so, you know, he, we didn't get into the, the details on what they're looking at, but this is something that the city council and the mayor are grappling with now to be able to attract workers who want to work in the area, but who don't want to have to drive two hours or three hours just to get to their place of work.

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       Yeah. I just don't know how you would ever do that. Yeah. Especially with all those fat cats that are living in Malibu. It's a crazy place. Live. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       Those houses on the beach or like ridiculously expensive. Yeah. And that's where a lot of, I mean a lot of the folks you were talking to yesterday, they live, uh, you know, up on the mountain or in the valley or that's a better spot anywhere. The thing, the thing about being by the beaches, people could just kind of hang out in your backyard, like right there, like right where your bedroom is. It can be people that are cooking out four feet away from your head. Yeah. That's not so much privacy. You've got none. It's the beach. It's everybody's. Yeah. Like people have tried to kick people off it too, which gets really strange. Yeah. There's been a lot of those cases where they hire private security, but it's like trying to kick someone out of a park because you decided to have a picnic. That's true, man.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       This beach is everybody. That's the ocean to stay that way. Yeah. It has to stay that way. That way. I have a problem with, this is a personal problem with, with municipalities that charge you to go to the beach. Crazy. So if I have no money in my pocket, you're going to bar me from going and putting my feet on the sand and go for a surf in the ocean. It's insane. It's insane. It is wrong. Right? I mean, I could see if you had a donation box to help people clean up the beach. That's all I could see. Donations. Yep. That's all. Throw some money in and be like, yeah, I'll pay for my parking. Sure, sure. You know, but don't stop me from coming on the beach. Like, I'll catch a bus if I don't have any money, I'll get you us to the beach.

Speaker 4:          01:15:32       Poor People's, you've got to like, that's the whole reason we have these national parks, national wilderness areas. It's anybody. Yeah. Anybody can get in there. Yeah. That's the beautiful thing about, one of the best things about the, the system that we have in place in America is that there's so much public land and people don't understand that they've never been to other countries where that's just not the case. Everything is private in many, many countries. You can't just go camping. You can't just take a raft and go down the river. You can't just do that. And what happens when those public spaces are, are lost, they're lost, they're lost forever and you pave over them when you develop them. You know when your beaches become trash with pollution and others like that's a treasure. It's a treasure that's lost. Well, we have our forefathers to thank for their foresight.

Speaker 4:          01:16:22       Like Theodore Roosevelt saw this in advance and met with great resistance from a lot of big businesses that just wanted to put apartments up everywhere and start building factories. Yeah. And we created this incredible system of public land in this country that's unprecedented. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, only Canada has something that rivals us. Oh Man. I guess Australia's got a lot of public land too, but it's just, there's other countries that have it, but it's amazing what we have here. And in terms of our diversity of, of scenery and, and where you could go to, I mean, you could go to the desert or you could go to Idaho and you know, go to quarterly volcano in Hawaii. Yeah. Well I think you guys have an advantage. I really do. And I've said this about many people that are faced with incomparable beauty

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       and this

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       in arguable sense of your perspective. And I think if you're living on a volcano in the middle of the ocean, you're five hours by plane from anywhere. Like you guys have a different vibe, you know? And I think, yeah, you know, I mean you go to, you, you, you turn on the news or you talk to politicians in Washington. I by okay, we've got to protect our environment and it's becomes like a political talking point. But a, I'm so grateful to have grown up in Hawaii and uh, you know, that talking point is actually a way of life. Like this connection that we have, uh, you know, with nature, with mother earth is something that's real and it's cultural and it's passed down from generations and it's, it's actually living out, uh, that, that saying that Mahatma Gandhi had, that the earth provides enough for everyone's need but not everyone's greed and what a powerful thing that is.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       And we think about both how we live our lives personally in being respectful and being thoughtful about our impact on other people and on our planet. And then of course for policy makers who are making those decisions about how our natural resources are used, stopping them from being exploited or polluted or lost for, you know, short term monetary profits or gains. There's a certain thing that happens in Hawaii as well, where people are more accountable because you can't get away from anybody. That's right. Somebody's uncle or Auntie is going to see and be like, hey, junior, what's going on? You're on an island. You gotta be nice. I can't drive like a dick. Yeah. I worked for a senator Akaka, who's a US senator from Hawaii for many decades in Washington, and I worked for him in Washington for two years between my two deployments. Uh, but he was a guy who embodied that Aloha spirit.

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       Uh, his wife, um, who we call auntie Millie. She, she's, she's got a, she's a firecracker. She's a little feisty, but even she, she's like a, you don't talks. Think about anybody in Hawaii because you never know. You might be related to them, but you know, it's good words to live by, whether you're related or not. Just, Hey, don't talk stink. Don't talk trash about somebody. Show respect. Share that Aloha. Even if even if you're different, even if you disagree, show that respect. That's, that's what my boss did. That's the senator Akaka did. And, and you know, he passed away a couple of years ago, but people in Washington still remember and talk about him, Democrats and Republicans. Uh, it's just the kindest human beings I've ever known. The problem with people is talking stink is fun, especially when there's nobody around. It's like a national pastime in many ways.

Speaker 1:          01:19:59       The spreading of bad vibes is discouraged in an area where you kind of have to know most of the people around. Yeah. Yeah. Which I want to give a shout out to one of the guys I met yesterday in Malibu Guide named Keegan. Uh, he organized like, I dunno, 20 or 25 of his friends and they went and they just started like fighting fires and people's houses all on their own organized like aid stations and food stations, getting generators. And they did incredible work. Uh, but I told them I was coming on your show today and he was, um, he just said that, that Joe Rogan and his show has made such a deep impact on my life because he went from somebody who was really triggered was the word he used by people who were saying things that he disagreed with. And you inspired him to kind of open his mind and his eyes and to recognize, um, that we are stronger and we are better when we have this kind of respectful discourse. And we're open to hearing from an, I'm trying to understand people who may have a different view rather than being triggered and running away in the opposite direction or reacting in a negative way. So I just wanted to pass that on because, um, you made a big impact on him and on a lot of a lot of his friends and a lot of people in the country and that that's having a positive impact on, um, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:21:25       our culture. Well that's very nice. And shout out to Keegan. I appreciate that. Um, I think that's something we can all learn how to do. And I learned how to do it. Yeah. It's not something I was naturally yeah. But I didn't naturally gravitate towards having good conversations with people. Yeah. It was a dickhead when I was young. I was fighting all the time. Yeah. Most of what I did was involved with, I was involved in martial arts, so it was always involved with competition was always very intense and I was very competitive and I wasn't necessarily that Nice, you know, all the time. And, um, when I examine my life over time I realized that hmm. The things that always felt the worst or conflicts that were unnecessary. And in particular the things that I judged myself the most harshly where at my mistakes or failures in my attempts at doing things, it was my misbehaving, my, my, um, just being a jerk where it wasn't necessary or having an opportunity to be nice and not taking it or escalating things where I could have used diplomacy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:30       Right. And I just learned over time that a lot of it is the way I was communicating with people where I was failing was how I was approaching their thoughts. And that I was immediately trying to be right rather than listen to them and I was thinking about them differently. Then I think about myself. One of the things that happened to me when I had children was I started thinking of people like babies that grew up. I think of everyone like old people. Like it freaks me out when I go to the, uh, I was in a casino yesterday. I was passing by this old lady smoking cigarettes, playing Bingo, playing roulette, rather slots, whatever. Fuck it is. Whenever wasted money and I'm watching her do this and I'm like, Oh God, this is, it was a baby. That was, someone's paid me. Now here it is barely hanging on.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       Who the fuck knows, right? Yeah. That's what she likes to do. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but my, my perspective has radically shifted and as I've gotten older and then started this podcast, that thing that I realized was that I needed to get better at talking to people when I was doing the podcast. I need to get better at listening and then I needed to have less bias. Perspectives may be less biased points of view and just try to understand what someone's saying and if I disagree, disagree and try to be as nice as possible while also being accurate about how much something bothers me. Yeah. But being nice like we can do that. We can all be better off that way. You know, and I share a lot of black men when you get to these, like if you want to look at the left or the right, I share so much in common with so many people in both the left and the right that I almost want to put a graph down of like what?

Speaker 2:          01:24:20       How do you live your life like a unites to people are ya, are you friendly? Do you have good friends he care about? Do you have buddies that could call you at four o'clock in the morning? Say you've got to drive two hours and pick me up and he would immediately do it. Yeah. Like what? What do you like? Okay. Then what's bothering you? What's bothering you in the news, what's bothering you and why do these things exist and how many of them are bullshit. Yeah, and for me it was like there was a lot of them that were bullshit. I was like, what am I wasting time and effort and thinking about what do I care what people do? I don't, I don't care. I want you to be nice and that's it. And then it get, it gets down to political and social issues and it gets down to the heavy ones.

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       Things like abortion and war and you know, freedom of religion. And then in these, these things I think are the ones where we should all just be communicating as commonly in, as in as objectively as possible. And we should discourage this, this tribal perspective discouraged this idea of being married to your own ideas and, and trying to win these arguments which you see in Congress, which you see in political campaigns, which you see in television. News is a fucking dumpster fire. Every single time they have the panel with the three people is just by, I can watch it. It's nonsense. Thank you for your time. What did you, what, what waste is this? It's just people shouting over people. You never find out what the fuck anybody really believes. You just hear their, their, their talking points blurted and vomited out. And this is the news. What's actually happening is completely lost and it's so, it's, it's so limited and this is how a lot of us are getting our view of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       Yeah. And I feel like

Speaker 2:          01:26:07       things are changing. I think the world is a different place than it was even just 10 years ago, I think. I think so too. I think humans are different and I think we just were not aware of how much all of this conversation on, on all of our analyzing the world around us has shifted over the last decade or so.

Speaker 1:          01:26:26       Yeah. People are looking, I feel like people are looking for, uh, for the facts. They're looking for more information. They're less likely to just accept at face value what they're seeing on TV or what they're hearing. Uh, which I think is, is a positive thing. Uh, and I think, I think we do need to look at the leadership of this country to, um, to set this culture for a civil discourse, for making it, making it okay and encouraging actually those kinds of conversations. And that's where if you look at it, you've watch cspan one night when he can't fall asleep. Uh, you'll see in the floor of Congress, you've got the Democrats who were all sitting on one side. You've got the Republicans all sitting on the other side. And unfortunately, not often enough do you see intermingling and conversation and people go into the other side of the island actually getting, getting to know people.

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       Um, that was something that when I first got elected, I was told, look, as a new member of Congress, serving in the minority with Republicans in charge, coming from a small state like Hawaii, you will never get anything done. So just accept it. Just accept that reality that you're not going to get anything done, wait several years or whatever. But one of the first things that I did was, uh, I got to get to know people. I got to make friends. So I, uh, my, my mom and dad, they're small business owners and they had this, uh, Macadamia nut toffee business. And so I called home and I said, hey mom, can you make 434 boxes of your toffee for every single member of Congress, all the Democrats, all the Republicans. She's like, wow, that's a great idea. Yeah, sure, I'd be happy to. And then I said, Oh, I've got one more, one more request.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       Can you make a bigger box? Uh, 435 bigger boxes of toffee for the staff of every member of Congress because they're the ones who make shit happen. And she said, okay, I'm going to take me a little bit longer. But, uh, yes, I think that's a great idea. So, you know, I started writing handwritten notes to every one of my colleagues, introducing myself. And as we started delivering these little gifts of Aloha to their offices, it was amazing how quickly I saw while on the House floor casting votes, I have Republican chairman of powerful committees making their way across from the republican side to the democratic side. Uh, saying thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It was delicious. I need to get more from you cause I ate it all. I got to take some home to my wife or my husband and then saying, tell me what's going on in Hawaii.

Speaker 1:          01:29:00       Tell me what your constituents are worried about. I am the chairman of the Transportation Committee, the Agriculture Committee or whatever it is. Let me know how we can work together. Just that one small outreach of Aloha, open the doors to these relationships that enabled me to be able to pass my first piece of legislation like my first six months as a member of Congress from a small state in the minority, um, as a democrat. And it's because just treating people with respect, treating people with Aloha and saying, yeah, we can disagree even on nine out of 10 things, but on that 10th thing like, Hey, let's talk. Let's get something done.

Speaker 4:          01:29:36       Was that eye opening for you and when did you at that moment in time realized like, Hey, I not only can I make an impact here, I can do this the way I want to do it? Yes, I can be a kind person and reach out and do you mean, and I don't have to listen to these people that are entrenched? Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       It, it, it directly disproved what we were told in those first days as new members of Congress in Washington. And a further affirmed what I already knew, both from what I learned from Senator Akaka, what I knew from growing up in Hawaii with the Aloha spirit, that this, this ability to transcend all of this superficial divisiveness, uh, whether it be based on politics like you said, or religion or race or ethnicity or, or any of these other things is what has the power to bring us together as a country.

Speaker 4:          01:30:23       Okay. That's a beautiful thing to hear. Like that's true. That's what people want to hear. They want to hear someone who thinks that way. Yeah and that like, oh, we're okay. We're going to be okay. Like we can move forward and be okay and do this like like human beings not like politicians. Yeah, exactly. There's a politician way of talking and I want you to avoid at all costs. I want you to never do this thing with your thumb. Don't do that. Because I was talking to someone and they did that thing with their thumb. I'd be like, hey bro, what the fuck's wrong with your hand if you're not, you didn't just have a stroke. What's your Goddamn hand down? I never realized it until I started watching like myself. Give speeches on TV that I do talk a lot with my hands. That's fine, but just don't do that.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       This one? Yeah. This is just as offensive as if you just started putting up your dukes, like if you started like where we're going to go out there and like what are you doing man? He fighting people. Exactly. Talking down like this is a teacher move. Right, right. I feel like this is a teacher move it in the military, they call it the knife hand. You see like the drill instructors are like, come on private. Yeah, but at least gets a drill instructor. Exactly. You're supposed to listen to, this is the fucking public servant. He was like at a half a fist. Like there's no reason to ever put your hand like that. This is not a good move. Like unless you're trying to poke somebody in the eye to see only reason why you should have your thumb up like that. Even know where that comes from.

Speaker 4:          01:31:42       Clinton Move Clinton I think was the first guy to do it. That was his shit. He used to do that. Funny. We're going to do here. He used to have this thing. He would do it. His thumb. Yeah. Would drive me crazy. I'd be like, this is such a bizarre thing. He doesn't want to be forceful. Yeah. He doesn't want to have a fist and he doesn't want to do and so just stick one finger out and that that, that deescalates who was making fun of that Bedo Guy. What's his name? Yeah, he, his hand movements. You've got some wacky hand stuff that he does. You can't be named Baido I'm sorry. It's too close to Beta. Just everyone should have told him that one value away from being like the most mocked thing in society when it comes to males. Can't do that. I don't even know if he's a good guy or not, but you can't do that.

Speaker 4:          01:32:26       You got to get in something. He's a friend of mine changed name Homie. Yeah, it's too late. You've got to get plastic surgery. Come back with a different social security number. It's just too close. Yeah, and don't be skateboarding. No, no. What's wrong? Let's keep going. Know what you're knowing it. Does he know what he's doing or was he just goofing around? Young dude, he probably knows what he's doing. Doesn't look like it looks sloppy. I didn't see it was pretty sloppy, but it's a thing that people do with, like I'm one of you how come on, I'm letting you guys come on. It's like, get out of here with that William. Yeah, this is, I, I dunno sometimes like, you know, I'll post little, little videos, um, that Abraham takes his Gopro of us out surfing. And sometimes I get that fruit, but like, oh, like why are you trying to pretend something?

Speaker 4:          01:33:11       I'm like, dude, I just love the ocean. I Love Surfing. I want to share this with everybody. Yeah. It's, it's a simple thing. People are funny like that. They don't want you to be fake, so, but they also don't want you to be real. Ooh, that's true too. Right? Yeah, that's true. Yeah. So it's, it's, I don't know, it's some kind of in between or something. I don't know. Well, I think there's just certain people that are malcontents. Yeah. And you're not gonna, you know, if you addressed all the people that are upsetting you all the time, you would never get anything done. Right? Yeah. How are you recognize in that though? Cause you're, how old are you? 38. You're not? No. You're very young in terms of like someone who's going to be president. Yeah. That's young. Thirties. Um, I'll, I'll be, I'll just say you're not that young.

Speaker 4:          01:33:56       I'm not that. Yeah. 38 for presidents. That's young shell. How old was JFK when he got elected? I think like 41 42 older than he is. I'm like that. Barely. I'll, I'll do like, I'll be 41. I'm sworn, sworn in as president. Right, right around there. Okay. But like I say when, but yeah, exactly. Confidence. Um, look, look at, look at Donald Trump though. So what? He's in his mid seventies. Right. But his maturity is of an adolescent. He's a Canadian test. He's of a fitbit. He should have been a comedian. I'm telling you, the guy would've been killing it. That's comic instead of a real estate developer. Great timing. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. He's very mature. But my point is maturity. Maturity Matters. Yes. Experience matters. And that the experience that I bring is, is different from any other candidate who's running for president of serving as a soldier for 16 years of serving in Congress on these, on these committees of, of importance and national security. Uh, you know, I've started this state legislature and the city council

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       and um, look, when you look back, we talked about our founding fathers. Yeah. Most of them who crafted the constitution and who wrote the declaration of independence or under the age of 40 many under the age of lived there, 40 bag men still still we're talking about experience and maturity here. I know you're, you're, no, you're defending yourself. I fully support you.

Speaker 2:          01:35:21       I think you could be president 38. I really do. I don't think it's a problem. And at 40 for sure you'll be 24 years older or 24 months older, you're going to be wiser. You'll, you'll have it nailed. But we do wonder, right? Like how, when has a person had enough life experience and what, but then again, the question is what is that life experience? Is it life experience? Like you said, that leads you to be an immature 17 year old, right? Or is this the life experience of someone who's served in combat and has Ben on in Congress for six years and someone who understands how the government works and has a better perspective of human beings?

Speaker 1:          01:35:57       Yeah, it is. It is that experience and it's what you draw from it and the conclusions and the judgment and the kind of leadership that you would exercise. Yeah. You know, there were a lot of folks in 2016 who said Hillary Clinton was the most experienced candidate ever to run for president because of the jobs she had held or the experience that she had had. Okay. My problem was with her judgment and the kinds of decisions that she would make as commander in chief decisions that would continue to send, uh, people like me and my brothers and sisters in uniform to continue to fight in these wasteful regime change wars that actually dishonor the oath that we all take when we volunteer to serve, to serve, to protect and defend our country and the American people. And instead sending us on these missions that, uh, our counter to that promise that undermine our national security, that undermine the great sacrifice that our troops and their families make. So it's that judgment. It's the experience and the judgment that, uh, I believe we need to look for in the next commander in chief. It's what I bring to the table and it's what I challenge voters too. Ask the other candidates and to, to hold them to account on both of those fronts. Would they be ready to walk into that Oval Office on day one and to serve our country as commander in chief?

Speaker 2:          01:37:18       One of the messages that Trump was very successful in getting out was that he wanted to drain the swamp. That we all realize that there's just this tangled web of bureaucracy. Yeah. And

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       that

Speaker 2:          01:37:30       he did a good job of connecting Hillary too, that bureaucracy and say, this woman is just completely entrenched in this world. She's never going to get out. She's not even a real person anymore. She's just a professional politician. And he would highlight all the different things that she did and lied and all call her crooked Hillary and that just got stuck. What made him, one of the things that made him very attractive to people is that he seemed like a person didn't seem like a politician that seem like a person. How do you avoid communicating like a politician when you're doing this in mass, when you're communicating with giant groups of people, when you're, you're having these big speeches in these big places, how do you do it without being, how do you do it and still let people know you're just a person? Cause that's I think what people are longing for and what they don't see in many candidates. You see this act like, oh he's pretty good at it. Exact, but I see the act. Yeah. I don't see a person. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:29       Being myself speaking the truth and standing up for what I believe in and why I'm offering to serve our country, think there's no really, there's no other way to do it because if I start like, okay, how am I going to convey myself as a real person? The only way to do that is to, to actually be a real person and who speaking truthfully and honestly and respecting the American people and the responsibility that I'm asking them to bestow upon me. That mission that I'm asking them to charge me with.

Speaker 2:          01:38:59       Yeah. Does this, you, you, you've said you've always been drawn to service. Yeah. Does this seem like, uh, calling to you? Like what does this feel like to you? This idea that you are going to be the commander in chief, the greatest army the world has ever known, the leader of the free world in a sense. Yeah. What does that, what does that seem like to you?

Speaker 1:          01:39:21       The, the, the grave responsibility that that job carries, uh, and the seriousness with which I would bring, uh, my experience in my judgment to fulfilling that job. MMM. You know, this is, I think one of the problems that we have too often in our politics is that people self serving politicians are more interested in keeping their job or in getting the next job or you know, in lining their pockets, getting ready for the, you know, the afterlife or whatever. When they leave their political office that that somehow is, is, is defining of who they are rather than recognizing, um, that, that to be able to serve the people is a great honor and it's tremendous responsibility and that's how I approach serving in, uh, you know, the local, the state level and at Congress. Uh, and, and how I approach being able to serve the American people as president and commander in chief. It is a grave responsibility and I will never forget for a single moment who I serve and who I work for. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       What is your take on wikileaks and Julian Assange?

Speaker 1:          01:40:35       Okay. What happened with the, with his arrest and all this stuff that just went down, um, I think poses a great threat to our freedom of the press and to our freedom of speech. Yeah. We look at what happened under the previous administration under Obama. You know, they were trying to find ways to go after a [inaudible] and wikileaks. But ultimately they chose not to seek to extradite him or charge him because they recognized what a slippery slope that begins when you have a government in a position to, uh, Levy criminal charges and consequences against someone who's publishing information or saying things that the government doesn't want you to say. The government does him sharing information the government government doesn't want you to share. And so the fact that the Trump administration has chosen, um, to ignore that fact, to ignore how important it is that we uphold our freedoms, freedom of the press and freedom of speech and go after him. It has a very chilling effect on both journalists and publishers. And you can look to both those in the traditional media, but also those in new media, uh, and also on, on every one of us as American. It was, it was, uh, uh, kind of a warning call saying, look what happened to this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:41:58       It could happen to, you could happen to any one of us.

Speaker 2:          01:42:01       Well, it's very transparent too, cause there's no real compelling crime for them to be going after him the way they are. There's not one thing that stands out in the, the latest one is hacking and some

Speaker 1:          01:42:12       not even hacking it's conspiracy conspiracy charges.

Speaker 2:          01:42:16       That doesn't make any sense that they would spend that much time going after that guy for those charges. Yeah, it's obvious and very transparent that there's another ulterior motive. Ulterior motive is that he leaked a bunch of things that were incredibly, yes.

Speaker 1:          01:42:28       Embarrassing. That's right. And not only that, but I think it was Secretary Palm, Peo, secretary of state who said that they wanted to designate Wiki leaks and assigned as a foreign intelligence agency. So once you do that, then you're talking about a whole different category. So they're pushing out information once again that the government didn't want pushed out. [inaudible] if the government then says, oh, well now we're going to reclassify you as a foreign intelligence agency, then there's a whole different set of rules of engagement that apply there. Then you're no longer protected under, uh, you know, the freedoms that we hold dear. The freedom of the press.

Speaker 2:          01:43:08       It's just such a disgusting way of framing things. Like, do you know he's on a foreign intelligence agent? Yeah. He's a guy that got information and released it to the general public that the government wanted to keep private. It's really that simple. Yeah. Um, Edward Snowden.

Speaker 1:          01:43:26       Yup. What is your similar, similar situation? Similar situation? I don't think I'm, I don't think we, you know, I remembered the very day that I woke up, uh, in DC, looked at my phone and started looking through the headlines and saw those headlines about how the NSA was mass surveilling all of us and collecting our phone records, collecting our phone records and Verizon at t and t, t mobile. And I was, I was shocked. So that was something that Snowden uncovered, uh, and released, uh, something that I don't know that even as members of Congress who would have been aware of. So now that we were aware of it than, hey, we can take action two to f, close those loopholes to change those policies, to protect our civil liberties, to protect our fourth amendment, constitutional rights as Americans. But was the NSA going to disclose that information voluntarily on their own? Absolutely not.

Speaker 2:          01:44:25       No idea, no. We would have had suspicions, but then again we'd have tin foil hats on and there was a gentleman who was, who left the NSA very early on a hill was, that was his last name, but he was one of the first ones to discuss this. This is post nine 11 when they first started doing it, but Snowden was the guy that really made it abundantly clear to everybody that not only are they doing that, but they're also lying about it. And even Obama was talking about we're just collecting better data. The metadata, like, no, you're not reading messages. You could do anything. Exactly. And this is just not an accurate assessment of what was going on. No, and it was outrageous.

Speaker 1:          01:45:03       And you had a, I think he was the director of the Department of national intelligence at that time. James Clapper, who sat before a committee in the United States Senate and latently lied. Yeah. He was asked very directly, are you collecting this information? And he said, no. Are you collecting this information on American citizens? And he said, no. And yet he's somebody who you see on TV almost every day as an expert in this country without any consequence lying to the American people.

Speaker 2:          01:45:33       And I think that if you polled the American people and you ask us to vote on it, know I w I think it would be a gigantic landslide victory for Edward Snowden to be exonerated and brought back to the United States. They've got this guy, Lou, he's in Russia now hiding. Yeah. Like it's crazy that he lives over there and he can't leave. And if he does come over here, they're going to immediately gonna lock him up. Yeah. What would you do as president?

Speaker 1:          01:45:56       One thing that I think, I want to answer your question, but one thing that I think, um, speaks to the Deign, the dangerous nature of this culture that we're living in now. Uh, uh, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer had done an interview on, I don't know, one of the major networks, and I think he was, I think he was talking about Trump when he said, be careful. You don't want a challenge, the intelligence agencies basically putting out that threat. I don't know if, if you can pull that exact quote up, but I was shocked when I heard him say that because it basically makes out that these intelligence agencies are their own separate branch of government. And that if any one of us as Americans or elected leaders in this country dares to challenge or exercise oversight over them, then we will suffer the consequences.

Speaker 1:          01:46:47       Uh, so as president would change that culture of leadership, that that leadership starts at the top. And when you have people in positions of leadership who continued to perpetuate that culture of unaccountability, of complete disrespect and disregard for the constitution of, of not understanding that yes, we need to keep our country safe, we also need to protect our constitutional rights. This is not a choice between the two, which is so often how it's framed. Well, if you want to protect us against terrorists, you've got to give up all of your rights as Americans in your civil liberties and your privacy's and, and just let these intelligence agencies run, uh, run free and run roughshod over us. Uh, and so that's the kind of of change in leadership that I'll bring. There's a whole host of policies that, that we can look at. Uh, for example, with the Patriot Act, the Patriot Act is up for reauthorization in Congress this year. There have been different sections of it that we have worked to try to change and reform to make it so that agencies like the NSA cannot collect our private information as Americans without a warrant. But there is far more that has to be done, uh, to undo the damage that, that we've already seen, the abuse of our, of our rights and privacies that we've already seen. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:48:06       Yeah. Did you ever listen to the Kennedy speech about secret societies? [inaudible] Kennedy had a, a fantastic speech, uh, before he was assassinated where he was discussing this very thing. And, uh, he apparently, uh, had notions of disbanding the CIA and, um, he was very concerned with the power of people like a j Edgar Hoover course and yeah. That this was all happening while he was president. And he felt like there were people that were involved in these secret societies and these secrets meetings and that there was a lot of conspiracy going on and he thought that the very idea was repugnant. It's a fantastic speech. Interesting president. And the press is what it's like, it's got a title, it's a fantastic speech. I'll check it out. Um, but this has always been the real concern that, uh, people have that when you give someone the ability to surveil the general population, when you give them, they're going to use some of that information to aid in their allies and to work against their enemies.

Speaker 1:          01:49:11       Yeah. That is ims a valid concern. Yes. And I mean, this is what unfortunately, we've already seen. This is what has been revealed by some of that information that was released by Snowden and how, for example, the Pfizer court as we have it now is a secret court that has and, um, has been abused for that purpose, allowing for that surveillance of Americans violating our civil liberties and privacies. And that's something that we've got to fix that whole, that whole Fi's a court from top to bottom and how the different judges explain pointed to people. It's, it's basically, it's a, it's a, a secret court that was appointed, uh, I believe, uh, created back in the 70s with the initial objective of providing oversight over the executive branch, um, mass surveillance that was happening at that time or illegal surveillance that was happening at that time, unfortunately, especially since nine 11.

Speaker 1:          01:50:11       Now you have this Pfizer court that is both used to, uh, approve surveillance and surveillance programs on a foreign targets, uh, but also on Americans as well. Uh, the one of the many problems with this is it's a secret court where you have a judge and you have someone representing the government, whether it be one of the Intel agencies or the dod or whatever coming before this court in making their case to try to get this warrant approved by the judge. There is no advocate there for the people. There is no civil liberties or privacy advocate there. Uh, it's, it's a one sided conversation. Uh, and the information being provided by the government is the only information that's being given to the judge. Uh, so this is one of the big problems there. And, and we've seen over decades now and especially since after nine 11, that there have been very, very, very few, um, applications for these surveillance warrants that have been rejected by the judges.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       So, you know, a rubber stamping of these applications for warrants is, is really what appears to be happening. Um, you know, there's a few different ways that we're looking at trying to fix this. There are some who are arguing, uh, to, to take away the Pfizer court completely. One of the concerns about that is that if we do that, then there has to be some other entity in place to exercise oversight over the executive branch and not allow them to, um, conduct the surveillance, you know, Willy Nilly as as they please. Um, so it's figuring out exactly what, what are the best reforms to meet that objective of providing that oversight, making it so that those warrants are given, um, you know, as needed and making sure that all in all the information is being presented. And again, that that Fi's a court was initially put in place to go after a tick to get warrants, to conduct surveillance on foreign targets. Um, not Americans. And that's been one of the biggest problems here with a lot of this mass surveillance is it's collecting our information as Americans illegally and unconstitutionally because you can't do that unless you go through this process and you actually get a warrant based on evidence. What would you do about Julian the songs? What would you do about Snowden? Uh, as far as undoing, dropping the charges president of the world, right? Yeah. We're dropping the charges.

Speaker 4:          01:52:45       You dropped the charges, but yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:52:47       they're still going after him for something from Sweden, uh, in Julian [inaudible] case. Yeah. And so Edward Snowden would be the only one that you'd be able to write because unless you would influence it, the charges that the Trump administration is, um, uh, putting on Julian Assange's. Right, exactly. And it remains to be seen whether or not they will push for extradition. There's another charge that was, I think it was today, the Sweden decided to, uh, go after him again for some sexual thing that they had, uh, decided to go after many, many years ago. Um, Edward Snowden, what he's doing right now is essentially living day to day hold up in Russia in hiding. And w w the charges against him stem from, again, this illegal operation that he, in many ways, he's very patriotic. I mean, he let us know and at, at great costs. Yeah. So you would give him a pardon?

Speaker 4:          01:53:45       Yeah, yeah. And I think address, we've got to address why he did the things the way that he did them. And you hear the same thing from Chelsea Manning, how there is not, there is not an actual channel for whistle blowers like them to bring forward information that exposes egregious abuses of our constitutional rights and liberties. Um, period. I mean there's, there was not a channel for that to happen in a real way. And that's why they ended up taking the path that they did and suffering the consequences. There's a great bill hooks bit about what happens when you become president that they, uh, they bring you in a room filled with smoke, cigar smoking buttons, industrialists, and they play a video of the Kennedy assassination from an angle you never saw before. Wow. And they say, uh, any, any questions? And he had this bit, and I thought about this bit when I thought about Obama because Obama, when he had his hope and change website when he was running for president, one of the things that they addresses whistle blowers and how much they would provide a platform for whistleblowers to expose illegal activity that was still on his website while he was president.

Speaker 4:          01:54:57       And while Julian Assange was getting arrested. And while this, all this was going down and, um, they wound up taking it down off of the website. Once somebody pointed it out, like, hey, you had this, what happens when you become president? What do you think happens and why do these, do you think that there are full of shit and they're just saying what, what we want to hear so they can get elected? Or do you think that there is something that happens to them once they get into office? Do you think that it's possible that they're given information that shows the real threats at the world has and there's things that the general public is just not privy to. And these are what influences people's decisions to go against all the things they were saying when they're running for

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       president. Yeah. Um, look, I haven't been with them and I've been in those rooms, so I won't speak for, uh, for, for that, which I do not know. But what I do know is this is what happens when you have, um, people who are elected to serve in this job as president, who's most important responsibility as commander in chief. And they lack the experience and the understanding to be able to make the right kinds of decisions that serve the American people and end up even those going in with the best of intentions end up being very influenced, whether it be by the military industrial complex or the foreign policy establishment that as we've seen over decades has crossed both political parties, both political parties in these areas often end up making the very same decisions about continuing these wasteful regime, change wars and acting as the world's police.

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       And, uh, therefore I'm listening to them because they lack that experience or that backbone and understanding themselves and then just continue the status quo. Um, you know, Trump was somebody who, during his campaign talked a lot about ending the stupid wars, talked about going after Saudi Arabia, that they're the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world. And you know what happened now, you know, and his administration, what he called draining the swamp, he's turned that swamp into assess. You look at the people he surrounded himself by, uh, some of the biggest war hawks that our country has seen. Guys like John Bolton, people like Mike Pompeo, people who've wanted to go to war against Iran for a very long time. People who have been cozy with Saudi Arabia for a very long time. Uh, you see who he's nominating to be secretary of defense, long time a defense contract career men like over 30 years.

Speaker 1:          01:57:43       I think working for Boeing, uh, you see the kinds of people who he surrounded himself by. And so it's, it, it doesn't take a lot to figure out how he has been influenced by them in continuing these regime change or this regime change is still going on in Syria now. Threatening regime change in Venezuela threatening regime change and disruption in Iran. Uh, and that's the difference. That's the difference quite bluntly between me and other people who are running for president is that experience and understanding that I bring to be able to walk into that office, to do that job as commander in chief and uh, on day one and to not succumb to the, the establishment that, that I have both felt the effects of as a soldier as well as seen in action as a member of Congress. I'm going in with both, both eyes wide open and understanding the situation as it really exists and most importantly understanding who I work for, that I work for the American people.

Speaker 2:          01:58:44       Do you think with someone like Trump radically shifts his position he's doing so because it's been influenced to change his position because he's been given more information or do you think they become compromised when they're on an office and they, I scratch your back, you scratch mine?

Speaker 1:          01:58:59       Uh, I don't know. I imagine that there's probably some of both, but if you're, if you don't have the strength of your convictions and your understanding about what kinds of policies actually best serve the American people, then you can see how easily you'd be swayed and influenced by others. Uh, you know, you saw Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail about Saudi Arabia against Saudi Arabia against the United States support for Saudi Arabia, calling them out for what they are and now, uh, refusing to end US military support for this genocidal war in Yemen that Saudi Arabia is waging that's created the worst humanitarian crisis of our generation because he says, well, he doesn't want to risk a multibillion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia. So you can see at least in that respect, what he's really motivated by. He doesn't, he would rather continue to support the senseless and devastating deaths of innocent people in Yemen and using our US military, my brothers and sisters in the military to do that because he doesn't want to risk an arms deal with Saudi Arabia theocratic dictatorship that actually directly supports terrorist groups like al Qaeda. Wow. It's hard for people to imagine that that's the case,

Speaker 2:          02:00:22       that it's an arms deal and they want to make sure that this deal goes through and that it continues to be financially productive for both nations.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       Well, that's, you know, and this is Trump's argument. He's like, well, you know, that's American jobs building those weapons that were selling to Saudi Arabia. That's what's at risk. My challenge to him and to the American people is if the best our president can do to help support the creation of jobs in this country is to build weapons that are being dropped on innocent people in countries like Yemen, then we need a new president. We need a new commander in chief. It will actually help serve the best interests of our people and work towards the interest of peace, peace here at home and peace abroad.

Speaker 2:          02:01:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:01:09       The idea that it's just jobs. It's not just jobs. Yeah. I mean there's consequences to these jobs. Um, you were talking about universal basic income earlier and you were saying it in regards to dealing with impoverished communities, but, uh, one of the big issues that people think we're going to need universal basic income for his automation. Something that Andrew Yang has built this whole platform on. Elon Musk has talked extensively about it, are in a situation where there was an article today about Amazon, um, using automo autumn, uh, these, um, I forgot exactly how to describe it, but essentially robots that are packaging things and automation is going to start taking over many non-skilled jobs. And this is, that's true with the travel industry, with trucking, with moving things, shipping that we're going to see less and less of these unskilled jobs and we're going to see millions of people out of work. And that universal basic income may be the only way to bridge that gap between them finding some sort of viable new source of income.

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       Yeah, I think that's certainly part of it. I think that's a, I mean, it's a strong argument. Uh, we've got to figure out how we pay for it and how it actually, uh, at, you know, achieves that intended objective. Uh, but also look at, um, making that, those kinds of investments in, in how do you train a whole new workforce and in what new areas? So any you're taking people who are working in, in, you know, really tough, tough labor jobs. You know, you hear all these stories about people who are working at Amazon very long hours, very stringent timelines, uh, and, and so if they're now being replaced by automation or robots or whatever it is, um, you know, let's look at our, our economy and see how we can, um, help train folks for, for jobs that pay more money, uh, and, and hopefully help offer a better quality of life.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       And I think that's overall when we look at this. Um, I think that's, that's the way that we should be addressing this is not just a job as a job, as a job, as a job, but really looking at the quality of life of people in this country that a job does not equal happiness or fulfillment. Um, but really looking at, um, you know, parents who, who have a child and who want to be able to spend some time at home raising that child or you know, someone who wants to start, start a small business and work out of their home to be able to hang out with their kids more or whatever the case may be. I think as we look at this and how we make this transition in a positive way in this country, we've got to look at it from this comprehensive approach.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       Yeah. The idea of these people that are working in these fulfillment centers being happy, it seems pretty ridiculous. They're not happy they have those jobs as people are in back breaking incredibly stressful positions where if you read the reports, I mean, I don't know how accurate their reports of what the job is like, but they literally run from one place to another. They're timed and they have their own breaks or yeah. Yeah. Time limits. Yeah. Yeah. This part of the problem

Speaker 1:          02:04:27       with

Speaker 2:          02:04:29       the idea that companies are supposed to constantly make more and more money as you get Russo ruthlessly competitive. People looking at the bottom line in every single aspect of that business. And one of the things that suffers is human human sacrifice, satisfaction. And their, their sacrifice has to be greater because they, they have to find a way to justify their position in the company. And so they get paid very little. They work very hard.

Speaker 1:          02:04:55       Yeah. And now the wild placement real company like Amazon. Yeah. Paying not only paying no taxes when, I think this is for the third year in a row. Yeah. And also getting, I think this last year was over $125 million tax credit that's on top of it.

Speaker 2:          02:05:11       Jeff Bezos says how much it was, you got $150 billion and he's going to give 75 to his wife and right. The whole thing is ridiculous. And it's what people who, uh, lean socialist point to when they talk about unchecked capitalism without any sort of regulation that can stop something like that from happening and stop workers from being exploited in that way. It's just, and people say, hey, you don't, you don't have to have that job if you don't, you know, you don't want that job, don't take it. But no one should have to have that job. How about that? Yeah. How about if, if there's a job that makes you have timed bathroom breaks and run from one place to another, you should get paid a fuck load of money for that job. That job should be something that it, it sucks all day long, but yeah, dude, I make $5,000 a week and people are like, what? Yeah, man, eight hours a day, five thought you've got to run. But when at the end of the, to save up your money, man, you're making a lot of money that way people would go, oh, okay. Yeah. Amazon would still make a shit load of money if they did it that way. But yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:06:13       automation barely making, I mean, they're barely making minimum wage.

Speaker 2:          02:06:16       It's crazy. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       so that's where I think, you know, as, as, as, and look, this automation really changing our economy is something that, that I think we're behind the curve ball on because it's already happening. But let's try to see the opportunity in that, where if robots are going to start taking over those back breaking jobs, then then let's try to find, uh, you know, new and innovative ways for people to work and to earn a living that's actually bringing value to them. That sounds awesome on paper, but how would one absolutely. That's what we've got to work out. And it's not, I'm not saying like, Hey, there's a government solution to this and snap your fingers and it's all done. No, the, I mean, this is, the government has a role. I'd, private sector, private business has a role. Um, and we've got a, we've got to work together because this is all of our futures.

Speaker 2:          02:07:07       How ultimately imagined any potential, any possibility, any potential solution?

Speaker 1:          02:07:14       Well, I think there's, there's pieces of it, right? I mean it's, it's making sure that we close these, these loopholes that tax loopholes that allow companies like Amazon to get away with paying no taxes and to get this much money back as a tax credit. How do they do that? Oh Gosh. I mean our tax code is so complicated. You know it has to do with the write offs and how many years and depreciation and all of these different things that they plan for a and they exploit in order to pay no taxes and to get money back in return. It's just so easily. It is and it's this crony capitalism that's really at the heart of this problem. How, how do we, how do they get that kind of sweet deal? When you look at the tax code that's written, when you look at the tax bills that are passed, who are the people who are helping influence and write those bills? They're the big paid lobbyists that Amazon has in Washington who are saying, hey, this is something that we want to see in there and working with lawmakers who their cozy with to get that legislation in there.

Speaker 2:          02:08:13       Well, this is one of the things that, uh, has come out about Trump over the last week or two, is that he lost $1 billion over the course of a x amount of years. And that this is not really accurate, but that this is how he set like [inaudible] purposes basically did basically said it's sport is what you said is his description was that it's sport. Wow. So essentially he was playing within the rules. No one's accusing him of doing anything illegal, but the way he framed his taxes, the way he, Eh, it turned out to be more than a billion dollars worth of losses over a period of something like a decade. Yeah. And uh, you know, people were like, what the hell is that? And he's like, look, that's what I was trying to tell you. He was basically trying to say, look, this is something that I was telling you people about when I was running for president, that the system is rigged. I know because it was a part of the rigged system and I paid these people off. Yeah. Um, it is rigged. But how could you get in without getting assassinated? How do you get in and say, Hey, all you billionaires that are making all this money, you're gonna make less money now because of Tulsi President Tulsi is coming in. There's a new sheriff in town. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       Sheriff with an army of people in this country mobilizing, saying this government was put in place to serve us, to serve the people and as much money in high paid lobbyists is these guys have. Ultimately it is the people of this country who cast the votes and it ultimately the people in this country who have the power, if we choose to use it, if we choose to make sure that our voices are heard and that that is the way that we make this change.

Speaker 2:          02:09:56       So would you have to simplify the tax code? Would you have to make things

Speaker 1:          02:09:59       heavily simplify the tax code? And you know, I'm working with my team, we're doing our research to figure out exactly what that would look like. But I think we do have to simplify the tax code because it is so many of these loopholes and massive corporate deductions that have brought us to the place where we are today. Where know most folks are not getting any kind of meaningful deduction. Most folks certainly are not getting the kinds of tax breaks that these corporations are getting. Uh, because it's, these corporations are influencing how our tax laws are written and it's written to benefit them. The, the ultra rich and the 1%. And you know, people who are working very hard every single day are, are struggling. They're still struggling just to get by.

Speaker 2:          02:10:41       What kind of dirty tricks do you think they will pull out against you if you try to fix the tax code and try to make corporations accountable and make sure that they have to pay? If they're coming after you now and you're just making waves and get ready for 2020. I mean, it could be, it can be pretty gross. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:11:01       Yeah. But I just, I, I don't underestimate the power of people. That's what I tell them, you know, and they've been playing these dirty tricks for a long time. Uh, there is more and more people, I think, in this country who are paying attention and who are calling him out on it. MMM. Don't underestimate the power of the people.

Speaker 2:          02:11:19       You know what I think too? I think it'd be better for them. Like Jeff Bezos, you know, you fucking people over and not paying taxes, Bro. That's so much money. And I'm sure he pays taxes. I don't know what he pays. But you know the, the idea that Amazon's figured out how to weasel that out, like that's

Speaker 1:          02:11:38       postures. You hear stuff like, you know, Warren Buffet talks about this, about he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, right? There's a famous line. How is that? Because he has, look, he's figured out all of these holes within the tax system that he can benefit from to pay lower taxes when most people don't have that ability.

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       And as a business person who is also fairly ethical, you have to be perplexed or collect, what do I do here? Do I just do the right thing and give, give more money to charity and balance it out? Or do I just take these cuts where they are and let everybody know, hey, look how much money I paid

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       broken the system is the shits. This shit's wack. Yeah. I mean like ultimately what you're saying, you know, as business owners, whether they're small business owners of these large corporations, I mean, look, it is these large multinational corporations that are exploiting the system and exploiting the people and represent the worst of these crony capitalists policies. Uh, and so when I talk about changing this culture of leadership at the top, it's bringing these values of service above self. This has to happen within our government, but we as a society need to encourage ourselves bringing these values of service above self to our businesses, to every sector of our community. Because just because you run a business and you make a profit doesn't mean that you can't, uh, be a servant leader and to think about, hey, how can I make a positive impact? Yes. For my employees and for their families, but on, on society. On our community, on our environment.

Speaker 2:          02:13:12       I think for the people that are running these corporations, there would be, there would be real value in appreciating the fact that we're all in this together. And you know, you're not gonna live that long. You just don't have that much time. Nobody does. Not even a hundred years if you're lucky and you probably, if you're running a corporation,

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       you probably on death's door, you've got kids and you've got kids who have kids, generations who will live with the repercussions, the decisions that are being made. And the argument is that if you forced them to pay more taxes, then there's going to be less jobs because they're going to have to make cuts. Yeah. But that's, that seems like a ridiculous argument to me. One that's been made all along. It's just you're used to it. That's all it is. You're used to these loopholes. You're used to it. So you want to keep them there. And if they take away those loopholes, you're going to punish other people. Cause you don't want to be punished yourself financially. That's what's really going on. Yeah. And you know, and this is coming from me who's a financial dummy, I don't pin spend any time analyzing the financial situ situation this world, but I could see that.

Speaker 4:          02:14:16       Yeah, that's pretty obvious. It's glaringly clear and the impact that it's having on people is also glaringly clear. People are seeing this and when automation really kicks into focus and you know, however x many years when millions and millions of jobs go away, we're going to be confronted with this new world and this is what a lot of people are very concerned with when they talk about the next couple of decades there. They're very concerned with automation and they're very concerned with audit, our artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence and that it's not just going to take away skill are unskilled labor, but it's also going to take skilled labor away. There's going to be no one answering phones anymore. It's all going to be computers. They're very close to be able to do that right now where a computer will have a legitimate conversation with you and you don't even know that you're talking to a computer.

Speaker 4:          02:15:05       It's crazy. It's crazy. Are you concerned with sentient artificial intelligence and in terms of its military applications in terms of, um, there's, there's a lot of concern that what we're experiencing now with particularly, you wouldn't talk about Yemen with drones, with these piloted things that you're going to have is autonomous weapons in the future where you just going to be able to literally release killer robots. I'm very concerned about artificial intelligence and how quickly this technology is evolving, uh, with very little, um, oversight or even understanding at the highest levels of our government about both what the opportunities are that it presents and also the very real dangers of this technology being weaponized and how quickly that could spiral out of control. What could we do to stop artificial intelligence from spiraling and spiraling out of control in particular, what can we do to stop autonomous weapons? What a lot of people are really concerned with. Did you watch that show? Black Mirror? It's a great show. It's on Netflix, but a lot of it is dystopian stories about the future and one of them was called heavy metal and it's about this woman being chased by

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       these little intelligent robots that are trying to kill her. Yeah. It's terrifying because this is something that could be implemented in the battlefield and we could have, if we don't do it first, we could have a situation where our soldiers [inaudible] in some sort of a situation facing off against robots. Yeah. It sounds like a science fiction movie, but it's not that far away from reality. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:16:52       I think this is one of those things that, um, and of leaders in the global community have to recognize that some, some key just to, just like with nucleus, the nuclear arms race, once you start on this race, I mean, there are no winners in a, in a nuclear war. Everybody loses in that scenario. And I think there's a similar approach that needs to be taken to, um, the dangers of artificial intelligence being weaponized and coming together as a kind of a global community to say, Hey, this is something that a end date could potentially, if putting the wrong hands in danger, all of us and find the best approach, um,

Speaker 1:          02:17:33       to deal with that. Because my concern is as we see with so many of these other weapons systems, if it's just one country that's doing it, then you have, well my gosh, if everyone else is weaponizing, but we're the only ones who are doing the right thing, then is that creating a situation where our national security is at risk or our troops are at risks? I think it's one of those things that, uh, you know, this world is a small place. Uh, we would have a shared interest with leaders of other countries in the world to provide the right kinds of checks and balances. I'm on this technology so that it doesn't become something that's a danger to humanity.

Speaker 2:          02:18:12       And the real fear would be that someone would not think that at all. Yeah. There would be whatever country, figure out what the country is that some country be like, fuck you, we're going to do whatever we want. We're gonna look, you guys took over this world because of nuclear power. We're going to take over this world because of autonomous weapons and artificial intelligence. Yeah. And we're going to design it to go kill American.

Speaker 1:          02:18:31       Yeah. I think that that's why it's important that we take, uh, that we take a global approach to this. Yeah. And because otherwise I think you do, you end up with that scenario and where you just, you know, this race begins and then there's no way to stop it and it's too late.

Speaker 2:          02:18:47       Unlike China, the United States has at least, yeah. In perception, uh, cleared differentiation between business and government.

Speaker 1:          02:18:58       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:18:59       and one of the concerns that, um, oh, when I've talked to experts in China and their electronics and their, their technological innovation is that they're inexorably connected to their government in some way, shape, or form. And that it's one of the main reasons that makes it incredibly difficult to compete with them on a global marketplace. Yeah. When you see that this, our State Department has told people to stop using Walway devices cause while, which is the number two provider of cell phones in this world, now they're connected to the Chinese government. Like how do you take that? What, what, what do you do about that situation and how relationship between the private sector in government in particular with the competition, what, look, when it comes to data, I mean, we're very concerned about people sharing data. We've, we've done it ourselves. We've spider, we've proven through the Edward Snowden case, govern our government's doing as well to us. We're worried the Chinese are doing it to us or so. And it's, we're saying don't buy Chinese stuff. They're gonna steal your data and steal your information and still your business secrets. Yeah. What can you do to stop that? What can you do to mitigate what's already happened?

Speaker 1:          02:20:09       Uh, I, you know, ultimately you can't stop every single individual with what they're purchasing. I think that, um, you know, you can regulate what is, uh, sold here in the United States. Uh, I think there's a role that government can play, especially as we're talking about artificial intelligence and that kind of technology, again, first in understanding it and then playing, um, being that responsible party, uh, too, make sure that what is being developed is not something that's going to result in these, uh, unintended negative consequences. Uh, so obviously our government, uh, you know, doesn't have ownership over private business in this country. We still do have sensible, uh, regulations and responsibility that government has to play in regulating what businesses can and can't do.

Speaker 2:          02:21:01       What's interesting to me is this competition aspect between dealing with essentially just the private sector here in America. Yeah. Versus the private sector in China that's combined inexorably with the military and that they have much more influence over what gets done and how things get done. Um, what did you pay attention at all to the State Department's call for a boycott of Walway products? What did you think about that?

Speaker 1:          02:21:28       Uh, well, I understood it. You know, I think there is a concern about that technology being, um, being used to, to get our information. Um, you know, so that that, um, can be enforced within the federal government, right? So if the State Department is saying, Hey, the federal government is not going to purchase any Walway produced products or cell phones or whatever, the technology is a and encourage other people in the private sector to do the same.

Speaker 2:          02:21:56       What people were worried about over here is that what they're trying to do is stifle the development of this gigantic company and that what they're trying wowway yeah. Of Wallet. Because while we went from having a tiny share of the marketplace about five years ago to being the number two cell phone provider in the world next to Samsung, we just surpassed apple. And that this is a Chinese company. And that because it's Chinese companies connected to the Chinese government, the worry is that they're making ungodly sums of money and it's enhancing the Chinese government's ability to do, to perform surveillance or just to just compete, just financially compete on a global scale. And Tech nerds, um, seemed to be siding with Walway, which is interesting to me. I've read a lot of tech blogs and people that are experts and they say that there's no evidence that these cell phones have anything in them or, or doing anything, but that there has been some evidence of network devices and it's, some of these network devices do have some sort of a third party input or some building, some ability to extract information that shouldn't be there.

Speaker 2:          02:22:59       That's interesting. Yeah. What this, it's like when you're dealing with a situation where you're competing with a country that also controls these companies that are the biggest cell phone and electronics providers on the planet.

Speaker 1:          02:23:14       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:23:15       How do you handle that? Like what, what is diplomacy with China like?

Speaker 1:          02:23:18       Well, we can see what's happening right now with Trump. It's, it's not working very well. Yeah. Uh, you know, this trade war that, that frankly, president Trump is escalating I think is really, really dangerous. Uh, it's having a negative impact on domestic producers, manufacturers, farmers. A friend of mine is a small business owner and he saw the news this morning about China retaliating, um, with Trump's escalation, I think with, with another increase of their tariffs. And how he's thinking like, my gosh, that's going to impact my small business. It got, I don't know, probably less than 15 employees and trying to figure out how it's gonna impact the pricing and production, manufacturing and everything every step of the way. What's so dangerous about, uh, what Trump is doing with this trade war that he is, um, that he's escalating is that these trade and economic wars can very easily turn into a hot war. And we're talking about a nuclear armed country in China. Uh, so while there are trade differences and issues that we've got to address with China and issues with intellectual property and other things, um, the way that Trump is going about this, I believe is very irresponsible and dangerous, creating a huge amount of uncertainty for American businesses. A while increasing tensions with one of the biggest nuclear powers in the world.

Speaker 2:          02:24:43       That's a scary thought.

Speaker 1:          02:24:45       It is.

Speaker 2:          02:24:46       [inaudible] and the ramifications of those that could lead to a nuclear war that this trade war could lead to something military. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:24:53       Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:24:53       What does Trump's argument is? His argument essentially is that China has been treating us unfairly and that the rates that we're getting there are there not, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:25:02       they're not even yet. I mean, Trump is recognizing a problem that exists. That trade imbalance with China is, is a real issue. Why does that trade imbalance exists? While, I mean you can point to probably a whole host of, of issues and trade policy. I don't think it's any one single incident, um, that has, that has created imbalance and that, you know, I'm an Iowa a lot these days and a lot of farmers have been struggling with that. Um, and would like to see it fixed a lot in the tech community would like to see these issues fixed, especially related to intellectual property. But the way in which Trump is doing it is having a very negative effect on these American businesses and jobs that Trump is, is supposedly advocating for both in, um, well really in the uncertainty that that is being set where, you know, it looks like they're on the brink of a deal.

Speaker 1:          02:25:56       Just the other day it looks like, Hey, okay. The United States and China, they've been working through these issues. They're on the brink of a deal and all of a sudden Trump sends out a tweet saying, nope, we're going to increase these terrorists from 10% to 25% and now China is left like, okay. I thought we were, I thought we were close to working, working things out and now left in a situation where they have no other recourse but to retaliate as they did this morning so you can see quickly how this thing is spiraling, so out of control and increasing these tensions between our two country not being done in a way that that to me is strategic, providing us with the certainty of that path forward to reach a specific objective of correcting this trade imbalance, which is how this whole thing began. Why do you think he's doing that?

Speaker 1:          02:26:42       Why would he make a cute look that it's, it's hard to explain because it doesn't make sense. It doesn't actually serve us in our interests of our economic interests of meeting that objective. I don't know if he thinks this is part of his masterful, you know, negotiation skills, but it's got a very dangerous effect. And, and the fact that we have nuclear strategists in this country who remind us that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war now than ever before. It's because of these kinds of things that are increasing tensions between the United States in China. Uh, other things that are increasing the tensions between the United States and Russia. You know, a country that we're, we still have a nuclear missiles pointed at each other that can be set off at a moment's notice, literally leaving us as people with just minutes before a nuclear holocaust, a nuclear disaster, nuclear war.

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       And you really think that this could be set off by these financial negotiations and by Trump saying something like that and just changing who's, who's offering a tweet. If you threaten a country's economy and their economic security, where does that logically lead? You threaten their ability to, uh, provide for their people. You threaten their ability to provide that stable environment, which China so much of what they do is just like, hey, they, they look for that stability. What else? What are the recourses there? Other than the threat of military force. And in this case, when you're dealing with two nuclear armed countries, this is what's at risk and it's something, you know, it's hard for a lot of people to conceive of like, okay, my gosh, nuclear war really. I mean this is something that, you know, back during the Cold War with the, the, the, you know, kids going under their desk, these drills and, and you know, okay, where do you go find a bunker?

Speaker 1:          02:28:38       Uh, but this is something that, that's a reality that we're facing today. And it's something that, you know, we in Hawaii in January of last year went through with that missile alert. Yeah, that was clear. It was terrifying. Missile alert, nuclear weapons on it, right? Right. Missile inbound towards Hawaii seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. That was the message that was blasted out to over a million phones all across our state on the radio, scrolling across the television and people immediate like seek immediate shelter. Okay, where do I go? Where do I take my kids? Where do I take my family? Had College kids sprinting across campus at the University of Hawaii trying to find shelters, seek immediate shelter. But the, the sick, um, insanity of all of this is that there, there is no shelter, there is no shelter and no nuclear bunkers, which, which really, I mean, and for, for people in this administration and politicians who are ratcheting up these tensions with these nuclear armed countries bring us to this new cold war.

Speaker 1:          02:29:44       They are not saying, okay, well because we're doing this, we're gonna Invest, uh, not just trillions, but hundreds or thousands of trillions of dollars to make sure that every single American in this country has a nuclear bunker within 10 minutes of their home or their place of work or their, or their school. Because that's how much time we'd have. That's what we would need in order to deal with the consequences of the decisions that they're making in the failed leadership that they're providing. And so this is, this is an issue that I'm raising awareness about because of what's at risk. I mean, this is, this is the greatest threat that we face and it requires strong leadership to walk us away from this brink of nuclear war, to be able to, to work with other countries, uh, based on cooperation rather than conflict, deescalate these tensions, work out our differences and, and walk us back from a, walk us back from the brink.

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       Stop this nuclear arms race that's making us in the world less safe. The last thing I wanted to ask you about was the opiod crisis. Yes. And what are your thoughts on it? This is an epidemic that is continuing to ravage the country and, uh, we're not doing enough. Our government is not doing enough right now, uh, to solve it. Uh, and I, I 0.2 to one, a very simple thing that could drastically help those who are dealing with opioid addiction and trying to walk down that path towards recovery. And that is ending the federal prohibition on marijuana. There has been a correlation in states that have legalized either a medical use or adult use of cannabis, a direct correlation in, uh, a reduction of opioid addiction as well as opioid related deaths. This is one thing that Congress can do now to help make progress, uh, in dealing with this opioid epidemic.

Speaker 1:          02:31:43       Another thing we've got to put a lot more resources towards treatment on all of the things that need to happen after that detox, that initial detox with folks who are, uh, dealing with opioid addiction and have lost everything in their lives then or at the place where, okay, well if they have gotten through that detox now they, they've got no place to live. They've got no place to work, they've got no money. And to be able to, to provide that helping hand up as they start to put back the pieces of their life is something that we as a society need to do a better at. And the third thing I'll say is we've got to go after the culprits responsible for this. When you look at companies like Purdue Pharma who have intentionally deceived and lied and cheated the American people into taking these opioids saying, no, you know, they're not risky, they're not dangerous, don't worry about it. These highly addictive opioids creating this situation that we're in, they are still not being held accountable in the way that they need to. This, this, uh, thing. It's the Sackler family has made tons of money off of selling these opioids that have ruined and devastated people's lives. Our legislation, the opioid accountability act we introduced in the last congress we're going to be introducing again soon would provide our federal prosecutors with the tools they need to hold companies like Purdue Pharma and others responsible for this proliferation of opioids criminally, uh, accountable.

Speaker 2:          02:33:18       And another thing that baffles me is this constant changing of the dosage. This fentanyl in this new thing that's even more powerful than fentanyl. The fact that they're developing these incredibly potent opioids, the FDA has approved like, I don't understand. I don't understand why do you need them? What are they for their there, they're toxic. They're fatal and incredibly small doses. Yeah. And it's not like we don't already have oxycontin coding. Oh, we have all these pain medications. Like why are they insisting on letting these companies patent these superior and even more lethal versions of something we already have a problem with. Exactly. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:33:58       It makes no sense. And I think it speaks to the huge influence, the huge influence that these pharmaceutical companies have over regulators and lawmakers. Both. So much of this comes back to money.

Speaker 2:          02:34:11       Joe, you say all the right things. I love, I love talking to you. I really wish all the best. Thank you. It was, uh,

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       you know, it's a, we live in a crazy time, you know, and uh, your breasts breath of fresh air. So, um, thank you. I appreciate you and I wish you well. Thank you. So good luck to you. Appreciate it. All right, folks on the road, good luck. Take care.
