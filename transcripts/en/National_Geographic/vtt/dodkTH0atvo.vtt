THANDIWE MWEETWA:
<i> Our beautiful wilderness</i>

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:02.968
<i> is in trouble.</i>

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.004
<i> It's being hammered
 on all sides</i>

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.373
<i> by human encroachment,
 poaching,</i>

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.775
<i> and habitat degradation.</i>

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:13.813
<i>And our mission is to save these
 large cats, wild dogs,</i>

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.982
<i>and all these other species
in our beautiful ecosystem.</i>

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.486
( applause )

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.823 line:0%
Zambia's Luangwa Valley
is indeed

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.225
one of Africa's
best kept secrets.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.727
<i> This environment
 is so awesome</i>

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:30.930
<i> that it is one
 of the last remaining</i>

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.166
<i> strongholds for lions
on the African continent.</i>

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.303
<i>I have been very fortunate
to live in this beautiful</i>

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.839
<i> environment surrounded
 by wildlife,</i>

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.510
<i>and living here, I've been able
to see animals live in action.</i>

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.512
<i> Previously, I only
 used to see them</i>

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.114
<i>on a tiny black and white TV,</i>

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:51.417
but I was fascinated even then.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.853
My uncle works
as a safari guide,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.455 line:0%
and he always came home

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.257 line:0%
with wonderful stories
of animals that he met

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.761 line:0%
during his work,
and those just fascinated me.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.229
They encouraged me to join

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.364
my secondary school
conservation club

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.934
so I could learn more
about these species.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.838
I found many fascinating things
about the animals in this place,

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.840
but also really sad news.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.477
Our ecosystem was under threat
from, you know, common things

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.245
that are affecting many other
places in the world.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.215
Human encroachment, poaching,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.350
habitat destruction,
you name them.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.819
And so I decided
there and then to say,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.222
"I'm going to do
something about it."

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.757
I decided to become
a wildlife vet,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.728
so I could help treat and cure
animals that had survived

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.663
bullet wounds from poachers.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.799
And so I studied really hard.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.533
I would stand at night,

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.205
really late at night with my
feet in a bucket of cold water,

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.507
so I could make the grades
to get into university.

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.842
( laughing )

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.111
And that did work.
I was very lucky.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.216
I got admitted into the pre-vet
program at UBC in Canada,

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.218
ready to go take on
this challenge

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:01.354
to become a wildlife vet.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.623
<i> But you know,
 it didn't go down well.</i>

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.126
<i>Second year into the program,
I discovered I could not handle</i>

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.995
<i> cutting anything
 with a sharp knife.</i>

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.731
-( laughing )
-And so my dream for vet school

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.502
crashed and burned right there.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.602
It was so sad.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:20.440
I had spent so many sleepless
nights studying to do this.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.674
But it did not end there.

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.378
I got diverted
into a different career path

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.446
where I could still
help these animals.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.149
I currently work
as a wildlife biologist

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.484
with the Zambian
Carnivore Programme,

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:36.055
and our mission is to save
these large cats, wild dogs,

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.556
my absolute favorite,

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:39.993
and all these other
species in our beautiful

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.762
ecosystem through
applied research

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.830
and community-based
conservation.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.100
So my job is one of the best
on the planet.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.637
<i> I get to see and touch
animals that I had only seen</i>

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.672
<i>in books and magazines before.</i>

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:56.042
<i>And it's an amazing experience.</i>

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.677
I get to collect
key data on survival

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:01.246
on who's going where,
who's eating what,

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.215
and what sort of areas
they're using

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.585
in our beautiful ecosystem.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.956
A typical day begins with me
and my partner in crime,

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.357
Gibson Banda.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.092
It's not crime-crime
because Gibson

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.428
is a wildlife police officer

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:20.032
with the Department of Wildlife
and National Parks in Zambia.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.302
And he is a great person
to work with.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.670
He is a comedian so we
are laughing all the time.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.072
He is a wonderful human GPS.

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.508
He knows the system
like the back of his hand

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:33.379
and this is an area the size
of Yellowstone National Park.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.615
So, it's great.
We get carried away sometimes.

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.084
We're out for days.
We ran out of water and

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:42.755
<i>we had to share waterholes and
drinking points with hippos,</i>

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.723
<i> -elephants.</i>
-( laughing )

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.059
<i> Sometimes we get to
 some really bad places.</i>

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.995
<i> You know, we get stuck
and getting back on the road</i>

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:54.534
can take anything between
15 minutes, 24 hours sometimes.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.403
The best we've hoped for
is an entire afternoon.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.005
But it works out.
We're able to get around.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:05.110
And so this difficult task
if you call it is compensated by

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.348
even more beautiful pictures
like this one.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:12.251
<i>Our absolute favorite to see
out in the field is a male</i>

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.121
<i> strawberry blonde lion,
 called Ginger.</i>

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.090
He's not ginger-ginger,
he's more strawberry blonde,

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.093
but Strawberry is not
a good name for a male lion.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.094
( laughing )

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:26.298
So, Ginger has a brother
called Garlic.

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:28.868
Um, Garlic is a regular lion.

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.903
We are always happy
to see Garlic.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.805
Um, he's a lion.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.807
-What's not good...
-( laughing )

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.542
What's not good about that?

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.211
Anyway, all of these
wonderful scenes,

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.681
all of these amazing
experiences in the field

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:45.418
lead to the sad reality
that we have to live with.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.787
<i>Animals are being affected
by the poaching crisis fueled</i>

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.123
<i>by the illegal Bushmeat Trade.</i>

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:54.861
<i>These are not the targeted
species for the Bushmeat Trade.</i>

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.097
<i> We do not eat lions.
 We don't eat wild dogs.</i>

00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:00.933
<i> But people are going for
 deer-sized antelope</i>

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.503
<i>that they can sell to urban
areas and all those places.</i>

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:07.173
The methods that they use
are non-selective,

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.842
so that means
animals, anything

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.245
that is of this shoulder
height, this shoulder height,

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.879
can get in and get caught.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.582
And the impacts are catastrophic
as you can see.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.485
Animals die,
animals lose their legs,

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.287
and that is just pretty sad.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.957
But we work really hard to save
as many animals as we can

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.860
and working really closely with
people that are in the park

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.630
all the time helps us
do what we do.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.633
And these animals, I'm happy to
say, made a complete recovery.

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:37.102
Animals do recover
even from injuries

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:39.271
that are as gruesome as that.

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.373
Just going to share
one story about

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:45.811
a particularly favorite lion
of mine who we call Funny Ear.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.314
-It's a very un...
-( laughing )

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:53.018
It's a very unimaginative name
for a really beautiful lioness.

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:55.387
<i> But Funny Ear
 was a young lioness</i>

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:58.056
<i>when I first started with the
Zambian Carnivore Programme.</i>

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.992
<i>She was about a year and a half.</i>

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.261
<i> She stands out
 because of her ear,</i>

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:05.798
<i> but Funny Ear in 2010,
 she picked up</i>

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.833
<i> a snare in her travels
 with her pride.</i>

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.503
And it was pretty sad,
but luckily the people

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:13.439
that spotted her and they
reported to us and we're

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.907
able to go there,
take off this snare,

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:18.410
and she healed remarkably well.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.715
<i>And so her story kinda ends
in a beautiful Disney-style,</i>

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:26.952
<i>-you know, Disney-style ending.</i>
-( laughing )

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:29.388
She got her prince, and well,

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:32.592
a couple of princes because
she is a lioness in her prime.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.126
-( laughing )
-Really beautiful.

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:41.100
And in 2015, we saw Funny Ear
raise her first litter of cubs.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.437
Really amazing, a graduation
ceremony of some sorts,

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:49.875
so gives us hope to keep on
pushing and keep on working.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:52.912
And so we've heard
all about getting people

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.314
to care and every society,

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:58.383
<i>every culture has a saying
 that goes in the line,</i>

00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:01.319
"Children are the future."
And we take that to heart

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.355
in our work and we really try

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:05.657
to work really hard
with these communities

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:06.925
and these students

00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:09.729
to just get them to become
environmentally conscious

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.332
lawyers, teachers, nurses,
and conservation leaders

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.067
of the next generation.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.237
<i> We take students out
in the field and expose them</i>

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.172
<i> to wildlife
in their natural habitat.</i>

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.842
<i> And it's just
 an amazing experience.</i>

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.010
<i> And these kids love
 being out in the field.</i>

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.246
<i>They don't want the field work
 to stop.</i>

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.949
<i> So, it gives us hope
to see that they're ready</i>

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.585
<i>to learn and they're willing
 to go the extra mile.</i>

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.621
And along with this
conservation education work,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:36.989
we want to impart skills

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.058
that will empower
them going forward.

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.159
<i> So, it's skills like
 public speaking,</i>

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:44.063
<i> writing, computers,
that can be taken for granted</i>

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.899
<i> in the developed
 world and in our cities.</i>

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.268
These students will
have the chance to

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.470
get an, sort of,
equal footing almost

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.873
with regards to uni admission,
getting employment,

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:57.009
anything other than poaching.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.344
<i> And so last year
 with generous support</i>

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:00.880
<i>from the Big Cat Initiative,</i>

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.216
<i> we are able to do
a human-wildlife conflict study</i>

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:06.318
<i> focused entirely on
 understanding</i>

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:08.654
<i> people's interactions
 to big cats</i>

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.590
<i>and also other carnivores.</i>

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.158
<i>It was a nice opportunity
 for students to get</i>

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:14.993
<i>in the villages, talk to people,</i>

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:16.962
<i> share their
 conservation message,</i>

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:19.265
but also we've found happily

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:22.101
that there's not as much
conflict as we thought

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.970
in our part of the world,
but there was a lot of negative

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.740
perceptions about big cats
in general.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.110
<i> We need to get people
to care about these issues.</i>

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.746
<i> And it comes from us,
 all of us that are here,</i>

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:36.181
<i> talking to them
 about experiences</i>

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:37.817
<i> that we've had
 with these animals.</i>

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:41.520
Alice Deal Middle
School right here in D.C.,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.425
they did a podcast on what it
means to them to conserve lions.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:50.429
And I'm going to quote
what one of the students said.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.764
She said,

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:56.535
"We need to give big cats
and large predators a chance.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.971
We are their only predator.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:01.707
They cannot survive
without our help."

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.708
Thank you.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.377
