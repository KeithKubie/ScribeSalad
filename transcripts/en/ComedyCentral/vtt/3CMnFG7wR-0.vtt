The online music world
is going crazy

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:04.204
because alt rock squint gods
Radiohead--

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:07.307
one of my and Scott Aukerman's
favorite bands, I might add.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.476
Scott and I have been to
Radiohead concerts together.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.912
-Yes, we've been to see them
together several times. -Yeah.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.347
They might release an album,
Scott!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.548
Everything went down,
and there's...

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.917
-I know. I almost called you!
-I almost...

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.685
I didn't know we were gonna talk
about it here on television.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.987
-HARRIS: Yeah.
-Okay, okay, okay.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.089
Okay, there's a lot of clues.
There's a lot of clues.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.591
First up-- fans were mailed
postcards that read,

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.560
"Burn the witch," and then
Radiohead began deleting

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.596
their entire social media
presence, uh, doing this.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.932
There it goes.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.168
(laughter)

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.370
-(applause and cheering)
-Who knows?

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.906
Who knows?
Why are they vanishing?

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.607
Why are they vanishing?

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.309
Either...

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.411
Either there's a new
Radiohead album,

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.547
or Thom's just
in one of his moods.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.981
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.651
Or maybe LP nine
is finally on the way.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.854
So, uh, comedians, since all
we can do is theorize right now,

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.222
what do you think is going on?

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.990
Rachael.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.192
I think they're really upset

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.927
that Miley stopped
following them on Twitter.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.629
Points. I think so. Yeah.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.498
(applause and cheering)

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.966
Very upset.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.368
-(bell dings)
-Scott.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.204
I think
Radiohead is being erased

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.705
like in <i>Back to the Future</i>

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.341
because Thom Yorke couldn't
trick his parents into (bleep).

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.109
-HARDWICK: Yeah, points. Right.
-(laughter)

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:19.913
-Right. -HARRIS: Okay.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.582
(British accent): If they don't
dance, they can't fall in love.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.083
If they don't fall in love,
they can't kiss,

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.552
-and then I'm history.
-(laughter)

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.521
"Let's play a Radio song
at the prom."

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.456
-Everyone scatters.
-(laughter)

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.525
Hey, Thom Yorke,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.228
you know that new sound
you've been looking for?

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.698
-Well, listen to this!
-(laughter)

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.366
â™ª Karma police...

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.268
-They're really funny...
-(laughter)

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.636
HARRIS:
Keep going. Keep going.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.938
"Karma Police" at the Under
the Sea dance, and... Oh!

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.074
Makes it a much different movie.
Weird Al.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.511
They're forsaking the Internet
and releasing their next album

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.914
exclusively on handmade
musical dream catchers.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.916
HARDWICK:
Yes. Points. Points.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.285
-(applause and cheering)
-That could be very true.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.623
(with English accent):
We're releasing our next album

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.324
on spider web.

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.293
A spider will come
and spin a web

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.228
in your home
and pluck the strings.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.097
(laughter)

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.466
Uh, please release another
album, Radiohead, and then,

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:12.566
-I... I want to meet you.
-(laughter)
