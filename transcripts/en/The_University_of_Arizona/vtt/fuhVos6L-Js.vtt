00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.820
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.610
So what is it?

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.880
This is rosemary.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.720
Oh.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.580
Rosemary.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.500
After finishing grad
school at the U of A,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.700
University Distinguished
Outreach Faculty Dan McDonald

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.150
decided southern
Arizona was home.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.060
I think I was led
here first of all

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.740
by the influence
of my parents, who

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
were very community-minded
people in the small town

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.060
that I grew up
in, in New Jersey.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.330
My father was a
volunteer fireman.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.930
My mother was one of the
crossing guards in town

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.550
and very engaged
in the community,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.960
a member of the
recreation commission,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.970
and that type of thing.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.270
Turning university research
into relevant programs

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.300
for the community,
McDonald and his colleagues

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.780
provide resources
to learn and explore

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.290
the benefits of gardening,
nutrition, and a generally

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.940
healthier lifestyle.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.610
What I love about
my job in Extension

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.180
is my ability to connect people.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.190
So I see myself as somewhat of
a convener, of a relationship

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.060
builder.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.270
And so I try to
keep tabs on what's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.060
going on in the community,
where the needs are,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.070
and who's doing what--

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.250
and within the
universities as well.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.780
You could say Renaissance
man, in some sense.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.690
He has a broad view of the
world and, in this case,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.214
of children and
health-related ideas

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:43.380
that he brings to the table.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.520
That's new.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.290
And he's also a real
feeling sort of guy.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.880
He has an appreciation
for the bigger picture.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.950
We're not in the classroom
in a traditional sense.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.980
So our classroom
is the community.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.620
One classroom is
the garden kitchen,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.400
located in a former
Mexican food restaurant set

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.000
to become a clubhouse for the
local chapter of the Hell's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.480
Angels.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.920
No problem with
the Hell's Angels,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
but the neighbors there
decided that that's not what

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.420
they wanted in their community.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.450
They really wanted something
to address some of the health

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.190
issues in South Tucson.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.140
So I approached the county
and said, I have programming,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.970
you have a building, we
need a teaching facility.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.630
What do you say we go
together jointly and do this?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.640
In the five years
since, the kitchen

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.350
has served over a quarter
million people in Pima County.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.290
So we have a program with
high school students called

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.960
Healthy Living Ambassadors.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.700
Part of that is
for those students

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.360
to be trained to deliver
nutrition and physical activity

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.940
lessons within their schools
and in their community.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880
A culminating event
that we have for that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.390
is hiking the Grand Canyon.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.860
So we take about 60
high school students

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.330
to hike the Grand
Canyon in the spring.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.550
Part of that, they're learning
how to deliver information

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.240
to others.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.590
But they're also incorporating
that into their own lives.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.130
And it really
motivates younger kids

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.030
to see other teenagers
that are my age

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.620
and see that we're hearing
about healthy living and things

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.120
like that.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.230
And it makes them want
to be involved, too.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.370
An enthusiastic sing-along
guitar and ukulele player,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.040
you might find him at
the Tucson Village Farm,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.940
singing about the perils
of canning your own food.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.390
He's also a long-time
distance runner.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.640
So that's what I find really
exciting about being part

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.210
of the University of
Arizona, is that it's just

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.140
such a tremendous resource
to the community here

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.690
in Pima County, but then
throughout the state, really.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.390
Because there are programs
all over the state that then

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.050
I'm able to make sure
where the need is,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.950
that there's a need being met.
