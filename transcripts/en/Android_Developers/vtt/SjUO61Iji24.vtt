[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.200
JOSH SOLT: My name is Josh
Solt. I am partner development

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
manager at Google Play.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.270
And I manage kids
apps and games.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.080
So today, I'll be
talking about optimizing

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.210
for a post-install world.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
Namely, how do you
retain and engage

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.150
families in your ecosystem?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.360
So you've spent a
lot of time, effort,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.610
resources getting a user to
ultimately download your app,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.270
right?

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.450
It's quite the process.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.560
There's motivation, discovery,
expectation, search, filter,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.630
and then finally the download.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.320
So what about
after the download?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.110
So let's look at
the user funnel.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.360
We've got the view listing,
install, open the app.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.970
Today, I really want to focus
on the bottom two-- engaging

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.070
with your app and retention.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.680
I have a number of
different case studies.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.910
Partners have been
willing to share with us,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.780
and hopefully some great
facts and data that you'll

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.230
find interesting
for your businesses.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.090
So since acquisition
costs are high,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.280
it's really important to
engage your most loyal users.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.230
Optimizing the lifetime
value of your traffic

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.140
is key for acquisition
campaigns and making it most

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.060
cost effective.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630
So this is a pretty
staggering stat.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.630
50% to 90% of app users have
churned after just 30 days.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.170
So just let that
sink in for a moment.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.840
No matter how great your app
is, that's just how it is.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560
And that's really the struggle
that a lot of developers

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.910
find and lays the
groundwork for what we're

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.520
going to talk about today.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.980
So what are some of the
key reasons for churn?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.482
First of all, there's
poor technical quality.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:10.759
Another one is inefficient
or unclear value proposition.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.440
Thirdly, outdated
content or functionality.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.630
Not personalized, and also
too many push notifications.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.690
All of these can cause major
headaches for your business.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.690
And we're going to
address them today.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.160
So the format of
this presentation

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.832
is really threefold.

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:33.020
I'm going to start off by
talking about user onboarding.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.350
We actually just had a great
presentation from 01 Digital.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.320
They talked about how they're
thinking through onboarding.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.050
And we have some great data
from Budge Studios as well.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.710
Second of all, we're going
to talk about successfully

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.020
releasing new
features and content,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.170
how PBS kids is thinking through
that, and other partners.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.960
And then finally, we're going
to talk about reengaging users.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.160
So to start off, how to
make user onboarding great.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.510
And thank you, again,
for your presentation.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.130
So now that you've had a
user download your title,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.770
it's time to make sure
they keep using it.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.890
And thinking through your
tutorial and registration

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.170
is key.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.940
On the tutorial side,
focus on the value

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.430
and make it fun and simple.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.070
Also allow users
to skip the demo

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.800
and see it later as an option.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.250
And be sure to explain
ancillary features

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.190
and make sure it's
relevant to the user

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.270
and focus on your top metric.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.460
And then-- this will be a
common theme through today

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.940
is just really testing,
testing, testing, and iterate

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.800
for your best D1
and D7 retention.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.530
On the registration
side, be sure that you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.050
show value for the
information asked.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.300
So what does the user get?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.605
And don't bar access.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.230
And optimize your onboarding
value proposition.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.330
So you really have to focus
on getting your user to engage

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.590
with your app in an instant.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.100
It's a very competitive
world out there, as we know.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.450
We were just talking about
how much competition there

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.160
is in the market,
so you really have

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.780
to differentiate
yourself that way.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.110
So familiarize new
users with your app

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.800
by designing a simple and
easy onboarding process.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.580
Make it fast and seamless,
contextual, and part

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.440
of the product experience.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.550
Also, ask for minimal input,
while gathering the information

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.310
you need to create engagement.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.420
So one great example is a
developer out of Montreal,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.570
Canada called Budge Studios.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.480
Budge Studios has
created their own IP

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.040
and they're also licensing
such prominent IP

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.580
as Hello Kitty and Caillou,
as well as Thomas the Train.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.620
So a few of the things
that Budge Studios thinks

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.770
through-- one is
fast time to fun.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.620
Really, how do you get
someone into the app quickly?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.130
How do you get them
having fun right away?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.100
The first playable moment
is really critical here.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.350
An early win to build a
user's confidence is key.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.570
We'll touch about
this later as well.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.810
So be sure to cut
the unnecessary steps

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.160
to your process.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.320
And for effective
onboarding, you also

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.530
need a check for dropoffs.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.020
So in terms of
Budge Studios, they

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.160
want to get players in the game
faster and be wary of drop off.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.100
And really, one
key metric here is

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.910
to find the right value for
first time user experience.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.160
And this actually was
not the case originally

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.050
with Miss Hollywood.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.240
They found that
it was too hard--

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.790
this title-- for preschoolers.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.390
So by making the first
time experience easier,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.640
they actually increased their
first time retention by 11%.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.150
That 11% actually
accounts for millions

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.650
of additional minutes of play.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.520
And test, test, test.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.700
Like we were saying,
you've got to keep testing.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.160
Budge Studios, through
their rigorous testing,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.910
was able to find that an
initial game loop included

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.250
five characters,
one of which had

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.800
issues with their
microphone permissions.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.610
So after adjusting this
permission and fixing it,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.160
they saw an increase to 74% of
first time users in this loop,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.960
compared to 25% in
the previous loop.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.690
And we had the honor of having
Play Kids present here earlier

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.916
today.

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:38.540
They're another great
example, in terms

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.000
of focusing on user onboarding.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.250
And they've spent a lot
of time running tests

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.650
to update their onboarding
value proposition.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.030
So here you have the
old onboarding, and then

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.040
the new one that
they rolled out.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.760
The new version actually took
their conversion rate from 0.4%

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.150
all the way up to above 0.7%.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.790
And this pop up that you
see, which really laid out

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.150
their value proposition in
a more clear fashion, that

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.240
increased their sales by 81%.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.230
So 81% increase in sales by
just improving your pop up

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.842
is a pretty staggering number.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.190
So in terms of onboarding, you
can test using onboarding flows

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.890
with Firebase remote config.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.930
You can run A/B
tests experiments

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.770
or change app behavior,
control custom key value pairs

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.080
from the console, and make
changes that are instant.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.020
Another key factor that not
everyone is really taking

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.810
advantage of are avatars.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.480
I love this quote
from Play Science.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.240
It says, "When children were
asked to design their own app,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.750
the feature that they
listed as the most important

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.420
was the ability to
create their own avatar.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.810
Yet few at the top playful
games offer this unique feature,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.790
suggesting a great
opportunity for developers."

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.950
And here, I'd like
to point to Roblox,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.760
another prominent
developer based in the US.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.640
They have been really
focused on their avatar.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.920
And as soon as a user
interacts with their app,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.460
they give them control
to customize it.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.440
So what have been the results?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.530
Well, this is pretty
staggering once again.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.190
60% of new sign ups
customize their avatar.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.710
And out of that
60%, they're seeing

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.820
that the retention rate is
1.8 times better-- almost

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.132
2x the other user group.

00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:39.980
Next, I would like to talk
about how to engage and retain

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.919
families through successfully
releasing new features

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.650
and content.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.320
Once again, Roblox is
a great example here.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.680
They have a systematic
release methodology.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.110
They test it with beta
users, so making sure

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.090
that you're really
getting out there,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.250
testing it with the right
user community that's

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.890
appropriate for
your ages, right?

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.540
Making sure it's technically
stable, show what's new.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.022
And lastly, analyze
that performance.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.160
PBS Kids is really
a great example

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.290
of a developer out there who's
refreshing content and updating

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.510
it on a regular basis.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.000
They add new games weekly.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.410
They have seasonal updates
around big moments-- Halloween,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.520
Christmas.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.180
Here it can be Day of Kids,
a number of other moments.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.790
And be sure to
update around that.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.370
And be sure to
update your icons.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.650
We saw some of the results
that Play Kids had in terms

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.142
of updating their icons.

00:09:41.142 --> 00:09:42.350
And that's low hanging fruit.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.230
If you can improve your
conversion rate 78%,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.840
like they are saying,
that's pretty tremendous

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.290
and not a tremendous
amount of work.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.640
So the key question is, is
there enough value in your app?

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.670
I wanted to point to this
example of Budge Studios.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.030
This is a graph that
showed retention.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.450
The top number is when they
gave away three free items,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.420
and the bottom is when
they gave away two.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.560
So as you can see, that
really spiked their numbers.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.140
This isn't necessarily what
a lot of developers think.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.360
There is usually the
perception that you

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.090
have to limit a lot
of the free content,

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.150
but we're actually
finding otherwise.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.250
And this is some great
data from Budge Studios,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.500
that the first time
experience was better

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.870
and that actually led to
greater retention, engagement,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.260
and ultimately revenue
by actually giving away

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.190
that third character.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.010
And the third part
I'd like to talk about

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.960
is reengaging users and
leveraging your key channels.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.810
So be sure to ensure that all
your organic channels are being

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.810
clearly marketed using Android
and update your existing

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.774
channels, including e-mail,
website, social, and YouTube.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.730
Here, we have some
examples from Roblox.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.240
They have an inbox in their app.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.760
And so they're able to
push notifications directly

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.860
to the user.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.530
Some other examples
include what they're doing

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.020
on social media and YouTube.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.900
A lot of developers
aren't really leveraging

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.870
the About page on
their YouTube page,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.540
so that About page
is a great place

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.120
to link to your
Google Play listing.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.910
You can also link to your
website, social media accounts.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.630
It's easy.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.751
And we've seen some strong
results out of that.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.150
Roblox is also using social
media, as I mentioned before.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.300
Form a Facebook,
Twitter, and they're also

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.250
doing YouTube cards.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.600
YouTube cards can pop up
on the side of your videos

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.170
if you're running different
videos on YouTube.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.600
Those are free to use
and another great way

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.620
to reengage users, bring them
back to your store listing

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.550
page on Google Play.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.010
Toca Boca also provides
a great example

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.350
of how a top premium developer
is leveraging their ecosystem

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.500
to really push new titles out.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.800
And a great example of that
is their Toca Life series.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.080
They have a number of
different Toca Life apps,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.100
including Toca Life
Town, Toca Life Vacation,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.710
and they actually just
released Toca Life Farm,

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.250
which is one of our
top premium titles

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.150
currently on Google Play.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.530
So Toca Life is a series of
apps that gives kids access

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.800
to a role playing universe
filled with everyday fun.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.960
It's uniquely created for
kids and it was really

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.710
a direct result of communicating
with their fan base

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.830
and taking user feedback.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.350
So since the release of
the first app in May 2014,

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.880
Toca Boca has received more
than 60,000 feature requests

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.510
and reviews from kids
all over the world.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.500
And it's feedback that has
informed their Toca Life series

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.690
and has brought us these titles.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.230
And this title,
Toca Life Vacation,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.420
was their most
successful launch ever.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.480
And it's really
because they leveraged

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.650
their previous ecosystem.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.810
So 32% of users downloading
Toca Life Vacation

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:34.800
had downloaded all of
the previous three apps.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.880
And 38% of users downloading
Toca Life Vacation

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.880
had downloaded one or two
of those previous apps.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.890
So be sure that your
cross-promotion is really

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.670
on point.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.130
Once again, text and
make sure that it's

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.215
relevant in driving the
benefits that you're going for.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.130
Another one is using
rich notifications

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.630
to bring users back to your app.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.600
So a few best practice here here
is include actionable content,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.650
deep linking to the
right part of your app,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.730
stacking similar notifications,
and avoid spamming,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.150
and testing.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.160
So what are the things
to do with notifications?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.310
Well, one, get users familiar.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.790
Two, consider re-activation.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.980
Three, try to make an
emotional connection.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.470
Four, include
actionable content.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.500
Five, deep link.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.860
And six, really
consider your audience.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.780
This is especially important
in the kids and family space.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.760
And then just four
things that you

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.450
want to avoid and not do
with notifications are

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.130
don't push spam notifications.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.510
Don't forget to
expire notifications.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.290
Don't push ads.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.110
House ads are permitted, though.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.930
And don't leave notifications
up to guesswork.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.430
So the case study
here that I wanted

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.910
to highlight on the
notification and messaging side

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.130
is SpeakaBoos.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:08.110
They utilize a combination of
notifications, emails, push,

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.690
and social media to
reinforce a message that

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.670
furthers their brand.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.490
For SpeakaBoos,
each touchpoint is

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.210
designed to motivate a love of
reading by connecting children

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.410
to their interests.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.510
So SpeakaBoos' push
notification, this example,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.470
it's fun.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.320
It's relevant.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.770
They said, did you know
it's world pasta day?

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.170
So that really activated
their user base.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.570
They also time it with
new content releases,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.190
exclusive content, holiday
events, and discounts.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.610
And they've seen strong results
from their push notifications,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.280
as well as from their messaging.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.900
They regularly test A/B
results, analyze those metrics,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.930
and optimize based on
a variety of factors.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.390
And this has resulted
in a nice uplift.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.760
So news story day
for SpeakaBoos is

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.150
an e-mail that promotes a
special and exclusive content.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.410
That has driven a 5%
increase in click rates.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.370
And content that makes use
of appropriate hashtags

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.890
is another key to this.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.770
Overall, they've seen a 60%
increase with web traffic

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.800
when it's paired
with social accounts

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.270
for 5% of monthly traffic.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.710
So I hope that was helpful.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.450
I know we covered
a lot of things,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.090
wanted to include a lot
of case studies and data

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.820
from some of our top partners.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.254
Hopefully, in the
next presentation,

00:16:41.254 --> 00:16:42.670
next time we come
down here, we'll

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.210
include more data from
a lot of you guys.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.280
We know this is collaborative,
but just to reiterate,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.300
the three key things
that we really

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.340
encourage you to
think through are

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.150
onboarding, new features
and content releases,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.580
and reengaging your users.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.820
So thank you very much.
