00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:02.629
- My mother and Arthur
Schlesinger were great friends

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.800
and they used to have a
playful teasing with each other

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.426
and it was 50/50 who would
get the better of who.

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:14.181
But Arthur was known for

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.059
on somebody's birthday or special occasion

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.047
like today he would say,
"Well, today is the day

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:22.799
"that the first can of beer
was canned in America and

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.199
"the first game was played in
the American Baseball League

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.993
"and also Governor Winthrop's telescope

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:32.993
"was burned in the Harvard fire."

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:35.073
Those things actually
all did happen today.

00:00:35.073 --> 00:00:35.906
- [Host] Right.

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:38.201
- And so my mother said, "Well look

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.801
"Arthur may be smart
but he's not that smart.

00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.620
"He's got a book that he's
looking this stuff up in.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.089
"So when we go out to play tennis

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.969
"why don't you into Arthur's
room and find the book

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.750
(host and audience laughing)

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.409
"and I will embarrass him at dinner."

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.920
And I said, "Mom, you want me
to go into your guest's room?"

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.441
And she was like, "Yeah"

00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:04.041
(host and audience laughing)
So I did.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.754
And so when Mom got back
from tennis she said,

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.712
"Did you find the book?"

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:09.743
And I said, "Yeah."

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:10.933
She said, "Well do you have it?"

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.823
I said, "I'm not going to take the book

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:14.042
"out of Arthur's room, Mom."

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.093
She said, "Well, what's the book called?"

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:18.710
I said, "It's called the
Almanac of American History

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.511
"by Arthur Schlesinger."

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.761
(laughter)
