00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.990
Black holes and dark matter are two topics
that get science geeks pretty hyped, but sadly

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.240
they’re not usually mentioned in the same
sentence.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.290
Now though you can feel twice the hype, because
a new theory has proposed that we can detect

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.599
dark matter using black holes.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.190
Well, more accurately, using the gravitational
waves that dark matter near a black hole would

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.190
give off.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.900
So make that three times the hype.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.730
I am 99.9% positive that all of you watching
are familiar with black holes, the superdense

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.529
points in space where matter is packed so
tight and gravity is so strong that -all together

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.880
now- not even light can escape.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.070
You’ve probably also heard of gravitational
waves.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.239
First proposed by Einstein and confirmed in
2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.530
Observatory, or LIGO, they are ripples in
spacetime and they’re caused when massive

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.280
objects turn space into a wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey...

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Thing.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.020
So far, these are well established phenomenon
and we have a pretty good idea of what they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.809
are and why they happen.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.770
But the third member in this science love
triangle is the biggest question mark of them

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.399
all: dark matter.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.249
Evidence has shown that almost 85% of the
matter in the universe is unaccounted for.

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:11.259
Beyond that, we have no solid lead what all
that missing stuff actually is, so we just

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.430
call it ‘dark matter’.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.479
One of the proposed culprits is a hypothetical
subatomic particle called the axion.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.039
These little guys were originally proposed
to solve another mystery of physics called

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.189
the Strong CP Problem, but they might be the
key to Dark Matter as well.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.189
Score!

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.170
They’re predicted to be a billionth the
mass of an electron or lighter, but with enough

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.670
of them they just might add up to all that
missing mass.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.509
Those are the key pieces: a black hole, gravitational
waves, and a whole bunch of axions.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.069
The way the researchers proposed they work
together is really quite elegant.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.789
Because the quantum world is a silly place,
axion particles should also act like waves.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.149
The lighter the particle, the longer the wavelength.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.810
Hypothetically, if an axion is near a spinning
black hole and its wavelength is as long as

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.649
the black hole’s diameter, then things could
get really crazy.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.609
That’s right we’re not even at the crazy
part yet!

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.989
A phenomenon called superradiance can kick
in.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:07.130
Superradiance is a process that has been shown
to multiply photons, and axions and photons

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.500
are thought to have some properties in common.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500
The spinning black hole would give the axion
more energy and generate more axions in a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.530
runaway chain reaction like a Mr. Meeseeks
box.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.849
You can end up with 1080 axions around one
black hole.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.290
That’s as many axions as there are atoms
in the universe!

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.069
All these axions should give off a distinct
signature that we can detect.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.930
The researchers predicted they won’t scatter
randomly, but will form orderly clouds like

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.790
electrons do around an atom.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.900
And as they smash into each other, they should
annihilate each other to produce gravitons,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.840
another hypothetical particle that’s never
been confirmed.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.040
These gravitons mediate the force of gravity,
so we should be able to detect them coming

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.439
from these huge axion clouds as gravitational
waves.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.950
LIGO isn’t quite sensitive enough to pick
up these gravitational waves just yet.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.549
But once it is, if LIGO detects gravitational
waves with the same wavelengths from different

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.940
sources, then we’ll know it’s likely caused
by these axions and all the pieces will fall

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.940
into place.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.970
Don’t go thinking it fits completely perfectly
just yet.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.689
For the axions to have a long enough wavelength
they’d have to be much lighter than what

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.519
we’ve been looking for with current lab
experiments, anywhere from ten thousand to

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.189
ten million times lighter.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.020
At that mass they still might be too light
to account for all the dark matter.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.689
So pump the brakes on the hype train just
a little, and let’s wait until LIGO is a

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:23.689
bit more sensitive.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.640
Do you have a favorite candidate for dark
matter?

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
Axions?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640
WIMPs?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640
MACHOs?
