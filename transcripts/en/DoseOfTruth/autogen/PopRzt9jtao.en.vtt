00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920
radical left-leaning activists and so
 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.130
radical left-leaning activists and so
like for a while one of the things I

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140
like for a while one of the things I
 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.250
like for a while one of the things I
proposed in Canada was that the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260
proposed in Canada was that the
 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.080

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559
university funding by twenty five
 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.080
university funding by twenty five
percent so that the universities would

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090
percent so that the universities would
 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.970
percent so that the universities would
have to sort themselves out but then

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980
have to sort themselves out but then
 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.920
have to sort themselves out but then
that was that was a provocative claim

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930
that was that was a provocative claim
 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.020
that was that was a provocative claim
obviously but then I thought well that's

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
obviously but then I thought well that's
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.849
obviously but then I thought well that's
not a good idea because it opens up the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859
not a good idea because it opens up the
 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.920
not a good idea because it opens up the
door to political interference in the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930
door to political interference in the

right but the Academy has done a very
 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.520

that if we let our systems get out of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
that if we let our systems get out of
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.430

betraying the truth and many of our
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.230
betraying the truth and many of our
disciplines so I think we need an

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240
disciplines so I think we need an
 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.550
disciplines so I think we need an
awareness of that and we need to hold

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
awareness of that and we need to hold
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.450

then in our role as teachers we have and
here we really can call it a fiduciary

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
here we really can call it a fiduciary
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.350

going to see a huge surge of
applications this year and if that's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630
applications this year and if that's
 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.880
applications this year and if that's
true

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890
true
 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.760
