JAMIE ROSENBERG: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.520
And wow.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.740
If you could stand here and
look out at this, what a sight.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.230
And what an amazing thing
to have all of you show up

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.630
and to spend this time
with us here today.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.320
We have a fantastic
day lined up for you,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.900
lots to update you about.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
But also, this is a time
for us to get together, meet

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
each other, share ideas,
and have a bit of fun.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.400
We are a community,
after all, and it's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
the spirit of community that
I've come to look forward to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.220
with these playtime events.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.100
We did our first play time
event about four years

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.080
ago back in California.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.570
Since then, we've taken
this on the road--

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.510
32 events in 14 countries
all over the world.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.020
It's been a great
opportunity to connect

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.530
with our developers in many,
many markets around the world.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.780
And I'm very pleased to say that
today, with you here in Berlin,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.150
this is our biggest
Playtime event ever.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.916
So thank you.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:07.381
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.130
We know that you're
all busy people.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.380
A lot of you
traveled to be here,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.630
took time out of your
regular routines.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.040
We're so grateful to be able
to spend this time with you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.140
because we really all are on
an amazing journey together.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
Tomorrow, actually, is
the ninth anniversary

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.300
of the first launch of the
very first Android smartphone.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.530
Extra credit for any of you
who know what phone that was

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.760
and where it launched.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.230
No fair using Google
for that, by the way.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.330
Nine years.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.710
That means that everything
about this world of smartphones

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.610
as we know it has happened
in less than 10 years.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.240
This Android community
that we have that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.370
now reaches more than 2 billion
devices all over the world

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.440
is less than 10 years old.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.600
It's amazing to think
about the innovation that's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.630
happened during that time--

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.880
how networks have
gotten faster, how

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.240
devices have become
these powerful computers

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.970
in our pockets, and how screens
on your wrist and in your car

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.200
and in your home have
gotten smart and connected.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.820
And we've been
blown away with each

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.770
of these waves of innovation.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.900
We've been blown
away by the work

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.860
that you all have done to
bring these devices to life.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.200
And Google Play itself is
just over five years old.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.050
And that's amazing
to think about.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.460
We're now delivering more than
8 billion installs every month

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.280
on Play, reaching users
all over the world.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.950
These are apps that entertain us
and educate us, inform us, keep

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.550
us healthy, help us get
things done in our lives.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.370
And we take very seriously
the responsibility

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.060
to make Android and Play
a rewarding platform

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.630
for all of you.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.510
Here in the EMEA region,
we have users of all types.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.650
We have very tech-forward
power users, probably

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.140
like a lot of us in this room.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.840
We have families who
use their smartphones

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.370
to stay connected
with each other

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.010
and share their experiences.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.250
And we have users who are
being introduced to smartphones

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.210
and computing for the very
first time in countries

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.300
where the infrastructure
and networks can barely

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.650
support them.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.620
Our job as a platform
is to help you

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.960
build the products
you want to build,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.150
reach the audiences
who want to reach,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.890
sometimes reach audiences
you didn't even know you had.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.680
We take that job very seriously.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.700
We're investing heavily
in tools to help

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.260
you build apps on Android,
distribute them in Google Play.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.710
We're investing in one of the
largest billing and payment

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.550
platforms on the planet.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.190
And we're constantly
looking for ways

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.360
to apply Google's technology
to the consumer experience

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.380
on Play.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.810
For example, we've
matched our human curation

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.110
with Google machine
learning technology

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.140
to help match the right
app to the right user

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.540
in the right context.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.630
And in some of these
cases, these investments

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.160
are happening right
here in Europe.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.790
For example, our team that
builds the Play Console, which

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.910
I know many of you use, and
our Play Publishing Tools

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.470
is based in London.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.630
And of course, our
partnership teams

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.760
and our support teams
that work with you

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.940
are based here in the region.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.420
And we have teams that work with
mobile operators and Android

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.550
device manufacturers
in the region

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.060
to complete the picture
of our ecosystem.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.710
Thanks to those
teams, by the way,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.950
we're now connected
with 90 mobile carriers

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.370
in 38 countries in
EMEA for billing,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.380
which means that more than 400
million users in the region

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.450
can pay for their
purchases on Google Play

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.310
through their
mobile phone build.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.190
It's really valuable to
have these teams here

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.480
to be able to interact
with you regularly,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.110
not just at events
like this, so we can

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.180
learn how to serve you better.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.780
And it's been amazing
to see the progress

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.570
that developers in this
region have been making.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.050
Apps and games
developed here in India

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.770
are now generating 2.5
billion downloads per month

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.450
globally on Google Play.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.490
That's amazing.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.940
Revenue growth from apps and
games developed here in EMEA

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.410
is accelerating.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.220
The number of developers
grossing more than $1 million

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.660
a month through their apps--
developers based here in EMEA--

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.210
that number has grown
30% this year alone.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.520
That's phenomenal progress.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.950
Congratulations.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.640
Going forward, we're
working on a lot of things

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.250
to make our platforms
more powerful and more

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.700
intelligent to help you build
better and more performant

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.510
apps, reach broader audiences,
better engage your users,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.150
and better understand
your users.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.910
And you'll hear a lot
about those things today.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.040
I'm also really excited
about the innovation

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.360
that we're seeing
in devices, which

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.600
is a function of the power of
the Android platform coupled

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.690
with great work being done
by our device manufacturers.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.780
And this innovation is
happening in targeted ways

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.010
in every segment.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.290
We've seen some phenomenal
Android flagship

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.302
devices come out this year.

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:53.010
These are devices that
really are pushing

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.590
the boundaries of
technology and computing

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.000
and industrial design.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.600
And those devices will bring
us new opportunities next year.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.420
For example, what
will we be able to do

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.630
when devices include onboard
artificial intelligence

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.590
processing capability
or when devices include

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.070
the capability to build AR
apps to bring the real world

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.440
into your apps, and vise versa?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.940
And in the mid-tier
segment, we've

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.890
seen manufacturers be able
to deliver premium hardware

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.290
at affordable prices,
which is going

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.530
to engage an entirely
new segment of users

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.170
in a much deeper way with apps.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.450
And at the entry level,
we've seen innovation

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.600
in data plan pricing
and the ability

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.250
to bring very low-cost, quality
smartphones to users in markets

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.740
around the world
and make computing

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.870
more accessible than
it's ever been before.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.380
Our own Project Go, which we
talked about at Google I/O,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.480
is aimed at this
segment and aimed

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.740
at working on both better
devices at lower costs,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.400
but also a set of best
practices for all of you

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.530
to reach users in these
markets and create

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.240
unique experiences for them.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.680
I'm also excited by all
the ways that Android

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.040
is coming to more types of
devices with Android Wear

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.220
and Android Auto and
Android TV, and now

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.790
on the desktop with Android
apps available on Chromebooks.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.340
Not only is this
creating opportunities

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.800
to build specific use
cases for these devices,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.240
but it's also making us think
about a world in which users

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.460
have several of
these devices and are

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.070
moving across these
devices during their days.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.440
And how can we
create experiences

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.179
that bring these
devices together

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.419
and bring these
experiences together?

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.039
All of this represents our
opportunity going forward,

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.240
and it's also going to
challenge us to keep up.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.650
But as a community, I
think we're up to the task,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.440
and I can't wait to see
what we all do next.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.730
So thank you.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.100
And with that, I'll
pass it off to Ishan

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.750
to talk about the Play Store.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.647
Thank you.

00:08:58.647 --> 00:09:00.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.640
ISHAN CHATTERJEE: Thanks, Jamie.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.820
Hi, everyone.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.350
My name is Ishan, and I focus
on Google Play's business

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.010
across apps, games, movies,
TV, and the other content

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.780
verticals in EMEA.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.960
I am really excited to tell
you about all the changes

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.210
that we're making in
the store to make it

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.510
the best possible destination
for users to engage

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.080
with your apps and games.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.640
Now, as Jamie said,
Play's mission

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.610
is to bring devices to
life on mobile and beyond.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.780
So whether it's your phone,
your watch, or increasingly,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.360
your car, Play is
the thread that

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.780
connects those 2 billion
devices to the content that

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.090
makes those devices magical.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.050
And that's why I'm really
keen to share with you some

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.080
of the improvements that we're
making on personalization,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.010
which is the building block of
everything that we do on Play.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.690
And I'm also going
to talk a little bit

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.290
about the new experiences that
we're creating in the store.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.960
So let's dive straight
in with personalization.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.810
We have created a new
taxonomy that groups

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.080
apps and games into
hundreds of different topics

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.030
that users can engage with.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.380
This taxonomy drives our
search filters as well as

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.900
the recommendations
on the homepage.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.720
We also want to go
beyond the install

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.580
and focus on reengagement.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.340
Now, you'll see a lot of changes
that we're making in the store.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.290
But one good example
of that is the

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.040
don't forget to try cluster
that surfaces apps and games

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.850
that you've recently installed.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.070
Now, personalization
and machine learning

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.770
are great tools to connect
up the right content

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.850
to the right user.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.830
You heard Jamie
mention that just now.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.630
But in the store,
we want to do more.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.190
We want to help users decide
what content to actually

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.000
install by highlighting the
very best of the catalog.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.200
And that's why creating
new editorial experiences

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.360
has been a big focus
area for us this year,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.970
including rich long-form content
that you see up there which

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.710
explains why we've selected to
highlight that particular app.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.930
These Editor's Choice
stories are now

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.110
available in 17
different countries.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.660
In addition to that,
we're continuing

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.540
to invest in a number of
different programs that

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.590
reward and recognize our
developer partners for creating

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.640
wonderful experiences
on Android and Play,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.630
such as the Android Excellence
Program and the Best of Play.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.830
And in that vein, it
gives me great pleasure

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.880
to announce the launch of the
second edition of the Google

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.840
Play Indie Games
Contest and EMEA.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.340
Yes.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.070
Thank you.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:00.210
This contest aims to celebrate,
to recognize, and reward

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.490
the very best of the
indie games talent

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.370
that we have in the region.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.190
Finalists will be showcased
in the Indie Games

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.930
Corner of the Play Store.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.690
They'll get a chance to showcase
their games at the Saatchi

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.020
Gallery in London as well as
win a number of different prizes

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.860
that will help them be
successful on Android and Play.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.020
Now, we're really
lucky today because we

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.870
have a number of finalists
from last year's contest

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.800
in the audience with us.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.100
So I'd like to take a
minute to actually ask

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.470
all of them to please stand up.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:34.670
There we go.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.913
Can we have a round of
applause for them, please?

00:12:36.913 --> 00:12:39.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.250
So if any of you have questions
about what that experience was

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.220
like, please reach out to
them in the break for a chat.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.560
All the details about
this year's contest

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.900
are at the playground,
which is right below us,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.690
and that's where you
can sign up as well.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.600
So please do.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.650
Moving on from indie
games to all games.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.010
Now, apps are different from
games, and we all know that.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.010
So we have elevated games
to its own destination

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.570
within the store.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.080
Not only does that drive
more users to gaming content,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.540
it also gives us the
chance and opportunity

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.750
to create new experiences
that are unique to gaming,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.200
such as immersive
recommendations that

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.060
include trailers or
screenshots of actual gameplay.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.360
We also want to give users more
control of how they explore

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.030
the catalog, so
we're experimenting

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.270
with new formats in the store,
such as a section dedicated

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.640
to new games that
highlight the latest

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.550
high-quality releases on Play.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.890
Similarly, we've
launched a new section,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.870
a premium section
on the store, that

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.870
highlights paid games only.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.060
And also, it
showcases content that

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.660
is on sale using our
strikethrough pricing feature.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.790
This collection went
live last month,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.120
and we've already seen a big
increase in engagement as well

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.090
as in purchases.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.000
We also want to be known
as a store where gamers

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.690
can discover what's happening
on games that they already have.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.510
So a first step to
live ops discovery

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.820
is through the use
of the Live Ops Card

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.520
that focuses on major
in-game events that

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.070
are happening now on the
games that users are currently

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.790
playing.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.500
Now, that's a lot about games,
so now moving on to apps.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.570
As you'll see in the
middle screenshot,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.750
we've already started to
feature major content events

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.730
in the entertainment
category, and we're

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.820
going to be extending that to
many other categories going

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.410
forward.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.020
And finally, I'm really
excited to announce

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.690
the launch of our
very first integration

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:49.460
with Android Instant Apps, which
now comes with a Try Now button

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.960
directly on the Store Listings
page that allows users

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.450
to experience some of the
functionality of the app

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.340
without actually
having to download it.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.660
That was a really
quick whistle stop tour

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.230
through some of the changes
that we're making in the store.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.870
And to tell you more
about some of the changes

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.730
we're making at
the Play Console,

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.750
I'd now like to
hand over to Kobi.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.062
Thank you.

00:15:16.062 --> 00:15:18.467
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.520
KOBI GLICK: Thanks, Ishan.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.330
Hi.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.410
I'm Kobi, a product
manager on Google Play.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.740
The Play Console offers you
tools at every step of your app

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.100
lifecycle.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.860
Last year, we had a
big focus on quality.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.330
We launched Android vitals at
I/O. The Play Console is where

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.140
you release your app to users.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.020
And we keep on iterating
our testing, targeting,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.300
and release tools
based on your feedback.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.180
Finally, the
console offers tools

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.100
to everyone on your team--

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.030
marketing and acquisition,
financials, customer support.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.210
Everyone can find tools that
are helpful for what they do.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.940
Let's start with quality.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.150
You're probably familiar
with this slide.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.670
50% of one-star reviews
are when users complain

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.280
about bugs or stability.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.260
Higher-quality apps
means happier users,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.650
which drives all your KPIs up--

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.460
revenue, retention, you name it.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.176
It's the foundation of
your whole app success.

00:16:20.176 --> 00:16:21.550
And what we give
you with quality

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.570
is a combination of
metrics, tools, and rewards.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.930
For metrics, we collect
telemetry data from the field

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.110
and surface it to you
through Android vitals.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:37.270
We offer you tools before,
during, and after release.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.880
Before the release, we offer
you the pre-launch report.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.000
And we recently added some
feature in this report,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.630
allowing you to get it for
every alpha and beta APK

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.110
that you have.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.074
During the release, we offer
you the Release Dashboard,

00:16:50.074 --> 00:16:52.240
which shows you the health
of your release comparing

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.010
to previous releases.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.910
And after the release, we
offer you Android vitals.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:04.470
Finally, Google Pay rewards apps
that show exemplary behavior.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.089
So we launched
Android vitals at I/O,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.280
and you started
using it right away.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.589
In the last 28 days, we've seen
65% of top developers using

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.300
Android vitals.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.450
With vitals, everyone on your
team-- not just engineering--

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.150
can set KPIs around app quality.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.710
And I'm happy to
announce that today,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.130
we're launching five new bad
behaviors in Android vitals.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.170
For example, on the
stability front,

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.806
we'll now show you sessions
when there are multiple crashes.

00:17:32.806 --> 00:17:34.180
And on the battery
front, we will

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.240
let you know when your app
drains unnecessary power when

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.400
the user is away
from their device,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.820
leading to unnecessary drain.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.520
We've also revamped the
Android vitals dashboard.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.630
To begin with,
we've significantly

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.540
increase the device coverage.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.020
We work with OEM to add
flagship [INAUDIBLE] devices

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.270
all the way to
mid-range bestsellers

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.390
so you now have much more
data at your fingertips.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.910
The Android vitals dashboard
itself was changed to show

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.100
your performance
overview at a glance,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.150
including performance
over time and benchmarks .

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.220
And Android vitals plays now
a key signal in Google Play.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.290
Our search and
discovery algorithms

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.290
favor apps with better vitals.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.600
And when your app is considered
for promotional opportunities,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.350
like new and updated editors
choice or Google Play Awards,

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.180
vitals play a key role.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.940
An area that is
related to quality

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.190
and is near and dear to
our heart is security.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.790
So I'm happy to
announce a new program--

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.940
the Google Play
Security Reward Program.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.710
How does it work?

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.620
So firstly, we'll be reaching
out to developers like you,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.350
asking you to opt in
and join the program.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.710
Then we'll have friendly
security researchers

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.620
scan your app.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.690
And if they find a
security vulnerability,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.659
they report it to you through
your bug reporting system.

00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:58.700
If you don't have one,
our friends from HackerOne

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.680
will be happy to help.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.960
Then once you fix
the vulnerability,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.900
the researcher comes back
to Google for a payout.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.720
Then our Android security team
can scan the entire catalog,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.440
surfacing the same vulnerability
to other developers,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.010
helping them fix their app,
making the Android ecosystem

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.890
more secure for our users.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.380
Together with other
security programs,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.874
we have in Google,
Android, and Chrome,

00:19:23.874 --> 00:19:25.790
we're happy to continue
our great relationship

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.080
with the security industry,
making the app ecosystem safer.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.870
OK.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.400
Let's talk about
releases now, and I

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.440
have some exciting news here.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.410
For years, beta testing has
been one of the most popular

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.150
features on Google Play.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:45.340
We have more than 300,000
developers using beta testing.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.190
But one feature request
that always emerged

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.860
was the ability to
target apps and betas

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.455
to different countries.

00:19:52.455 --> 00:19:53.830
And you can see
the feedback here

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.150
from our friends at Space Ape
Games telling us how badly they

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.530
wanted this feature.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.690
So I have some great news.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.270
Starting today, we're
launching this feature.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.930
You'll now be able to
target your beta apps

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.180
to different countries.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.434
Woo hoo!

00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:12.819
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.920
So until today, the way it
works is that when you target

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.510
a country-- let's say Germany--

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.769
you have to target it across
alpha, beta, and production.

00:20:24.769 --> 00:20:27.060
But starting today, you will
be able to target your app

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.110
to different countries in alpha
versus beta versus production.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.980
So for example, you can
run a beta test in Germany

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.110
before launching it publicly.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.456
We're sure you'll find great
ways to use this new feature.

00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:42.830
Another feature
that you guys use

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.050
quite a lot is stage rollout.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.480
And I have another
great announcement here.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.370
In a few weeks, we
will start allowing

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.330
you to do country-targeted
stage rollouts.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.470
How does it work?

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.700
You can see right here.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.160
Let's say you have an
issue you want to isolate,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.420
let's say, in India.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.430
So you start by rolling
your app to 1% India only.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.080
If everything looks
good, then you

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.080
can continue and go
to 10% in India only.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.250
At that stage, perhaps you want
to add a control group country.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.310
Maybe you add
Indonesia, still at 10%.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.890
Then if everything looks
good, then you bump to 20%

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.370
and add more countries.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.745
And finally, you finish by
rolling out to 100% globally.

00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:27.900
Pretty cool, right?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.320
Another feature we launched
at I/O is the device catalog.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.530
It allows you to look at the
hardware spec of every device

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.970
supported by your app.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.100
It became very
popular with you guys.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.290
For example, in
the last 28 days,

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:46.130
we've seen 66% of top developers
engaging with the catalog.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.070
And one thing the
catalog allows you to do

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.080
is to search for devices based
on a range of attributes--

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.650
RAM, system on chip, screen
size and density, and many more.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.930
Starting today, we're
launching a new feature

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.480
allowing you to construct
your search queries,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.190
save them, and reuse
them across your catalog.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.900
So you can create a search
query like high screen devices

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.700
running on [INAUDIBLE]
and then use it

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.180
in every app in your catalog
to see the installs, rating,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.100
and revenue driven
by those devices.

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.920
Another feature
we're launching today

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.160
comes to answer a very frequent
question we get from you guys--

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.036
why isn't this device
supporting my app?

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:26.660
So starting today,
you'll be able to go

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.020
to every device in the catalog,
deep dive to that device,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.870
and see the support
stages across alpha, beta,

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.540
and production-- for
example, highlighting cases

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.000
like the one you see right
here where the device doesn't

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.850
support your app because your
app requires certain hardware

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.715
or software feature that
this device doesn't support.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.340
Now I want to continue
and talk about how

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.290
we help you grow your business.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.320
And I want to focus on the
fastest-growing business model

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.930
in the industry-- subscription.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.610
You remembered it
at I/O. We shared

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.890
that the number of
subscribers and the revenue

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.770
from subscription businesses
have doubled on Google

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.439
Play in the last year alone.

00:23:05.439 --> 00:23:07.480
And I'm going to share
with you some new features

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.640
at every step of the process--

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.970
setting up subscriptions,
acquiring new users,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.540
and retaining them.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.940
So let's start with setup.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.780
We recently launched a
Play Billing Library 1.0.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.180
And using this
library is a great way

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.150
to make sure you're using the
latest and greatest features

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.796
our billing stock has to offer.

00:23:28.796 --> 00:23:30.170
In a few days,
we'll be launching

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.120
another big
improvement to testing.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.230
We'll be launching a
good form of payment

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.760
and a bad form of payment
associated with every test

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.510
account.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.590
This allows you to test both the
happy path and the unhappy path

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.897
without actually using
a real form of payment.

00:23:44.897 --> 00:23:47.480
And in addition, we're launching
a new Subscription Management

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.670
page in the Play
Console today that

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.550
allows you to opt in into
various features related

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.120
to subscriptions.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.490
Now, your app's success
depends on your ability

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.110
to acquire new users.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.470
And our data shows
that 78% of users

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.430
start with a free experience.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.540
So we're making some changes
to how free trials work

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.950
on Google Play.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.440
To begin with, to
reduce free trial abuse,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.160
we'll be making free trial
an app-level setting.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.050
In addition, we've
heard your feedback

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.250
about wanting a shorter
free trial period.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.550
So starting last
week, we now allow

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.400
you to run free trials
of minimum three days.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.310
And user acquisition
is important.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.210
But if you cannot retain those
users, you have a problem.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.710
Right?

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.460
So we are here to help.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.470
You remember that
at I/O, we announced

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.450
that we have a feature
called Account Hold that

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.770
is available on beta.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.710
So I'm happy to announce that
starting today, this feature is

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.210
available for all of you.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.030
All you need to do is opt in
through the New Subscription

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.580
page in the Play Console.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.860
But the one feature I'm
really excited about

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.510
is our new feature for win back.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.810
We will now-- starting today,
we will notify you every time

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.700
the subscription state changes,
including cancellation,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.090
in real time.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.500
This means that no more waiting
until the end of the month

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.070
to find out that the subscriber
churned two weeks ago.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.020
We will now let you
know in real time,

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:15.020
allowing you to start to
win back process right away.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.500
And in addition, we're enabling
another new feature today--

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.540
subscription restoration.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.090
This feature allows
users on Play Store

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.820
to come back to your service
if they've changed their mind

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.660
without almost any friction.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.800
So today, we shared
some exciting news.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.040
We have new Android vitals.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.950
We have country targeting
for alpha and beta.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.660
And we have some
great new features

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.950
to drive the success of your
subscription businesses.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.700
We're sure you'll use
those features to do

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.050
what you do so well--

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.110
launching such great apps
and games on Google Play.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.540
Thank you very much for
joining, and enjoy Playtime.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.290
[APPLAUSE]
