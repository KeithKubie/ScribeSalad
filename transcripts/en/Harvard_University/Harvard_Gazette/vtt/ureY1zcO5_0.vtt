My dearest Lauren Lou,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.540
From the day you were born you captured
our hearts with an infectious smile that

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.310
soon developed into the warmest hug.
I used to remind myself that the day

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.160
would come when I would find myself
missing you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.259
the little girl who would sing around
the house or write plays for others to

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.650
perform; the girl who was at times so
hungry but unable to decide what she was

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.250
hungry for; the girl who adores her baby
sister

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.730
My dearest Lauren I appreciate your
integrity, your passion, and your love for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.600
Jesus. I expect great things from you, not
great as defined by the world drunk on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.600
its own materialism, but great on a
deeper level. I expect you to live

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.300
truthfully, to face your imperfections
head-on, to be real and authentic in your

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.130
relationships; I expect you to call home

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.640
I will close with some guidelines: life
is not fair

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.010
get used to it. Always treat people with
respect and be nice to everyone. Maintain

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.830
balance in your life.
Always keep your personal integrity, it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.200
defines who you are. Do something with
your career that you're passionate about

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.660
never let money be the motivator for
what you decide to do: success is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:06.129
determined by how you contribute to
making someone else's life better

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.120
my dear Lauren, today is one of the best
days of our lives. You have exceeded our

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.770
highest hopes and dreams. Thank you for
bringing so much joy into our lives

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.780
with all my love, your dad
