00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.930
I’m not afraid of dying.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.830
Sometimes I think dying is a relief.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.279
I would rather pass on then to not be able
to have any good times.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:33.970
The thing I miss the most is not being able
to see the cards and play cards.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.700
I miss going to bridge.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170
Can’t eat much at times.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.659
But that’s what the doctor told me I’d
be able to do…less and less.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.989
And he was right

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.969
I can’t get out of here.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.520
Alright, we’ll get you.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.650
I’ll be your arms and your legs for you
OK?

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.220
Alright mom, 1,2,3, alright.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:22.050
I think she’s in distress of being fully
conscious of her body receding.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.740
And then the other distress is when she actually
can’t breathe.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.740
‘

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.870
You alright mom?

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.180
You know what is life?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.340
Is life just simply that you’re technically
alive?

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
Is that life?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.540
Or does a person define what life is for them.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.950
If I lay on my left side I can feel my heart
beating.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.590
Sometimes it’s just bang ,bang, bang.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.870
I can hear it vibrating and hear it too.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.920
I really don’t want to do that.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.320
We asked her about her meds today and she
would rather have us give them to her in advance

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.170
so she doesn’t ever feel bad.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.360
And she knows the price of her being comforted
is she’s going to be less alert.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.480
She’ll be more dopey.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.730
She wants to go.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.110
My goal now is to make it easier for her even
if it makes it harder for me.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:43.170
But it bothers me.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.630
Mom I’m gonna….

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.210
I’m gonna go to the bank mom and run that
errand.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:59.910
So I’ll be gone for a little while.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.660
You’ve taken really good care of us.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.560
And we’ll all be ok.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.030
We’ll be sad but we’ll be OK.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.500
I love you so much, you’ve taught me so
much mom.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.630
I love you too.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.240
One more kiss.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.090
I love you.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:39.520
See I think I need to leave, cause I think
she needs me to leave.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.340
She’s slowing on down.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.959
You can count like 9 beats between each breath
she’s taking.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.270
But she’s doing what she needs to do.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:02.300
I want to pray with you OK?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.120
The love that’s here God, surrounded, the
attention she has Lord, how blessed.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.539
God continue to comfort her with your presence,
continue God to allow her ears to hear your

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:24.160
voice and her heart to beat for you as it
has for so long.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.630
Receive her Oh God, and take care of her oh
God.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.620
In Jesus name we pray.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.650
Amen.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.790
It’s OK to go.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.500
You know all the people we love, tell them
hello.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:51.240
We want the best for you as you always wanted
the best for us.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:56.110
And you always gave us the best.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.229
You go ahead and go.

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.650
I think she’s gone.
