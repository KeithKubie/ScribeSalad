00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.090
So I'm going to try to offer
a few remarks to frame the day

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.640
and give a little context
for the arc of the day.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.510
And I want to start with
a strong assumption, which

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.730
is that no one--

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.270
no one has as their goal
that there be poor quality

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.220
teaching at Harvard.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.370
Students don't want
poor quality teaching.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.990
Parents certainly don't.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.010
Deans don't, department
chairs don't, presidents

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.560
don't, and instructors don't.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.379
Nobody wants there to be poor
quality teaching at Harvard.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.920
Many of you will be
thinking of those

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.550
stories, the ones that you have
heard or experienced yourself

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.910
where someone said, don't
spend your time on teaching.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240
It's not rewarded here.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.730
Even the people
who said that still

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.740
want there to be high
quality teaching.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.710
They just don't want you
to spend too much time

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.900
because they want you to
spend time on other things.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.030
Everybody wants there to
be high quality teaching.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.400
Another assumption-- although
for this one, we have data.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.630
While there are many examples
of transcendentally excellent

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.930
teaching-- and I've walked
in and just sat in on classes

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.650
and been amazed, there are a
lot of moments in the classroom

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.800
and in other kinds
of learning contexts

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.330
that are sort of middling.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.400
And there are still
some, I think,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.970
fewer and fewer that are poor.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.320
And so my third assumption--

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.100
Harvard can and should
offer the absolute best

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.956
educational experience
possible for students.

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:47.580
There's no reason
why we can't do that.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.190
These days, like
a lot of people,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.830
I find myself
envisioning a future

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.050
that seems sort of apocryphal.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.070
There's a landscape that seems
kind of harsh and stripped.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
And then I think hopefully
about the students.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.210
And I think of each
one of them as a kind

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.280
of truly precious seed
that, carefully cultivated,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.160
can change the
landscape of our future.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.790
And I think that
when we don't attend,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
when we allow poor quality
teaching to happen,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.400
we're treating those seeds
cavalierly, and it's a mistake.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.920
So I'm guessing that
most of you in the room,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.840
because you're here, you share
these assumptions with me.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.870
You basically agree that we
all want high quality teaching,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.440
that there's room
for improvement,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.510
and that we should
be working at Harvard

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.480
to make those improvements.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.780
So then if we wanted
to make an intervention

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.480
at any number of levels--
at an institutional level,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.326
at a departmental level, at a
school level, individual level,

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:01.950
what would that
intervention look like?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.760
In the end, no matter what kind
of intervention you think of,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.280
the quality of the teaching
comes down to the choices

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.770
that instructors make.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.710
Before and during each course
or a learning opportunity,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.840
whether it's short or
long, online, residential,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.400
the instructor has
to make decisions,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.240
they've got to do things.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.360
They've got to figure
out what the syllabus is,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.870
they get to decide what
the assignments are going

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.453
to be, and to think
about what they're

00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:32.990
going to do when
they're actually

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.870
in the context with learners.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.040
They're designing an
experience, and that experience

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.860
is supposed to have
lasting effects.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.040
It's supposed to result in
new knowledge, new skills.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.470
It's occasionally thought that
it should be transformative,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.220
and that's a lot of
responsibility for instructors.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.650
As so many have said,
even today, not all

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.860
are given explicit training
in the kinds of things

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.780
that they feel like
they need to be equipped

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.020
to take on that responsibility.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.600
You'd think given that
most of our instructors

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.450
are academic, that if they had
questions about how to approach

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.209
that, they would go
to the literature

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.640
and they would try to figure
out what the literature says

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.060
and the evidence says
about how to teach well.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.160
So it's kind of
interesting and surprising

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.800
that it seems rare that
that's what happens,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.700
that people go to
the literature.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.550
That brings us to the question
we're exploring today.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.314
Does implementing the
science of learning

00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:38.480
advance the art of teaching?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.315
Does it?

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:40.940
I think there are
questions when people

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.940
are trying to decide whether
to go to the literature.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.470
Does it improve learning?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.720
What is the science of learning?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.970
Where are the boundaries
of the science of learning?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.290
Does it translate to practice?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.532
When does it
translate to practice?

00:04:54.532 --> 00:04:56.240
So in preparation for
today's conference,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.980
we had a number of lunches
and dinners with faculty.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.630
And we used a
particular provocation

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.040
to try to get
conversation going,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.030
and that provocation
was an example

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.820
of a university that
was intentionally

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.690
built around evidence--

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.510
science of learning
and other evidence.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.960
And Stephen Kosslyn, who you'll
hear from, and other colleagues

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.700
that he worked with,
use the science

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.220
of learning to design both the
curriculum and the pedagogy

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.580
for Minerva.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.140
They wrote about their work
in a book called Building

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.490
the Intentional University.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.290
And we used that
book and the ideas

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.090
in that book as the provocation
for these lunches and dinners.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.180
Senator Bob Kerrey wrote
a forward for the book,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.470
and you'll see that that's why
we have this upcoming keynote

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.050
panel.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.510
The book in the
ideas in the book

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.790
really did work
as a provocation.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.050
Sparks flew in some of
these dinners and lunches--

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.710
mostly the dinners-- where
there were heated words

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.790
that were exchanged.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.400
Maybe it was the good wine.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.400
People said things
about the Minerva model

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.750
that I hope Stephen will take
as evidence that the challenge

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.040
really was taken--

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.780
as a challenge and
felt as a challenge.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.200
There were some things
said like, Minerva,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.280
it's just creepy.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.210
It's reductionist.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.470
Hyperrational.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.450
Hyper-Instrumental.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.850
Killer of the magic.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.360
Someone called
someone else an SOB.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.178
Affectionately, I'm sure.

00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:41.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.720
Some faculty suggested that
the intentional science

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.330
of learning approach is
only good for some learning

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.200
contexts.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.700
That the reduction
of uncertainty

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.216
may be appropriate for learning
some kinds of material,

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:53.465
but not all kinds of material.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.690
For some kinds of material,
many of these people--

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.860
mostly humanists-- said,
the goal is to cultivate

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.700
and engaged out.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.350
Being too intentional
is an example

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.140
of what Wordsworth would
call, we murder to dissect.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.800
Others, of course, were fans
of the intentional approach,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.760
and wanted to know more about
the science of learning,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.700
wanted to be able to take the
conversation of the dinner

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.320
and what was in the
book into the classroom.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.990
And a lot of those
were scientists.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.700
I hope that there
are people with all

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.050
of those views in this room, and
that we can have today candid

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.290
discussion, respectful
debate, disagreements

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.640
about these issues.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.450
We have three goals for
these HILT conferences.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.570
One is to promote dialogue.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.730
And I mean real
dialogue, you know?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.680
Actually saying what
you think, getting

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.620
to a place where we are
moving the institution

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.832
or us as individuals along.

00:07:56.832 --> 00:08:00.420
The second goal is to provide
new examples, new approaches,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.620
new tools that can be
used in actual practice,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.930
teaching and learning practice.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.810
And the third is to extend the
network of Harvard students,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.000
faculty, academic,
professional staff--

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.690
for you all to meet one another.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.760
And we hope that you
will take the time

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.600
to meet people who are different
from you in their role,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.310
in their school, in
their discipline,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.640
and talk with them about
teaching and learning.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.770
The plenary is meant to
be the jumping-off point.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.110
Following the plenary
session, rather than

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.839
having a Q&amp;A here where my
observation-- probably yours--

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:38.380
is that you hear
from some people who

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.090
feel empowered to get up
and grab the microphone.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.380
We are instead going to have
these series of sessions

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.860
of unpacking the
plenary, and being

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.330
able to be in a more candid
discussion with Stephen

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.160
Kosslyn, Senator Kerrey, one
with some amazing faculty

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.090
around faculty issues,
and then with students

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.740
from their perspectives.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.350
And you'll see in the
program that there are

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.270
some more descriptors of those.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.940
Those Are meant to be candid,
they're not going to be taped.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.830
We want this to be an open
discussion that you have.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.630
The second breakout
sessions are meant

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.370
to be implementation workshops.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.220
To really be more concrete
and more workshop-focused.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.690
So to take some of the ideas
and think of them implemented

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.890
in a series of ways.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.500
Finally in the lunch plenary,
we come back as a community

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.250
and look backward and
forward with people

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.760
who have responsibility for
the next phase of this work.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.030
Provost Garber, new Vice Provost
for Advances in Learning Bharat

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.420
Anand, and moderated
by Dustin Tingley.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:57.560
And as you are thinking
about that forward-looking,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.210
backward-looking,
forward-looking, what

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.810
do we want to know for
this conversation with them

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.870
about pivoting to
what the next era is,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.430
you can send your questions
ahead of time or at anytime

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.740
during the day to
this Poll Everywhere.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.810
And I think there's
cards on the table that

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.430
has this information there too.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:28.830
So I'm going to kind
of pivot for a moment.

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:36.350
During one of those
dinners, a faculty member

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.860
asked me whether if I could,
if I were queen of the world,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.560
would I insist that all
Harvard instructors design

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.700
their pedagogy using
the science of learning.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.170
I've been mulling
this over, and I

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.380
keep finding myself using
this sort of elaborate analogy

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.680
to try to answer the question.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.490
The analogy is cooking for
a special dinner party.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.480
So I do realize that that
might sound frivolous.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.190
I actually really take eating
and cooking very seriously.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.380
Perhaps as seriously as I
take learning and teaching.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.350
And I have enjoyed
this analogy, so I

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.172
hope you'll indulge
me and let me

00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:18.380
kind of play it out with you.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.790
So imagine you're
hosting a dinner party

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:28.050
and you want to ensure that the
food is high quality, that it's

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.550
a great experience,
that it's memorable,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.300
that it stands the test of
time, that people might even

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.000
take things from that experience
and use it in other ways.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.670
It could, for example,
be a 50th birthday party,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.570
which I just had last weekend.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.460
For this, you can think of
these different elements.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.270
There's the food itself.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.670
It has a nutritional value.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.920
It can be high quality,
it can be low quality.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.080
Let's call that the
content of the course.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.160
This is really important.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.910
Any chef will tell you that
the quality of the food

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:11.040
is really important for whether
it's going to be a good meal.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.740
We here at Harvard
have a real luxury.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.160
We can actually afford
to do farm-to-table.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.940
We can take right from
the research and discovery

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.170
enterprise into the classroom.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.870
So then you have the eaters.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.600
They need to be able to digest
the food, and some of them

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.140
might have particular needs.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.200
You could have someone
who has celiac disease

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.610
and gets a rash from wheat.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.460
You could have
someone who just can't

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.780
stand the sight of raw fish.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.470
And you want to be able
to understand where

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.370
those eaters are, what
they need in order

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.370
to have a good quality
experience, just like you

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.960
need to for the students.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.730
Then there's the surround.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.770
The context, the table setting.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.130
And that can also have a big
impact on the experience.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.550
If you can't hear, for
example, as sometimes we

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.800
hear that people can't
in our classrooms

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.260
because the audio
isn't quite right,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.420
you can't have a
good experience.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.420
And the experience will
definitely disappoint.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.346
And now we get to the cooking.

00:13:19.346 --> 00:13:23.988
So let me ask you a question--
how many of you like to cook?

00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.910
Yeah.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.930
For those of you who cook,
whether you like to or not,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.120
raise your hand if
you prefer the kind

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.270
of baking version of cooking.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.030
You know, a recipe.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.060
OK, now raise your
hand if you prefer

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.400
the kind of throw in a
spice, figure something out,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.620
more resourceful.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.880
So it's about half and a half.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.040
And I wonder--

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.800
I mean, I wonder if there
is some correlation with how

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.950
you think about your learning or
you think about your teaching.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.350
So the point-- whether
following a recipe or not,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.500
you can have great
food or bland food.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.204
You can have an edible food.

00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:14.370
Whether you're using the
science of learning or not,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.530
you can have great teaching
or terrible teaching.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.950
Whether you cook from
recipes or intuitively,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.380
because you've been
eating all your life,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.340
you are drawing on a lot
of implicit knowledge,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.300
some of which is accurate
and some of which

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.230
actually biases the
way that you cook.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.994
Similarly, whether you're using
the science of learning or not,

00:14:33.994 --> 00:14:35.910
you are drawing on a lot
of implicit knowledge

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.360
from how you learned in
all of those classrooms

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.450
that you've been in, and some of
that is helpful and some of it

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.110
is not.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.460
It's like biasing the quality
of the teaching because of all

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.020
that you've
intuitively taken in.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.430
My opinion, to come
back to the question

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.180
that the faculty member asked
me, is that I wouldn't insist,

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.760
but I would certainly
recommend that you

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.690
use the science of learning.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.420
I mean, if you imagine
a cook, if they

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.115
learn the science of cooking,
it's not going to hurt them.

00:15:13.115 --> 00:15:14.490
It might take them
a little while

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.400
to implement what
they've learned

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.780
in a way that
feels more natural,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.000
but it can't hurt them.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.900
And I'd say similarly,
it is not going

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.890
to hurt you to understand
the science of learning

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.930
for your teaching.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.280
I am also incredibly
sure that using evidence

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.180
and doing so intentionally,
whether cooking or teaching,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.270
is better than going
through the motions.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.490
Unquestionably just
cooking like one's parents,

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.680
unquestionably just teaching
the way you were taught.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.220
And I think we've all been to
those kinds of dinner parties

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.560
and those kinds of
classes that you'd rather

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.020
not go back to or attend again.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.729
So finally before I
introduce the plenary,

00:15:55.729 --> 00:15:58.020
I want to come back to that
earlier question about what

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.250
is the science of learning?

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.700
There's not a single
discipline, and there

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.410
are these different strands.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.060
And some cognitive science,
neuroscience, education,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.110
psychology all makes sense.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.620
There's also different
kinds of methods.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.570
There are some that are more
sort of qualitative in nature,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.850
and then there are
random-controlled trials,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.680
and they result
in different kinds

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.530
of information and evidence.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.440
And some people would call some
of that science of learning

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.727
and some would not.

00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:31.560
So we could put the
boundaries in any number

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.070
of places around what the
science of learning is.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.240
There's also a kind
of movement that

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.892
encourages people to be
systematic in the inquiry

00:16:41.892 --> 00:16:43.850
in their own practice of
teaching and learning,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.430
in the scholarship of
teaching and learning.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.740
And there's a lot
of literature that

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.906
comes from the scholarship
of teaching and learning.

00:16:48.906 --> 00:16:50.730
And there are people
in this community who

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.310
are doing incredible work in
the scholarship of teaching

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.268
and learning, whether
they call it that or not.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.750
Like any interdisciplinary
evidence base,

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.420
a lot of people question what
generalizes and what doesn't.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.579
And it's easy to say, well
that wouldn't work here.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.540
That isn't important here,
whether the study was

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.369
done in a different
field or the study was

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.579
done in a different
school, and I frankly

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.220
think that's a kind of cop-out.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.069
I think you really have to pay
attention and think about it

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.220
and try things out for yourself,
and more information is always

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.880
going to be better than less.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.910
So we tried to figure out what
we should put in front of you

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.500
to sort of demonstrate
the science of learning.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.420
If you get your
programs out, you'll

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.230
see that there is a
table, a one-pager that

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:51.560
includes a whole bunch
of principles organized

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.460
in a kind of framework
around cognitive, behavioral,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.040
affective sort of principles.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.570
This is one framework.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.300
There are resources
that go with that.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.800
If you go to the HILT website--

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.980
by the way, HILT website redone.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.860
After years and years
and years of gathering

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.350
all of the teaching
and learning resources

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.930
that exist at this university,
the HILT website now

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.880
captures them--
perhaps imperfectly,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.925
but it is an amazing
place to go visit.

00:18:21.925 --> 00:18:23.800
And there are resources
there for the science

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.940
of learning that are
referenced in that table.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.270
There are books that have
done a pretty good job

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.559
of pulling all of this together
and making it operational.

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.850
And you can find them, I'm
sure, at your local teaching

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.280
and learning centers.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.870
The other thing I'll
just say is most

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.180
of these principles have
been around a very long time.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.460
This is not really new--

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.400
10, 15 years at least.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.610
And some of them is
just common sense.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.700
So they don't come
across as, wow, we're

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.680
really learning something
new when you look at them.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.590
But the research is good.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.310
They help people
learn better and more.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.570
And I'd say one of the
best, simple, short versions

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:12.650
of a principled
set of ideas that

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.340
are operational comes in
Stephen's book, The Intentional

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.880
University.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.730
And there's a chapter in
there on science of learning,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.110
and it includes 16 principles.
