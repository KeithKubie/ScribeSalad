00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.934
Ladies and gentlemen,
Liz Garbus.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.669
-Liz, welcome.
-(cheering, applause)

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:06.172
-Thank you.
-So, Liz...

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:08.541
So...

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:09.842
You saw that clip,
in that clip

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:12.178
that was New York Times 
reporter Maggie Haberman.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.013
-It was.
-She's one of the people

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.249
-you focus on
in this documentary. -Yes.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.317
Why would you focus on

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.420
a third-rate reporter
like Maggie Haberman?

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.422
(laughter)

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.092 line:0%
Uh, Maggie is an extraordinary
reporter and journalist.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.494 line:0%
She's kind of, you know,
one of the backbones

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.964 line:0%
of the White House team
reporting on this president.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:35.201
She's a very public face
for The New York Times. 

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.470
And she's also a mom, um,

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.405
and a person who works really,
really hard,

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.008
and was a person who I think
people could relate to.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.143
Could rel-- Well,
I can't relate to her.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.678
I'm just like Donald Trump.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.513
I've never heard
of Maggie Haberman.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.082
He doesn't talk to her,
apparently.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.450
-Never at all.
-Never talked to her.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.684
That was a setup phone call,
I'm assuming.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.919
Right, he's never met her.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.454
So let's back up here.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.389
You embedded with
The New York Times.

00:00:56.422 --> 00:01:00.159
Why would you want to follow
the failing New York Times?

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.361
I thought it was a good time to
kind of pull back the curtain

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.230
on how the sausage is made.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.798
Um, how-- you know,
it's incredible, you know.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.400
If you work at
The New York Times,

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.635
you're given so much information
every single day.

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:10.970
You get tips.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.339
If you put them out there,
they would be salacious.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.075
The process by which they
confirm and vet their stories

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.377
and before they put them in the
newspaper is pretty incredible,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.280
so, um, I thought it was
important to see that process.

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:23.883
Now, in watching this process,
you're watching them struggle--

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.952
which is one of the moments
that I like--

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.323
with how to cover the news as it
was changing in the Trump era.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.757
It was moving faster.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.392
They were figuring out ways
in which to change,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.395
basically, fundamentally,
how The New York Times works.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.131
What was that like?
What were you noticing?

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.499
The thing about the-- I mean,

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.933
the news cycle is relentless,
right?

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.802
And the competition-- I mean,
it seems to matter very,

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.704
very much to the people who work
in The New York Times

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.306
that they beat the
 Washington Post all the time.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.442
Um, and I mean,
really, by minutes, you know?

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.644
If, like, you get your alert
on your phone,

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.980
and it's The New York Times, 
and they've, like--

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.082
then The Washington Post one
comes, like, two minutes later--

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.017
Imagine them all high-fiving
each other.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.752
And, to you, you're still
getting the information.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.287
You're all good,
but it's very meaningful.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.755
And, you know, I like that,

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.323
'cause it means they care
about their work.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:06.893
But, kind of the drive
and the incessant pressure

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.629
to-to get out there,
to be first,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.531
but, also, to be right,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.299
which is the most
important thing of all.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.268
But that has shifted
even in the last year.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.836
I mean, Trump has changed
everything.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.404
-OG Trump, way to go.
-Yeah.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.506
But... but they do feel
this need

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.909
to-to get the news out
within minutes

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.777
-as opposed to within 24 hours.
-That's right.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.546
Did you notice that changing
the quality of the news?

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.914
I mean, it fundamentally has to.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.282
Well, you know,
what I think is ex--

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.616 line:0%
I mean, look,
everybody makes mistakes.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.185 line:0%
The New York Times
 makes mistakes, you know.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.320 line:0%
They generally own up to them.

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:36.422
-We call them out here
all the time. -I know.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.591
Some of them even aren't
mistakes until we call them out.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.626
That's right. You've discovered
so many mistakes.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.496
But in general, given the amount
of news that they put out,

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.032
like, you know, thousands
of stories every week,

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.467
they, basically, have been
getting them right.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.469
One of my favorite moments
was when you got

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:52.705
to watch them downsize.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.273
Oh. (laughs)

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:56.309
Okay, well, that wasn't
exactly downsizing.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.010
That was reorganizing.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.979
I like to think of it
as downsizing.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.614
Okay, there you go.
Okay, yeah.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.316
Tell me something
I already know.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.917
Something you already know.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.286
Well, one thing that I found was
when these Times journalists,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.055
when we'd go out in the world
with them, you know,

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.890
and they'd walk into a place
like CPAC--

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.558
your favorite place,
the conserv...

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.328
-Oh, it's so warm and so fun.
-Right, right.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.396
Best style in the world.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.931
So they love-- so you go to CPAC

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.499
and you're a New York Times
 journalist.

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.368
You introduce yourself as
someone from The Times,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.337
and people kind of react like...
(inhales through teeth)

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.938
"we're gonna stay away.”

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:27.607
After five minutes of talking,
they're like,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.508
"Eh, you're fine. I like you.”

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.611
And there is that connection
that happens when people realize

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.479
that those other people
that they've demonized

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.181
are just human.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.782
Could you think about that?

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.451
I think that is a,
that is a good lesson.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.487
So whatever you can do,
stay away.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.056
Okay. The Fourth Estate 
airs Sundays.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.692
All four parts are available now
on all Showtime platforms,

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.327
including On Demand
and streaming.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.895
Liz Garbus.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:50.830
The fight continues.
