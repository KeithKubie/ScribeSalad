00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
Sometimes we meet people who just don't like us.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.960
And, it may be our fault.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.440
You stabbed me!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.420
Or you may have done absolutely nothing wrong.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.380
No matter how much you want everyone to like you,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.060
some people just won't.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.460
Unless you're a magician...

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.060
everyone loves a magician.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.580
Do you want to see a magic trick?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.800
Sure.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.020
Close your eyes.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.480
But what is up with this constant need to be liked,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.120
even by people that we don't know?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.800
Yeah, can you have the delivery guy

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.300
tell me that...

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.620
I'm really funny?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.740
I get that humans are social creatures,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920
and evolution's kind of made us this way

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740
Ugh, insert religious comment war here.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.480
But you have to get to the point

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.300
where you just say, "fuck it."

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.620
I mean, I used to be a huge people pleaser.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600
And I would be so upset and hurt

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.180
when someone didn't like me!

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
And I would be like, "wait, it's just cause you don't know me!

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
You just need to know me to like me!"

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.720
And I'd try extra hard to be nice to them

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
and win them over.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.480
And it just turned out to be a giant fucking waste of time.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.400
Cause, unfortunately, once someone passes judgment on you,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.940
there's not much you can do about it.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.460
And as... *makes weird noise* as it sounds...

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.440
as long as you like who you are

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.840
and you love yourself...

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.940
that should be enough.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.260
Alright, well, I will see you guys next Monday.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.820
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Oh my god. I'm getting a little too buff.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.580
It's getting a little gross, I'd say.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.880
Oh my god!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.440
Oh my god, that's disgusting but really hot at the same time.
