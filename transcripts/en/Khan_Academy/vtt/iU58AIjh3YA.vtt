00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.280
In this video, I'm going to
use words like eras, periods,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.270
and ages to refer to
segments of time in the human

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.190
or in the pre-human past.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.330
And what I want to clarify
right from the get-go--

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.746
because frankly,
this is something

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.720
that's confused me in the past--
is that archaeologists will

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.429
refer to eras, periods,
and ages in the human past

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.970
and they're usually referring
to periods of tens of thousands

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.810
of years, or thousands of years.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.320
But these are different eras,
periods, and ages than the ones

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.369
that geologists would
refer to when they're

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.300
talking about geological time.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.750
In geological time, era means
several hundred millions

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.250
of years.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.010
Periods and ages mean
millions of years.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.460
When an archaeologist,
when we're

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.510
studying the human past,
this is just talking--

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.600
they're just generally
talking about long segments

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720
of human time, but not
in the millions of years,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.015
usually in the thousands or
the ten thousands of years.

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.890
So what I want to do
with that out of the way

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.150
is talk about what has happened
in the distant human past,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.900
or the distant
pre-human past, and also

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.620
touch on some of
the classifications

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.430
for these segments of time--
because they actually tell us

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.780
what were the interesting
developments that happened

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.910
to humanity over
the 200,000 years

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.600
that Homo sapiens have
been on this planet,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.790
or that we believe
that Homo sapiens have

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.610
been on this planet.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.210
So the longest period
of time in human past,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.340
or the category of
human time-- and there

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.881
are different ways
you can categorize

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.040
it-- is the Paleolithic
Era right over here.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.360
And what really makes
that period of time--

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.910
so this begins even in
prehistory or pre-human

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.620
history, so before
Homo sapiens even

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.370
existed-- you have the
beginning of the Paleolithic Era

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.480
that really began with the
development of stone tools.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.000
And as we learned in the
video on human evolution,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.490
there were pre Homo
sapiens species

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.760
that were using stone tools.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.280
And so the Paleolithic
Era, it's really

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.949
kind of signified by one, the
stone tools, but even more--

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.660
that either the
pre-humans-- or once

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.520
you go about 200,000 years
ago-- the humans show up.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.320
It's kind of
distinguished by humans

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.640
being hunter-gatherers, which
essentially means to survive,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.030
we used to walk around a lot.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.385
If we couldn't see something
obvious to hunt, maybe

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:31.760
a woolly mammoth or something,
if we didn't see something

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.590
obvious to hunt, we
would look around

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.750
for snails, or mushrooms,
or whatever else.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.130
And that's how we would survive.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.500
That's how we would live.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.980
And because we were constantly
adapting to our environment

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.800
based on the seasons, we
were maybe following animals

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.420
as they migrated,
hunter-gatherers

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.610
were fundamentally nomadic,
which means that they never

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.600
settled in one place
for a long time.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.700
They were always ready to pick
up-- probably their tents--

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.460
and follow the herd, or follow
whatever animals they were

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.712
hunting, or follow
the season, so they

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.170
could go to warmer
climates, maybe,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.910
where they're more likely to
find something on the ground

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.350
to eat, maybe,
during the winter.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.820
Or who knows.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.610
So the Paleolithic Era is
really distinguished by that.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.720
It's a huge swath of
time in human history.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.530
And it doesn't come
to an end until you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.300
get to the advent of farming.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.580
So the Paleolithic Era,
I mean, we're literally

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.700
talking about over
two million years ago

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.660
was when it starts--
before Homo sapiens even

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.390
existed as a species.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.330
And it goes all the way
to the advent of farming,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.010
that we believe first
came about around 11,000

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.930
to 7,000 years ago.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.910
And this abbreviation
right here, this BP,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.770
this does not stand
for British Petroleum.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.030
It stands for Before Present,
or before the present time.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.090
So one more acronym
to have in your tool

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.640
kit when you see things.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.460
And obviously, if we're 11,000
years before the present,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.120
that's the same thing as
9,000 years Before Christ,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.040
or Before the Common Era.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.100
Because Christ was, we
believe, born 2,000 years ago.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.810
Now, it may or may
not be obvious to you,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.790
but the advent of agriculture
is a super big deal, arguably

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.870
the biggest deal
in the development

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.385
of human civilization, or
in all of human history.

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:25.760
And you might say,
hey, you know,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.350
what's the big deal
about agriculture?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.310
These characters over
here look pretty happy.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.260
They're able to
walk around a lot.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.020
They're able to hunt.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.430
What's the big deal of
all of a sudden people

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.610
plowing fields, and
domesticating cattle,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.440
and having chickens to lay
eggs, and whatever else?

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.140
And the big deal about that--
besides the fact that it would

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860
change people's diet-- is
that for the first time,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.620
it allowed them
to not be nomadic.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.760
It allowed them to-- and
you could have probably

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.220
had some hunters who were
somewhat settled, maybe living

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.860
near the ocean.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.030
Maybe they did some
fishing, and all the rest.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.480
But for the most part, with
the development of agriculture,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.690
it forced people to
stay in one place.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.570
So you have the Paleolithic
Era all the way to the advent

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.520
of agriculture, which was about
11,000 to 7,000 years ago.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.750
And besides the fact that
it changed people's diet,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.310
it allowed them to settle.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.340
So agriculture
allowed human beings

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.100
to settle down in one area.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.590
And it wasn't just that they
were settling in one area,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.500
but because they were able to
control their environment, they

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.920
were able to increase
the density of things,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.390
of crops that humans
could consume,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.680
and animals that humans
could consume-- and lower

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.070
the density of crops that
humans can't consume,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.400
and animals that
they can't consume,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.390
or that they don't want around,
like pests of some type.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.970
What it allowed
them to do is also

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.250
settle in more
dense environments.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.680
You can imagine when you just
have people walking around,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.650
you need a lot of
land to support

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.330
even the calorie requirements
of one human being.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.945
But all of a sudden, if you are
able to develop agriculture,

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.610
you're able to
domesticate animals.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.150
All of a sudden you could have--
in the same amount of land,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.717
you could have more
calories being generated.

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:11.800
And because you have more
calories being generated

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.130
in a smaller amount of
land, people can settle.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.440
And they can settle in
a denser environment.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.830
And so agriculture was really
this necessary requirement

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.300
for people to
develop civilization,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.030
or to develop
villages and cities.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.420
And maybe also giving
them the free time

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.000
to start thinking
about hey, maybe we

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.800
want to think about how we
can record what we know,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.410
how we can develop
even more technologies.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.740
And so just to give us a
sense of the categorization

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.220
that an archaeologist would
use for these different periods

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.303
of time-- I told you we
start with the Paleolithic

00:06:47.303 --> 00:06:49.370
Era, with the advent
of stone tools,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.200
pre-humans-- most of
human time on this planet.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.480
And then about 11,000 years ago,
the development of agriculture.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.590
And it developed independently
at different places

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.890
around the world,
which is by itself

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.060
an interesting phenomenon.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.634
And people think that it might
just be that be the climate

00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:06.050
might have warmed
up a little bit,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.633
so that people--
maybe naturally there

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:09.860
were some human
edible crops that

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.860
existed in a little bit
of a denser environment,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.040
and humans learned to
optimize that slowly,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.540
and they did that independently.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.360
But it's an interesting
question of why

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.130
did it develop just then
after 180,000, 190,000 years,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.486
why did agriculture
all of a sudden happen?

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:25.860
But just to get
the terminology--

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.440
the Paleolithic Era is that
period before agriculture.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.910
And then once agriculture
starts developing,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.740
we are now in the Neolithic Era.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.990
And some archaeologists will
describe a transition period

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.500
between the Paleolithic
and the Neolithic Era

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.870
called the Mesolithic.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.360
And just so you know what
these words mean-- because they

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.401
actually make sense when
you know what they mean,

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:55.250
paleo means old and lithic
means stone, or of stone.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.910
So they're really talking
about the Old Stone Age.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.240
Neolithic, as you could
imagine, means new stone.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.400
So it's kind of
the New Stone Age.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.600
And meso means middle.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.910
So it is the Middle Stone Age.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.400
So another way of thinking
about this whole period

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.150
from when people
were hunter-gatherers

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.240
all the way to about
11,000 to 7,000 years ago

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.100
when they developed
agriculture-- this whole period

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.270
is called the Stone Age.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.630
And the Stone Age
is this biggest age.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.750
And there's just different
ways of describing it,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.559
because if you just
call it the Stone Age

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.980
you're really making importance
out of the actual tools

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.750
that people could shape.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.070
They weren't able to
use metal at this point.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.480
When you refer to
Paleolithic and Neolithic,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.911
you're maybe referring
a little bit more--

00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:47.660
and there's other ways
to think about it--

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.750
but you're referring
a little bit more

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.690
to the lifestyles of
the human beings--

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.160
Paleolithic being
hunter-gatherers,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.850
Neolithic having actually
settled, having actually

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.460
started to develop primitive
villages, and even cities.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.280
And then of course
Mesolithic is in between.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.590
And just for a pop
culture reference,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.830
you might have heard
of the Paleolithic diet

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.722
that some people
are going on now.

00:09:12.722 --> 00:09:15.180
And those are people who try
to live like hunter-gatherers.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.380
Their belief is that
most of human evolution

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.550
occurred while we
were hunter-gatherers,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.770
and so that's what our bodies
are most accustomed to.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.720
So they like to eat meat.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.910
And they like to
eat a lot of nuts.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.530
And I even met, I
had a coworker once

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.000
who used to only eat raw meat.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.791
And I don't know if
that is even justified,

00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:34.980
or that's even somehow validated
by the archaeological record.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.520
These people probably
did cook their meat.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.730
Now, at the end
of the Stone Age,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.930
we would have, I would say,
the number two most significant

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.200
development in human history.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.800
And now we're talking
about 3,000 BC,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.260
which is about 5,000 years ago.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.060
And this is the
development of writing.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.610
So we were hunter-gatherers
about 9,000 to 10,000,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.100
11,000 years ago.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.785
People started
developing agriculture.

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:04.962
It allows them to settle
in more dense environments.

00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:06.920
It also gives them a
little bit more free time,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.390
because they don't have to
hunt and gather all the time.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.500
And then you go and once again,
we'll probably discover things

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.950
as we go forward in time
that maybe these dates need

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.570
to be pushed back,
or whatever else,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.950
or we discover new
civilizations, or who knows.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.730
But our best sense is
you have these villages.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.790
You have these
civilizations developing.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.600
And by about 5,000 years
ago-- so this would be 5,000

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.319
before the present, or 3,000
BC-- Before Christ-- you

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:34.860
have people saying,
hey, why don't we

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.230
start trying to write down what
we know so that when I tell

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.190
someone orally, it doesn't
actually lose information

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.690
there?

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.520
And then so our
descendants can slowly

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.160
collect all of the
knowledge we have,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.910
and maybe accelerate-- I don't
know if they did it explicitly

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.550
thinking of these, but let's
just write down what we know.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.880
And so at about
that period of time,

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.910
you have-- as far as we can
tell-- the first development

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.910
of a pictogram-based
system of writing.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.080
And the earliest system
of writing we know

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.210
is cuneiform, which is from the
Sumerian civilization, which

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.100
is now in present-day Iraq.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.120
And what's the really
big deal about this

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.510
is that this is, on some
level, the beginning

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.109
of recorded history.

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:17.650
We could talk about
the word history.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.340
You could say that history
is all of the past,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.090
and we could use the
archaeological record

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.050
to figure out
stuff before people

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.559
started to write things down.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.350
But when they started
to write things down,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.183
now it was recorded.

00:11:29.183 --> 00:11:31.340
Now we're actually
getting actual accounts

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.760
of what people know, of
actual people's knowledge.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.681
And the reason why this is a
big deal-- I mean agriculture,

00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.180
hopefully you now appreciate
that it was a pretty big deal--

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.180
but the reason why
writing was a big deal,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.550
is that now civilization
could collect its knowledge.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.420
And it could build upon it
generation after generation,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.680
without having to worry
about people forgetting it,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.070
or information getting
distorted verbally

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.320
from ancestor to descendant.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.760
And with that, you also have
the beginning of the Bronze Age.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.330
And the Bronze Age
is kind of known

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.970
for this beginning of--
even though it's referring

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.630
to a material, which
comes from the first time

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.930
that people started
using bronze as a tool,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.430
or using bronze for their
tools, and for their weapons--

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.880
and bronze, it's a
mixture of mostly copper

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.190
and a little bit of tin.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.196
But the Bronze Age--
at least in my mind--

00:12:20.196 --> 00:12:22.820
the biggest deal of what started
at the beginning of the Bronze

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.200
Age really, really
was the writing.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.880
So once again, just as a
review, because I actually,

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.020
I find this kind of confusing--
our current understanding,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.380
most of human prehistory,
and even pre-human prehistory

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.110
were spent as hunter-gatherers
using stone tools,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.380
until about 11,000 years ago.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.800
And then we became a
little bit more settled.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.360
We became farmers essentially,
using stone tools.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.550
And then you fast forward
another about 5,000,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.930
6,000 years.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.840
And then we started
to become farmers

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.580
who started to write down
the things that we knew.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.070
And we started to
use bronze tools.
