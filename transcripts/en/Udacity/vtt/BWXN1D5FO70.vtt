00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.819
The arrow should point to the right.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.040
We can check this by picking a number on
the right or the left side of the number

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.750
line, plugging it in for x, and
seeing if it's a true statement.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.004
If I pick 1 and plug it in for x, and

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:19.780
write 1 is less than or equal to 2,
that's a true statement.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.440
1 is part of the solution set.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.630
So the arrow should go to the right.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.757
If instead I had picked 3 and
written 3 is less than or

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:32.073
equal to 2,
that is not a true statement.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:36.340
3 is not part of the solution set and
it should not be covered by the line.
