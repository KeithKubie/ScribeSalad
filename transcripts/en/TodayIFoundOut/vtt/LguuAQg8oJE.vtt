00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.270
Probably not, although anecdotal evidence
shows it has a strong correlation with stupidity.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.770
What it may do is cause vomiting, vertigo,
confusion, drowsiness, breathing difficulties,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.950
burning in the esophagus, sore throat, weakness,
and diarrhea, even when ingested in small

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.400
amounts; in larger portions, it can cause
loss of consciousness, internal hemorrhaging,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.460
convulsions and death (from circulatory failure
and/or damage to vital organs).

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.590
To address the question at hand a little more
specifically, although vision loss is a potential

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.190
symptom of gasoline poisoning, complete vision
loss doesn’t appear to be a common consequence

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.130
for those who ingest it, unlike many of the
aforementioned symptoms.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.649
Although, you will experience complete vision
loss when you die.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.720
So, in that sense- yes, drinking gasoline
can cause you to go permanently blind.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.310
And just for reference, it doesn’t take
much swallowed gasoline to kill you- just

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.680
half an ounce can cause severe intoxication
for adults and even death for small children.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.680
A 12 ounce drink of gasoline will often be
fatal to most humans.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.230
Despite these dangers, however, a brave few
have overcome their (rational) fear of gasoline’s

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.880
toxicity and, instead, developed a powerful
addiction to petrol.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.770
In 2011, it was reported that 71-year-old
Chen Dejun, of Chongqing, China, has been

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340
drinking gasoline for over 40 years.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.590
According to one report, in 1969 when Chen
picked up his habit (based on a folk remedy),

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
kerosene was the elixir of choice; adapting
to the times, he later switched to gasoline,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.689
and in 2011, he was supposedly imbibing nearly
one gallon each month (about 4 ounces per

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.689
day).

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.960
A couple of years earlier, it was reported
that a 14-year-old boy from the Sichuan province

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.840
in China was struggling with a 5-year habit.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.119
Born from a desire to turn into a Transformer,
the boy’s addiction began with drinking

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.340
the butane out of cigarette lighters, but
soon progressed into siphoning gasoline from

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.230
the family’s motorcycle and sipping on that.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.340
Although the boy’s parents state that his
habit is up to nearly 3 quarts a day, experts

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.870
highly doubt that claim.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.560
Regardless of the amount, the addiction has
had a devastating effect on the child who,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.450
before the habit, was “a very smart boy,”
but now “he doesn’t [even] know seven

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.480
plus 17.”

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.700
In 2012, one episode of TLC’s My Strange
Addiction told the story of 20-year-old Shannon

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
who drank up to two ounces each day.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700
Describing the flavor as “sweet and sour,
like a tangy sauce,” Shannon also noted

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700
that although it burns the back of her throat,
it also “makes me feel good.”

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700
More recently, a 45-year old UK man, Brian
Taylor, was arrested for drinking petrol despite

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.349
the fact that he was under an anti-social
behavior order (ASBO) prohibiting him from

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.930
going near gasoline pumps.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.030
Apparently, his first gasoline-related run-in
with the authorities happened in 2005, when

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.970
he was found to have stolen fuel 51 times,
to drink, after which, “bug-eyed and ruddy

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:03.680
faced,” he would dance “a little jig while
high on 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.650
the fumes.”

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.940
Of course, not everyone who drinks gasoline
does it on purpose, although that doesn’t

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.990
mean they don’t pay a heavy price.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.790
In February 2012, 43-year-old, Gary Allen
Banning of Havelock, North Carolina, accidentally

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.620
drank a bit of gasoline when he mistook a
jar of liquid that was sitting out on his

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.670
friend’s counter for a palatable beverage.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.459
Wisely, he immediately spit it out before
much was ingested.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.209
Unwisely, sometime later that evening, he
went outside, stuck a cigarette in his mouth

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.400
and attempted to light it, at which point
he burst into flames.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.709
You see, he hadn’t changed his shirt and
had spilled the gasoline all over it after

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.709
his swig.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.720
Medics rushed him to the hospital and later
to the UNC Burn Center, but due to the severity

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.379
of the burns, he died early the next day.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.610
For his valiant effort to protect humanity’s
collective gene pool by sacrificing his life,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.959
Gary Allen Banning was nominated for a Darwin
Award in 2012.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.269
Methanol, like gasoline, is also highly toxic,
as one of Gary’s fellow nominees in 2012

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.269
discovered.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.970
Employed as a truck washer for a Canadian
liquor store chain, the nominee (hereinafter,

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.620
Vodka Bob) had developed a bad habit of stealing
the hooch hidden by truck drivers in the cabs

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.910
of their vehicles.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.340
On the fateful day, he discovered a vodka
bottle, although it was filled with a light

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.370
blue liquid.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.500
Somehow forgetting that windshield washer
fluid is also blue (and often stored in vehicles),

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.950
Vodka Bob began swigging the toxic liquid.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.110
Seemingly, he never realized that the wiper
fluid was not intended for human consumption

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.919
because he kept ingesting it for the next
two days.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.979
Ultimately “he died in the hospital from
methanol poisoning.”

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.770
Weirder still, the 2007 Darwin Award winner
was Texas Mike, an alcoholic who preferred

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.360
rectal drinking, i.e., giving himself alcohol
enemas.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.010
On the eve of his death, Mike poured more
than 100 ounces of sherry “right up the

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.010
old address.”

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.229
A significant amount to imbibe over a long
period of time, when taken all at once it

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.170
caused Mike to pass out; however, because
it was all still resting in his intestines,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.720
his body continued to absorb it.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.539
Consequently, he died from alcohol poisoning
with a blood alcohol content of 0.47% (in

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.240
many states, at .08% you are considered legally
drunk).

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.370
In response to this tragic story, the Darwin
Awards’ kindly readers posted many words

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.960
of sympathy including “takes shit-faced
to a whole new level,” “drunk off my ass,”

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
“rectum?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.060
Hell no it killed him,” “up the hatch,”
and “a drop never touched his lips.”

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.970
And if you’re wondering, this same type
of thing is why vaporized alcohol inhalation

00:05:26.970 --> 00:06:08.919
can be extremely dangerous.
