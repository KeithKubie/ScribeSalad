00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:02.831
- [Voiceover] If x and y are integers,

00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:05.854
seven is less than y is less than 16,

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:08.131
and x over y is equal to 2/5,

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:12.322
how many possible values are there for x?

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:15.147
So x and y have to be integers,

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:18.445
and y is greater than
seven and less than 16.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.537
So let's, before we even
think about this constraint

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.040
right over here and this constraint,

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.501
if we just had this
constraint right over here,

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:27.189
what are the possible values for y?

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.686
Well, y is an integer greater than seven,

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:34.157
so let's see, it would
be eight, nine, 10, 11,

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:38.894
12, 13, 14, 15,

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:41.979
and it can't be equal to 16
so we'll stop right over here.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.544
So just with that constraint,
here are all our candidate ys.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.286
Now they're saying x
over y is equal to 2/5,

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:50.229
or another, let me just rewrite that.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.385
So they're saying x
over y is equal to 2/5,

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.925
or if you multiply both sides by y,

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:59.998
you get x is equal to 2/5y.

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:02.784
Now, if x is equal to 2/5y,

00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:06.221
so over here you would
have eight times 2/5.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:07.873
So let me write this down.

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:10.422
So these are our possible ys,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.065
and then our possible xs,

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.049
eight times 2/5.

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:18.877
Now is this thing right over
here going to be an integer?

00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:21.068
Remember, x and y need to be integers.

00:01:21.068 --> 00:01:23.801
Well no, eight isn't divisible by five.

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:26.784
Eight times two is 16, 16
isn't divisible by five.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:29.260
And so this is not going to be an integer.

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:33.198
Is nine times 2/5, is that
going to be an integer?

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.462
No, nine isn't divisible by five.

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:37.181
I think you start to see a pattern here.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.578
10 times 2/5, is that
going to be an integer?

00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:41.653
Sure!

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.081
10 is divisible by five.

00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.745
10 divided by five is two,

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:47.601
10 divided by five is two, times two,

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.509
this is equal to four.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.908
So this is a possible value for x,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.795
and frankly this is a possible value,

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.039
this is a possible value for y,

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.535
if we assume that they
both have to be integers.

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:02.352
And so we don't have to test all of these,

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:03.103
we just say,

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:05.444
"Look, which of these are
also divisible by five?"

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:07.360
Well, 10 is divisible by five,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.540
and 15 is divisible by five.

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:12.796
None of these other ones
are divisible by five.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.192
So if y is 15,

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:16.103
we don't even have to
know what the value is,

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.947
we could say x is going
to be 15 times 2/5,

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.579
which is 15 divided by five is three,

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.375
times two which is six.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.017
So there are two possible values,

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:30.236
there are two possible values for x.
