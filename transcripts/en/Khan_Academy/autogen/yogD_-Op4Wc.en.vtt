00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:03.636
 Let us recall what Napoleon was doing, 

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.515
 before entering into the Third Coalition war, 

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:10.436
 with which Napoleon is truly established 

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.189
 as a dominant figure in Europe. 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:19.453
 So - in 1799. he takes power. 

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.183
 At first with two more consuls, 

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:23.900
 but then self-proclaimed for First Consul. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.572
 And so he takes power. 

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:29.702
 He gets first - I will write it in capital letters - 

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:35.270
 First Consul. 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.572
 Then in 1802, but before we reached 1802, 

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.673
 let me tell you what he did in 1800. 

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.705
 In 1800, when he took power, 

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.521
 the Second Coalition's war is still under way. 

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.364
 We have discussed this briefly. Napoleon, or rather 

00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:50.390
 France, losing positions, losing a lot 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.357
 of what has already been won at the First Coalition with Italy. 

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:55.633
 The Austrians return it. 

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:59.568
 That is why Napoleon decides to borrow and cross the Alps. 

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:00.938
 Here's his picture. 

00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:04.449
 This is Napoleon, who crosses the Alps. 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.605
 It crosses the Alps. 

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:12.503
 He leads troops through the Alps to return 

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:16.723
 what he thought he had to regain from Austria. 

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:18.643
 And in the last video tutorial we learned 

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:22.109
 how did the First Coalition finish? 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:31.747
 So in 1800. he returns or goes back to Italy. 

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:39.859
 He pulls out to bring Italy back. 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.373
 When we talk about Italy, 

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:43.122
 it's about the kingdom of Italy, 

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:44.498
 which was northern Italy. 

00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:46.287
 We are not talking about the Neapolitan Kingdom, 

00:01:46.287 --> 00:01:49.286
 which was in the south of Ethiopia. Nor for the papal states. 

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:51.986
 Actually let me show you this. 

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.767
 If we get down here. 

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.967
 You will see that when people speak of the Kingdom of Italy 

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:57.892
 at that time, they actually talk 

00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:01.300
 for this region here above, which is in northern Italy. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.032
 And Papal states are here. 

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.044
 And the Neapolitan Kingdom is down here. 

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:08.713
 Compared to modern Europe, the two countries, 

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:10.315
 which we associate with today's Europe and which 

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:14.128
 did not exist in a unified form at the beginning of the 19th century. 

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:15.979
 are Italy and Germany. 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.300
 They were fragmented 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.305
 of many kingdoms. 

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.120
 And as I have already mentioned, Germany from that time, 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.373
 this confederation of kingdoms 

00:02:23.373 --> 00:02:26.456
 was called the Holy Roman Empire, 

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:30.234
 in which the Austrian king was called ... he wore the title 

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:31.772
 Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. 

00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:33.753
 But he is not actually a horse ... 

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:37.885
 has not controlled the Holy Roman Empire 

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:40.758
 in a centralized manner. 

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:45.090
 It is actually controlled by several smaller kingdoms. 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.084
 Anyway, let's go back to Napoleon. 

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:51.623
 Here he crossed the Alps in 1800. 

00:02:51.623 --> 00:02:54.117
 This ends when he returns the captured. 

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.360
 He defeated Austria. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.120
 And this is basically the end of the Second Coalition. 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.688
 That's what we learned in the latest video tutorial. 

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:03.604
 In 1801. we have the contract from Lunaville. 

00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:09.777
 End of the Second Coalition. 

00:03:09.777 --> 00:03:11.606
 There is no contract with Britain until next year 

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.602
 just because of exhaustion. 

00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:16.224
 But that is irrelevant - it was a very short-term contract. 

00:03:16.224 --> 00:03:20.229
 And then, in 1802, 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.332
 before we start talking about the Third Coalition, 

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:36.502
 Napoleon is pushing the Constitution to the tenth year. 

00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:37.937
 Why do we say the tenth year? 

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:40.614
 You remember that they had written a new, revolutionary calendar. 

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:42.742
 That's why - because of the revolutionary calendar 

00:03:42.742 --> 00:03:45.876
 this was the tenth year of the revolution. 

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:50.145
 But most important from Napoleon's point of view 

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:52.621
 is the first. He says: 

00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:55.475
 "The French people point out, and the Senate proclaims 

00:03:55.475 --> 00:04:00.218
 Napoleon Bonaparte for First Consul to Life. 

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:06.149
 First Consul to Life. 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.561
 If you think, you will understand that 

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:14.330
 Napoleon is given a status similar to King, 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.060
 in view of the fact that ... 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.757
 black white is recorded, 

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:22.260
 that he will rule France for the rest of his life. 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.066
 Then we reach 1803. 

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.263
 But before 1803, 

00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:26.927
 remember what's happening at the same time here. 

00:04:26.927 --> 00:04:31.793
 We have the revolution in Haiti, 

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:37.927
 the Haitian revolution, 

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:39.995
 which - if you remember the video lessons, 

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.229
 Haiti was 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.811
 the most profitable enslaved colony in the world. 

00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:48.062
 As the slaves rebelled and received their freedom, 

00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:52.260
 it was no longer so profitable for France, 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.396
 as it was before. 

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:55.290
 And do not forget that the whole French Revolution begins, 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.462
 because France is free of steam. 

00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:59.663
 That's why Napoleon is trying to regain slavery. 

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:01.813
 Which generally returns to him. 

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:04.336
 Desalin and the other revolutionaries 

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.979
 learn about it and start it 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.233
 to oppose Lukler even more. 

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:16.060
 Leclerk and the French occupiers 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.335
 are ruined by yellow fever, 

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:20.942
 and Desalin is a very aggressive general. 

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:22.665
 That's why he's starting to lose Haiti. 

00:05:22.665 --> 00:05:24.194
 We also have Rochambo, 

00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:26.225
 if you remember it from those video tutorials - he's an extremely brutal figure 

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.534
 and takes on Leclerk. 

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:30.954
 So we have a revolution in Haiti. 

00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:31.953
 And in a sense it can be said, 

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:35.004
 that they are starting to lose Haiti. 

00:05:35.004 --> 00:05:38.010
 They lose Haiti. 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.409
 And at the same time - the year 1802, 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.366
 with the entrance in 1803. 

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:48.011
 Napoleon begins to realize, 

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:52.264
 that Britain controls the seas. 

00:05:52.264 --> 00:06:02.684
 Britain has a dominant military fleet. 

00:06:02.684 --> 00:06:04.233
 And as they begin to lose Haiti, 

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.182
 your primary source of income, 

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:08.367
 but Britain dominates, 

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.100
 Napoleon generally renounces North America. 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:23.302
 So Napoleon gives up North America. 

00:06:23.302 --> 00:06:25.365
 Outside of Haiti, 

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:27.896
 which is the main source of income for the French Empire, 

00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:30.260
 also had the territory of Louisiana, 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.698
 which is generally the average 1/3 

00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:35.517
 from what we call the United States today. 

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:37.313
 And Napoleon decides - 

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.176
 Britain has a dominant fleet, 

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:41.274
 I give up Haiti, 

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:44.598
 anyway, Desalin would probably take it away, 

00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:46.768
 why not give up straight across the continent. 

00:06:46.768 --> 00:06:50.513
 If I do not sell Louisiana or Britain, 

00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:54.164
 or the US will probably be in a good position 

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.891
 to take it away from me. 

00:06:55.891 --> 00:07:06.452
 So he decides to sell Louisiana. 

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.897
 For me as an American 

00:07:08.897 --> 00:07:12.164
 and an American born in Louisiana, 

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:13.366
 the chain of events that led to this, 

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.564
 is absolutely amazing. 

00:07:15.564 --> 00:07:16.544
 Because when you know about it 

00:07:16.544 --> 00:07:17.635
 from the point of view of America, 

00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:18.964
 you're just saying - Hey God, Thomas Jefferson 

00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:21.300
 has bought Louisiana for $ 15 million. 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.117
 Why someone will suddenly come to him 

00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:25.454
 to sell this vast territory? 

00:07:25.454 --> 00:07:28.299
 And the reason is that Napoleon has realized, 

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.944
 that he or she will probably lose it anyway. 

00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:31.964
 Britain has an unbeatable fleet. 

00:07:31.964 --> 00:07:33.300
 And at the same time he had nothing, 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.718
 to protect them in these areas. 

00:07:35.718 --> 00:07:39.033
 Another valuable asset was Haiti. 

00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:42.448
 The combination of Britain and its fleet 

00:07:42.448 --> 00:07:46.119
 and the Haitian slaves' uprising have led to this 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.304
 The United States to succeed 

00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:52.355
 what is today the average 1/3 of the continent. 

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.589
 You probably think, "Well, if they had never done it, 

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:56.432
 if they ever managed to ever conquer 

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:59.479
 the entire west coast? " 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.823
 It is these little things in history, 

00:08:01.823 --> 00:08:03.898
 although not necessarily small, 

00:08:03.898 --> 00:08:05.308
 but they lead you to 

00:08:05.308 --> 00:08:09.106
 huge changes in our modern world. 

00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:10.058
 But it is enough for that. 

00:08:10.058 --> 00:08:12.311
 And so he sells Louisiana. 

00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:14.452
 Britain dominates with its fleet. 

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.206
 At first Napoleon thinks 

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:19.976
 to build troops here 

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:22.736
 and attack the United Kingdom. 

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.476
 But he realizes, 

00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:25.766
 that Britain's fleet is unbeatable. 

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.309
 And I think 

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:28.911
 Britain begins to feel a little confident, 

00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:31.388
 and she does not like what benefits Napoleon has 

00:08:31.388 --> 00:08:34.168
 in the last two wars. 

00:08:34.168 --> 00:08:38.898
 And so Britain declared war in 1803. 

00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:45.005
 in May 1803. 

00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:46.544
 Great Britain or otherwise 

00:08:46.544 --> 00:08:48.310
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.306
 the same thing is. 

00:08:50.306 --> 00:08:54.307
 The United Kingdom declares war. 

00:08:54.307 --> 00:08:55.634
 You can accept this 

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:58.166
 such as the beginning of the Third Coalition war. 

00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.385
 But it is not yet a coalition. 

00:08:59.385 --> 00:09:02.636
 Only the United Kingdom is. only UK. 

00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:06.101
 And it really became hot in 1805. 

00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:10.286
 In 1805. everyone else jumps. 

00:09:10.286 --> 00:09:12.977
 Now we are talking about a real coalition. 

00:09:12.977 --> 00:09:26.421
 Austria and Russia join the UK. 

00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:27.517
 And as you know Austria all the time, 

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:28.831
 in each of these coalitions, 

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.624
 lost territories at the expense of France and, above all, of Napoleon. 

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:33.956
 They just seek revenge. 

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:35.712
 Britain in a sense feels this - 

00:09:35.712 --> 00:09:37.757
 they control the waters, they also seek revenge. 

00:09:37.757 --> 00:09:40.355
 And Russia does not like this champion Napoleon. 

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:42.782
 And so they all get involved. 

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.991
 There are two interesting corners 

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:47.748
 of the Third Coalition war. 

00:09:47.748 --> 00:09:49.946
 Let me write it down. 

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:52.503
 This is the Third Coalition. 

00:09:52.503 --> 00:09:53.541
 It includes other, 

00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:55.825
 but these are the great powers. 

00:09:55.825 --> 00:10:02.170
 This is the Third Coalition. 

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.910
 And the first thing that happens, 

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.439
 or actually two things that happen at the same time - 

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:16.435
 in October 1805. the French navy is destroyed 

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:18.441
 from the British at the Battle of Trafalgar. 

00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:21.638
 This is Trafalgar here - here it is written. 

00:10:21.638 --> 00:10:23.729
 Trafalgar. 

00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:27.386
 Destroyed by Napoleon's good old friend 

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:31.638
 Admiral Horatio Nelson. 

00:10:31.638 --> 00:10:34.617
 This type was definitely a thorn in Napoleon's eyes. 

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:37.663
 Horatio Nelson 

00:10:37.663 --> 00:10:43.450
 He defeats the ships of Napoleon in the battle of the Nile, 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.870
 after which the troops were scattered in Egypt. 

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.860
 And now he comes and generally destroys 

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.182
 the French Navy in the Battle of Trafalgar. 

00:10:52.182 --> 00:10:54.570
 Here's a picture of the battle. 

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.455
 The only reassurance for Napoleon 

00:10:58.455 --> 00:11:00.867
 from this battle it was, 

00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.258
 that to the end 

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:06.566
 Horatio Nelson is hit by a bullet 

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:14.361
 and he died at Trafalgar. 

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:17.242
 And it really cemented the royal fleet, 

00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:19.901
 the UK fleet, which is already dominant 

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:22.041
 and defeats the French fleet, 

00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:23.263
 which was the only fleet, 

00:11:23.263 --> 00:11:26.103
 with which it could have measured its strength in some way. 

00:11:26.103 --> 00:11:27.974
 The defeat at Trafalgar 

00:11:27.974 --> 00:11:31.016
 really cemented British domination over the seas. 

00:11:31.016 --> 00:11:34.119
 This is actually a picture of the Battle of Trafalgar. 

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:36.932
 This is the battle here. 

00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:38.575
 A group of ships that shoot each other, 

00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:39.849
 you can not really understand what's going on. 

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:45.375
 And just to make the connection with modern Britain, 

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:47.034
 and more precisely with today's London, 

00:11:47.034 --> 00:11:49.171
 this is a picture of Trafalgar Square here. 

00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:51.582
 He was baptized at the Battle of Trafalgar, 

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:54.614
 with which Britain has established itself as a dominant maritime force. 

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.645
 This is Trafalgar Square in London. 

00:11:57.645 --> 00:12:00.781
 Trafalgar Square. 

00:12:00.781 --> 00:12:03.778
 If you go to this square, you will see the Nelson column. 

00:12:03.778 --> 00:12:06.891
 Here's the Nelson column, 

00:12:06.891 --> 00:12:10.555
 named after Horacezo Nelson, Nelson's column. 

00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:13.169
 And at the top there is a small figure, 

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:14.128
 and maybe it's actually quite big, 

00:12:14.128 --> 00:12:16.729
 but small on the background of the column, 

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:18.698
 the figure belongs to Horatio Nelson himself. 

00:12:18.698 --> 00:12:20.461
 This was a little deviation, 

00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:23.771
 this has happened during the war with the Third Coalition. 

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.986
 So Napoleon's fleet is destroyed. 

00:12:26.986 --> 00:12:27.937
 But he does not give up. 

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:29.134
 He just says, "Well, no problem, 

00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:30.824
 with you I can do nothing more, 

00:12:30.824 --> 00:12:33.629
 but look in Europe - I can make big stunts there. " 

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:37.538
 So he takes his troops ... 

00:12:37.538 --> 00:12:40.268
 He has already refused to attack Britain by sea. 

00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:42.048
 He realizes that it is not realistic to do so. 

00:12:42.048 --> 00:12:44.635
 Let me show you how the troops moved 

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.716
 at that time. 

00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:48.512
 He had troops here 

00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:51.304
 and has refused to attack the United Kingdom. 

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:55.890
 And what he does - goes to the Austrians. 

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.553
 And the Austrians are gathering troops here. 

00:12:58.553 --> 00:13:00.751
 They actually thought there was a chance 

00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:02.084
 the military campaign to be brought mostly to Italy. 

00:13:02.084 --> 00:13:04.640
 And so they concentrated their troops there, 

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.639
 which will be a major mistake.
