00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:03.345
Stoicism is a philosophical school

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:05.240
that began in ancient Greece

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.740
and was later dominant in ancient Rome and which continues

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.165
to have hugely urgent and important things to teach us

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.195
about calm, resilience and emotional stability

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.265
Its ideas should be at the

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.200
heart of any attempt to remain serene

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.940
in face of turbulent, unpredictable

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.280
and often mean minded world.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.515
Arguably, the greatest and certainly the most

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.545
prolific stoic philosopher was the Roman author and statesman

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.680
Seneca who was born in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.140
4 BC in Spain and died in 65 AD in Rome.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.000
A lot of Seneca's thought is known to us from the letters

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.080
he wrote to his friends giving them counsel at times

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.020
of trouble.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Seneca had a friend called Lucilius, a civil servant

00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:50.280
working in Sicily. One day,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.860
Lucilius learned of a  lawsuit against him which

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.160
threatened end his career and disgrace his good name.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.655
He wrote to Seneca in a panic.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.275
"You may expect that i'm going to advise you to picture

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.680
a happy outcome and to rest in the allurements of hope."

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.160
Replied the philosopher.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.340
"But i'm going to conduct you to peace of mind through another root

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.640
which culminated in the advise if you wish to put off

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480
all worry assumed that what you fear may

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.600
happen is certainly going to happen.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.215
This is an essential stoic idea.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.275
We must always try to picture the worst that could happen

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.755
and then remind ourselves that the worst

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.460
is survivable. The goal is not to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.880
imagine that bad things don't unfold,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.000
it's to see that we are far more capable of enduring them

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.820
than we currently think.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.800
To calm Lucilius down, Seneca advised him to himself entirely

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.820
at home with the idea of humiliation, poverty

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.880
and ongoing unemployment.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:50.115
But to learn to see that these were,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.635
from the right perspective, not the end

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.445
of everything. If you lose this case,

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:58.315
can anything more severe happen to you than being sent into exile

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:01.515
or left to prison? Ask the philosopher,

00:02:01.515 --> 00:02:04.765
who had himself, survived bankruptcy and eight years

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:06.565
of exile in Corsica.

00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:09.905
Hope for that which is utterly just and prepare

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.745
yourself for that which is utterly unjust.

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:16.145
Seneca gave Lucilius a meditation

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.900
to maul over in the luxury of his home that he was now

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.365
in danger of losing. I'm may become a poor man;

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.100
I shall may then be one among many.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.040
I may be exiled; I shall then regard myself

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.300
as born in a place to which I shall be sent.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.260
They may put me in chains; what then?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.220
Am i free from bonds now?

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:39.245
Behold this clogging burden of a body to which nature

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:40.335
has feted me.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.940
Seneca tells us that we must grow familiar with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.760
and hold before us, at all times,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.660
not just the sort of events we like to plan for

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.640
that are recorded in living memory or are common in our

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:54.325
age group and class. But the entire range

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:56.475
of possibilities - a longer and inevitably

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:59.455
far less agreeable list which finds

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:01.965
space for cataclysmic fires, suckings and

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.405
untimely deaths. He wrote:

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:07.425
"Nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Let us place

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:10.780
before our eyes in its entirety the nature of man's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.980
lot. Not the kind of evil that often happens but

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.900
the very greatest evil that can possibly happen

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.920
We must reflect upon fortune,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.020
fully and completely.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.500
At one point, a friend of Seneca's lost  a son.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.500
And the consoling thoughts run in the similar direction.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.560
Marcia, a lady of a senatorial family

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.920
was devastated by the death of her son Metilius, not yet 25.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.540
She fell into a period of mourning

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.700
that seem to have no end.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.740
Three years after the death, her sorrow have not

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.080
abated one bit. Indeed it was growing stronger everyday

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.600
So Seneca sent her an essay in which he expressed

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.620
the hope that given the length of time that elapsed

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.500
since Metilius' death, she would forgive him for going beyond the usual

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.685
condolenses to deliver something darker but

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.000
perhaps more effective.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.700
To lose a son was surely the greatest grief that could befall a mother.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.145
But given the vulnerability of the human frame,

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.060
Metilius’ early death had its place in a merciless

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.960
natural order which daily

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.400
offered examples of its handy work.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.160
He wrote: “We never anticipate evils before

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.320
they actually arrive.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.080
So many funerals passed our doors,  yet we never dwell on death.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.260
So many deaths are untimely,

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:26.995
yet we make plans for our own infants.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.785
How they well done the toga,  serve in the army,

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:32.080
and succeed to their father property.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.480
They might end up doing such things,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.860
but how mad to love them without remembering

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.200
that no one had offered us a guarantee that they would

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.920
grow to maturity let alone make it  to dinner time.”

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.340
If Metilius’ death had been unexpected for Marcia,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.760
it was only on the basis of a wishful assessment of probabilities.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.800
You say,  I didn’t think it would happen,  do you think

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.840
there is anything that will not happen

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.380
when  you know that it is possible to happen.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.980
When you see that it has already happened to many.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.680
Seneca imagined meeting Marcia before her birth

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.240
and inviting her on a tour of the troubled earth

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.980
so she could weigh off the terms of life then choose

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.440
whether or not to accept them.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.600
On the one hand, Marcia would see a planet of

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.760
all inspiring beauty and occasional goodness.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.960
On the other, a place of intermittent, unspeakable horror.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.520
Would Marcia choose to step into such a world?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.880
Her existence suggested her answer.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.040
Importantly, the stoics Seneca did add

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.200
that if things were truly unendurable,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.780
we have no obligation to continue forever.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.280
Here’s another letter from Seneca:

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.340
“The wise man will live as long as he ought

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.000
not as long as he can.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.060
He always reflects concerning the quality

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.700
and not the quantity of his life.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.680
As soon as there are numerous events in his life,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.520
that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.500
he sets himself free.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.580
And this privilege is his not only when the crisis is

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.180
upon him but as soon as fortune seems to be maltreating him.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.160
Then he looks about carefully and sees whether

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.720
he ought or ought not to end his life on that account.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.180
He holds that its makes no difference to him

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.380
whether he’s taking off be natural or self-inflicted.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.780
He does not regard it with fear as if it were a great loss

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.440
for no man can lose very much

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.840
when but a driblet remains.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.900
It’s not a question of dying earlier or later

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.160
but of dying well or ill and

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.660
dying well means a escape from the danger of living ill.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.000
Seneca was not advocating random

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.040
or thoughtless exits.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.920
He was attempting to give us more courage

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.020
in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.940
within our remit when we’ve genuinely tried everything

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.640
and rationally had enough to choose a noble path out of our troubles.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.140
When we are furious, paranoid, depleted,  or sad

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.740
the philosophy of stoicism is on hand

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.240
as it has been for 2000 years

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.320
to nurse us with its hugely fortifying,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.700
distinctive and unusual wisdom and friendship.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.360
 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.100
 

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:12.005
 

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:15.005
 

00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:18.065
