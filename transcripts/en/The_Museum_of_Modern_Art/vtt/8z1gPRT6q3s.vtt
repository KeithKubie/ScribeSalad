00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.890
I first met Rauschenberg through Dorothea
Rockburne. and I went out and I was going

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.610
around openings, just looking for people and
telling them that I needed a job.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.060
And Dorothea said, "Oh, there might be something
where I work."

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.320
And she didn't say where she worked.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.730
So she said, "Be here," And it was Bob's.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.000
And this is, you know, Robert Rauschenberg.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.059
He was a big deal.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:44.600
But you're there
making coffee, you know, and fending people

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.770
off on the telephone.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.079
And I was very good at that, I could pick
up the phone and I could identify, you know,

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.089
"Oh, Ileana," you know?

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.010
And he would go, you know, he answered "no.”

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.969
I was Bob’s assistant from the late 60’s
and I had the job for about four years.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.140
It was the longest I ever had a job.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:17.970
I had to set this painting up for Marcello
Mastroianni or...I can’t remember...it was

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.160
either Julie Christie or Fae Dunaway.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.850
And they were supposedly interested in.. but
he just looked totally bored.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.160
I mean, the way he always looked.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.340
Lots of people would just, like, drop by.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.200
It was a very relaxed sort of situation.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.350
People had coffee and drinks and he had this
big iron stove and you know, there was a kitchen

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.240
table and, you know, a couple counters and
the phone.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.910
I mean...there are a lot of young artists
hanging out at the house.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.130
I mean there are a lot of young artists hanging
out at the house.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:05.800
some days there'd be a lot of dancers, like
Yvonne…and Yvonne Rainer or Lucinda Childs.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.060
And then another day, there'd be painters,
like Alex Hay.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780
And I remember Alex working on some big projects,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.200
I mean, he was, like, very supportive of younger
artists and very generous.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.160
My job, basically, was I was supposed to make
it so that he could just walk in the room

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.540
and start working.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.740
I rarely saw him work.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.410
I mean, it seemed to me, at that time, he
was working mostly at night.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.180
And things would just sort of appear, you
know.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.710
I had never seen, before or since, someone
concentrated so intensely.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.680
I mean, he was just like, "Look at these things,"
and you could tell he was working out how

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.230
they could be working.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.380
And, you know, he was working.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.860
After he did white painting, he did black
paintings.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.670
These were very plain…

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.860
I mean, to show that at that time was pretty
radical.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.370
The story was that Newman objected to them
so they didn't get shown in the Betty Parsons

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.180
Show.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.270
Barnett Newman was an abstract expressionist.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:31.460
Basically, one of the first minimalists, and
a giant personality, and a giant painter.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.130
And if Newman was objected to it, they must've
been pretty radical

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.060
Bob wanted to re-do his White Painting project.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.770
I mean, he had done it, and then most of the
panels were used up in Combines that he did.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.370
He just used those canvases in other projects
he was working on.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.260
So they didn't exist anymore.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.900
basically, you know, but we stretched it out,
we got canvas that was very close to the canvas

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.560
that he had originally used.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:19.909
And he said, "When you paint them...just make
sure that the paint doesn't show.

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:30.289
I mean, there's no expression, there's no
brushstroke, just...make it totally anonymous."

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.439
The whole point was that anybody can make
them.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.800
You know, that was...

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.550
I mean, that's the way he felt about it.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.080
And this was like in, you know, the minimalist
thing was starting up and I always thought,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.180
it was like, "Bob," such-and-so, wanted to
do, like, show he'd been there or, you know,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.470
keep his finger in the pie or whatever.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.120
Why is Rauschenberg important?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.419
He opens it up.

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:20.479
He's pointing out the importance of art, and
yet at the same time, he's leaving himself

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.430
in a position to explore unpretentiously.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:39.469
And 
it's like there's no pretense, just incredible

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.779
intelligence.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:48.509
It's an intelligence that is between art and
life.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.930
But also, I see collage as a big influence.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.830
there's an immediacy about collage.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.699
The paint in a lot of Bob's paintings, they're
like, collage elements.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:07.550
There was a certain kind of imagery that can
get really complex in Rauschenberg's.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.830
You know, I mean, you say, "Oh yeah, there's
the wheel, yeah.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.189
There's a bicycle, there's..."

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.070
He had all this stuff he really liked, you
know, was really drawn to.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.210
When he wants to put it together, he can really
put it together.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:35.080
when he first got some money, he bought a
car and drove the whole coast of Eastern United

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.389
States, looking for some place to go or to
be.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.669
I remember, you know, one day he just got
this call and it was from an agent in Captiva,

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:47.690
Sanibel, Florida.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.749
And he went down the next, you know, couple
of days, would look at the property and decided

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:55.229
to go for it.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.220
He got the place, you know, it was a house
on the beach.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.259
And then just started building it up.

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:09.050
And then finally he just came back once and
said, you know, "I'm letting you all go."

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.899
He said, "None of you need this job anymore."

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.399
And he was really right.
