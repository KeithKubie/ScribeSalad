00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.690
Alright. Although there might have been some new terms for some of you out there

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.170
in this lesson, hopefully the concept map wasn't

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.380
too hard to piece together. Let's start here

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.780
with pharmacogenomics, which studies how the genome

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.270
affects our response to drugs. Now pharmacogenomics wants

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.620
to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy of drugs.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.380
The ability to do that enhances personalized medicine.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.190
Pharmacogenomics is one main way that we can

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.860
achieve more personalized medicine. Now obviously the genome

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.750
contains many various alleles which we've learned about

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.070
in. Many lessons, particularly if you want a refresher,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
lessons 3, 4, and 6 would be a good place to check out. But in this lesson

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.410
we learn that alleles that affect pharmacokinetics have

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.170
to do with pathways about the metabolism of drugs.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.140
Whereas alleles affecting pharmacodynamics are about pathways that are

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.930
target effects of the specific drugs. Together, the pharmacodynamics and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.490
pharmacokinetics influence our efficacy and toxicity of particular drugs

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
that are at the center of our study in pharmacogenomics.
