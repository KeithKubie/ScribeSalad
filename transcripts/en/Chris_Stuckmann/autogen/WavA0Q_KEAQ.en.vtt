to survive in the wild and there were

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
to survive in the wild and there were
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.399
to survive in the wild and there were
all these things and the elements and of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
all these things and the elements and of
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020

the first half hour of Riddick was like
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010

that and I really wish the rest of the
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899
that and I really wish the rest of the
film had a similar tone but once he did

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
film had a similar tone but once he did
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760
film had a similar tone but once he did
run into this group of soldiers it all

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
run into this group of soldiers it all
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200

started to make sense and you got a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
started to make sense and you got a
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.270
started to make sense and you got a
taste of why certain things happened and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
taste of why certain things happened and
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
taste of why certain things happened and
I get that and it's fine I don't really

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
I get that and it's fine I don't really
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260
I get that and it's fine I don't really
think it derailed the film I just think

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
think it derailed the film I just think
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.580
think it derailed the film I just think
it possibly would have been a more

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
it possibly would have been a more
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.679
it possibly would have been a more
entertaining film if the entire film was

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
entertaining film if the entire film was
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.419
entertaining film if the entire film was
just Riddick against the elements but

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
just Riddick against the elements but
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919
just Riddick against the elements but
really the last two acts of the movie is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
really the last two acts of the movie is
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690
really the last two acts of the movie is
Riddick against the elements still is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
Riddick against the elements still is
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400
Riddick against the elements still is
just more people involved and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
just more people involved and
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500
just more people involved and
so they cut away more from Riddick he

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
so they cut away more from Riddick he
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.330
so they cut away more from Riddick he
became sort of this shadow that could

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
became sort of this shadow that could
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640
became sort of this shadow that could
just strike out and then back into the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
just strike out and then back into the
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.560
just strike out and then back into the
shadows again and I enjoyed that aspect

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
shadows again and I enjoyed that aspect
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.820
shadows again and I enjoyed that aspect
of the film but I did want to see a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
of the film but I did want to see a
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.290
of the film but I did want to see a
little more of him for that second act

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
little more of him for that second act
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.330
little more of him for that second act
and a few of the characters in that army

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
and a few of the characters in that army
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.420
and a few of the characters in that army
were a little okay they're just sort of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
were a little okay they're just sort of
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280
were a little okay they're just sort of

quirky people that don't really need to
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.300
quirky people that don't really need to
be there but then some of them were

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
be there but then some of them were
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.250
be there but then some of them were
pretty awesome like Katee Sackhoff was

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
pretty awesome like Katee Sackhoff was
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.990
