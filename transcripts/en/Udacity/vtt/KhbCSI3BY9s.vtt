00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.126
The center will be at negative 1 negative 2 the opposite signs of these and a

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:11.606
value is 3 and the b value is 2. Nice thinking if you got these right. Now

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:15.584
let's check out your graph. We'll start by graphing an ellipse and the center

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:21.092
is at negative 1 negative 2. We'll go one unit to the left, and two units down.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:26.264
Now we use our a and b values to get the other points. Three units in the x

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:31.390
direction for a, and two units in the y direction for b. We carefully construct

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.160
our rectangle around our ellipse. This is going to start our hyperbola graph.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.154
Next, we draw on our two diagonals across the rectangle. And now we're ready to

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:44.866
draw on our hyperbola. Our hyperbola will open left and right, since the x

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:49.031
squared term comes first. So we'll cut open our ellipse, and we'll split the

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:53.917
two halves outward. We'll stretch the ends of the hyperbola to our diagonals,

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:58.588
which gives us our final graph. Keep in mind, that the reason this parabola

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:02.945
opened left and right was because the x squared term came first. It was

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:07.704
positive in this case. We use the opposite signs for h and k to get our center,

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:12.485
negative 1 and negative 2. These are some of the most common pit falls students

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.854
make. So you want to make sure you pay close attention to signs and which term

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.505
comes first for hyperbolas.
