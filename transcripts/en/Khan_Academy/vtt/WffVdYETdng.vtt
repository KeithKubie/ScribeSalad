00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.288
Voiceover:On the right-hand side we have

00:00:02.288 --> 00:00:04.322
a bunch of expressions
that are just ratios

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.514
of different information
given in these two diagrams.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:09.832
Then over here on the left we have

00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:11.857
the sine taken of angle MKJ,

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:15.196
cosine of angle MKJ, and
tangent of angle MKJ.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:19.407
Angle MKJ is this angle right over here

00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:22.505
same thing as theta, so these two angles.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.189
These two angles have the same measure.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.767
We see that right over there.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.178
What we want to do is figure out

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.551
which of these expressions are equivalent

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:34.440
to which of these
expressions right over here.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.706
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:40.312
and try to work this through on your own.

00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:42.897
Assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:44.338
let's try to work this out.

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:45.287
When you look at this diagram,

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:47.300
it looks like the
intention here on the left

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.531
is this evokes the unit circle definition

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.868
of trig functions because
this is a unit circle

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.980
right over here,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.350
and this evokes kind of
the soh cah toa definition

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.849
because we're just kind of in a

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.337
plain, vanilla right triangle.

00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:02.470
Just to remind ourselves,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.260
let's just remind ourselves of soh cah toa

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.172
because I have a feeling
it might be useful.

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:08.603
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:12.577
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:16.603
and tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:18.350
We can refer to this and we can also

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.971
remind ourselves of the
unit circle definition

00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.435
of trig functions that
the cosine of an angle

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:26.809
is the X coordinate and that the sine

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:30.816
of where this ray
intersects the unit circle,

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:32.407
and the sine of this angle is going to be

00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:33.578
the Y coordinate.

00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:34.849
What we'll see through this video

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.497
is that they actually, the
unit circle definition,

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.829
is just an extension of soh cah toa.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.965
Let's look first at X over one.

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:47.892
We have X, X is the X coordinate.

00:01:47.892 --> 00:01:49.377
That's also the length of this side

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:50.891
right over here,

00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.855
relative to this angle, theta.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.940
That is the adjacent side.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.150
So X is equal to the adjacent side.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.285
What is one?

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:02.750
Well, this is a unit circle.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.867
One is the length of the radius

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:07.190
which for this right triangle
is also the hypotenuse.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.398
If we apply the soh cah toa definition,

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:12.963
X over one is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:15.495
adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.826
adjacent over hypotenuse, that's cosine.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:23.888
That's going to be this is
equal to cosine of theta,

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:26.272
but theta is the same thing as angle MKJ.

00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:27.594
They have the same measure so cosine

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:31.198
of angle MKJ is equal to cosine of theta

00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:36.219
which is equal to X over one.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.339
Now let's move over to Y over one.

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:42.150
Well, Y is going to be
the length of this side

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.686
right over here.

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:47.599
Y is going to be, let
me do this in the blue.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.825
Y is going to be this length
relative to angle theta.

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.553
That is the opposite side.

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:54.831
That is the opposite side.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:59.764
Now which trig function is
opposite over hypotenuse?

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.361
Opposite over hypotenuse?

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.780
That's sine of theta.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.274
Sine of theta.

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:08.470
So sine of angle MKJ is the same thing

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.341
as sine of theta.

00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:12.230
We see that they have the same measure,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.425
and now we see that's the same thing

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.453
as Y over one.

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:18.643
Now for both of these I used
the soh cah toa definition,

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:20.994
but we could have also used
the unit circle definition.

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.329
X over one, that's the same thing.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.530
That's the same thing as X,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.942
and the unit circle definition says

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:30.249
the X coordinate of where this,

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.446
I guess you could say, the
terminal side of this angle,

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.704
this ray right over here,

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:34.926
intersects the unit circle.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:37.674
That by definition, by
the unit circle definition

00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:40.455
is the cosine of this angle.

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.444
X is equal to the cosine of this angle,

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.390
and the unit circle definition,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.640
the Y coordinate is equal
to the sine of this angle.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.339
We could have written
this as instead of X, Y,

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.746
we could have written
this as cosine of theta,

00:03:54.746 --> 00:04:00.600
sine theta just like that,
but let's keep going.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.419
Now we have X over Y.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.312
We have adjacent over,

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.229
we have adjacent over opposite.

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.797
So this is equal to
adjacent over opposite.

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:12.853
Tangent is opposite over adjacent,

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.404
not adjacent over opposite.

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:17.108
This is the reciprocal of tangent.

00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:19.425
This right over here, if we had to,

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.322
this is equal to one
over tangent of theta.

00:04:22.322 --> 00:04:24.622
We later learn about
cotangent and all of that

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:25.552
which is essentially this,

00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:26.906
but it's not one of our choices.

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:29.425
So we can rule this one out.

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:31.240
Then we have Y over X.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.333
Well, this is looking good.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:37.195
This is Y is opposite.

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:38.574
Opposite.

00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:41.812
X is adjacent relative to angle theta.

00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:42.745
Adjacent.

00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:45.328
So this is the tangent of theta.

00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.585
This is equal to tangent of theta.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:50.440
Tangent of angle MKJ is the same thing

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.212
as tangent of theta which is equal,

00:04:54.212 --> 00:04:58.187
which is equal to Y over X.

00:04:58.187 --> 00:05:02.267
Now let's look at J over K, so J over K.

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.419
Now we're moving over to this triangle,

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.051
J over K.

00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.381
Relative to this angle because this

00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:07.533
is the angle that we care about,

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:11.136
J is the length of the adjacent side,

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:15.593
and K is the length of the opposite side,

00:05:15.593 --> 00:05:16.706
of the opposite side.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.172
This is adjacent over opposite.

00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:23.330
This is equal to adjacent over opposite.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.804
Tangent is opposite over adjacent

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:25.960
not adjacent over opposite.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.999
So once again this is the reciprocal

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.750
of the tangent function
not one of the choices

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.407
right over here so we
can rule that one out.

00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:36.357
Now K over J.

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:38.565
Well, now this is opposite over adjacent.

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:40.241
Opposite over adjacent.

00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:42.927
That is equal to tangent of theta.

00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:45.418
This is equal to tangent of theta,

00:05:45.418 --> 00:05:47.580
or tangent of angle MKJ.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.900
This is equal to K over J.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.605
Now we have M over J, M over J.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.809
Hypotenuse over adjacent side.

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.748
This of course is equal to the hypotenuse.

00:06:02.748 --> 00:06:04.953
Hypotenuse over adjacent.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.482
Well, if it was adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:07.415
we'd be dealing with cosine,

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:09.187
but this is the reciprocal of that.

00:06:09.187 --> 00:06:12.795
This is actually one
over the cosine of theta

00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:14.288
not one of our choices,

00:06:14.288 --> 00:06:15.786
not one of our choices here so I'll just

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:17.723
rule that one out over there.

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:20.393
Then we have it's reciprocal, J over M.

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.534
That's adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:25.599
Adjacent over hypotenuse is cosine.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.604
This is equal to cosine of theta,

00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:31.152
or cosine of angle MKJ so
we could write it down.

00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:35.196
This is equivalent to J over M.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:37.438
Then one last one, K over M.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.479
Well, that's opposite over hypotenuse,

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.940
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.545
That's going to be sine of theta.

00:06:43.545 --> 00:06:46.517
This right over here is
equal to sine of theta

00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.641
which is the same thing
as sine of angle MKJ

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.528
which is the same thing as
all of these expressions.

00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:54.120
This is equal to K over M,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.881
and we are done.
