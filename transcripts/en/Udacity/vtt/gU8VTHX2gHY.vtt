[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:06.641
Okay, Marty,

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:11.850
NSUserDefaults is by far the easiest
way to persist data to your device.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.350
&gt;&gt; How does it work?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.410
&gt;&gt; It's actually it's like
a dictionary that every now and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980
then automagically saves its contents.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.900
&gt;&gt; And it can save my algorithm?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.050
&gt;&gt; Yes, it saves data into a plist,
this stands for property list.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.280
And even though it can only take certain
types such as data, string, number,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.035
date, array or dictionary,
that's not a problem.

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:34.785
We're sending your message a string.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:41.375
&gt;&gt; So if we go back to the past and
implement and NSUserDefaults on the text

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.945
input section of my phone's messaging
app, then when my phone dies and

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.035
the app turns off, it will have
saved the album I wrote out?

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:51.065
&gt;&gt; Yes, though.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:51.565
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950
&gt;&gt; It's nothing.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.377
&gt;&gt; What is it, Doc?

00:00:57.377 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt; NSUserDefaults reads and
writes all in one go.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.090
So that's why we try to
keep the size below 1 MB.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.835
If it's bigger,
it would be taxing for the device.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.085
But that should only a problem
if the file is tremendous.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.605
Your algorithm can't be that big.

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:16.521
&gt;&gt; I wish I could remember.

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:18.472
&gt;&gt; Nah, I think that's impossible.

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:20.342
Actually, I'm certain it is.

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.015
NSUserDefaults will suffice.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.665
Come Marty, we have no time to waste.

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:24.540
To the DeLorean!
