watching TV and doing something which
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910
watching TV and doing something which
was actually non-scientific so I think

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
was actually non-scientific so I think
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620

also clear that there are people who

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
also clear that there are people who
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940
also clear that there are people who
were serial creative people but I think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
were serial creative people but I think
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010
were serial creative people but I think
it's very difficult to know what really

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
it's very difficult to know what really
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390
it's very difficult to know what really
makes I think there's a certain level of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
makes I think there's a certain level of
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.880
makes I think there's a certain level of
messiness that makes some creative David

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890
messiness that makes some creative David
 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.520
messiness that makes some creative David
well you know unfortunately I think all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
well you know unfortunately I think all
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230
well you know unfortunately I think all
of us will agree we have no idea where

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
of us will agree we have no idea where
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690
of us will agree we have no idea where
creativity comes from and that's quite

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
creativity comes from and that's quite
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.359
creativity comes from and that's quite
unfortunate because if we know we could

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
unfortunate because if we know we could
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.080
unfortunate because if we know we could
teach it and we can't at least we know

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
teach it and we can't at least we know
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969
teach it and we can't at least we know
ways of encouraging it but not teaching

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
ways of encouraging it but not teaching
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.630
ways of encouraging it but not teaching
it but I think it's clearly related to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
it but I think it's clearly related to
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.319
it but I think it's clearly related to
our illusion that the conscious is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
our illusion that the conscious is
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.370
our illusion that the conscious is
somehow in control of even our thoughts

00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:25.639
in 400 years I mean the basically the
mechanisms are the same the rules are

mechanisms are the same the rules are
 

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:27.499

the same the product is the same so that
that that that that is the future

actually try to avoid hard work when

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:40.949
actually try to avoid hard work when
 

00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:43.210

things look when things look complicated

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.220
things look when things look complicated
 

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.609
things look when things look complicated
and difficult to that's often a sign

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:46.619
and difficult to that's often a sign
 

00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:49.069
and difficult to that's often a sign
that there's a different way a better

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079

creativity and and I think Steve talked

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:07.649
creativity and and I think Steve talked
 

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:09.470
creativity and and I think Steve talked
about one of them which is going to it

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480
about one of them which is going to it
 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.220
about one of them which is going to it
going into a new field or posing a new

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:13.230
going into a new field or posing a new
 

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.359
going into a new field or posing a new
question which is not necessarily yet a

00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:17.369
question which is not necessarily yet a
 

00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:20.929
question which is not necessarily yet a
discovery but just approaching a new

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:20.939
discovery but just approaching a new
 

00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:23.989

question that most people ignore because

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:23.999
question that most people ignore because
 

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.910
question that most people ignore because
they think it's too hard or because it

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920
they think it's too hard or because it
 

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.160
they think it's too hard or because it
is too hard and and so empty territory

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.170
is too hard and and so empty territory
 

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.530

is a great place for creativity it's

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540
is a great place for creativity it's
 

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.230
is a great place for creativity it's
very easy to come up with the first I'd

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240
very easy to come up with the first I'd
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.639
very easy to come up with the first I'd
good ideas in the field and once

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:39.649
good ideas in the field and once
 

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:42.590
good ideas in the field and once
breakthroughs are then made the easy

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600
breakthroughs are then made the easy
 

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.269
breakthroughs are then made the easy
ones the crowd rushes in

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279
ones the crowd rushes in
 

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:50.040
ones the crowd rushes in
then it gets harder and harder yeah

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.050
then it gets harder and harder yeah
 

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.489
then it gets harder and harder yeah

I've been trying to develop instruments

00:15:30.819 --> 00:15:30.829
I've been trying to develop instruments
 

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.939
I've been trying to develop instruments
invent new instruments and because I

00:15:33.939 --> 00:15:33.949
invent new instruments and because I
 

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:35.530

realize there's so many more people
 

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.650
realize there's so many more people
smarter than me and but if you are the

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:38.660
smarter than me and but if you are the
 

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.989
smarter than me and but if you are the
first to look under a rock with a new

00:15:40.989 --> 00:15:40.999
first to look under a rock with a new
 

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:42.579

instrument you don't have to be smart

00:15:42.579 --> 00:15:42.589
instrument you don't have to be smart
 

00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:46.900
instrument you don't have to be smart
and and so that and so continuing just

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:46.910
and and so that and so continuing just
 

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.329
and and so that and so continuing just
you know okay what new instrument what

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:49.339
you know okay what new instrument what
 

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:51.100
you know okay what new instrument what
new method or what new technique or what

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.110
new method or what new technique or what
 

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:55.420
new method or what new technique or what
new now nanoprobe it's and so I try to

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.430
new now nanoprobe it's and so I try to
 

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.600
new now nanoprobe it's and so I try to
teach people who are equally incompetent

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:58.610
teach people who are equally incompetent
 

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.740
teach people who are equally incompetent
and dumb that invents a new instrument

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:02.750
and dumb that invents a new instrument
 

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.780
and dumb that invents a new instrument
invent a new method and then the world

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:04.790
invent a new method and then the world
 

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.809
invent a new method and then the world
opens up Michael you are going to do so

00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:07.819
opens up Michael you are going to do so

opens up Michael you are going to do so
I guess like Frank most of my work has

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759
I guess like Frank most of my work has
 

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:13.389
I guess like Frank most of my work has
been theoretical and just thinking back

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399
been theoretical and just thinking back

as I have I've lost a couple of minutes

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319
as I have I've lost a couple of minutes

as I have I've lost a couple of minutes
I think most of the time you're just

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800
I think most of the time you're just
 

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.879
I think most of the time you're just
working hard but I would guess I

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:21.889
working hard but I would guess I
 

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:23.650

sometimes they don't work out maybe have

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720
sometimes they don't work out maybe have
 

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720
sometimes they don't work out maybe have
had ten ideas and half of them didn't

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:34.730
had ten ideas and half of them didn't
 

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.660
had ten ideas and half of them didn't
work out but I think in some ways it's

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:37.670
work out but I think in some ways it's
 

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.369

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:42.309
one of the reasons why being a scientist
is so great to have an idea to feel it's

00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319
is so great to have an idea to feel it's

is so great to have an idea to feel it's
gonna be okay and then so you work it

00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:44.209
gonna be okay and then so you work it
 

00:16:44.209 --> 00:16:46.210
gonna be okay and then so you work it
out and it comes out to be okay so I

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:46.220
out and it comes out to be okay so I
 

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.299
out and it comes out to be okay so I
think in some ways creative ideas are
