1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,420
I appreciate, I don't give a fuck style
more than any other style of comedy.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,340
For me, my favorite shit was like,
first of all, Joey Diaz, but then the,

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,720
when you go back to the greats,

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:14,550
like Kinison and Hicks and this guys
didn't give a fuck. They went out,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,270
they went off and it was the most
fun to watch as a person who was a,

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,500
an audience member for me was the most fun
to watch. And I think, you know, that's,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,000
that's the shit that
I got. And it's, yeah,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,990
we grew up on that and then society
changes. And I'm like, no dude, I've been,

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,740
I've been working on this for so long.
Please let me,

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,270
I have to change my entire like foundation
of what I think is funny now because

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,291
it's almost like,

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,200
and that's why I think guys like Legion
of skanks and then the specialist's name,

13
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,210
it Legion of skanks me in big J.
Okay.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,640
So big would constantly
cheat on his wife and uh,

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,290
it was like a regular car and she
knew it and everyone knows it.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,750
And one time we were there and then we
were hanging out and we were about to

17
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,360
leave. They were in an argument and she's
like, fuck you, why don't you go, hey,

18
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,690
how was your legion of
skanks and me and pick j?

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,440
We were both playing guitar hero at the
time. There was like a big game in town.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,440
We both looked at each other.

21
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,560
We were like guitar hero name and
that's what we named our band initially.

22
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:08,610
And Guitar Hero, um, was legion of
skanks and then we're not that creative.

23
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:13,530
So we wrote a script. How long ago was
this? Probably 10 years ago. 10 years ago.

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,580
10 years ago. The name. And then that was
the guitar hero band. Maybe if I'm more,

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,020
probably more, yeah, actually way more.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,430
Cause it was right with me
in big Jay became friends.
Um, and then we wrote, yeah,

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,230
Legion of skanks is a great name.

28
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,680
It's probably one of the all time
greatest names of anything, right.

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,630
You stop and think about like bands
or television, legion of skanks.

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,790
That is eight. Great. Thank you.
Thank you Jeff. Great Name. Yeah,

31
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,580
well I've got to give it a big Jay because
he recognized it immediately and then

32
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,580
every project we ever did since then has
been named Legion of skanks until the

33
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:46,080
podcast worked. It's good move. Yeah.
And it uh, yeah, it's, you know,

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,010
people know what they're getting.
They get it, dude. They get it.

35
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:51,720
And to be honest with you, people,
people want that type of humor.

36
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:56,400
That's the other thing is
like, it's the new alternative,
um, is like dirty, edgier,

37
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,950
ballsy shit. Well, it's when we
were talking about earlier, look,

38
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,710
if you like punk rock,
you should be able to listen to punk rock.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,060
But if you like the kind of comedy
that some people like aggressive,

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,080
like outlandish comedy you like,
if that's what you like,

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,280
then you should be able to
enjoy it or not. It's up to you.

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,310
It's like you don't have to like it.
You don't have to listen.

43
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,180
You don't have to watch.

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,480
It's not that it makes you immune from
criticism if people don't like it.

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,060
But you know, it's, everybody's
got different tastes it,

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,440
and to be honest with you,

47
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,100
if I wanted to sit here and deconstruct
everything that could trigger me in life,

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,870
I'm just not a bitch.
I don't,

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,030
I don't sit here and I'm
triggered every moment by the,

50
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:41,250
the amount of shit that I've seen in my
fucking life. Everything triggers me,

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,910
everything triggers me.
And every movie that I watched it,

52
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,810
if there's some fucked
up scene, I can go, oh,

53
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,970
that reminds me of some fucked up shit.
Um,

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,790
but you have to appreciate those things.

55
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,080
Don't you sort of want sort of
everything to be represented.
