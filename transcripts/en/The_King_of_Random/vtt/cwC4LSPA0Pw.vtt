00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.710
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in the past we've done some fun experiments with candy and today

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.569
I have a new one. I want to try. I want to see if we can make some glowing candy

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.320
That's right. Candy that actually Luminess is in all of my research

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.949
I wasn't able to find any foods that actually put off light on their own

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.959
So I'm going with the next best thing and I'm going to see if I can make candy that glows under a blacklight

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.849
Edible substances that glow under a blacklight are also fairly uncommon and actually I was only able to find two one of them is

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.790
quinine which has a horrendously bitter and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.180
Overpowering taste so I didn't want to use that the other thing

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.569
I found is vitamin b2 also known as riboflavin a little bit of reading tells me that riboflavin is

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.159
Non-toxic even at fairly high doses which we aren't even going to use in this recipe

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.299
So I'm going to see if we can use this vitamin to give some bright backlight glow to our candy

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.390
I figured if we're going to have some candy that glows under a blacklight

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.180
We might as well pick something that looks like it should

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.920
Glow so the goal today is to see if we can make some glowing green candy that looks like the heart of Te Fiti stone

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.980
From the movie Moana the first step will be to make a heart of Te Fiti

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.000
Stone that we can then mold to cast our candy in to make our stone

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
I have this yellow sculpey brand polymer clay, which you bake in the oven to make it hard

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.949
And I also have this same two-part silicone mold rubber that we use to make our thumb molds unfortunately

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.220
I don't have a lot of tips on how to sculpt something to look how you want

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.419
Except to look up pictures of what you want it to look like and then squish it until it's in the right shape

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.540
The stone in the movie is not quite as wide as a person's palm

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.939
So I'm going to try and make it one and a half

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.040
maybe two inches tall

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.169
I think this seems like about a good amount of clay

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.030
If I start forming it and it's too big or too small I can add a little bit more or take some off

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.580
Squish it around a little bit to get it kind of soft roll it into a sort of a ball

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160
Not like a really good ball, but kind of round

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
That's sort of round now. Let's flatten that out a little bit

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.009
And I want a tapered edge going around rounded edge, nothing sharp

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.810
All right, I think that is a pretty good approximation of the size and shape of the stone

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.000
We can see it's not quite as wide as my whole palm

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.990
But it's still got some good sides to it so now. It's time to start carving in the decorations on the front of the stone

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.849
Lightly marking in where all my lines to go

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.339
All right there we go we have our nice

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.619
Carved out heart of Te Fiti I've tried to match the patterns on it to the movie as well as I could

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.839
It's probably not a hundred percent, but it's pretty good. I think now we need to bake this in the oven at 275

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.280
Fahrenheit or 130 Celsius for 15 to 20 minutes

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.020
All right, I think our clay is ready to take out of the oven let's see how it's looking

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.370
You really use tools not your hands to pull it out, but foil is so thin. It doesn't conduct all that much heat

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.630
Let's let that cool down for a minute. Okay. I think our stone is now cooled down pretty well. It's looking good now

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.109
Just to get rid of any of the little scuffs or burrs I left on the surface

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.139
I want to hit this with some sandpaper to really smooth it down now

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.160
It's not very rough and doesn't need a lot of changes, so I'm gonna hit it with some 800 grit sandpaper

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.630
Which is fairly fine, and then some 2,000 grit sandpaper, which is actually very smooth

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.119
I'm hoping for a little bit of a shiny look on it

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.369
Did get a little bit of cracking along the back as it baked but

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.759
Pretty minor it's on the back. I'm not worried about it

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.230
Of course I don't want to sand so much that I lose any of the details. I carved in

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.829
But it's a pretty fine grit sandpaper, so I'm not very worried

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.899
All right, that's with the 800. Let's move on to our mm

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.430
Mm. Grit, sandpaper, it doesn't even really feel like sandpaper. Just kind of feels like normal paper. Honestly, but

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.440
It does make a difference

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.249
There we go I think our heart of Te Fiti stone is now complete, and I think it's looking really good

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.049
So let's use our two-part silicon mold rubber and make a mold on this stone

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.770
Now to make sure that we are able to pour our candy into our mold

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.539
I have a little bit of this modeling clay that I'm going to attach to our heart of Te Fiti stone

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.260
to make a pour spout

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.450
So that it's not just completely closed up once the whole thing is covered in silicone

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.609
There will be an opening where this bit of clay is that's where we'll be able to pour in the candy so now

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.240
We've got our two-part silicone. It's just two putties that look

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.880
kind of like silly putty really a

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.970
couple of blobs there's a blob of purple a

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.720
Blob of white those look about the same size, maybe just a smidgen more white now. We need to squish those all together

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.239
Let's just knead this until it's all one uniform color with no more streaks in it there

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.090
We go that looks like one smooth texture. No more streaking no more marbling. Let's apply it to our stone

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.139
Smooshing it down because I want a nice smooth flat surface that I can press in to really pick up all of the details of

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.139
Our little part of taffy tea here

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.839
If you recall this stuff can actually do really good detail on the thumb suckers

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.699
We were able to pick up Grant and my fingerprints in the thumbs

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.380
So I'm hoping that the level of detail in the stone will be no problem for it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960
Alright, it's nice and enveloped

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.879
And I'm just gonna stick that down onto the counter and give it a nice flat spot

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.169
Hopefully that will make it so that we're trying to pour candy into it it will hold itself up nicely

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.159
I've also added a little bit of a thicker Ridge on this side

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.329
That's where we'll cut in the mold open to be able to pull out our heart of Te Fiti

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.669
stone master and the candy once

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.820
We've cast it in there

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.359
Our silicone mold should only take 15 or 20 minutes to cure before we can take out the yellow heart of taffy D

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.180
stone inside it and while it's doing that we're gonna get started making our candy as I explained we want to use some of the

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.039
Coloring in the b2 vitamins in our candy to make it so it will glow under a blacklight

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.280
So let's take out a few of these tablets and grind them up into a powder

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.609
That will hopefully dissolve into some water. You can see these are pretty bright yellow colored although

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.419
They don't look like they're anything really spectacular. It's just sort of yellow tablets

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.960
I'm going to start with just two of them and see how much powder we get out of that two of these tablets into our

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.669
mortar

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.758
Starts pushing it up pestle

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.729
I think this one's the mortar. This is the pestle but maybe I have that backwards

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.989
That grinds up into a powder very quickly

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.669
Our candy recipe calls for 3/4 cups of water, so that's how much I have in this little pot here

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.698
I'm going to now pour our powder into our pot

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.280
Now let's do a test with our backlight to see how much this water and riboflavin mixture will glow

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.800
Whew

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.659
We'll give that

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.079
Without the backlight with the black light

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.750
That lights up

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:44.110
beautifully

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.460
It's such a good bright color. I'm excited. You can see everywhere

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.810
That's flashed onto the counter, so we've got our mixture, and that's blowing really well

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.229
But it has a lot of this thick yellow powder down in it

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.529
And I really just want the water to be glowing on its own

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.089
So let's see if we can filter out all of the yellow powder, so we're just left with the dyed water

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:08.218
We've got a coffee filter here and a mason jar without the covering part of the lid

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:12.179
I have the ring, so let's just stuff the coffee filter down in most of the way

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.889
Hold it over the lip

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:18.779
And screw the ring over the coffee filter this way

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.999
It'll hold all the liquid and I don't have to try and hold the filter on with one hand while I'm pouring

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.289
It's just better

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:28.289
alright here goes

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:37.229
It's so bright that looks like just straight highlighter ink straight out of the world of Avatar or something

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:39.820
just like

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.990
straining out

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:48.180
Concentrated magic now. We have some essence of b2 vitamin, and it glows beautifully in a black light

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.789
Let's use this to make our candy one thing I did talk about how I didn't want to use quinine because it's extremely bitter

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.029
Riboflavin doesn't taste all that great either, but I'm hoping that

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:03.209
Diluted like this and mixed in with all of the sugar in the candy it'll be pretty good and just as a small test

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.209
I'm gonna take a sip of this and see how it is

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.330
It's not great it does have a little bit of a bitter taste to it and a little bit

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.650
like dirt I

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.380
Guess but it's pretty mild

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.140
I think it's a flavor that could easily be masked by all the sugar and the flavorings we're going to add to our candy

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.940
We'll see once we're finished. Our candy recipe if you don't remember it is two cups of sugar

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.610
2/3 cups of corn syrup and

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.310
3/4 cups of water

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.959
And as our water we have our neon glowy juice

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.430
Now let's throw this on the stove and stir it until all of the sugar is dissolved

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.409
There we go, I think the sugar at this point is just about dissolved, so let's put in the candy thermometer and let it go

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.349
260 degrees Fahrenheit, it's time to add some food coloring

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.009
I'm just gonna add a little bit of green to try and match the color of the movie

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.639
We don't need to stir the color in the bubbling action will do that for us

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.490
Right at 300 remove from the heat

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.779
We're going with a nice lemon flavor today lime maybe would have matched the color better, but lime flavoring is a lot harder to find

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.410
While the candy is cooking on the stove, let's de mold our heart of Te Fiti stone

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.529
And see how it turned out pop this clay right off?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.150
Take a razor, and we'll carefully cut along the edge of it

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.730
Pull that out

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.169
It's looking pretty good in there see quite a bit of our carved in details

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.990
I like that let's actually just use a little bit of electrical tape wrapped around this to hold it closed

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.270
Now I'm quite sure if I try and pick up the whole pot and pour it into that little spot, I'm just gonna spill

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:23.119
Everywhere, so I'm gonna try scooping up some candy in this spoon and drizzly get in a little bit slower

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.210
That looks like a spoonful of

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.180
Ninja Turtle ooze

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.510
And I'm still spilling it all over so

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.299
Imagine how much worse it would be if I use the whole pot I think that is full

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.820
Okay our mold has cooled down

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:50.390
I think so it's time to see how our candy heart of Te Fiti has turned out take off this tape

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.800
little shards of

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.830
Candy that dribbled on the outside come on

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.860
more shards

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.720
So far looking good

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.780
Oh yeah

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:17.820
Beautiful, I'm just gonna break off a little pour spout stuff on top, but that has some pretty good details in it. It's not

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.100
Perfect, but you can tell what that is that looks a lot like the one in the movie

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.020
That is really cool now

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.139
It does have a little bit of a frost and texture that we often get from the candy

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.429
So I am gonna try hitting with some heat. I'll start on the back and see if it's working there

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.270
I'm just gonna use our little

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.270
wind resistant lighter here

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.359
See if I can clear it up just a little bit

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.570
Yes, just like that

00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:49.089
Beautiful

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.969
Now I actually went ahead and made two other molds as well so that I could produce

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:00.189
Multiple of these Hearts of Te Fiti at once so let's see how these ones turned out

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.050
beautiful three

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.469
Hearts of Te Fiti. One of which is a lollipop. That's pretty excellent. It's gonna taste

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.170
some of these little scraps here

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.089
I'm really good. I can't take any of the bitterness from the riboflavin

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.909
I'm just getting sugar and lemon that's really good well

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.459
There's one more very important test and that's to see how well these hearts glow in blacklight

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:37.680
I'm excited. I think they're gonna glow really well. Alright here goes. We've got our backlight. We've got our heart. Ah

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.000
HA! Oh that looks amazing

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.240
Look at that glowing Oh even better

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.810
glowing green

Heart of Te Fiti stone

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:03.200
There we go our heart of Te Fiti candy glowing under backlight stones turned out just the way I was hoping they would they're

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.880
Translucent, but not a hundred percent clear like the ones in the movie

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:13.570
They're made of candy not like the ones in the movie, and they glow under a blacklight, which is just it looks so

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:20.739
Cool the b2 vitamin tablets that we use to get the color and the glowing effect did not affect the taste negatively

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.720
You really can't taste the bitterness at all

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.140
And it just the glowing is phenomenal and that was just with two tablets for this whole batch of candy it working really well

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.880
This is a very fun project

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.529
You can sculpt kind of whatever shape you want and mold it and then make your own shape of candy

00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:40.898
We've done something similar with our thumb suckers of course, but I really just wanted to try the glowing aspect of it

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.900
I'm very happy with how it turned out

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.640
