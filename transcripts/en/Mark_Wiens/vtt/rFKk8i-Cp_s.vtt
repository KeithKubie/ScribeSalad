00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.793
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm in Chiang Mai, Thailand,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.900
and today we're gonna go on
a Northern Thai food tour

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.733
of Chiang Mai.

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.566
We're gonna eat at the market,

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.910
we're gonna eat at some
street food stalls,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.090
we're gonna go to some restaurants,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.440
and we're gonna eat a mix of food,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.670
but especially focus
on a dish called laap,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.000
which is a Northern Thai
mixed meat dish full of spice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.060
It's so good.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.600
Mostly we're just gonna have a lot of fun.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.350
We're gonna eat some incredibly delicious

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.090
Northern Thai food and I'm
gonna share it all with you

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.302
in this video right now.

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.885
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.747
Our first destination
this morning is called

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.580
(speaking foreign language) and
it is a market in Chiang Mai

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.830
known for Northern Thai food.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.130
They have a specific stall here

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.520
that serves one of the
best versions of sai oua,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.690
which is the Northern Thai sausage,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.800
which is guaranteed to make
one of the best breakfasts.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.633
But walking around the market,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:55.750
it's just sort of opening up.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.280
They have some curry stalls.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.910
You can get fruit and vegetables here too,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880
and one of the great
things about this market

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.220
is it's actually not too big,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.610
yet it's big enough.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.193
So it's manageable, it's friendly.

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:11.427
Let's go find that sausage.

00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:14.010
(upbeat music)

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.460
The grill is just loaded
with curls of sausage.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.330
You can smell the lemongrass in the air.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.907
The stall is called
(speaking foreign language),

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.010
and they also have another few delights,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.660
Northern delights in packets,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.600
which we're gonna try
this specific one here.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.040
They have some (speaking
foreign language),

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.707
but the real thing you're gonna...

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:39.293
Oh, there is it, the curly,
the curly rolls of sausage.

00:01:40.378 --> 00:01:41.630
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.126
Just given me a sample.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:46.167
(upbeat music)

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:48.338
Oh, oh, the lemongrass.

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:52.005
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.620
- [Mark] Oh look at those cutting skills.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.110
He just flew through that curl of sausage

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.943
slicing it up.

00:01:58.943 --> 00:02:00.730
That was impressive.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.540
He has some sausage cutting skills.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.470
The aroma of the lemongrass and the herbs

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.560
just bursts out of that sausage.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.570
Joel has since joined.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.770
We got a whole bag of it now

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.660
and it's just steaming hot.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.760
It's right off the grill.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.310
It even fogged up my lens
as soon as I got close

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.370
taking a photo of it.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.570
That is an aroma.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.700
That is an aromatherapy.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.533
Cheers.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:19.366
- Cheers, dude.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.960
- I was so excited I forgot
about the little stick

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.900
that's tying the intestines
closed at the end.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.960
Some of the best sai oua I've ever had

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.900
for sure without a doubt.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.470
It's so herbaceous.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.950
Mm, so heavy on the lemongrass,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.630
and to me it actually
doesn't taste as fatty

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.510
as some other versions,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.830
because it's not, it juices,
but not like that fatty,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.450
fatty juiciness that you sometimes get.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.033
It's more heavy on the herbs which I love.

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.152
That is dangerously tasty.

00:02:59.152 --> 00:03:00.560
You could munch through a whole bag

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.760
without even thinking about it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.010
at 7:00am in the morning.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.220
Follow that with a little sticky rice.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.660
There's one more little packet

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.690
that we need to taste next.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.060
One of my favorite thing is to eat

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.120
in Northern Thailand is called
(speaking foreign language),

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.630
which is a little packet.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.830
It can be meat, it can be herbs,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.400
it can be vegetables which are packed

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.100
into banana leaf wrapper
and then roasted grilled

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.545
over fire, over charcoal.

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.930
But the supreme version.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.540
The most gourmet,
greatest, richest version

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360
is called (speaking foreign language),

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.350
which is pig brains mixed
with spices and herbs

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.668
that needs to be eaten with sticky rice.

00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:39.251
(upbeat music)

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.570
All the creaminess.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.660
It's a fine custard on top of sticky rice

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.103
with a little bit of a lemongrass flavor.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.680
You got a 12 kilo bag of sai oua to go.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.347
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.020
That was for sure some of the best sai oua

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.710
I've ever had in Chiang Mai.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.010
Really good, really top quality.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.860
Such an herbaceous mix,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.490
and one thing you should know is

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.380
that sai oua is one of
those things that you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.680
cannot return back to Bangkok without it,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.510
giving to friends and family.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.260
They will not be happy with you

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.610
if you came back empty handed.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.010
So Ying bought...

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.693
How many bags did you buy, Ying?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.930
- Five kilo.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.645
- Ying bought five kilos.

00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:31.340
(laughing)

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.410
We're walking out of the market,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.950
because we've got many
more thing to eat today.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.800
I've gotta get one more bite
of that sai oua over here.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.000
Oh, look at that hanger. (laughing)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.340
That piece just stuck together.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.880
It kind of inverted.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.360
It insided out, you wanna
take this to your mouth

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.931
as fast as possible.

00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:50.514
(upbeat music)

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.030
That is like the
definition of what sai oua

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.930
should taste like.

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.310
We're underneath the,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.410
underneath the camera.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.890
Okay but we have decided to go,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.060
it's a little bit North of Chiang Mai City

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.750
to a place that has an
insane looking meat grill,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.900
and we'll get a couple of
Northern Thai grilled meat

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.370
delights there before,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.310
there's one place that we have to be back.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.260
We have to be there by 11:00am to get

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.200
what is supposed to be one
of the top places to eat laap

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.157
in all of Chiang Mai.

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:34.980
But we're on our way first
to eat some grilled meat

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.380
and maybe some other things.

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.332
(upbeat music)

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.123
That was about a 30 minute drive or so.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.300
This restaurant is north of Chiang Mai

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.617
and it's called (speaking
foreign language).

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.360
They do have a selfie position,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.420
but let's try to get a look.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.750
Oh yes, yes I can see
the smoke from the grill.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.213
We're here just like 15
minutes before they open.

00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:13.708
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:18.351
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.280
Right now it's just in full bloom.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.150
The entire grill is just covered with meat

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.790
and different banana leaf packets.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.760
You can see the curly intestines.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.546
You can see the pork,
you can see the catfish,

00:06:28.546 --> 00:06:30.180
the pig ears.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.570
Oh man, it is all there.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.840
The grill, it smells so good,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.550
but not only do they have the entire grill

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.430
just smoldering away,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.640
but they have a lot of different Northern,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.260
whoa, I just almost got
knocked out by the pole there.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.690
They have a lot of
Northern curries and soups.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.370
They have a full Northern
Thai food selection,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.715
and also includes the
(speaking foreign language),

00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:53.500
which we gotta get as well.

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:56.999
(upbeat music)

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.480
The main dish that we
ordered is the mixed grill,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.170
so he's rummaging through.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.240
This is just a grill to behold,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.010
but he is going through
the different parts.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.860
The snout, the ears, the intestines,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.600
chopping bits off and assembling
them all onto a plate.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.683
Oh, look at that.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.280
We had to actually hold ourselves back

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.510
from ordering too much,
because we have lots more

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.770
to eat today.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.160
But it looks so good.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.370
We got some of their specialties,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.420
especially the (speaking
foreign language),

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.820
which is all that mix of grilled meats.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.870
Another thing that have here

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.270
is the (speaking foreign language),

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.650
which is one of their specialties,

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.680
and so that's like a fermented pork,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.347
which is roasted in a banana leaf.

00:07:40.347 --> 00:07:42.620
But we saw him as he was making one.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.720
They first roast just the pork

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.730
and then he cracks on an egg onto the top.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.000
So that's like just a next level,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.250
a new type of fried egg

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.470
with just an entire base of fermented pork

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.920
on the bottom, all wrapped
in a packet banana leaf.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.750
Oh man, that look storage so good.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.140
I think we have to start on that.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.870
The entire base is just all fermented pork

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.280
down there, and then you've got the yolk

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.700
just nestled on top.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.470
It also comes with a little bowl

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.014
of raw chilies and garlic
which you also chase with.

00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:15.664
Wanna get a dosage of the skin and,

00:08:15.664 --> 00:08:17.180
oh, look at the yolk.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.330
Be sure to coast your sticky rice in yolk

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.530
and grab a bit of everything.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.609
So gooey and collageny.

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:27.192
(upbeat music)

00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:31.239
Oh, that's so gooey.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.450
Perfectly sour, so garlicky.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.750
Oh wow, and the creaminess of the yolk,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.680
and you gotta follow that.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.710
Chili and garlic combo,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.595
and since this is Thai,
(speaking foreign language),

00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:43.108
Thai garlic, you can
actually eat the skin.

00:08:43.108 --> 00:08:45.691
(upbeat music)

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.160
That just elevates your entire mouth.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.893
Look at this multi-colored chili.

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:55.501
Wow.

00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:00.230
It's so porky, porkilucious.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.400
Okay, let's move on to
the next grill here.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.890
Dip it into the sauce, get a look at that.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.340
That looks delicious as well.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.613
Oh, dude.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.100
Oh, the meat is so tender and
so smokey, and their sauce.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.950
Their sauce has like a different taste.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.620
Almost like a Worcestershire
sauce flavor to it.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.520
And typically my favorite piece

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.170
from the (speaking foreign
language) of Northern Thailand

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.350
of the mixed grill is the intestines.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.460
Heres a little guy.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.710
Give this a good soaking.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.570
Intestines are the best.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.171
They have like a, mm, you know
what I taste in that sauce

00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:39.890
is a little bit of galangal.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.770
Oh man, but the intestines,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.430
they have that perfect balance of chewy,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.320
crunchy, crispy, like, everything,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.600
all the textures in your mouth.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.900
As you do keep on chewing
the flavors release.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.780
I think right here, this one is the snout.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.060
Look at that, it's just pure. (giggles)

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.413
I think this one is the
pig nose, the snout.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:07.090
Mm, oh, oh the snout, dude.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:12.090
It's so fatty and gelatinous
but the edges are so crispy.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.740
Mm, mm, oh that is like a burst of smokey,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.236
fattiness in your mouth.

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:21.240
(speaking foreign language).

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.377
We got some (speaking foreign language).

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.380
This is made from some type of a mushroom,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.380
but made with some chilies in there too.

00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:31.526
Mm.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.863
Oh, oh that is, that's insatianally good.

00:10:35.863 --> 00:10:38.120
But you've got the roasted green chilies,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.960
but at the same time you
have that meaty flavor

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.884
from the mushrooms.

00:10:40.884 --> 00:10:42.490
And this is some type of a, I don't know

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.860
if I've ever heard of
this, but it's like a beef,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.170
oh there's lemongrass in there,

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.583
a beef stew or a beef soup.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.520
Oh, that tastes like beef stew,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.220
but with more of a
lemongrass flavor to it.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.420
And this one is the
(speaking foreign language),

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.250
which is a young jackfruit curry.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.230
There's also pork bones in here.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.290
They topped it with
cilantro and green onions.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.507
And then this is a chunk
of the young jackfruit.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.920
Like a light pork soup, and
the pieces of young jackfruit

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.840
are kind of, they're starchy.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.210
They're starchy rather than sweet

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.810
at that stage when it's a young jackfruit.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.104
And finally we just wanted to try their

00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:18.270
(speaking foreign language),

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.200
which, so you gotta
kinda turn the bowl here,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.930
because it has a lip and there's a shadow,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.410
but this is one of Ying's favorite dishes,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.630
Northern Thai dishes, and so
we had to try some of that.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.230
Oh, that pork just flakes
apart, it's so tender.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.530
Oh, I lost my sticky rice.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.530
Mm, mm yeah.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.593
Ying is the best judge at
(speaking foreign language).

00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:40.668
What do you think, Ying?

00:11:40.668 --> 00:11:41.501
- It's very good.

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.900
- The ginger is really nice in there.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.203
You taste the pickled garlic as well.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.370
Just that slightly part flavor.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.680
The ginger stands out though,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.083
and that pork is really, really tender.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.410
Man, that was some incredibly good food.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.170
I think the thing that stood out to me.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.050
Their (speaking foreign
language) was delicious

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.240
with the fried egg on top,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.910
but their mixed grill,
man, this is a place

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.820
that you wanna get some
takeaway grilled meat

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.160
for your next party, that is for sure.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.190
And we got our bill.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.960
The total bill for all
that food came to 390 baht.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.120
We've gotta move kind of quickly now,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.730
because we've gotta get
to the next restaurant

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.910
right as they open, because otherwise

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.700
they're only open for three hours per day.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.070
We wanna get there right as they open

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.283
to get that first selection.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.100
They sell out very fast.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.730
But yeah, just as you have
probably noticed already

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.450
since we've been eating this morning.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.310
Northern Thai food is
quite heavy on the meat,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.530
and yeah, people love to eat meat

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.530
so we're gonna eat like the ultimate

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.083
of meat dishes in Northern Thailand next.

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:46.757
(upbeat music)

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.310
And it's right along
the side of the highway.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.080
It just opened up, it's 11 right now,

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.870
but already all of these cars,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.750
everyone is rushing for the laap.

00:13:02.028 --> 00:13:05.330
(upbeat music)

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.980
Yes, this is the spot right here.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.270
There's almost like a bar counter seating

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.380
at the front and then you walk back

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.990
into the yard, into the house here.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.420
I'm not even sure if
they have a menu here,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.490
but Ying instructed that we need to order

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.380
the (speaking foreign language),

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.660
which is the, it's buffalo laap,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.573
minced buffalo raw.

00:13:22.682 --> 00:13:24.173
Oh, there it is right there.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.060
It's only been open for like five minutes

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.290
and those are the orders already.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.310
Actually all the seats are taken already.

00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:36.194
(upbeat music)

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.040
Just from the way he moves the bowl,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.020
he is such a master.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.650
He's focused on the laap.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.370
That's all raw minced buffalo.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.570
So it's really, dark, dark
like maroon, beat red.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.400
He adds in a lot of
(speaking foreign language),

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.780
which is the bile.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.990
He adds in some powders,
some spices, he mixes that.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.780
He almost mixes it like
a cake batter style,

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.960
revolving the pan as he scoops and stirs,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.933
mixing all these spices.

00:14:21.933 --> 00:14:24.060
Oh, that looks so good and people are here

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.893
just waiting now.

00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:27.020
This is the takeaway section.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.010
You know it's a good spot
when there's a buffalo skull

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.520
hanging in the kitchen.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.810
Look how cool this is.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.510
This is something you'll
rarely see anymore.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.343
The traditional style.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:40.613
This is the coconut shell on a stick.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.823
We've been waiting for probably,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.520
yeah, 40 minutes, but it's
gonna be so worth the wait.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.610
They already had quite a few,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.610
like at least 10 or 15
orders before we got here,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.183
and we got here at 11:02.

00:15:05.374 --> 00:15:07.860
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.310
She just brought us the
(speaking foreign language),

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.650
and that is the dish that everybody.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.910
You can order, they probably
have only five things

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.240
on their menu, but this is a dish

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.150
that everybody orders here.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.100
This is what you come here for.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.570
He added heaps, not only,
he scooped in at least,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.570
in that bowl, at least five
giants spoons of green bile.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.633
Oh, oh, hot.

00:15:29.633 --> 00:15:30.466
- [Joel] I'm drooling.

00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:33.693
- Oh, look at that, it's so fine.

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:39.010
Oh, and cool, that's
like the texture of jam.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.823
It literally looks like strawberry jam.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.743
- Cheers, man.

00:15:53.134 --> 00:15:55.467
(chuckling)

00:15:58.089 --> 00:15:58.922
- Oh, wow.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.250
Okay, I'm just speechless.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.410
I just wanna lick my fingers.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.743
(chuckling)

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.690
It literally is like jam.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.640
It's such a fine grind.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.428
Maybe even like liquified buffalo.

00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:19.261
- It's almost like--

00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:20.570
- But it's like jelly a little bit,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.980
'cause of the blood.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.640
(giggling)

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.780
- That's thick.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.550
- It's like a buffalo's
meat, and then he does,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.040
oh man, he's such a master.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.260
It has that perfect bitter bite,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.126
but not overpowering.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:35.940
And makhwaen, I think there's
some makhwaen in there,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.940
which is the citron, pepper-like spice,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.560
we have a little bit of zing.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.070
And just the fact that he
beat it like a cake batter,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.560
that took out all the air bubbles

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.950
and probably coagulated the blood,

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.260
so that's why it's kind of
almost like smoothie-ish.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.470
I cannot wait to take another bite.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.653
Look at the texture of that.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.460
That is a ground breaking plate of laap.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.350
And then you gotta have a herb basket

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:08.090
when you eat laap.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.125
I'm gonna go in for some of this one,

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.150
is the (speaking foreign language),

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.850
which is english is often
called Vietnamese coriander.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.270
- Thanks, man.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.170
(upbeat music)

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.480
- And that just goes so
well, that cleans the palate.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.600
We also got some (speaking
foreign language).

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.170
This is the soup that's boiling

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.850
with a lot of animals parts
in it in the back there,

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.980
in the kitchen.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.050
Oh yeah, there's meat in here,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.170
there's lung, there's all the organs.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.730
That looks great, I'm gonna grab.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.893
Oh, did I score a piece of rumen?

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.408
That could be an inner-stomach
chunk right there.

00:17:42.408 --> 00:17:44.991
(upbeat music)

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:46.883
Oh yeah.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.880
That's a grassy, livery chunk.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.753
I got a little bit of digested
grass in that bite for sure.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.430
That's a soothing broth.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.078
Maybe a little bit of this.

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:01.753
A little bit of this dry spice blood.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.273
(upbeat music)

00:18:09.226 --> 00:18:11.250
- Oh, with the extra spice blood.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.133
Oh, that is I think mostly makhwaen.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.250
You wanna be a little bit careful.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.403
Look at those thorns.

00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.333
Just be careful of those thorns.

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:24.959
Mm, it's bitter and then
followed by sweetness.

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:26.580
(laughing)

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.507
- The best price and the best taste--

00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:31.220
- Of laap.
- Of laap--

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.700
- In Northern Thailand.
- In Northern Thailand.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.690
- Yes, he has just informed us.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.560
And it was, it was so good.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.530
Another Northern Thai
dish that they have here

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.560
is called (speaking foreign language).

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.800
It can be raw, but we got the
(speaking foreign language),

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.190
which it's like, flash blanched.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.450
It's slices of meat,
also mixed with spices.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.490
You can see the garlic in there.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.550
You can see the herbs.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.420
There may be some digestive juices

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.770
and liquids in there as well,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.520
but then that also looks delicious.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.093
Oh.

00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:04.770
Oh wow.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.350
It's so bitter it's almost sweet.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.350
You've got a jolt of
bile bitterness in there.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.150
That's a digestive meat
broth that you wanna

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.233
just let your sticky rice soak in.

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:20.122
(upbeat music)

00:19:21.524 --> 00:19:22.357
Wow.

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:24.580
From appearance it looks like an average,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.323
slightly sauteed beef dish,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.560
but I can assure you

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.840
there's enough flavor in there
to just excite your mouth

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.700
and tongue for days.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.123
That flavor might linger
on your tongue for days.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.570
- So I think...

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.352
Is this 300 baht?

00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:45.269
- 200 baht.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.668
Half a kilo.

00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:48.820
- Half a kilo.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.210
So we got (speaking foreign language).

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.430
100 grams, they got 500 grams.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.448
- That's half a kg of the laap.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.073
They know what they're doing.

00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:02.870
You'd be definitely getting it wrong

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.703
by only getting 100 grams.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.045
- Oh, yeah.

00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:06.889
- We should have gotten the half kg.

00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:11.050
(speaking foreign language)

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.760
- The guy sitting behind
us that we just left from,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.820
they said this is the best...

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.610
They think it's the best place for laap

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.660
in all of Northern Thailand,

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.060
and that's really quite a bold claim,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.100
but I would not argue
with them whatsoever.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.570
- I think I'm a bit
buzzing from all that bile.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.067
My mouth is buzzing, I'm
even stumbling a little bit.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.760
- Man, if we ended this food
tour right now, right here

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.780
I would be very, very happy,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.530
but I think we might have
to go to one more place

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.160
just to like, just to eat some more food

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.730
and just gather our thoughts after that.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.730
Oh, Ying, that was the
greatest plate of laap

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.865
I've ever had in my entire life.

00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:57.532
(speaking foreign language)

00:20:59.533 --> 00:21:02.820
Oh, Ying, it was unbelievable.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.420
And by the way, thank you to Ying.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.520
She is the one that...

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.081
She discovered that spot for us.

00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:10.560
She said that we had to go there.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.667
Thank you, Ying.

00:21:11.667 --> 00:21:13.634
- You welcome.

00:21:13.634 --> 00:21:16.217
(upbeat music)

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.800
- We made it to the final place.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.550
This is the final laap restaurant.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.650
Northern Thai restaurant.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.857
It's called (speaking foreign language),

00:21:24.729 --> 00:21:27.750
and it's actually quite packed right now.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.703
It's kind of a whole courtyard area.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.730
This restaurant specializes in laap,

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.940
but they also have a number,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.830
quite a mix of Northern Thai dishes,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.420
including a few curries and soups

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.425
and some things from the grill as well.

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:44.008
(upbeat music)

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.790
I think most of the
dishes have just arrived.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.940
The two center pieces,
these are the two laaps

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.270
that we got, but then we
got also some other dishes

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.610
that we had to taste.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.520
Check out this mountain of lemongrass,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.710
this (speaking foreign language).

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.923
Okay but let's come back to that later.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.430
Sticky rice.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.531
You can actually see the
chili seeds in there.

00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:13.283
Oh wow, that is like a, it
looks like frog skin almost.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.480
Okay, but I'm gonna save that for later.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.680
I'm just gonna go into this.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.513
- [Joel] So soft.

00:22:18.513 --> 00:22:19.500
- Look at all the herbs and stuff,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.833
and the spices in there.

00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:24.180
But you can see how that's
not nearly as red dark

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.374
as the buffalo.

00:22:25.374 --> 00:22:27.957
(upbeat music)

00:22:31.342 --> 00:22:33.675
That is incredibly good too.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.040
The bitterness, the bile in there,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.171
and the the makhwaen
that comes in so nicely.

00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:44.603
That citrusy, zinginess,
look at that texture.

00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:47.967
(upbeat music)

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.300
You could say...

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:53.395
It's not, it kinda has that snappy,

00:22:53.395 --> 00:22:54.442
cartilag texture to it.

00:22:54.442 --> 00:22:56.800
Then next, this is a cooked plate of laap

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.410
made with pig, pork.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.760
You can see the toasted garlic in there,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.860
the cilantro and the green onions

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.260
and the fried garlic on top.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.737
- [Both] Yes.

00:23:12.737 --> 00:23:14.970
- The garlicky goodness, oh my.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.510
- They cooked is so good as well.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.930
It's all the same spices
as in the raw version.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.270
Just it's more like a warm feel,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.770
as apposed to the refreshing
coolness of raw meat.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.963
Slightly soured, slightly
fermented pork little riblets.

00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:34.663
Mm, oh yes.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.700
So salty, it's so crispy,
it's so fatty, oily.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.280
That is awesome. (chuckles)

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.840
Next dish is called
(speaking foreign language).

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.910
I think it's mostly shin pieces of beef.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.483
A mix of beef that's steamed.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.987
And then served with
(speaking foreign language),

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.410
which is red eyed chili sauce.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.370
- We've had so much meat today,

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.291
and I'm still excited for each bite.

00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:59.109
Look at that.

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:01.692
(upbeat music)

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.070
- This is straight up, like a Sunday roast

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.270
with a really smooth chili taste.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.560
It's actually not spicy.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560
Well rounded in flavor.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.100
You taste the chili, you taste

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.733
something fermented in there.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.183
Oh yeah.

00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:25.380
Oh.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.240
Oh, that one has like a,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.560
like a lemon feel, lime feel, zest to it.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.400
The next dish is called
(speaking foreign language)

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.500
and it's with fish, and
this is a Northern curry.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.550
I've never had it before.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.310
There's fish in it, and lotus stems in it.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.700
You can see the curry paste in it.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.903
It looks like a sauce almost.

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:50.392
It tastes pickled almost.

00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:51.890
Like the whole curry's pickled,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.290
and then you've got the
crunch of those lotus stems.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.360
Like that same kind of
crispness of celery,

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.653
but really soft and
tender at the same time.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.787
The (speaking foreign language).

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.620
It's a fried fish and
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.360
just means like a mix of Thai herbs,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.550
which is mostly lemongrass

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.070
and kaffir lime leaves in this case.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.720
Dip that into the sauce,
and maybe chase it

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.963
with some of that lemongrass,
that fried lemongrass.

00:25:19.187 --> 00:25:20.020
Mm.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.520
That's just, it's just like classic good.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.770
The crunchy fried fish, the
sour, garlicky chili sauce,

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.264
the fragrance of lemongrass.

00:25:33.264 --> 00:25:35.847
(upbeat music)

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.113
It's deep fried strands of
lemongrass, it's so good.

00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:47.373
Oh, that's good.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.540
The bile, it never gets old.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.530
I can say with certainty that
this is one of the best days

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.840
of Northern Thai food in Chiang Mai.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.920
Well, without a doubt the
best day of food in Chiang Mai

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.940
that I've ever had.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.910
I'll have all the information
of all the restaurants

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.330

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.760
