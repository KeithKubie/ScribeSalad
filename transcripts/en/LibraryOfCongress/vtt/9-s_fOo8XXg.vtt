00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.800
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.690
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Hello,
and welcome to the Poetry

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.450
and Prose Stage which
has been supported

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.850
by the National Endowment
for the Arts,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.170
the NEA since the festival began
and I'm glad to be able to say

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.540
that we're continuing
our support.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.290
My name is Amy Stolls and I
direct the Literature Program

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.510
at the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.570
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.390
That was the total
plan right there.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.550
We celebrate literature as an
art and an essential reflection

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.300
of our nation's rich diversity
of voices and we do this

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.350
by helping writers and
translators create work

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.140
and connect with
audiences through publishers

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.940
and other literary organizations
and programs like this festival.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.900
So, we're really excited to
have, I'm particularly excited

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.880
because I'm such a big fan
of the three and I want

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.740
to call you poets,
but then also writers

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.460
and they'll talk about that.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.060
This is a conversation we've
titled Poets Writing Prose

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.290
and we're going to hopefully
unpack that title for you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.350
as we discuss and maybe
theorize, reassociate,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.810
tell stories, about what exactly
we mean by poetry and prose

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990
and how we individually

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.390
and collectively approach
the writing and reading

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.340
and subject matter of
those genres, so I'm going

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.320
to briefly introduce each
of our distinguished guests.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.130
So, I think maybe hold
your applause until we get

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420
to the end then we'll really
give them huge applause

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.660
and then we're going to,
well it needs to be organic,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.300
but I imagine that we'll chat
and then each of them will read

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.570
for a bit then we'll
chat some more

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.040
and then we'll entertain
questions

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.420
from the audience, okay.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.480
So, let's see, Patrick
Rosal is the author

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.040
of four full-length
poetry collections.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.960
His latest book "Brooklyn
Antediluvian",

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.860
I feel like I'm going to do
do-do-do-do-do as you go down

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.440
and look for the books in
the bookstore; is the author

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460
of "Brooklyn Antediluvian",
was published in 2016

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.910
and won the Academy of American
Poets Martial Poetry Prize

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.070
and was a finalist for the
Kingsley Tufts Award for poetry.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.800
His collections have been
honored with the Association

and the Asian-American Writers
Workshop Members Choice Award.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.650
He has received a Guggenheim
Fellowship, a Fulbright,

and an NEA Creative
Writing Fellowship in Prose,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.540
and his essays and reviews
have appeared in a wide variety

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.070
of distinguished publications
and he's taught and presented

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.800
in many different
places and venues

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.310
around the country and abroad.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.100
Currently, he calls
Philadelphia home,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.590
teaches at the M.F.A. Program
at Rutgers University in Camden,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.400
although this year now you're
going to be at Princeton, right?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.700
And I just found out last night

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.040
that also you are a
jazz musician, right?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.760
Playing instrument
with drums as well?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.360
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Piano, guitar
and some [inaudible], yeah.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.700
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Camille Dungy.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.290
Camille is the author of
four collections of poetry.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.530
Her most recent and
I'm going to show this,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.940
is "Trophic Cascade"
published in 2017.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.950
It won the Colorado
Book Award, in fact,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.730
her collections have won
and/or been nominated

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.440
for numerous awards.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.760
Also, in 2017, Norton
published her debut collection

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.520
of personal essays, "Guidebook
to Relative Strangers;

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.420
Journeys into Race,
Motherhood, and History"

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.450
which was a finalist for
the National Book Critics

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.750
Circle Award.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.190
She's an editor too, has edited
several anthologies including

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.850
"Black Nature; Four Centuries

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.420
of African-American Nature
Poetry" published in 2009,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.380
and she's received two Creative
Fellowships from the NEA;

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.400
one in poetry and one in Prose.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.760
I should say that Patrick
got his in Prose as well.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.860
I'll explain that in a minute.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.550
And she comes to use
from Fort Collins,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.420
Colorado where she teaches
at Colorado State University.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.130
What was that?

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.270
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I didn't know that,

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.790
my husband is from Fort Collins.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.090
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Oh.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.390
Wow.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.690
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
Conversation piece.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.990
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Restore [brief laughter].

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.290
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Well, you know
I have to say I also just found

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.590
out that Patrick's
dad is an ex-priest.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.890
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: What?!

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.640
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.180
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Okay, wait, wait.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.760
So, this considered; this
is Patricia Lockwood.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.490
Patricia is the author of two
critically acclaimed collections

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.790
of poetry; "Balloon Pop Outlaw
Black" published in 2012

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.890
and her most recent
collection is

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.900
"Motherland Fatherland
Homelandsexuals" published

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.260
by Penguin in 2014.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.620
It was named a best book of the
year by numerous publications

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.160
as was the memoire she published
in 2017 called "Priestdaddy"

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.860
which was among the New York
Times book reviews 10 best books

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.320
of 2017, it was an Amazon
Best Book of the Month

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.700
and was a finalist
for the Kirkus Prize.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.630
It was on the Best
of the Year list put

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.470
out by the Washington Post, the
Chicago Tribune, The New Yorker,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.990
and the PR Publishes
Weekly on and on.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.050
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: You should
say I didn't win any actual

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.350
awards [multiple speakers].

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.810
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Oh, sweetie
I would give you an award.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.110
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Thank you.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.410
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Patricia.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.110
I'm going to get right on that?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.730
It's also worth noting

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.440
that Tricia's writing is
hugely popular on social media

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.490
and I'm saying that because
I think we'll probably talk

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.790
about that.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.660
She has more than 71,000
followers on Twitter,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.830
the Atlantic included two,
I believe of Tricia's tweets

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.130
on its list of the
best tweets of all time

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.310
where she was the only
author included twice.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.820
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I didn't know that.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.450
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: It's
true though [laughter].

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.890
And you have, are
you in Georgia?

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.380
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I
am in Georgia now, yeah.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.680
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: It's
quite the place.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.100
Welcome to D.C. everyone.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.510
Okay, now you can applaud.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.080
[ Applause ]

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.370
Okay, I just; I'm going to say
one more thing then I'm going

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.230
to really back off
and let you talk.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.530
Let me give you a
little background

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.070
about why we're doing
this session,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.040
and that is because it has to do

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.450
with our Fellowship
Program at the NEA.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.770
We give out fellowships
in creative writing,

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.040
but because we get
so many applications

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.990
and we have only one person

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.460
on the staff pretty much doing
this, we had to split them

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.960
to per year, so one year
you can apply in poetry,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.040
the other year you can apply
in prose and that means

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.570
and that means fiction
or creative nonfiction

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.720
and each year we get about 1800
applications and we're able

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.940
to give out roughly about 35

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.160
to 40 fellowships
$25,000 fellowships.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.880
Well, we gave out 36 fellowships
in 2018 and we noticed

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.660
that a large percentage of
the award winners in prose won

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.130
for their creative nonfiction,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.370
but they actually
called themselves poets

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.860
and where mostly known as poets,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.160
and we were thinking
"Wow, what happened?"

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.460
They came over to prose.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.660
It's like an infiltration
of prose for the poets

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.680
and it gave us this idea to
start talking about these genres

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.360
and so my first question I
suppose that I would ask you is,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.270
and I ask this of
you answered this

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.590
through a blog post earlier,
which is, you know, do you see

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.360
or is it fair to say that
you are poet writing prose

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.590
or do you see yourself as
a writer and, you know,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.640
the deeper question is
really if this is, you know,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.520
here's poetry, here's prose,
are they that distinct to you

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.440
or do they kind of, you know?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.070
I'm going to stop with
hand gestures sitting next

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.540
to you Tricia because I feel
like that might get, yeah.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.840
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
We'll do that one again.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.140
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.440
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
That's something.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.740
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.040
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I know it's something.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.340
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.700
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Let me think.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.000
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah, I it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.600
I have to say that my, the whole
idea of sort of the separation

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.190
of genres is a little
bit confusing to me

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.490
for a number of reasons.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.970
One, because when I got to know
the writing of the Philippines

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.820
where my parents are from, what
I realized very quickly was

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.540
that writers were writers
and they wrote everything.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.530
They wrote novels, they wrote
poems, they were journalists,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.220
they were speech
writers for politicians

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.010
and so this whole sort of
market division between,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.040
between genres is not universal.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.610
It's actually an invention.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.790
And the other reason why it's a
little bit confounding to me is

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.900
that I came to books
late in life.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.770
I came to books in my 20s, I'm
a college flunky twice over

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.460
and so my original
love was music.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.580
I wanted to be a
composer and a musician.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.320
I think of all of writing as
an extension really of music.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.210
So, when we're talking about
a kind of a blurring or genre,

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.510
I think that my own sort of
blurring happens across arts.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.710
That means performance,
the means theater,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.850
that means [foreign words
spoken], and that means so many

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.230
of the kinds of musical
and artmaking traditions

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.800
that we have in the
United States.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.360
So, it always feels funny to be
kind of, I'm also an academic

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.900
and to be in a department and
a discipline that is, you know,

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.730
has very specific boundaries,
it's really just kind

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.010
of an invention for
me and I navigate it

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.180
but it doesn't feel very true to
the way that I just make stuff

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.110
and the real enjoyment
of making stuff which is

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.120
across artmaking practices.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I have
kind of a; ooh I'm sorry.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.080
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
No, you can go.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.900
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I
have; do we think it's

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.260
like a whole different
from the romantics

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.300
because it's a true thing
in the United States I think

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.190
or in the West with
like novelists

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.500
as well considering themselves
poets versus [inaudible]

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.890
and I think that's true like
a lot of English novelists,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.980
a lot of American novelists.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.900
So, I wonder if holding
that closer to like the core

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.490
of identity is like a
leftover romantic ideal.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.150
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: The core,
holding that I'm just a writer.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.690
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: A
poet first and foremost.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.990
No. No the opposite.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.450
That thing where it's
like you'll read people

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.360
who have written
like splendid novels

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.960
and their poetry is
absolutely terrible and they're

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.310
like I still consider myself
a poet first and foremost

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.300
and they hold it their core
in almost a romantic way.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.940
So, I wonder about
that a little bit

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.780
because I feel more as you do.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.840
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: I think
I have thought about it

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.330
as a question of marketing and
where you, where you're going

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.900
to place that book in the
library or the bookstore more

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.020
than I have thought about
it as a romantic holdover

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.320
or something like that.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.250
And I think as a writer
of color, part of why,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.350
part of the space for my
resistance to that segregation

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.700
of various modes of writing
has to do with the fact

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.000
that Black writers are

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.140
so frequently separated
anyway, right?

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.270
They, like I remember going to
look for Rita Dove's newest book

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.130
when she was the Poet Laureate
of the United States of America

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.180
and she published a new book
and I went to go find her

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.380
in the bookstore and I couldn't
find her in the poetry section.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.910
And I was informed that she was
in African-American literature

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:38.120
which is true about Rita Dove,
but she was the Poet Laureate

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.320
of the United States, so maybe

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.210
in U.S. literature
she could have been.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.660
And that kind of sense
of categorizing her based

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.380
on one aspect of
her presentation,

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:58.100
I think so many writers that I
grew up admiring wrote all kinds

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.890
of things, Alice Walker.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.940
I remember the books of Alice
Walker were all over the house

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.240
when I was growing up.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.540
She was a poet.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.840
She was an essayist.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.140
She was a novelist, right.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.010
She's a writer that she wrote
what she needed to write

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.410
and I think I came into writing
thinking I'll write the thing

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.230
in the mode it needs to be
written for that purpose

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.320
and the world is going to do
with it what it's going to do.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.780
Like it's not my job to
categorize what I'm writing

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.370
when it's coming out,
because the world is going

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.230
to be plenty of that
categorizing.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.530
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yep.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.830
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Upon me anyway.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.130
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yep.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.430
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: And
I guess when that's true,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.730
as well when it's a matter

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.030
of marketing it's also
a matter of money.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.480
A lot of people who would
consider themselves poets first

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.250
and foremost that's like the
phrase I always have it's

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.840
like etched on my mind; I
don't know where it came from.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.110
You're not going to
make money that way.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.710
So, yeah you're going to
branch into other fields

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.230
and I think it's true.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.720
I think like a genre
is something that flows

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.020
out of you as you're writing.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.630
It's like the form
comes out of you.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.970
It's I don't think about whether
I'm writing poetry or prose

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.800
when I'm doing the
actual writing,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.320
and since as you mentioned
Twitter and things like that,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.170
on Twitter I'm known as a poet.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.520
So, when people come
to my readings

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.650
and they hear me read
anything they call it a poem,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.470
because like they
think that's what I am.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.210
I think that's as
good as anything.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.120
I mean, that makes as
much sense, but yeah,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.330
a huge part of it is that,
you know, like we're not going

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.100
to make a ton of
money doing this.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.790
So, we're going to have to
branch out a little bit.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.090
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: So, wait.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:32.420
When you set out to
write, you're not thinking

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.520
on what I'm writing,
you're not category; really?

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.820
Like you.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: You
know what book you're in.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.420
That's what's true of me.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.880
I know what book I'm in, but
even in the midst of something

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.740
like [inaudible] I'm writing
something that's essentially

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.580
along the poem, so not really.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.620
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: It's kind of
fascinating, because you,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.430
you know, there are; I mean we
all know there are differences

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.730
for example right?

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.520
I mean, like for, you know,
you have we're mostly talking

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.200
about creative nonfiction,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.860
prose almost demands you
declaring it true or not

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.030
because there are these
categorizations that we've grown

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.230
up with, they're fiction,
they're nonfiction, you know,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.830
poetry you have a voice and
there's a little bit more leeway

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.920
in there, and of course,
there's; you know,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.220
one of the different things.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.520
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Right,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.690
but I think that in poetry
also I have a responsibility

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.170
to capital T truth, not facts.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.930
That's not what I'm
talking about.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.910
I'm talking about real
truth; is this believable

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.280
to another human heart, right?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.630
And so, how is that different
than truth in nonfiction, right?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.930
So, I think there's
different things

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.290
that you're doing with the line.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.000
That often when I start

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.700
into writing nonfiction I've
released myself from one

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.460
of poetry's great super powers
which is that the line break

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.100
at the end you have all these
opportunities for variation,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.910
but there's really
beautiful poetry

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.360
that doesn't depend
upon the line either,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.360
so I think sometimes I
know there's an essay

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.670
at the very beginning
of "Guidebook

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.060
to Relative Strangers" where
I'm at an artist colony

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.590
and somebody said like
a ridiculous thing,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.040
and I it was maddening
and rather

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.800
than go drink I went
and wrote about it.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.060
And so, that I knew like
I'm angry about this thing

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.380
and I'm going to write into
that anger and that writing

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.230
into that anger requires
some sort of [inaudible]

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.550
of information and history and
context that it's probably going

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.620
to be too bulky, right, and so
as I start writing it becomes

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.690
and essay and that becomes clear
as I'm writing, but mostly I was

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:53.110
like I am filled with rage
and really practical way

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.610
of dissipating that rage
is to get to the page.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.530
And so, I might have written
a poem, right with that.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.260
It's just in this case I
was driving towards a point

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.460
at length and that ended up
becoming an essay for me.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.860
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: There was
that funny [inaudible] a couple

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.740
of years ago, where
like the it turned

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.990
out The New Yorker was
still fact-checking poems

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.390
and there was like a line

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.940
in a Michael Robbins'
poem I think it was.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.880
It was like the Swedes invented
refrigeration and they wrote

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.090
and they were like "No,
they actually didn't."

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.710
And I think that they stopped
after that point, because I know

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.700
that I had like some poems
and then after that I'm like,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.010
"Oh those are full of lies."

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.720
So, it's good that they're
not doing that anymore.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.520
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: So, go with
me here and imagine a world

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.810
where we don't have these
categorizations than and how,

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.000
so here, you know, did
you; when you came to write

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.880
and you know writing and reading
when you were a kid let's say,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.520
did you come through poems
and then come through?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.540
No, so it really is,
you're shaking your head.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.840
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: I didn't.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.140
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.320
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: I was
kind of a typical product

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.750
of American education which is
to say that I was intimidated

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.010
by poetry and I thought that it
was completely apart from me.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.040
It was apart from my
family as traditions.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.930
It was literary with a capital
L. It was up there and so, yeah,

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.420
poems were not part
of me growing up.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.500
They were part of my entrance
as an adult into loving books,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.360
into you know, really
dedicating my life in terms

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.150
of having a formal
relationship with language,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:36.150
but yeah poetry was not, it
wasn't something that was sort

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.470
of engrained in me
very early on.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.900
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: And I'm
going to say the opposite.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.680
My grandmother was
a school librarian,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.320
an elementary school librarian.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.190
Books were all around and I was
like ecumenical in my reading.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.710
I was just like there
was a book.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.370
It's almost like
Patricia's audiences.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.670
Like it was a book.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.970
I was just reading a book.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:03.850
It just could be anything
and I trapped through poetry

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.570
when I started going in college
and graduate school in poetry,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.940
but even in graduate school
I remember what I was in one

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.160
of those programs that
was very, very isolated.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.710
Like you were in the poetry
trap and you weren't allowed

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.090
to take any of the fiction traps

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.490
and nonfiction wasn't
even a thing

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.060
that they were talking
about at that time.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.830
So, the explosion of nonfiction
is a fascinating space for a lot

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.550
of us to be writing is,
but that was a trap.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.450
But I was sneaking away
writing stories and working

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.970
with the fiction people and
trying to figure out how to,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.780
how to get a kind of
training in prose even

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.690
when I was being disallowed
from it because I was a poet

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.180
and that was what my
job was supposed to be.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.640
I think when, when my
daughter was born I found

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.240
that prose was a way that I can
write because of that training.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.340
That training in poetry
I have been trained

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.930
in now what I've come to call
the person from poor lot school

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.560
of poetry where like when you
write a poem if anybody knocks

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.220
on the door or interrupts
it all the poem is destroyed

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.520
and you can't, you know,

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.790
then that's why we didn't get
the rest of Kubla Khan, right?

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.400
Like, but when you have a
kid like you have the person

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.470
from poor lot knocking on
your door every five minutes

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.080
and because I think I
was untrained in prose,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.550
I can just keep writing
through it and around it,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.480
because I had already
fiercely figured out how to do

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.840
that against all odds
and so it was a wild,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.680
but before my training in my
training in poetry was able

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.020
to be overtaken again by
that freedom that I had found

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.890
in prose which was
from the leftover

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.460
of just you reading something
and you writing it in response.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.840
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Maybe that's why nonfiction

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.520
at the moment feels so
elastic too, if it's true

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.450
that because I don't have
higher education, I don't know,

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.510
but what you're saying
resonates with things I've heard

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.010
from other people, if those
traps are so strongly defined

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.910
and people want to flee
those a little bit,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:03.150
maybe they've found this other
ground or this other capacity.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.930
Maybe that is the place

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.420
that we've taken those
things, I don't know.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.270
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Patricia
you had said,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.110
wrote I had asked a
question about whether poetry

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.070
and prose reaches
different audiences

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.290
and you said there's a certain
percentage in my audience

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.330
that considers anything I write
in poetry, because I am a poet.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.680
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Yeah,
but I think that's why, I mean,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.200
that's okay yeah, right.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.400
It's like it's a matter of
how you get them in the door

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.530
and then you can read
whatever you want to them

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.610
and they have no control over
it, so again, it's a book.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.910
It's a reading.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.810
You know, what happens in it
is sort of amorphous material

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.540
that the form is imposed
upon from without.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.590
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: I it's, you're
wrapping my world a little bit

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.890
because I have a
lot of questions.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.730
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
You ask the questions.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.950
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: I know,
because I have questions.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.110
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: You ask
the questions that interest you.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.710
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Well,
my question is

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.210
about how one informs the
other and they'll run,

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:04.440
and where you know, like you
know Camille had said let's

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.980
breakdown the walls and that.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.600
You know, we have prose
writers who say don't put me

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.340
on a poetry panel
because I can't.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.640
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.940
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Judge poetry.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.700
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Well, I
mean I will say that I think

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.900
that as how to train as a poet,
I have an attention to word

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.880
like at the word
level and phrase level

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:36.360
and the music level the prose
writers are not necessarily

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.660
trained in.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.860
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
They're jealous about it too.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.160
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
As poets, right?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.070
And so that may be what
one of the differences

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:51.790
between poets writing
prose is that like I found

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.520
when I remember like right
after graduate school I tried

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.120
to write a novel and
that just didn't work,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.030
because I was writing the novel
and then I would have to break

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.600
for the day and I would go
back as I would with a poem

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.910
and I would read everything
I've written before

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.880
to get the sonic quality.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.420
Well once you hit page 10,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.020
like my whole writing session
was rereading what I had written

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.340
the day before and I would
tell that to prose writers

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.840
that would be like, it's
not going to work for you.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.220
Like that's crazy.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.030
So, and I didn't do it with the
book of essays all the time,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.210
but there would be
some days and I know

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:51.030
that prose writers do this, so
don't come at me prose writers,

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.990
but you don't pay attention
to the words, but I do think

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.630
that poets have been trained
usually to pay attention

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.800
at the word level, the phoning
level a little bit differently

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.340
than how prose writers do
and that, that may be one

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.160
of the uniquenesses between
the two of us, right.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.500
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I think
it may be even be inherent.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.570
I don't know if it training.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.920
I notice that I get stuck
on words a lot more easily.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.670
I notice that there were
things when I was a kid

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.410
that I did not understand
certain idioms that I would pour

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.130
over and pour over
because I didn't get them;

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.530
jokes I didn't understand.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.090
I still don't get the chicken
butt thing and I never will.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.810
No one can explain it to me.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.730
I had a student who asked me,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:57.490
she was like sometimes
I read poetry

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:06.730
and I just don't understand
it on a basic sense level.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.730
I was like, if your
body understands it,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.580
you understand it enough.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.880
You have enough of it.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.130
You know what you need to
know and I think to be honest.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.380
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: For
her that's not enough.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.020
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Well, but
I think it was anxiety, yeah,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.440
so what I told her
was that it is enough.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.130
Like if your body is
responding you know something

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:41.210
about this poem that maybe
your head doesn't know yet.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.100
But I think it's true maybe
that we are the people

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.130
who misunderstand things,
that we misread things,

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.190
that we transpose
words and a lot

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.250
of times I'll misread something
and it sounds better to me.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.960
So, I don't know if it's
a thing where, you know,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.180
we're drawn to that training
because it's something

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.750
that we already kind of do,
like that might just be me,

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.110
but I get stuck on stuff
in a way that is almost

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.000
like a childish way and that's
why I pay so much attention

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.110
to it, because I have to.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.970
It's just like how I'm wired.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.200
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Why don't
we take, I want to get

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.100
into a little bit of the
subject matter that you.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.400
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Sure.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.700
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: All write about,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:39.890
but why don't we take a
break and do some reading.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.190
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Sure.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.970
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Can you
do; who would like to?

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.640
Should we go?

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.450
Patrick would you like to read?

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.610
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: I don't
know what this is [laughter].

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:56.250
I'm doing work around the race
riots in Watsonville in 1930,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.640
Watsonville, California.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.520
There were Filipino
farmworkers who were dancing

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.520
with White women in taxi
dance halls and they,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.600
the White community formed
posses to hunt Filipino's down,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.640
threw them over the
Pajaro River Bridge,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.190
went out to the bunkhouse which
was four miles from downtown

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:18.980
and one of the people from the
posses shot through the wall

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:27.220
into the bunkhouse and killed a
young man named Fermin Tobera.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.110
So, I'm doing a cite, I
didn't even curse yet.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.420
I'm doing a cite-specific
performance.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:39.340
I hope to do a cite-specific
performance out there

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.790
in Watsonville, California.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.240
I'm writing around it.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.670
I'm doing drawings and all
kinds of things The only thing

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.830
that you need to know about
this is that I'm an intralocular

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.260
with these monomes the
Filipino farmworkers from 1930

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.660
and I don't know who's dead.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.510
It's either them or me.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.840
I maybe a ghost visiting
them and one of the things

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.770
that they've come
to do over time is

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.770
to make kites inside
of this bunkhouse.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.070
"Here is a lie.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.990
The kite maker and his
companions work hard.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.790
They get up under
an orange-blue dawn.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.430
If they dream there's no time
to think about the dreams

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.200
of visions of roosters
thrashing deep in the water.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.680
The blade still tied
to their ankles.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.060
The birds aren't drowning,
but they clearly don't belong.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.360
They're kicking their
feet, scratching,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.660
turning in the swirls
of undercurrent.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.960
The men always wake up before
they know if the cocks drown

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.260
or grow fins or gills or
get swooped up by nets

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.560
and dropped back into a yard

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.860
where the animals
make more sense,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.160
into the fields,
hotter and hotter.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.460
Every day, I try to look more
carefully, see more deeply

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.760
from all the way out here
this incredible distance.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.060
I'm younger than these
men after all, and yet,

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.360
I'm older than them too.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.660
They are as young as
17 and one who looks

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.960
like my grandfather barely 23.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.260
Sometimes I get close enough
to them I can ask questions.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.560
When they speak, it's as if
they aren't speaking to me,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.860
but to one another or
a lover left behind.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.160
I can't tell if it's because
they are too far away in time

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.460
and miles or if they
just refuse to tell me

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.760
about the knife they're holding,
the sound of the blade pulling

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.060
through the stalks,
what the ground tastes

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.360
like when they have to
suck the blood from the cut

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.660
in the thumb they
made themselves

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.960
and not lose the
rhythm of reaping.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.260
I don't blame them.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.560
There's nothing to the
work after a while.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.860
There is no thinking.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.160
There was a time when the
men had a deliberateness

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.460
and a strangeness to the
bending and cutting and pulling

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.760
when they first arrived just
after White men took their names

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.060
and asked them if
they could read,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.360
asked if they had
wives back home.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.660
There was a time the men,
these monomes thought

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.960
about this comparing
the first lettuce

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.260
to the next making sure
they got the whole head.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.560
It doesn't take a
week to stop thinking.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.860
You're body just goes and
your mind does other things.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.160
First it dreams of the
faces it left behind.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.460
How happy they'll be to see you
again to build a house and buy

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.010
so many fat pigs
and goats and cows.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.370
You caught me lying again.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:21.280
They are thinking of sleep or
they are thinking of the uncle

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.110
who slapped them on the back

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.860
or across their teeth the day
before they left their village,

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.760
or they are thinking of
slitting the foreman's neck.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.770
They are thinking of hanging
themselves from a tree.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:40.480
They are thinking of swimming
in the ocean, the water salt

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.630
which is different
from the spicy,

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.310
muddy salt of their
own heads and armpits.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.210
They are thinking of swimming
all the way back home.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.300
They are thinking no
will remember their names

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.880
when they get back.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.150
They are thinking of
changing their names anyway.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.420
Edison is a good name.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.460
They are thinking of going
back to another province

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.100
and finding a wife who will
call them Edison, a famous name

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.570
as if a name could
change a face sun bait.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.520
No one weeps anymore.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.400
That's my last lie.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:25.010
But this man here because he no
longer has to think about how

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.410
to grip the handle or the
angle of the knife's edge,

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.540
because he is quick with
his work but not too quick.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.840
He can think of something else.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.640
He can think of making kites."

[ Applause ]

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.020
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.240
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Ii
must say I was to grateful

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.180
when Amy invited me to
be part of this panel

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.200
because I love these, she
told who was going to be on it

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.170
and I love both of these
writers, and so anytime I get

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.940
to be in a space with
writers who I really admire;

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.240
I've never met you in-person.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.540
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I've never met you.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.180
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: But, but
I know her work so there we go.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.480
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: And
you're all reading poems.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.780
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: That's
the, I know that's the beauty

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.880
of about the beauty
of literature.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.320
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Back around Amy I like it.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.670
Very, very good.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.970
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
So, what I'm going

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:29.160
to do is actually read a very
short excerpt from an essay

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.090
in "Guidebook to Relative
Strangers" and I'm going

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.020
to read a poem from
"Trophic Cascade"

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.510
and I chose these two sections
because they were written

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.510
within relatively
close proximity

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.000
of each other in
time in my life.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.350
And the poem, by the way,
happened to have been written

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.670
after a trip home
from Washington,

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.540
D.C. when I did some work

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.860
with the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.600
So, it seemed like the
right poem to read.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.420
But you can kind of
just hold in mind that,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.800
that these were written within
about a month of each other,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.870
so similar concerns are
spinning through my head.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.150
"In the years before her death,

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.290
my maternal grandmother told me
the story of her family's flight

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.930
from Shreveport to
Summerville, Louisiana.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.250
My great-grandfather who
owned his own sheet metal shop

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:31.730
in that left behind town who
could read and write and figure

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:36.730
and who understood his worth,
entered his business one morning

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.820
and found his young
cousin dead on a worktable.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.290
A note pinned to the body warned
my great-grandfather to get

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:52.130
out of town before nightfall,
but less he be killed as well.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.320
The surviving family piled
into a wagon with nothing

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.670
but what the wagon could hold.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.070
'Imagine that', my
grandmother said repeatedly

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.920
in the last years of her life.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.110
She didn't talk much about
the new shop or the new town

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.260
and the years before
she died it was

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.530
that wagon my grandmother
talked about,

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:18.080
loaded with things her family
could haul and that life plucked

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.830
from her family's line.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:24.290
Most Black American
families have a story

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.420
of some branch brutally
severed from their family tree.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.070
The only remarkable thing
about my grandmother's story is

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.380
that she had to reach
as far back as 1917

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.510
to encounter such a trauma.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.310
But pain is an immortal humor,

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.510
lasting in a body far
longer than pleasure.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.030
Again, and again my
grandmother asked me

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.960
as if I might one visit provide
some satisfactory answer,

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.300
what would make a
person do that to a body?

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.650
We might be playing with the
baby, grandmother's namesake.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.270
We might be sitting in a nursing
home's courtyard enjoying the

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.050
light of the springtime sun.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.450
Once we in a communal
dining room surrounded

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.750
by the dying old White Iowans

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.640
with whom my grandparents
spent their final years.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.510
She looked around if startled to
find herself amongst strangers

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.750
and whispered the story
of her family's flight

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:26.100
as if it were a story
that I that moment

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:30.930
for my very survival
needed to hear.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.620
Grandmother's voice shook
when she recited this story,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.630
not from age, but from the
hard-driven grief that spoke

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.720
through muscle to bone,
this must be what they mean

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.410
by this role of terror.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.970
My grandmother repeated
her story,

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.910
because she could not
help but remember.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.420
She was there.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.170
She walked into the
shop and saw her cousin.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.380
She climbed into the wagon
and rode through the dust.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:03.210
She felt her father's
fear-born defiance and caution.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.020
She saw her pregnant mother,
several siblings packed up

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.990
and driven off before
the last of the light.

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:14.820
She was there you understand
and she had to tell me.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.350
Though, she would likely have
been too young at the time

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.590
to remember the incident,
this too is possible.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.740
Hers was the small body
inside her mother's body.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.360
She might not yet have
even been conceived.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.780
This is how history
eclipses all reality.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.990
My grandmother, who could not
help but relive this trauma,

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.700
was also as far away

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.560
from everything I am
writing as you and as me."

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.860

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.660

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.690
Thanks. So, that was
the essay excerpt

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.630
and then this is a poem called

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.450
"Frequently Asked
Questions, Number 7."

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:13.490
Is it difficult to get away from
it all once you've had a child?

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.020
I am swaying in the galley,
working to appease this infant

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:24.260
who is not fussing, but will
be fussing if I don't move.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.660
When a black steward
enters the cramped space

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.010
at the back of the plane.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.430
He stands by the food
carts prepping his service.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:38.330
Then he is holding his throat
the way we hold our throats

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:42.670
when we think we
are going to die.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.090
I'm sorry.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.400
I'm so sorry.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.990
He is crying.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.930
My God. What they did to us.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:57.650
I am swaying lest my brown baby
girl make a nuisance of herself,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.840
and the steward is
crying honest man tears.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.510
Seeing you holding your daughter
like that for the first time,

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:12.620
I understand what
they did to us.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:19.620
All those women sold away from
their babies, he whispers.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.940
I am at a loss now.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.920
Perhaps I could fabricate an
image to represent this agony,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.350
but the steward has walked
into the galley of history.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:38.510
There is nothing
figurative about us."

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.310
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Since
you so generous Patrick

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.520
as to read something that
you do know what it is,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.820
I will do that as well.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.180
I'll read from what I'm
working on right now.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.500
It's just kind of a
hybrid of everything.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.480
It's about an idiot
on the Internet.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.820
"In childhood she had laid
awake at night on fire

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.500
with a single question; 'How
did French people know what they

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.920
were saying?'

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.660
You know, when she
finally asked her mother,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.140
she didn't know either

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.200
which meant the problem
must be inherited.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.100
'Can't learn', she
Googled late at night.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.670
Can't learn since
losing my virginity?

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.830
Her most secret pleasures
were sentences

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.060
that only half the percent of
people on earth would understand

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.910
and that no one would be able
to decipher it all in ten years.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.410
Grizzly British witch pits,

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.730
sex in the moon next
summer, what is binged?

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.950
What is to be corncobbed?

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:53.380
That's the cost of my vegan
lunch, pan [inaudible] my wound.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.820
She could not feel
her first fingertip.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.100
This in the way that your ear
used to get soft pink compliant

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.260
and the swirls of hair
around it like damp designs

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.820
from talking on the telephone.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.810
A hundred years ago her cat
might have been called 'Mittens'

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.670
or 'Pussy willow.'

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.510
Now her cat was called
'Dr. Butthole.'

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.020
There was no way out of it.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.820
'Dr. Butthole' she called
at night almost in despair

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.220
until he trotted to the door
with the bright feathers

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.050
of her dignity clinging to
his lips and disappeared

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.500
in his alternating
stripes over the threshold.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.240
In Bristol the sunset dripped
as if from a honeycomb.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.680
'This is your contribution
to society?'

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.810
a man asked holding up a print

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:41.510
out of her most famous
post, 'Can a dog be twins?'

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.860
[ Laughter ]

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.890
'Yes', Rachel peeped.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.280
She wanted to explain that she
had also popularized the concept

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.770
of today's ceiling wax
manicure where you paint it

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:57.360
over your entire fingertip
in a big careless red blob

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.080
and that this had paved
the way for 1776 Corp,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.480
an irony-based esthetic

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.600
where people adopted
various visual signifiers

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.200
to the founding fathers, but
he had already turned away

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:12.620
in disgust tearing the print up
in two as he went, just as well.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.630
It probably wouldn't be funny
to an Englishman anyway.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.790
But afterward, a boyish figure
stood in line to see her.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.090
He waited until the very end.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.990
'I used to read your
online diary' he confessed

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.670
when it was finally his
turn and tears sparked

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.040
in her eyes instantaneously.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.090
The diary she had written before
anything had happened to her.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.750
The diary where she used
to make the sort of jokes

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.790
that would get people fired now.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.330
'What was your name' she
asked and he told her

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.610
and mundane ecstasy began
to rush in her veins.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.540
His had been one of her
very favorite lives.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.730
She remembered it in the
minutest detail, the pine step

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.950
to work, the rides back
and forth on the train,

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.350
his search for ever spicier
curries, the imagined dimness

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.630
of his apartment with
crates of obscure records

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.860
and the green waving
gentleness of it all.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.360
She stood up and held him.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.150
She could not help it.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.150
He felt as breakable
as a link in her arms.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.160
It was hard to know
which forms of protest

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.910
against the current regime
were actually useful.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.790
The day of the election
her husband had woken

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.990
up with a strong urge
to get a face tattoo,

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.740
'Either I want a teardrop under
my left eye or I want them

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.150
to make my whole skull visible.'

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.220
He settled finally on
getting the words 'Stop it'

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.670
in very small letters
right near his hairline

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:31.590
where they could
hardly been seen.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.560
When she closed her
eyes she saw people

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.650
as polka dots assembling
now into a ballet,

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:41.000
swoop now into a battle, swoop
now as a flock of scavengers

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.530
with single word like 'garbage'
saved ever from ugliness

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.640
by the swoop the wind,
the uplift in the wings

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.000
which were made for this.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.430
A bear breaks into
a Colorado house

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.200
and plays the piano
but not very well.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.830
A man with a self-administered
hyena haircut following a woman

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.810
through a store and shouting
'Immigrant, immigrant,

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.120
immigrant, immigrant.'

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.430
In the front seat of
the police car he began

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.470
to discuss World War III
and why it would begin.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.930
Why it must begin.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.620
Why it was coming.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.480
Why he would be the general
that led the first charge.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.980
Previously these
communities were imposed along

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.730
with their mental weather.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.050
Now we chose them or
believe that we did.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.890
A person might join a site to
look at pictures of her nephew

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.650
and five years later
believe in a flat earth.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:34.570
A man with a chest tattoo
that says 'I can do all things

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.500
through Christ who
strengthens me, motherfucker!'

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.720
'MySpace was an entire
life' she nearly wept

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.040
at a bookstore in Chicago.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.880
And the whole audience
conjured up the image of a man

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.760
in a white T-shirt
grinning over his shoulder

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.890
and then private music began
to autoplay for each of them.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.890
And it is lost, lost,
lost, lost.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.730
A former presidential
candidate whose face was

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.550
as long a cartoon shoe, had
favored a porn in the nights.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.670
It was always thrilling
when this happened.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:10.100
First there was the
porn itself to dissect,

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.320
in this one a red-blooded
American housewife stumbles upon

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.280
her stepdaughter getting fucked
from behind by her boyfriend

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.340
who seemed likely to
shoot an unbelievable load

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.400
of mayonnaise into
her at the end.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.630
Twist though, the woman
in the clip who stood

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.380
in a hallway theatrically
pleasuring herself while her

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.450
step-daughter was
[inaudible] looking exactly

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.260
like the candidate's wife.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.620
This was somehow thrilling
too in its innocence.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.000
He would always desire her, but
at least the blonde substance

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.930
that flowed through
her turn sketch.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.920
Rachel though then of the
women of separated twins.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.770
She thought of the
divergence and use

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.130
between this identical beauty.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:52.440
I wanted to end up in a porn
clip slapped up by sexual posts

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.250
and how the other had become the
wife of a man who is outspoken

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:58.990
in his belief that people should
not manipulate their genitals.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:00.290
When the imagination was caught

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:04.600
like this it was no longer
her imagination but the mom's.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.650
Flat architects are awaken
which move through flat scenes

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.660
in a cave of the mind.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.690
Torches were raised somewhere
and her blood pounded

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.420
and it was the blood of the mom.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.120
She had another heart now
that beat a black shadow

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.230
of her real one, but if it
ceased to be, she would die too

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.140
like that security robot who
had recently committed suicide

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:31.510
in a fountain face
down insanely funny.

[ Applause ]

&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: I
was just transport;

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.010
I didn't even care whether
it was poetry, right?

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.310
Just right?

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.610
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I'm
trying to imagine what it feels

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.540
like being on the Internet.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.890
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: There is, I mean
I have encountered your work

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.850
and felt and you know through
the page when you are looking

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.220
at white space, you
know, or the display

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.070
of the words it's a
really different experience

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.580
to hear you read it and
the subject and the words

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.880
and what you're saying.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.470
It's just and then
categorization kind of,

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.300
I'm also right here listening.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.750
I mean, I'm, it's a
really moving experience.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.650
Does it feel different when
you read your, you know,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.650
if you're reading poetry
or reading prose out loud,

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.890
to yourself or an audience
versus writing it on the page?

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.640
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: I think
when you asked about kinds

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.840
of the differences
between poetry and prose,

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.530
what's occurring to
me is that poetry

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:41.050
in its tradition maybe closer to
social practices, to gathering,

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:45.540
whereas we think of the novel as
something that you would engage

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.190
in just you and the page.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.850
Now, we've taught poetry
as if every poet was

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.230
like the archetype of
Emily Dickinson locked

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:58.600
in one's room writing and
then you get, it get arrives

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.660
to somebody and the read
it alone in their room.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.350
Poetry is also it's a
social art form, you know,

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:10.360
and it brings people together
certainly for people of color.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.670
It calls back to our family
gatherings, to our social,

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.150
to our social gatherings.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.870
And so, maybe there's something
about composing in prose

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:24.500
with this idea of people
actually being in the presence

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.760
of one another, of
mourning together,

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.180
of celebrating together,
of arguing together,

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:37.920
of dancing together that,
you know, calls up the music

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.400
of poetry and of all these
sorts of American traditions.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.900
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: I think for
me the one thing about reading;

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.860
both of the books came
out in the same year

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.090
and so I found myself
reading from them

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.770
at the same time often, and one

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.700
of the things that's very
different is I didn't have

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.840
to do a lot of setup
for the poems.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.170
"Frequently Asked
Questions Number 7",

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:04.800
yes those 1 through
10 are in the book,

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.620
but you don't really need
to know 1 through 10.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.740
Like I had to come to
terms with the thing

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.660
like you don't know
anything else that happened

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.610
in that essay body of evidence.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.590
That 5 paragraphs that
I read to is an excerpt

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:20.560
of a huge long other thing
and I wrote an essay partly

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.750
for the other rigging that's
around it and then to read it

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.730
to you I have to like remove all
that other rigging and get back

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.110
to the thing that is that sort

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.940
of image kernel right,
about one thing.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.600
And so, that is hugely
different for me coming at,

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.730
coming to share prose with you
as opposed to sharing poetry,

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.420
is it's the way that it
can just be self-contained;

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.720
that a poem can be
self-contained in a way

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.480
that an excerpt from an essay
can't be and yet it can be.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.490
What you've got is fine and
it's self-containable and it's,

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.490
and it works, it's just you
didn't get a whole bunch

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:57.460
of other stuff and I know that.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.160
So go buy the book and
they you can share it too.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.750
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Yeah, I always felt luckier

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.450
as reading poems than, like
you know, the novelist,

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.750
comes on after you and
he's like "Alright,

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.100
so there's a ballet dancer."

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.140
And it's like, I don't have
to do any of that, you know.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.540
I just get up there
and I pop it out.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.990
If feels like you're a little
bit of like the show pony

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.420
who comes out and you do a big,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:20.460
cook but also universal
trick you know?

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.510
That it's like it speaks to
the human heart and all that,

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.160
but you're like still the pony
and everything and like you get

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.460
to see that cool thing.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.170
And you guys there is like you,
there's, there feels like a pop

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.720
out quality like a completeness
to it that I always like,

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.410
yeah when I read that.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.030
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: I guess I was
also thinking of let's writing,

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:38.910
let's move to call it all
writing and when you come

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:42.980
at a subject directly, which
as prose writer it's more,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:47.080
you know, head on, right,
you're piecing out verses

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.240
through a little bit more
slanted, through metaphor,

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.880
through you know
working things out

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.060
and making a little bit
more; they, you know,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.500
poem sort of invites
the reader to come in

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.650
and make different
interpretations like they're

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.460
like sometimes prose
doesn't do that as much

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.170
because you are saying this on
the page and so when we talk

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.510
about there are hard subjects
that we are all, you know,

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:13.970
that your work we're talking
about you know fear and death

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:18.600
and discrimination and misogyny
and hard, hard, hard stuff.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.720
You know, typhoons I was reading
your, but you know, so sometimes

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.140
when you approach
this writing do you;

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.330
how if you can riff
a little better

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.770
about how you approach
sometimes the tough subjects

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.600
and whether sometimes it
feels a little easier to do it

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.010
through poetry or not,
because of that coming

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.440
about it you know what
brings up for you?

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.090
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I was telling my escort

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.920
when I got here I was like,
I was looking at selections

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.270
of what to read today and
I looked at "Priestdaddy"

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.380
and I thought if I have to read
about the Catholic Church today,

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:53.430
I will burst into
tears, you know, if I,

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.870
if I have to talk
too much about it.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:58.140
If I have to go through
that, I don't know

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.860
if I would be able to do it.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.350
But I, it's also true that
I couldn't have written

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.000
about the Catholic
Church in a poem really.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.300
I mean, I could have.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.680
I could have written
about specific moments,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.310
but like if you're
talking about exposing

00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:13.550
like institutional abuses,
if it, some things are better

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.810
to lay them out in prose
because you can really like;

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.930
prose you feel like you
can really slap something

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.230
down sometimes, you know?

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.800
And it felt that way, but
yeah, I mean it's one thing

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.740
to be alone in room
writing these things,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.730
but it's different sometimes
to come out and read them,

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:32.760
you know, when the wounds are
still fresh and when it's not

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.060
as if any of the
things we're dealing

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.340
with in our work has
stopped happening.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.150
You know, the wounds
reopen every day.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.260
I mean, it's again and again.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.310
So, as you know, we're
reading them, as we're talking

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.940
about them, we're
still living them.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.820
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Yeah, I
mean I think writing is just a,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.990
it's a difficult thing.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:56.620
You're writing into
revelation or I am,

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.210
I don't know what you are doing.

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:04.530
I am. I am writing into
revelation when I write

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:10.020
and it's always troubling and
disturbing and even when I say

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.750
like I knew I was angry about
this thing that this woman said

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.710
and I was going to write about
it instead of drink about it,

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:22.050
right, that the essay then still
revealed new things, right,

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.900
to me that I didn't; I knew on
the surface why I was so angry,

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.240
but spending the time writing

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.560
into it I understood a whole
lot more around it or I came to

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.250
and that's, that's one of the
scariest things about writing,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.380
but it's also one of the
most, if you see it through,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.840
it's also one of the most
wonderful things about writing.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.040
Is it, that you can really come
to understand not just myself,

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.820
but also the world
that has created me

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.330
and crated my response
systems and I don't know that,

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:58.750
I don't know that I think

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:02.490
about that differently
in poetry and prose.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:06.100
I think my subject matters
are, have remained consistent.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.730
I write about family,
I write about history,

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:09.780
I write about the
world, the environment,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.340
the world that I live in.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.930
It doesn't matter what
medium I pick up to do it.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.280
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Right.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.350
You know, to sort
of riff of Camille,

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:27.140
you write you don't just
write about difficulty.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.460
The music of the language leads
you towards the difficulty,

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.290
because often if you're
composing music rather

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:37.580
than I want to say this fact
or convey this information,

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.040
you're thinking about the sound
and the contour and the music.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.140
You're not controlling the
"content" of those words.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:50.620
It's often times that
revelation is difficult.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.920
It's hard.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.220
It's painful.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.520
It's surprising.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:02.820
It is unwanted and so for
me it's I play a bunch

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.120
of musical instruments.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.140
I don't, I don't really
consider myself a singer

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:12.440
and I want all my writing
to sing and the singing

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.850
when I'm doing it well really
leads me to something that's,

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.880
that's difficult and I'm trying
to be a; I'm trying to learn how

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.630
to be a good singer in my
writing in that regard.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.640
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: We had
a student this morning

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.090
who is our Poetry
Out Loud Program.

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:34.330
He's now a first in college
has won a couple of times

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:38.140
and he talked about writing
a poem in high school right

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.030
after he went on a first date.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.310
And he wrote on the first date
and then he wrote this poem,

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.790
you know, it was a love poem
and we all kind of gushing,

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:49.540
and then there was only a first
date and then it got published

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.700
in his local you know
publication when he wrote it

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.290
in October and it got
published in December

00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:02.470
and then the girl read it and
came back and said "What?"

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.290
And I thought of that
and I thought of this,

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:09.450
our conversation and what you
write and how raw and vulnerable

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:14.400
and you get, you know, in
your writing until you,

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.470
and I almost felt like I
just want to say thank you

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:22.350
for getting raw and vulnerable
so that we can get there too.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.650
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: But you
know, I mean I think part

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:26.460
of that sense of kind of writing
towards it and around it is

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.450
that you find more
interesting things.

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:31.160
I have a similar story from my
first book and I have a poem

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.430
that it became a; it
becomes a love poem

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:38.640
between my grandparents
in the book and I,

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.450
and I like by the time it's in
the book like that's in my mind.

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:44.560
That is a love poem
between my grandparents.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.010
But I went and I read
it at my graduate school

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.950
and the guy I had been
dating in graduate school was

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.600
in the audience and
I sort of looked up

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:55.160
and I was like, that was to him!

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.580
I had completely forgotten

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.620
that the poem had become
something much bigger

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:02.320
than that dude, right?

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.100
And that's one of the really
great gifts of writing is

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.250
that we can come to
knowledge that I was writing

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.660
about what love could
be, now what love was

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.150
between me and that dude, right?

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.340
And so that, then I
can once I reached

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.790
into that the poem got
better, the writing gets better

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:28.150
if you untether it from
these little pesty details

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.260
like some specific date.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.400
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
Who it happened to.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.990
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
Yeah, who it happened to.

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.670
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Patricia you
had said and I'm just going

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:40.690
to ask maybe one more
question then we'll open it

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.010
up for questions
to the audience.

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:44.600
You had, I think there
was something in prestudy

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.850
where you had said, I think,
where you had said that you

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.740
or feel, you know, feel stronger
on the page then sometimes

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:55.740
in person and it got me thinking
about how, and I'll ask you

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.040
because we're all
dealing with this,

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.420
if you see yourself here you are
as writing, either, here you are

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.810
in poetry and your poems,
here you are in your prose,

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.910
here you are in your writing,
but here you are in person

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:10.140
and here you are online too.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.810
And I wonder if you can just
kind of think about you,

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.010
or does it you know, again,

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:19.600
riff on how those different
parts are different,

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.260
are they not different, are
they deliberately not different

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.600
or different and do
you have, you know,

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.960
negotiating those spaces?

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.640
I mean, I'm looking at you just
because I know you, you know,

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:36.610
but I think we all do because
it's the reality of here we are

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.550
in person like you said,
there are certain things

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.830
that you don't want to do
in person that you want

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.130
to do in your writing.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.130
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: And it's
because you have, it's not just

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:45.570
because you have more control.

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.940
It's also because I was
never the sort of person

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.240
who in my life was allowed
to have the arguments

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.540
that I wanted to have.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.010
Like when you talked
about, you know,

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.660
instead of drinking you
know you're going to go home

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.590
and write it out, I mean
there was like a conversation

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:58.890
that could have been had.

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.560
I mean, you're going to make
something better out of it

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.870
by putting it on the page.

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:06.580
I knew growing up that I
could not had the arguments

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:10.710
with my family and with my
church that I wanted to have.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.480
But I knew that I could
do something on paper

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.030
and there's something that
felt very firm about them.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.520
That you had said your say,
and that you then, you know,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.830
and when people talk to
you about it and you're

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.070
like here is what I think,
because I'm not always;

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:25.080
I'm a person who tends to
just like open my mouth

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.660
and talk a little bit, you
know, but I like to be able

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.440
to shape what I talk about more.

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.500
I tend not to get
into fights online.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.940
Like I tend not to get mad
online because it's really easy

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.660
to say dumb stuff and it's
easy to get drawn into it.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.960
So, I like to be in places

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.660
where I have more control
before I talk apart from jokes,

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.920
you know, which I probably
make because I am scared

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.220
of that stuff, you know.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.520
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: I've
been meaning to ask you

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.070
about humor with those, yeah.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.890
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Yeah.

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:52.560
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: The parts of
being separated are the parts

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.330
on the page in our
regular lives.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:57:00.950
And you're asking if
I do it or why do it?

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.250
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Are
there is, I mean,

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:03.550
do you see this separately?

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:06.560
Or do you really
feel that you do?

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.680
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: It's
hard for me to separate.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.050
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:11.350
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: It's so hard.

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:15.710
I think I was already a kind
of weirdo when I was growing up

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:19.180
and being a writer
has sort of allowed me

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.200
to affirm my weirdness.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.720
And so, like the processes
of the ways that I;

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.810
the ways that I think when I
write or when I make music,

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.590
I carry them into the
world you know when I,

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.210
when I interact with people.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:40.150
I, I remember a conversation
with a colleague;

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:43.090
I used to teach at a small
college, Springfield College

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:45.140
and one of my colleagues Steve
Goldwin stopped me in the street

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.440
and we were having
a conversation

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.820
about campus politics
or something like that,

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.750
and he said, he said, "You
know", Steve's a great guy,

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:56.090
he was like, he's like
"You know, men don't get,

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:57.890
we're not good listeners.

00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:01.470
They don't get taught
to be good listeners."

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:05.440
And I was like, "Oh my god,
I'm one of those guys."

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.640
And then, Goldwin went on to
say something other things,

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.800
but I wasn't listening
so I didn't [laughter].

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:19.370
Writing and being a musician
has created a continuity

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:22.130
between my listening as
a poet and a musician

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.820
and my listening in the world.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:31.400
I'm so grateful that writing
and music and visual art and all

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:37.380
of the dancing has taught me
so many kinds of listening.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.930
Not for the sake of the art
that I make, but for the sake

00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:44.800
of the time that I
spend with human beings.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.130
And so that separation
is very difficult for me,

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:51.960
because those perceived
different lives have been

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.240
so deeply mutually informative.

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.540
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: Yeah.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.560
I think I would just add to
what Patrick said and something

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.440
that Patricia said earlier about
that maybe what's brought her

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.080
to writing is just a kind
of quirk of thinking,

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:17.010
is that I been married now for
10 years and I think so living

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:22.010
with him he's like seeing the
me for longer than anybody

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.740
but my parents, and he will very
frequently point out the fact

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:30.460
that I just think differently
than people do and it's not

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:34.030
like it's not, he's not saying
it in an antagonistic way

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:36.190
or anything, but it
sometimes it's just like

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:38.720
"Sweetie let me just explain to
you that the way that you got

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.400
to that logic point is not the
way that most of us would."

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.040
So, can you walk me through it?

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.340
No you can't.

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.640
You can't, right?

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.510
And so, there's like a way that
I think that I get from point A

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:58.630
to point B to 4, you know, like,
like somehow just like do a leap

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:03.110
and that that's, that's a
way that poetry works, right.

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.290
It's the way that we understand
poetry to work that we do,

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:09.560
we have sinestesia so we mix,
you know, we mix some sort

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.860
of sense with the taste,
with color and things

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.920
like that we cross and that
we expect that of poetry,

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.790
but I think it's one of the
things that people who think

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:24.480
about poetry and write in
poetry also can bring to prose,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.560
because rather than in an essay,

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.600
rather than doing a straight
chronological narrative

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.430
of the first year of
my daughter's life,

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:36.690
I'm able to leap around through
time and chronology in a way

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:38.820
that I think is, sorry,
that I think is true

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.880
to how we experience time.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.420
Like I actually think
we experience time

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.190
in a very unchronological
way, but we're often trained

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.890
when we're reading the
who, what, when, where,

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.190
why kind of narrative.

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:53.880
We're often trained to read very
linearly, but with the freedom

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.680
of a poet's mind, and I
don't know which came first,

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.990
the poet's mind or the poet,
right, I'm able to bring

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:04.390
that into prose and so shift
what happens in my essays

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:08.320
and untether them a little
bit from linear narrative

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.290
into a kind of, I think,
real-world narrative

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.490
but it's really also just
the way I think, right.

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:18.350
That I'm also just
writing as I see the work

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:22.850
and as I communicate the
world and speak it out, right,

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.460
and so it's just a like
stylized version of the real me.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.620
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I mean like the joke

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.270
about a poet writing a
novel or memoires that will

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:36.950
like describe a leaf for like
20 pages, but they also tell you

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.810
when we were born and get
the important facts or things

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.090
like that, so when I was talking
about you know like having

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:44.100
to make an argument in
prose things like that,

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.230
it was basically painful
for me sometimes to be

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:49.030
like this was the bishop
at the place that I was,

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.240
this was the name of this,
this is what happened next,

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.540
this is what happened here.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.290
Having to stick some of
that reportage in there was

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:56.920
like difficultly, like
gut-wrenchingly painful for me,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.690
because it's not again
I think you're right,

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:01.260
it's not how I experience
the information.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.840
You know, like I would meet
a person, I would interface

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.070
with them, but it's you know
I didn't know their Wikipedia

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.370
entries or anything like that.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.710
The things that you
have to put and things

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:13.300
that are not poetry sometimes
are painful for us to put in.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.960
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Yeah, I will
say in preparing for this I had

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.300
like an outline and then I
[multiple speakers], let it go.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.530
So, we're not going to go there.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.960
I notice, I don't know
that there are microphones

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.910
but I think it would be great.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.210
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
You can hear.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.510
Oh, there are microphones.

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:30.810
There's mics.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.110
There are two, two.

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:33.410
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Oh, there are.

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.710
Do we have questions?

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:39.120
Would anybody like to ask
these, anyone a if you do would

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.610
like to ask a question
you go to the mic.

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.910
Thank you, yes.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.210
&gt;&gt; Let's be [multiple
speakers] to the first person.

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:45.510
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: There
should be on this side.

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:55.970
&gt;&gt; Where, where does
poetry end and prose begins?

01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:00.130
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal:
Where does poetry end?

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.660
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
There's a critic

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.360
and poet named James Logenbach

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:10.240
and he has this book called
The Art of the Line or "The Art

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.740
of the Poetic Line" I
think from Graywolf Press,

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:20.090
and he has a sentence in that
book that goes something like,

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:29.690
poetry depends; poetry is the
art of thinking in the line.

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:33.510
And prose is the art of
thinking in the sentence,

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:41.280
and prose poetry is what we
invented to make sense of both

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.500
of those things, right, and to
refute both of those things.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.010
So, there's this,
three is poetry

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.190
that doesn't require the line.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:52.820
I think there's an easy way
of doing that delineation

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:55.670
and saying all poetry
is lineated

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.790
and all prose is unlineated, but
there's really beautiful poetry

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:03.830
that is not lineated and
there's really beautiful prose

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:09.040
that is essentially lineated
because the sentences,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.740
the paragraphs and units
of thought are cut so short

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.740
that we read it almost
like lines.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.650
So, in the end, what I'm
telling you is I don't believe

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.500
in those lines, right.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.130
I believe that we
are writing towards;

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:31.410
we're writing towards truth,
we're writing towards energy,

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:35.680
and we're writing towards
like a kind of delivery,

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.400
the best delivery of
information and there are,

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.230
there's an extreme whereby
that's in paragraphs

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:46.450
and chapters and a great link,
and there's another extreme

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:51.990
that it's a single line and
it's crystalized and condensed

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:56.410
and then there's the
children of the marriage

01:04:56.410 --> 01:05:00.030
of those two extremes
who are as multi-varied

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.990
as the people in this room.

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:04.290
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: I mean,

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:05.600
I was just rereading
Michael Ondaatje's "Running

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:11.930
in the Family" this summer and
he's got conventional chapters

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.230
or essays in there and then all

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:14.560
of a sudden you're
reading a poem.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.300
And I guess you would find,
I suppose that you would find

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.300
that book in the
Memoire section.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.530
So, for, for Ondaatje even

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:29.020
within one book those
lines are blurred.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:33.600
I was a DJ for a longtime
and I think about some

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.040
of these record stores that
don't have categories for music

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.900
and you would find like
Sesame Street next to a record

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.630
of MLK speeches, next
to a Sly Stone record

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:52.020
and like an old tango record,

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.980
and because there were not
these clear categories,

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.400
these things would fire off in
your imagination about kinds

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.870
of music that you
could put together

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:03.870
that supposedly don't
belong together.

01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:09.110
And so, I think that having
genres is helpful in a way

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:10.930
because it helps
us both as writers

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.620
and readers approach the work
with kinds of expectations,

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.680
but when we're composing,

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.480
I imagine that those
things become less useful

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.480
or they're only useful
in that we're trying

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.300
to breakdown those
very rigid categories.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.600
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I think

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.730
if there's one thing the good
poetry; there's one thing

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:33.170
that good poetry has to have
I think a good prose doesn't

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:37.160
necessarily, and I think that
good poetry has to make a leap

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.460
through the air of the minds.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.170
I mean you can write a novel
where that doesn't ever happen,

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.190
but I think in all good
poems there is a moment

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:46.020
where you just fly and we
know what that moment is,

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.240
like you feel it, you feel
something almost like pass

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.640
through the ether in your
brain, it's a connection,

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.110
but it's like above
the connection.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.660
And you don't necessarily need
to have that in a narrative.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.210
So, I guess that's how I
identify those like kind

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.310
of touchy-feeling, but
that's you know, again,

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:01.760
we can identify it
when it happens.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.170
I think everyone knows what
I'm talking about here.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:06.360
You don't always find
that in a good novel.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.310
You'll probably always
find it in a good poem.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:12.520
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
There was a woman there.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.850
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for being
here in Washington today.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:17.170
This has been wonderful.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:23.860
I think that each of your
participates as editors

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:30.400
and editorial work, can you
speak a little bit about how

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.180
or whether that informs your own
writing maybe judging as well,

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.710
but particularly being
editors or editorial writers

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:44.610
of in other aspects
of your writing life?

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:45.910
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah.

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:49.500
As a judge and an editor
sometimes I read some revisions

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.290
I'm like ah, I wish I did that.

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:58.080
It's a real, it's a real
gift because you know as wild

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.650
as I try to make my imagination,

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:02.960
if you're when you're judging a
contest or reading submissions

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.990
for a magazine, somebody
always has an idea

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.620
that you didn't have before.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.370
And so, you know, it's just a,
it's probably a different part

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:17.050
of engaging my imagination
and I haven't thought;

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:21.120
I've never stolen anything from
anybody, but it certainly fires

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.790
up your imagination about
what the possibilities are

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:25.810
and the fact that
your imagination

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:30.530
as one person is really not
quite as good as several

01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:32.600
or a multitude of imaginations.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.680
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood:
I'm not really an editor.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.350
I mean, I sometimes
write criticism

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.370
but I don't actually do a
whole lot of editorial work,

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:39.920
but I do like writing
criticism because it's

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.960
like getting an assignment
that you actually want to do

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.260
and I love that aspect of it.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.670
I, like you know getting to
engage on a really deep level

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.970
like reading all of someone's
books really drilling down,

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:53.380
that to me feels like if I
could have gone to college

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.440
and it had been like that,
I would have liked that.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.350
As it is probably not you know,

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.020
probably would not have
done so well otherwise.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.480
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: I mean
I think it's possible that,

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.570
that this thinking that
have about the blurriness

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:13.570
between poetry and prose might
have started to get codified

01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:17.600
when I was working on the
"Black Nature" anthology,

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.300
each of those poetry sections
was introduced by a prose piece

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.780
and many of those prose
pieces are written by people

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:30.100
who identify as poets, honoree
Fanonne Jeffers writes one,

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.690
Richard Wright has one and
you think of Richard Wright

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:36.490
as probably as a
prose writer except

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:41.600
for that he has this
incredible collection of haiku

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.400
that are just phenomenally
wonderful and so to be able

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.470
to have that haiku next to this
excerpt from this wonderful book

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.760
which is also so poetic,
"Twelve Million Black Voices."

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.360
A lot of the early
African-American writers wrote

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.660
in mix genre.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.980
I think Jean Toomer who is
one of the key writers of the

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.960
"Harlem Renaissance"
that's like one

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.680
of the first American
hybrid text.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.980
Like what is it?

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.280
Is it nonfiction?

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.580
Is it poetry?

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:13.880
Is it prose?

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.180
Like we, I don't know.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:17.100
And so, just the work of
really spending time with all

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.170
of these writers whose
work; who I really admired

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.470
and also I resisted,
I resisted a lot

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:28.040
of the typical categorizations
when I put together that book,

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.900
so I didn't, I didn't
organize it alphabetically.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.270
I didn't organize
it chronologically.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:39.500
I organized it based on kind
of the ethos of the poems

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.690
and the pieces inside them
and that kind of thinking

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:45.660
about new ways to
categorize and combine

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:49.150
and put things together
made me rethink the way

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:54.930
that I was rigidly assigning my
own text along typical lines.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:58.170
So, I think it can help you
working through other's work

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.640
and curating other's
work and kind

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.980
of really helping other
people's work get into the world

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:09.210
in its best light can help you
help me think about my own work

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:14.290
and what potentials it has.

01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:15.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:21.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. As I'm listening to you
I hear you all very poetically

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:26.340
speak of poetry as singing,
listening, conveying truth,

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:32.680
which all sounds like
something a little bit less;

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.260
a little bit subconscious,
a little bit less conscious

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.340
than our normal conversation.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.000
Do you think that poetry
is a way to convey things

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.450
that we feel kind of
behind and beneath or above?

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:50.640
I don't know, but behind
those conventional words

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.360
that we normally cannot express?

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.860
Like a way of giving vocabulary
to the things that we feel,

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.160
whereas, prose is more,
a more conventional way

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.020
of talking about ideas?

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.320
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy:
Audre Lorde says,

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.140
"Poetry is the way we
give name to the nameless

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.940
so it can be thought."

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:13.830
So, yeah. But I also
think prose can do it.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:18.010
It just, the, there are ways in.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:20.480
There are ways into
understanding ourselves.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.780
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.080
&gt;&gt; Camille T. Dungy: I
mean, Audre Lorde said

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.520
that phrase in an essay.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.320
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: Yeah.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.040
[ Laughter ]

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.340
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I mean,

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.030
people are always
comparing things to poetry,

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.540
but when it gets right down to
it we also have to compare it

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.790
to something, so we're like
singing sounds good, you know?

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:39.050
Like music is it make sense.

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:42.270
I think that it makes
a lot of sense.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:46.070
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: We have time for
one more question, go ahead.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.390
Yeah.

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:51.690
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm thinking about
how for poetry so much of it

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.060
like shifts when read aloud
versus like [inaudible]

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:58.640
on a page and how so much
of I think as a writer

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.300
like reconciling that sort of
tension between how you want it

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.160
to look on a page and be
read by an audience member

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.120
versus like reading it aloud
and then sort of wondering how

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.180
that translates into prose,
which may not have the same sort

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.640
of limitations or
in other ways does

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.560
and I'm curious what you
guys think about that.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.360
&gt;&gt; Patrick Rosal: There's been
this sort of immense privileging

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.060
of the written word over
the, over the spoken word

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:26.540
for a very longtime
in western culture,

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.910
and what we really know is the
fact is that the spoken word,

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:34.070
the singing word, the bodies
among bodies making literature

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:36.960
and stories and song
is much, much older

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.440
and there's a return to that.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.840
Somebody much smarter than
that coined a phrase called

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.350
"The new orality" with the
Internet and performance

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:48.830
and so forth and I know a very
few writers regardless of genre

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:53.900
who are not engaging with their
own work or other people's work

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.850
on a stage or without
being out on stage

01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:59.280
or on a mic or out loud.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.370
So, this is a whole
other conversation,

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:06.270
because I'm so deeply invested
in the role of performance

01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:12.220
in our culture, but I this,
I think that regardless

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.740
of genre this out
loud manifestation

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.960
of our literature is actually
a central part to the way

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:27.400
that we engage with story
and song in this country.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.220
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: I
think that it, oh wrap it up.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.820
I think that it can.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.120
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Bring
us home Patricia.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.420
&gt;&gt; Patricia Lockwood: Yes,
so I'll bring us home.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.720
Thank you very much.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.540
When I read my first book
I definitely was in a place

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.360
where I didn't have access to
being able to do something,

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.120
like you I didn't have a
place where I could perform,

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.880
no one wanted to hear
me read my poems.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.130
So, you have in first book,
you have a person at a desk,

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:48.430
you know, writing to herself,

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.390
maybe not necessarily
understanding that it going

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.890
to be really fucking
hard to pronounce some

01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:54.850
of that stuff once you have to
stand up and read it later on.

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.770
So, then in my next book
I'm like damn, I get it now.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.020
I know that I'm going to have
to get in front of a microphone

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.930
at some point and
read this to people.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.850
So, when it got time to
actually write prose,

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:05.830
I'm like well I know
what I can do.

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.310
I can use some of
these little tips

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:08.920
and tricks in prose as well.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.820
Basically, yeah as you're
writing no matter how deep

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.120
into it you're getting,
always think

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.420
about how it's going to sound.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.050
And read out loud when
you're editing always;

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.920
always read out loud and change
the font so that it looks weird

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.820
to you and you can
catch mistakes.

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.740
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: And with
that, we'll it's a wrap.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.300
Thank you too, Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:31.010
