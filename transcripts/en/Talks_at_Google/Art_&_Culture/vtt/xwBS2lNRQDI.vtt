[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.240
GISELE CASTRO: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.760
It is an absolute
pleasure being here today

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.070
as we celebrate
Black History Month.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.660
There's so much to celebrate.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.180
And then, as Jenny
said, there's so much

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.100
work that we need to do.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.140
Good afternoon, I'm Gisele
Castro, the Executive Director

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.420
of Exalt Youth.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.210
We are an educational
internship program

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.640
that serves young
people who are involved

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.189
in the juvenile justice
system in New York City.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.320
And our model is very simple.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.670
It's an educational
internship program.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.150
However, it is
how we do our work

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.690
that we have been able
to have 99% of our youth

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.810
engage in school,
moving on to graduation,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.790
and going off to
college for those

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.940
who are inclined to do so.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.060
And as Jenny said, you
know, 2% of our kids

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.070
are not reconvicted of a crime.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.220
And more importantly, for those
who come into our organization

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.620
with an open court
case, most of them,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.270
their cases are dismissed.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.720
The reason to this is our work.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.060
It is our appeal.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.420
It is that we come with
a large group of people

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630
who are interested in
ensuring that we bring equity

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.620
and justice to our youth.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.620
I want to thank you
once again for being

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.760
here with us this afternoon.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.890
And I want to introduce our
Director of Programs, Brian

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.140
Lewis, who's going to
introduce our youth

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.780
and also give us
all an opportunity

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.480
to understand the challenges
that our youth face

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.122
with our production of "16
Bars of Offending Justice."

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:39.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.380
BRIAN LEWIS: James
Baldwin once said,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.320
"Anyone who has ever
struggled with poverty

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.682
knows how extremely
expensive it is to be poor."

00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.140
The narratives of the young
people who you're about to hear

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.020
know those struggles well.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.420
But I think it's important to
note that the struggles that

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.980
they experience take not only
a materialistic and a physical

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.790
toll-- which they do--

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.030
but they also take a mental
and spiritual toll as well.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.400
In the summer of
2016, when we first

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.820
debuted and conceived of
this piece at The New School

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.820
in Eugene Lang College,
we were adamant

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.320
that we mix these
stories together.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.980
We did that for two reasons.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.265
One was to protect
the identities

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.140
of the young people who
you're about to hear,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.851
because they're all minors.

00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:31.350
But the other reason
we did that was

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.290
because we knew it was
important that we share

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.800
in this collaborative effort
of doing what my mentor Sekou

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.080
Sundiata called making
as a way of thinking.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.630
So the stories that
you're about to hear

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.600
are not the stories of
any singular one person

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.080
who you will see on the stage.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.320
They belong to all of us.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.600
And so very much in that
spirit of shared work

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.630
and responsibility,
we ask you to engage

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.120
in what James Baldwin once
again would have called

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.340
an act of radical listening.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.490
So open your ears, and
also to open your hearts

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.400
to their voices,
to their stories,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.090
to the things that
they have to say.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.570
Because their struggles
are our struggles.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.280
And now, without
further ado, I invite

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.240
you to please welcome
the youth of "16 Bars--

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.859
Youth Offending Justice."

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.793
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:38.840
LATUNE FINCH: 16 Bars.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.940
They love me.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.590
They love me not.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.720
They love me-- my ambition.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.800
They love me not--

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.180
my color.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.280
They love me-- my character.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.390
They love me not--

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.560
my sexuality.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.230
They love me for all the
things you can't see.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.030
Then, they love me not.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.370
JMAR REID: New York has finally
recognized what research

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.620
and science have confirmed.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.450
Adolescents are children.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150
And prosecuting and placing
them under the adult criminal

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.600
justice system
doesn't work for them,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.360
and it doesn't work
for public safety.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.890
SPEAKER 3: In 2017, Raise
the Age legislation passed.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.770
However, it will take three
years to go into full effect.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.600
In the meantime,
many young people

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.010
will continue to be prosecuted
as adults and courts

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.730
and will continue
to be incarcerated

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.527
in adult jails like Rikers.

00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:33.735
ALEXIS SANDERS: What does
a youth offender look like?

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:36.030
Like a kid who is
crying out for help.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.230
JMAR REID: What does a
youth offender look like?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.860
They look like us--

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.015
young and black,
colored of any sort.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.479
Look, they don't care.

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.020
As long as you've got any type
of browning that isn't a spray

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.385
tan, then you're black.

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:49.170
ALEXIS SANDERS: Hispanics, too--

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.290
the lighter ones may get away
until they hear your last name.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.410
Martinez, Gonzales, anybody
could be a criminal.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.520
But growing up in New York,
growing up in America, black

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.574
and Hispanics are
labeled as criminals.

00:05:00.574 --> 00:05:02.490
LATUNE FINCH: We got the
name youth offenders.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.400
But we're just ordinary kids.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.700
To the system, we're not.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.940
Even if I didn't do the crime,
somebody got to do the time.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.790
How come the system knows what
youth offenders look like,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.800
but in our community,
they just look like kids

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.120
trying to find a way out?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.490
JMAR REID: Youth offenders--

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.710
any colored kid in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.620
SPEAKER 3: Youth offenders-- any
colored kid living in poverty.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.578
ALEXIS SANDERS: When
white kids commit a crime,

00:05:24.578 --> 00:05:25.980
no one mentions it in the media.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.130
If they do, they'll say
he has a mental illness.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.100
But when a black kid commits
a crime, it hits the news.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.927
Then, they say
it's gang related.

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.760
LATUNE FINCH: I don't
know a youth offender.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.360
I don't know of that concept.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.870
It's a white man's word.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.370
They title us in a bad way--

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.420
like they ever titled us
in a good way, remember?

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.440
Nigger, gangster, thug, hood
rat, jailbait-- any of those

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.070
ring a bell?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.780
They rung mine like
it's Christmas time

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.500
and the carollers
are out to sing.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.031
They rung me like a doorbell
or woke me up like an alarm.

00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:53.530
[CLAP]

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.612
ALL: Wake up.

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:56.570
LATUNE FINCH: I don't
know any youth offenders.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.620
I know the young man
who made a mistake.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.750
I know the girl who
fought for food.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.970
I know the young man
being bullied who snapped

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.560
from all the internal hate.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.590
I know kids that need help
to be safe, to be themselves.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.842
Sorry, I don't know
a youth offender.

00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:11.550
SPEAKER 3: Criminal
summonses and arrests

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.670
dropped more than 90% since
a Democratic-controlled city

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.539
government decriminalized
low-level offenses last year.

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:18.830
JMAR REID: What does that mean?

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.830
SPEAKER 3: It means violations.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.010
LATUNE FINCH: Yeah--
jumping the turnstile.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.000
ALEXIS SANDERS:
Asking for a swipe.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.910
SPEAKER 3: Sitting
on the sidewalk.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.150
LATUNE FINCH: Walking
through the train doors.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.070
ALEXIS SANDERS: Crossing through
a playground when it's closed.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.930
JMAR REID: You know, the police
look for different things

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.680
on different days.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.650
LATUNE FINCH: What day is that
day for making your quota?

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.660
ALEXIS SANDERS: Under the new
law passed by city council--

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.980
LATUNE FINCH: The city-- the
Criminal Justice Reform Act?

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.820
ALEXIS SANDERS:
--law enforcements

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.250
will issue tickets for
those things mentioned,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.110
which, in the past,
would have been dealt

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.020
with in a criminal court but can
now be addressed with community

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.889
service and a fine.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.180
SPEAKER 3: And that's progress.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.080
But police can still
arrest you and lock you up

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.080
if you are a recidivist.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.840
JMAR REID: A what?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.049
LATUNE FINCH: A recidivist--
a previous offender.

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:54.340
JMAR REID: This is how it goes.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.650
LATUNE FINCH: You're
ready to be locked up.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.190
You're ready to
be fed up-- fed up

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.340
with the betrayal of
the land of the free.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.000
They want the youth
to be in darkness.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.458
They don't want
the next generation

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.670
to be better than the last.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.740
They bother the helpless
and abuse their power

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.380
because, to them,
we are worthless.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.570
SPEAKER 3: The cops are
trained to use their weapons

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.970
and assert force on criminals.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.100
They don't learn how to
properly use their guns

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.700
or how to disarm people.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.400
That make conflict
out of nothing.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.430
What they don't realize is
that people are getting hurt.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.076
People are getting killed.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.700
People are embarrassed, and they
can't stand up for themselves.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.244
Clearly, what the cops
are doing is not working.

00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:31.410
LATUNE FINCH: They ran
because they were scared, not

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.920
because you said freeze.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.620
Riding your bike to
the park, then you

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.410
get stopped for riding
on the sidewalk.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.910
They claim you give an attitude
then push you off your bike.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.770
They didn't ask for his age.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.771
This is how it goes when
a cop feels threatened.

00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:44.311
ALEXIS SANDERS: This
is how it goes--

00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:45.870
you get loud on
the train, you're

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.300
laughing with your friends
pushing each other around.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.240
This leads to a school
suspension then an arrest.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.470
And this is how it goes
when you look like me.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.540
LATUNE FINCH: When
you look like me.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.080
JMAR REID: And me.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.800
SPEAKER 3: And me.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600
LATUNE FINCH: Maybe you get
into a fight-- a stupid beef,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.734
or it's self-defense.

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:00.150
SPEAKER 3: You
jump the turnstile.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.566
ALEXIS SANDERS: I
had to get home.

00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:02.790
I didn't have $2.75.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.400
I swiped my metro card,
and it took my money,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.540
but didn't let me in.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.560
So I jumped.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.080
The next time they stopped me
when I stepped off the train,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.120
the officers pulled
me onto the bench

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.240
and said that the metro card
I used wasn't actually mine.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.410
They asked for my ID.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.490
I didn't have it.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.220
They asked me how old I was,
and I told him I was 16.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.540
JMAR REID: You don't look 16.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.140
LATUNE FINCH: And this is
how it goes where I'm from.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.570
JMAR REID: Send me to Horizons.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.320
Send me to Rikers, and I
will learn all the skills

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.020
I need to survive--

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.429
all the skills I need
to be bad so I can cope

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.869
when I get back on the street.

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:36.077
ALEXIS SANDERS: Detaining
the young persons at Rikers

00:08:36.077 --> 00:08:40.590
caused New York City taxpayers
almost $250,000 per person,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.429
per year.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.240
For $8,000, a young person can
be supported for a year or more

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.530
by a program like Exalt.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.309
CALVIN FALCON: $250,000
to lock up a kid?

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:51.600
ALEXIS SANDERS: My student
loans for a four year degree

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.220
is a fraction of that cost.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.440
89% of detainers
at Rikers Island

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.630
are black or Latino,
despite the fact

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.790
that black and
Latinos make up 53%

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.260
of New York City's population
of over 8 million people.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.167
JMAR REID: Suggest
a guilty conscience.

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:06.750
Look, it starts with
the police saying

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.850
that you fit the description.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.702
Then they don't
like your attitude.

00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:13.610
And then they take
the situation too far.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.680
LATUNE FINCH: They had
their guns drawn at us.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.820
We didn't have any
type of weapon.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.150
We didn't even get within
10 feet of the guy,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.930
and all we had was words
exchanged for about a minute.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.140
And it turned into the cops
throwing me on the floor,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.520
then ripping my sweater
and kicking me in my face

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.110
because I had screamed.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.000
My arresting officer
threw me on the floor

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.650
and kneed me in my back.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.400
ALEXIS SANDERS: They
locked up her brother

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.592
when he tried to come pick
her up because he was 18.

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:39.050
When the mother
came, they told her

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.550
that they were in the precinct.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.860
The police said that they
were being sent to Spofford,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.750
and if she wanted her kids, that
she'd better go to the Bronx

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.740
and go pick them up.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.720
LATUNE FINCH: So you know,
I hear my mom's voice,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.970
and there's a cop in the room.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.847
So I ask him, is my mom here?

00:09:51.847 --> 00:09:52.430
JMAR REID: No.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.638
LATUNE FINCH: Is my mom here?

00:09:53.638 --> 00:09:54.420
Can you go check?

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.220
JMAR REID: Fine.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.122
Fucking Negroes.

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:57.830
LATUNE FINCH: So he
got up, and he said--

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.550
JMAR REID: No.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.380
Your mom's not here.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.180
LATUNE FINCH: And now
the door was open,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.460
and I could see the
reflection in the glass.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.699
I could see my mom
standing there.

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:08.740
ALEXIS SANDERS: When I
was 12, I got into a fight

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.450
by the train station with a
kid that went to my school,

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.860
and I hit him pretty bad.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.360
This kid was a
little older than me,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.860
and he was a seventh grader.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.810
He had just got out
of Horizons, and he

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.060
was saying he was a gangbanger
and yelling in my face.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.700
I was small, and he
was causing a scene

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.840
in front of these girls.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.520
He pushed me, and
I put my hands up.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.200
And he swung, and he punched me.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.740
And I hit him above the eye.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.820
He stumbled and he fell, and
all of the adults in the area

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.440
were saying--

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440
ALL: Get away from here.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.702
Run.

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.410
ALEXIS SANDERS: And
we ran to the school.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.110
He tried to say I jumped
him, but then he got scared

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.190
and told the truth.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.120
The police came
out of the school.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.960
The officer was my fifth
grade teacher's husband.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.910
My school is linked
up to the precinct.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.050
They treated me bad.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.730
There was a lot of disrespect.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.500
There was a lot of
negative attention.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.630
But they had to let me go
because other kids didn't

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.160
want to press charges, but
the officers were saying--

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.970
SPEAKER 3: I'm going
to get you one day,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.250
and I'm not letting you go.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.670
ALEXIS SANDERS:
And it scared me.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.280
LATUNE FINCH:
Eventually, the officer

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.800
did arrest her at 13 years old.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.650
She got into another fight,
and the kid was bigger than her

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.070
then.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.430
And she was still small.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.274
If one person disrespects
you, then everyone around you

00:11:12.274 --> 00:11:13.940
feels that they can
disrespect you, too.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.920
And this is a problem, and you
can't do anything about it.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.080
So I filed a report because
I had swelling on my face.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.580
And even though
it had went down,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.940
it was still very much swollen.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.370
And my property was damaged.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.740
My sweater was ripped,
and my bone was cracked.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.340
And I knew something
needed to happen.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.050
I know my rights.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.175
I knew my rights as a female.

00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:34.325
SPEAKER 3: A male officer
can't arrest a female.

00:11:34.325 --> 00:11:38.090
And even if she looks like
a boy, she's still a girl.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.040
It's against the law
because a lot of females

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.800
are saying that they were
sexually harassed by officers.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.640
So now they can't do it anymore.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.900
It takes a second to
radio in a female officer.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.790
And since she was
right by the precinct,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.640
there's no reason a female
officer isn't around.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.570
It wasn't as if she was
the only girl there.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.870
And even if you came to
arrest a whole bunch of kids,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.540
you should have
a female officer.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.430
LATUNE FINCH: Research
into brain development

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.800
shows that the human
brain is not fully formed

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.199
until the age of 25.

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:06.740
SPEAKER 3: My mom
had called the cops

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.210
to walk my brother
out the house.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.090
And the officer called backup
because he thought my other two

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.525
brothers were going to jump in.

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:14.150
When the other officers
came, they just

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.181
grabbed my other two
brothers for no reason.

00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:18.680
So when they were all helping
each other to get the cops off

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.430
of them, they stopped-- one of
the officers stopped and pulled

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.000
out his gun and pointed it at
my older brother and said--

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.200
JMAR REID: Do you
want to die in front

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.680
of your mom and little sisters?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.320
LATUNE FINCH: After that, they
took them all to the precinct.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.374
ALEXIS SANDERS: In 2017, the
DA's office in both Manhattan

00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:35.540
and Brooklyn announced that
they will no longer seek

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.027
cash bail for non-felony cases.

00:12:38.027 --> 00:12:40.610
LATUNE FINCH: While the change
could save New Yorkers millions

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.550
of dollars and hundreds
of days in jail time,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.580
cash bail can still
be sought in instances

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.170
where a felony is charged.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.850
And this burden
can be especially

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.370
difficult for a
low-income family to bear.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.070
JMAR REID: Rikers is a
really twisted place.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.040
In the beginning,
it's a horror movie.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.530
The way they cage you up in
there, it looks like a dungeon.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.300
They buzz you in
four or five times

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.580
after they take
off your shackles.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.500
You know, when
you get to intake,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.810
it's completely terrible.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.390
Everyone you meet will do
anything it takes to survive.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.910
And the COs are the worst.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.790
In some cases, I've seen
someone get housed and come back

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.179
all bruised up.

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:19.970
ALEXIS SANDERS: He said
he went to housing,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.520
and his unit was full of a
bunch of rival gang members.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.524
And they just beat him
up just to beat him up.

00:13:24.524 --> 00:13:25.940
He's really just
trying to survive

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.200
in there and everything.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.110
People is just playing
around with their lives.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.510
JMAR REID: I never expected
when I got released.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.071
I remember I told my
mom not to bail me out.

00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:37.070
I was sleeping, and one
officer went by my door,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.280
and he just turned the lights
on and shined it on me.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.900
And I'm like, yo,
what's going on?

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.660
Why is the light shining on me?

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.970
Well, I looked up,
and he disappeared.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.887
He came back, opened my
door, and he told me--

00:13:47.887 --> 00:13:49.469
ALEXIS SANDERS:
You're being released.

00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:50.730
You know who released you?

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.640
JMAR REID: No.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.230
SPEAKER 3: He gave Frank a
paper and told him to sign it.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.316
He signed everything.

00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:57.940
He stayed back a little bit, so
they woke him up for breakfast.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.440
And he was eating
with a few fellows

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.690
who were about to get
released that day too.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.670
So they took all his
stuff, and they sent him

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.610
upstairs to the next jail
cell-- to the end of it.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.260
When they came, they
put him in a cell,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.850
and they went to go
get his belongings.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.610
It took them like five hours.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.860
JMAR REID: So I started
getting irritated.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.380
Like man, I want to get out.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.130
I want to go home.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.088
I just wanted to go home,
but at the same time,

00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:24.290
I'm getting more irritated
and becoming impatient.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.030
Then they finally
brought me my stuff.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.560
They sent me out to a
bus, and they took me out

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.460
of the housing unit.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.580
And they're just driving--

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.070
driving to get me to
the end of the island.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.780
So I go there, and
the lady tells me--

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.630
LATUNE FINCH: I left some
information about a program.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.520
Call them when you get out.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.290
They'll help you.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.910
JMAR REID: I told the lady
I left something at Rikers,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.380
and she goes--

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.671
LATUNE FINCH: Just go that way.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.280
Just keep moving,
and don't look back.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.399
JMAR REID: And I just
didn't ask her again.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:45.690
I went to get my metro card,
which had two fares on it.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.315
I had to wait out
there for a city bus,

00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:48.860
you know, and trying
to wave it down.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.070
And an officer saw me.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.540
ALEXIS SANDERS: Don't do that.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.250
JMAR REID: So I stopped.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.296
And I went on the bus.

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:55.920
I forgot the same
day I got released is

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.090
the same day as my court
date, so they said--

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.010
ALEXIS SANDERS: Make
sure you go to court

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.660
before they give you a warrant.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.210
LATUNE FINCH: So Frank went
straight to the Supreme Court.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.370
And when he went
there, they told him

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.950
he had to go to criminal
court, so he went there.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.704
He waited for the judge,
with some substitute lawyer.

00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:12.620
There, they told him
that his court appearance

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.100
was changed to the next day.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.210
So he could go home.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.800
JMAR REID: I walked around
Downtown Brooklyn just trying

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.299
to get my mind off of Rikers,
because it messed me up really

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:20.040
badly.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.373
And, you know, I thought I'd
just cool off a little bit,

00:15:22.373 --> 00:15:23.890
then I'd go home.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.662
So I go home.

00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:27.370
And, you know, the
first thing on my mind

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.440
is, let me call my brother.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.880
Let me bring the peace
between me and him.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.850
I knock the door, and
my sister was there.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.640
She was surprised to see me,
and she told me the news--

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.510
broke it down, and I'm
like, what happened?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.820
My sister told me our
brother was murdered.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.835
When she told, me it crushed me.

00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:47.960
It was like my heart was
ripped out and everything.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.640
I just spent a
week in hell, and I

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.451
got to hear about something
worse than what I just did?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.450
I just broke down crying
because the first thing

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.610
I was going to do is to
tell my sister to call him.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.954
And it was too late.

00:15:57.954 --> 00:15:59.370
And it taught me
a lesson that you

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.037
can't keep waiting for things.

00:16:01.037 --> 00:16:03.120
And that's why sometimes
I hate hearing the word--

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.995
ALEXIS SANDERS: Wait.

00:16:03.995 --> 00:16:06.060
JMAR REID: What's
the sense to wait?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.100
I started lashing out,
arguing and destroying

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.540
stuff because of the pain
after my brother died.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.130
I didn't care
about life anymore.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.130
I didn't care about
graduating or anything.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:22.150
I just kept lashing out,
lashing out, lashing out.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.070
SPEAKER 3: Protect and serve?

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.036
Take out the word protect
and put in the word target.

00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:28.910
ALEXIS SANDERS: I can't
run down the streets,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.540
or I'm running from something.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.350
But you, if you're
in yoga pants,

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.830
you can run down the street,
and you're just jogging.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.830
I have a target on my back every
time I go out the front door.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.360
And my mom is always worried.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.490
She is sick when I
don't come home on time.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.830
She tells me to be
careful, to be polite.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.462
Don't get into it with anybody.

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:46.920
I watch who crosses
the street when

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.570
I'm coming back down the block.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.980
LATUNE FINCH: I
was just walking,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.794
and you target me, make
me lose all my pride.

00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:53.710
You want to arrest me.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.800
You want to slam me
up against the wall.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.200
Warning shots-- no
taser, no baton,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.500
always a spoonful of hatred.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.767
I could be killed today.

00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:03.600
I could be outside of
my house and be killed

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.590
by cops or by gangbangers.

00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:08.670
CALVIN FALCON: And then it's the
black person that goes to jail.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.130
But if a cop kills,
there's no justice.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.540
And you lost your life.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.619
And your mom is sick.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.244
That's going to break
your mom's heart.

00:17:15.244 --> 00:17:16.050
And then what?

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.890
You, your brothers,
your sisters--

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.130
your whole family going to
start carrying guns now?

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.546
ALEXIS SANDERS:
As a young person,

00:17:21.546 --> 00:17:24.000
my opinions don't hold as
much weight because, you know,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.980
I'm a child.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.089
Even my facts don't
hold as much weight.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.650
And I'm ridiculed for that.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.430
JMAR REID: When you
come out of jail,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.865
you expect someone to support
you at the end of the day.

00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:34.279
But it's very hard to
find that one person

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:35.820
because once you
come out, everyone's

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.724
going to treat you
like a criminal.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.390
ALEXIS SANDERS: New
York allows children

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.000
as young as seven years old
to be arrested and charged

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.310
with acts of
juvenile delinquency.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.440
What did you do
when you were seven?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.750
LATUNE FINCH: My best summer day
was when I was seven years old.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.850
It's in Barbados.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.365
That's where my family is from.

00:17:52.365 --> 00:17:54.030
It starts off getting
ready for crop

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.880
over, wake up to the
sounds of the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.707
We get ready, we pick our
mangoes from the trees,

00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:01.290
get our lemonade
that me and my sister

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.370
got to squeeze ourselves.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.237
Then we can hear the bands
rehearsing for the floats--

00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:09.820
it's so loud, you can even feel
the turbulence on the ground--

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.330
all the people in their
costumes playing mass.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.980
Then we'd head to
the beach, walk

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.271
through the fields of the
farm with my cousins Danielle

00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:22.320
and Jackie, eat our
mangoes in the sea water,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.140
play with the jellyfish,
go for a swim,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.510
or even float on
our big red lobster.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.304
Then we'd wash up and get
treats from the store.

00:18:30.304 --> 00:18:31.970
These was Indian chips
called Bigfoots--

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.300
the spicy ones
were my favorite--

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.762
and this type of strawberry
milk, which isn't cow milk,

00:18:36.762 --> 00:18:37.470
but coconut milk.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.270
And it's just the best thing.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.259
And that's my best summer day.

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:43.050
ALEXIS SANDERS: We
can't do what adults do.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.800
We can't buy liquor, cigarettes,
or a lottery ticket at 16.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.960
But you can get
locked up for a crime.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.312
When you act like a child
even when you are a child,

00:18:51.312 --> 00:18:52.770
people are saying
there's no reason

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.290
to be acting like a child and
doing all this dumb stuff.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.456
SPEAKER 3: But then, if you
do things like an adult,

00:18:57.456 --> 00:18:59.370
they say, well,
you're just a kid.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.430
Do you want me to be
a kid or an adult?

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.680
LATUNE FINCH: Young people
are treated unequal.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.550
I'll say that.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.360
Young people are
treated unfairly.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.980
They're seen as demented
or ghetto or gangbangers.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.800
And if you have a certain
style or you act a certain way,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.840
it's wrong to society.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.990
And it's unfair because the
white kid could be ghetto,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.910
and it's fun for him to be hood.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.560
But if a black kid has proper
grammar, does his schoolwork,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.170
wears glasses and
doesn't sag his pants,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.340
then he's considered the
black white boy, the wanna be.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.980
And that's unfair because
he's black and educated.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.010
Not only are you black, but
you're black and educated.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.260
JMAR REID: Black people are
already seen as a threat.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.120
So if you're not only black,
but now you're educated, well,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.560
maybe you're even
more of a threat

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.310
because you know what
to do when you start

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.710
to see all the opportunities.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.500
You shine a light, and
you're not blind to yourself.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.230
ALEXIS SANDERS: Home for
me is my thoughts, my mind.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.460
That's my home.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.720
It's the safest place.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.420
I don't feel like my home is
where I live or where I go.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.930
My state of mind is where
I'm free from harm, where

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.760
I zone out to avoid things.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.650
When everything where
you physically live

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.842
isn't where you want to be, your
mental state is the best home.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:12.300
JMAR REID: The
hardest challenge is

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.310
having that voice in my head
saying that I won't make it.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.220
LATUNE FINCH: I work to help
people in any way that I can--

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.870
being physically supportive or
emotionally supportive-- having

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.900
someone who can sympathize or
empathize with you on what's

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.600
going on.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.690
So for me, it was
not having love.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.640
I've learned to talk
to myself and construct

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.150
ways I can make my
life better and see

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.950
if I can do whatever I can to
get out the hood, and if I can,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.450
help my community.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.640
SPEAKER 3: If our
words could save us,

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.200
everything would be different.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.460
To them, our age don't matter.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.761
For us, we have to change that.

00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:46.260
This is how it goes when you
can't get home and nobody wants

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.460
to give you a swipe.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.830
So you do what you
don't want to do.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.999
They see you in need,
but you was their needs--

00:20:51.999 --> 00:20:53.290
their need to fill their quota.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.600
No ID, age don't matter to
them-- they take you in.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.640
It would have been a 30
minute ride to go home,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.280
and now it's a 48 hour.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.530
Get roughed up for
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.887
Raise the age so that
kids can get home safe.

00:21:08.887 --> 00:21:11.220
ALEXIS SANDERS: Where do you
see yourself in five years?

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.000
LATUNE FINCH: In
five years, I see

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.580
myself greater than what I am.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.320
I'm not sure where
my path will lead,

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.170
but I know it will be for
greater good-- the best

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.227
effects of me, my
family, and my community.

00:21:24.227 --> 00:21:25.810
SPEAKER 3: In five
years, I see myself

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.840
being the successful tattoo
artist I always wanted to be.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.670
I see myself having
a beautiful family

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.410
with a beautiful
house in Florida

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.990
with all the phone calls I want.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.330
I see myself doing everything
people doubted I could do.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.510
In five years, I
will be the person

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.160
I wanted to grow up to be.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.080
JMAR REID: In five
years, I see myself

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.817
in my third year of college with
a job on the side, you know,

00:21:46.817 --> 00:21:49.150
working hard, spreading word
about Raise the Age helping

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.460
the youth, stacking my
money, helping to raise

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.980
my little brother.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.840
I see myself out of New
York, out of the hood

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.120
with a clean record,
finally free.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.624
I see myself doing
whatever I put my mind to.

00:22:01.624 --> 00:22:03.790
ALEXIS SANDERS: I want you
to make your mother proud

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.800
cause she's not here, but I know
she's watching me every day.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.330
I don't want my father
taking care of me anymore.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.640
I want to take care of him.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.310
Five years from now, I
see myself out the hood

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.080
like all my friends promised.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.300
I will be an adult
five years from now.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.010
And of course, life
will get harder.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.380
But you have to grow up someday.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.190
LATUNE FINCH: In just five
years, I might be free--

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.350
well, as free as I can be.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:32.570
Free to drink, free to smoke,
but that's only semi-free.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.500
I'll take it.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.180
In five years,
I'll be semi-free.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.430
"Too High," by Sekou Sundiata
from "The 51st Dream State."

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.590
ALEXIS SANDERS: What if
we were life, or liberty,

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.540
or the pursuit of something new?

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.540
SPEAKER 3: Between the rocks
below and the stars above,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.149
what if we were
composed by love?

00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:53.440
JMAR REID: And what if we
could show that what we dream

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.800
is deeper than what we know?

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.800
LATUNE FINCH: Suppose if
something does not live

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.720
in the world we long to see?

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.572
ALEXIS SANDERS: Then we make it
ourselves as we want it to be?

00:23:01.572 --> 00:23:04.030
JMAR REID: What if we are life,
or liberty, and the pursuit

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.930
of something new?

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.721
SPEAKER 3: And suppose
the beautiful answer

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:09.010
asks the more beautiful
question, why don't we

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.900
get our hopes up too high?

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.180
LATUNE FINCH: Why don't we
get our hopes up too high?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.436
ALL: Why don't we get
our hopes up too high?

00:23:17.436 --> 00:23:19.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.000
SPEAKER 5: 12 boys, 12 truths.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.380
One race, one lie.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.850
And we asked them to
share their stories.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.360
Our story's the truth
of this nation you see.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.360
Long before our necks
proved strong enough

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.150
to hang from 12-foot
trees, we knew who we.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.440
We knew our problems.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.730
These boys got stories.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.340
The boys got problems.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.320
10 10-hour days, and not one
boy has blamed his hardship

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.320
on the system like
project housing,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.320
bus tokens, ticket luncheons,
immigration, adoption,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.740
abortion, teen pregnancy,
rape, police brutality,

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.320
gang violence, like
mass incarceration

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.955
ain't the result of this system.

00:24:12.955 --> 00:24:14.986
But who are we to
say he is lying?

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:16.360
Who are y'all to
say we're lying?

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.820
All he knows is his
mother never loved him.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.520
Mother left him on a doorstep
so grasping for love,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.770
facing [INAUDIBLE]
reminiscent about touch.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.380
All he knows is father
never claimed him.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.950
Father two was never claimed,
so father never new love.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.150
Father never gave love.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.540
He never knew trust, and
we asked him to trust us.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.270
Our word is our bond.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.550
We must be here tomorrow
cause 12 boys got 12 stories.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.320
And the root of this
problem, whether it

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.410
be the household, or the system,
is that nobody is listening.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.379
One boy doesn't
know his last name.

00:24:46.379 --> 00:24:47.920
He's still hoping
he gets to the top.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.930
There are two boys in
the midst of an argument.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.729
One calls his sister a bitch.

00:24:51.729 --> 00:24:52.645
She runs out the door.

00:24:52.645 --> 00:24:55.210
Some hours later, she
comes home crying rape.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.284
He keeps blaming himself.

00:24:57.284 --> 00:24:58.950
The other boy can't
fathom with the fact

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.730
he didn't stop his younger
sister from running out

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.360
that door.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.920
Three boys think love is pain.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.830
I'm one of them.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.720
Four boys got the
exact same story.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.624
Five boys can't
fathom with the fact

00:25:08.624 --> 00:25:11.040
that their mother is using
their bodies to make ends meet.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.407
Six boys won't even talk.

00:25:12.407 --> 00:25:13.990
Their tears are
telling their stories.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.920
And out of 12 boys, only
one father got deported.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.177
I'm not talking about mine.

00:25:18.177 --> 00:25:19.260
Some fathers aren't there.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.600
Some fathers are in jail
when out of 12 boys,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.940
only one boy has
never met his mother.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.130
Seven boys got mothers
who strung out on drugs.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.380
And only one mother has found
the strength to recover.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.970
I'm talking about mine.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.310
Eight boys just want to be free.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.810
They like, I can't
go back to juvie.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.910
Nine boys, because they
did 10 10-hour days,

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.200
want to go to college.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.600
10 boys more confident
than they've ever been.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.220
Eleven boys blame
their hardships

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.500
on one decision--
deciding to be the same.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.560
12 boys think it's a chance
they can be different.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.580
One race.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.735
We blame it on the system,
but we, these 12 boys,

00:25:49.735 --> 00:25:51.030
know it's our household.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.060
We blame it on our household.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.934
We blame it on our household.

00:25:56.934 --> 00:25:58.100
We like, we never knew love.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.752
We never had love.

00:25:59.752 --> 00:26:00.960
All the system needs is love.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.310
Though like a one
day, if he loved me,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.726
would he still
pulled the trigger?

00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:06.450
Because if father knew
love, father would be here.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.090
Mother would be here.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.130
12 boys, 12 truths.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.050
One race, one lie.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.136
Both just needed love.

00:26:15.136 --> 00:26:17.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:22.570
JONATHAN PRIESTER: Let's give
another round of applause

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.620
to all our performers.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:30.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.430
My name is Jonathan Priester.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.220
I am one of the co-leads for the
New York chapter of the Black

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.060
Googler Network.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.730
I am an account strategist
here, and it is an honor

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:39.990
to have all of you all here.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.330
It is an honor to have
the Exalt family here.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.622
And before we begin, we're
going to have a brief panel,

00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:46.163
and then we're going
to some question

00:26:46.163 --> 00:26:47.700
and answer for the audience.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.040
But before we begin, I
think we want to start off

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.450
with introductions.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.700
So I'll start at the end,
and we'll work our way down.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.289
And then also, we'd love to have
just some quick introductions

00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:57.330
from our performers as
well because they've given

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.399
voice is such a
powerful subject.

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:00.690
JOLANDA PORTER: Good afternoon.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.481
I'm Jolanda Porter.

00:27:01.481 --> 00:27:05.184
I'm the Deputy
Director of Exalt.

00:27:05.184 --> 00:27:06.600
CALI JORDAN-GOTAY:
Good afternoon.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.840
My name is Cali Jordan-Gotay.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.280
I'm an Exalt alumni.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.204
I graduated in 2015, and I
work for the Daphne Foundation.

00:27:15.204 --> 00:27:16.370
BRIAN LEWIS: Good afternoon.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.227
Brian Lewis, the Director
of Programs for Exalt.

00:27:21.227 --> 00:27:22.810
LATUNE FINCH: My
name is Latune Finch.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:28.190
I am a Exalt alumni,
and I graduated in 2015.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.740
And I am an entrepreneur.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.369
JONATHAN PRIESTER: And could
you give-- and if each of you

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:35.910
all could come up
real quick, we want

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.990
to make sure--
you all gave voice

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.040
to such powerful messages.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.290
Come back to the stage real
quick, introduce yourself.

00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:44.110
JMAR REID: Hello, my
name is Jmar Reid.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.390
I am a member of the New School.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.790
I have come on to
this lovely project

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.674
just to help out
in any way I can.

00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:52.590
ALEXIS SANDERS: Hello.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.390
My name is Alexis
Sanders, and I'm

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.835
a Exalt graduate of cycle 85.

00:27:57.835 --> 00:27:58.710
CALVIN FALCON: Hello.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.720
My name is Calvin
Falcon, I'm also here

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.760
on behalf of the New
School Lang department.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.054
I'm a theater major as well.

00:28:04.054 --> 00:28:05.970
JONATHAN PRIESTER: Let's
give them all a round

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.135
of applause one more time.

00:28:07.135 --> 00:28:09.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:18.400
So my first question for
the entire panel really is--

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.800
that was such a
powerful presentation.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.870
It's captured so many
different stories.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.850
And as you mentioned
earlier, this isn't just

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.240
one person's narrative.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.050
This is a narrative of
an entire generation.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.780
So can you talk about
the creative process?

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.700
And can you share
with us what was it

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.952
like to be a part
of Exalt and going

00:28:35.952 --> 00:28:37.660
through that creative
process and putting

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.707
this piece together?

00:28:38.707 --> 00:28:40.540
LATUNE FINCH: Being a
part of Exalt in 2015,

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.670
I was going through
a very hard time,

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.559
and it drifted me
to a right path.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:47.350
When we started this
project, it was a year

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.360
after my graduation
in the summer of 2016.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.730
So we have been working on
this for a year and a half.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.150
During this process, we
did multiple monologues.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.280
Creativity, we just-- we thought
and processed everything that

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.320
happened to us over our lives--

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.770
me and several other
participants who

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.750
wrote and scripted the
documentary theater piece.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:19.630
BRIAN LEWIS: We also watched
the work of Anna Deavere Smith.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.230
We watched a lot of what
was happening in the media

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.740
that summer.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.031
So, you know, the police
killings and police brutality

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:29.530
that was happening sort of like
made its way into our script

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.320
and became a really
important focal point.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.866
We watched President
Obama's response

00:29:33.866 --> 00:29:34.990
to what happened in Dallas.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.031
And there was a lot of
things that were happening

00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:38.440
that really informed our work.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.790
It was sort of--

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.950
it was definitely a
lot of improvisation

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.350
and collaboration.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.600
JONATHAN PRIESTER: And I
guess as a follow up question

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.484
to that for the entire
panel, here at Google,

00:29:48.484 --> 00:29:50.650
we think of everything from
a technical perspective.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.420
We look at, like, oh, I
want to solve for x problem.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.240
So I'm going to build
this application.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.970
Or I'm going to build this
type of phone or something

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:58.930
like that.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.940
What were you all
looking to address?

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.431
What was the goal
in terms of, this

00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:04.430
is something that we're
seeing in the community.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.660
This is something
that we're seeing--

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.493
and again, throughout
the piece, there where

00:30:07.493 --> 00:30:08.980
it talks about Rikers.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.440
There where it talks
about specific legislation

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.690
such as Raise the Age, which
we'll get to in a moment.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.850
But was there something
specific that you had in mind?

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.141
Or was it really just, we
want to create a piece that's

00:30:18.141 --> 00:30:19.810
cathartic for the community?

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.685
JOLANDA PORTER: Yeah.

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.606
I think one of our main
goals was awareness.

00:30:22.606 --> 00:30:23.980
A lot of people
don't know what's

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.840
happening with the young
people in our country.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.267
And I think one goal was
awareness for the public.

00:30:31.267 --> 00:30:33.850
And I think the other goal was
to really help our young people

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.270
to look inside themselves and
be able to tell their stories.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.130
And one of the
best experiences I

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.116
had was working on
songwriting with the group

00:30:42.116 --> 00:30:43.990
and getting them to
really tell their stories

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.210
and seeing how that
could be transformed

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.280
into part of the piece.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.281
So I would say that awareness
is a big part of the issue.

00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:53.530
And I think that's one of
the things we're trying to--

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.760
we're striving to
do today, which

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.593
is to make you all aware
of what's happening

00:30:56.593 --> 00:30:57.580
and get you involved.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.830
CALI JORDAN-GOTAY: I was
there at the beginning stages

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.630
when everybody
was brainstorming.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.880
And this was a really
amazing process

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.360
because a lot of young people
aren't aware of the issues that

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.200
are going on, right?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.040
We just deal with
the effects of that.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.190
So it was really just an
opportunity to look at,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.390
what's going on today?

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:14.770
How does this affect us?

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:20.020
And how can we use this project
to tell people how we feel?

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.150
I think one of the focal
points of this project

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.370
are how valid our voices are.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.210
But as young people,
people just don't

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.880
listen sometimes, for
whatever reason that is--

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.120
ageism, adultism,
I'm not too sure.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.710
But this was an opportunity
for us to get together--

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.710
Exalt participants as a whole--
and share these real life

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.610
experiences.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.530
You do have minors who
are going to Rikers.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.450
You do have people
who are living

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.770
in impoverished neighborhoods.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.860
And you have people who are
dealing with this every day.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.870
But people only see
this angry face.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.030
So I think this
was an opportunity

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.590
to peel back the
layers, and it was

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.174
amazing to be a part of that.

00:31:58.174 --> 00:31:59.590
JONATHAN PRIESTER:
That's amazing.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.870
And I think you brought
up a good point.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.140
You called it adultism, but it's
really just closing our ears

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.910
and closing our minds
to a different reality.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.830
So one of the things I took away
from your powerful presentation

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.620
was giving voice
to the voiceless.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.950
And it seems like Exalt has
been a platform to that.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.860
So could you all speak
to the impact of Exalt--

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.290
how you got connected
with it, and the work

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.940
that Exalt does to make a
difference in the community?

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.100
LATUNE FINCH: Exalt is better
than the school system.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.670
It's better than,
you know, being

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.190
put on probation because
it teaches you something.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.150
It gives you education.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.149
It gives you strength,
and it gives you barriers

00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:40.930
that you know you
could hop over.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.120
It gives you the strength
to know when to leap,

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.630
and how to leap, and how far.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.900
Exalt has been a platform
for me throughout out years.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.550
It's 2018.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.950
I graduated in 2015.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.260
Before that, I started Exalt
when I was 14 years old.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.850
So being that I
was that young, it

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:04.540
drifted me onto the right
path and has shown me a better

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.480
way of living, essentially.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.230
CALI JORDAN-GOTAY:
Well, as you guys know,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.060
Exalt is an
organization that works

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.830
with justice-involved youth.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.210
So when I was
younger, I did have

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.480
an interaction with the
juvenile justice system.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.940
But what Exalt
helped me realize was

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.130
there was a reason that
this was happening.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.960
And you can look at this from
an analytical standpoint.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.360
And you can figure out what
you're going to do about it.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.270
And I used that as an
opportunity to kind of

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.450
push forth, right,
and just expose myself

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.360
to different opportunities to
learn about different fields

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.090
and, you know, what I
actually want to do.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.130
Right now, I'm getting
my bachelor's degree.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.040
So I'm studying politics,
law, and economics.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.640
And that's definitely something
that Exalt helped influence.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.280
That's a decision
that was made partly

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.250
by my experience with
Exalt because there

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.440
is such a deep issue in the
juvenile justice system.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.860
And it's just affecting
so many young people.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.010
And we don't know
how to look at it.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.640
And people don't look at it.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.016
And you just bypass
this huge problem.

00:34:03.016 --> 00:34:04.390
So this was an
opportunity for me

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:06.880
to learn and just do
something about it

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.261
and switch things around.

00:34:08.261 --> 00:34:09.969
BRIAN LEWIS: And so
what we do in Exalt--

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.210
and Latune and Cali spoke
so eloquently to it--

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.400
but essentially working
in three key areas.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.969
We're trying to get young
people to get their cases closed

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.440
or get sentence reductions.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.929
So we're working in the courts.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.100
We're working to get young
people enrolled in school

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.710
and progressing educationally.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.001
And then we're also providing
them with paid internship

00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:28.812
opportunities.

00:34:28.812 --> 00:34:30.520
And so when we work
in those three areas,

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.239
the one thing that we notice
is the common thread is that

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.880
so many of our young people--
and Cali and Latune both said

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.429
this, and all of our performers,
and the young people who

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:40.989
created these
stories said this--

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.895
is that they feel
disconnected from society.

00:34:42.895 --> 00:34:44.520
They feel like they
don't have a place.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.540
They're truly the
most marginalized.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.000
And so what Exalt is doing is
putting those young people's

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.560
experiences at the center.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.524
And that's why this was
such a perfect marriage

00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:54.190
to create this
documentary theater piece

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.920
because my colleague and I--

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.420
Cecilia Rubino, who
I have to thank.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.170
She's amazing.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.930
She's out here in the
audience somewhere.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.340
And Luisa [? Strodeman ?]
is also back

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:03.790
here doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:04.510
JONATHAN PRIESTER: Give
them a round of applause.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.850
BRIAN LEWIS: Please.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:05.776
Yeah.

00:35:05.776 --> 00:35:08.554
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.034
When we created this piece,
we said, OK, you know,

00:35:12.034 --> 00:35:13.866
we're going to come up
with writing prompts.

00:35:13.866 --> 00:35:16.334
We're going to come up with
different activities and things

00:35:16.334 --> 00:35:17.500
that we can create together.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.110
But the young
people led this out.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.610
I mean, they
co-produced everything.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:21.787
They co-directed everything.

00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:23.620
Jolanda talked about
how she came in and did

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.610
songwriting with them.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.630
They went in the
studio, and then they

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.760
produced songs, right?

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.760
And so all the music that
you heard in the piece

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.510
also was original
music that was created

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.506
that summer except for
the intro song and the--

00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:34.506
LATUNE FINCH: Exit song.

00:35:34.506 --> 00:35:34.922
BRIAN LEWIS: Exit song.

00:35:34.922 --> 00:35:35.422
Right.

00:35:35.422 --> 00:35:37.406
But there were three
original tracks, right?

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.280
I mean, it's incredible
what young people can

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.770
do if you give them a platform.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.300
And I think that's what
Exalt really stands for.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.425
JONATHAN PRIESTER: And I'll
ask one quick follow-up

00:35:45.425 --> 00:35:47.710
for both of you all as
administrators and people who

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.780
are helping to
facilitate this work.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.210
What has been the impact
on you all as people

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.250
who are seeing this
from a different lens--

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.250
a different perspective?

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.600
How are you-- how has this
experience changed your view--

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.940
not only on criminal
justice, but on the way

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.100
that you relate to young people?

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.617
JOLANDA PORTER: I
would say that--

00:36:04.617 --> 00:36:06.700
probably Brian, you could
say this too, right-- we

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.260
grew up in this
space and knowing

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.540
what it's like to be
under-served and be

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.930
from those communities.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.690
And so doing this
work, I think it just

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.770
makes you feel like you're on
the right path, in that you

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.360
are doing the kind of work
that you should be doing.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.340
I mean, every day we get
to work with people--

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.979
especially through our alumni
problem, we're working with--

00:36:24.979 --> 00:36:26.520
we actually just
worked with Google--

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.590
about how to connect
people who don't

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:32.310
know what to do with this work
and how to get them connected

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.180
to the work.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.930
So I think one of the major
things that I've taken away

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.030
is that I'm happy to be
a part of the mission

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.090
and part of the movement.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.920
BRIAN LEWIS: This
work is stressful.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.190
It's difficult. It's hard.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.344
But every day, I'm
inspired by my students.

00:36:46.344 --> 00:36:47.760
And so these are
both my students.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.100
They were in-- so when Latune
talks about graduating,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.790
she graduated from Exalt.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.040
In Exalt, we call them cycles.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.422
And so Latune and Cali--

00:36:54.422 --> 00:36:55.130
LATUNE FINCH: 69.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.870
BRIAN LEWIS: --were
both in cycle 69,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.850
right, which I had the honor
and the pleasure of teaching.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:02.850
I mean, you can imagine.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.920
I mean, you know, it's like--
you see how brilliant they are,

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.410
and how creative they are,
and how inspiring they are.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.390
So yes, I mean,
there were struggles.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.580
There were young people
who got incarcerated

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.240
or literally had to dodge
bullets to get to our space

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.106
and to learn.

00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:17.730
And so those things
take a toll, right?

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.880
There's a trauma that gets
passed on to you from that.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.740
But then, you get to
hear the brilliance.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.490
You get to learn.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.820
You get to be in conversation
with incredible young people

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.780
like these.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.840
And so there's no
higher high, right?

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.361
I mean, you know, the lows
can be low, and difficult,

00:37:34.361 --> 00:37:34.860
and tough.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.130
But then, you
know, you're fed by

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.630
this incredible creative spirit
that our young people bring.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.820
So every day, I'm inspired
by them and learn from them.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.510
JONATHAN PRIESTER:
As we all know,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.740
change just doesn't
happen overnight.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.850
It's something that is done
through habitual hard work--

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.950
putting in the work
day in and day out.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.210
And topics like Close Rikers--

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.430
like, that's something that
has been in the works for years

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.470
and is still an ongoing process.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.110
Raise the Age-- that's
a legal battle that's

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.140
been going on for years
that Exalt has been

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.260
on the front line really
pushing to make that an issue

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.760
that we're all aware of.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.760
And we're seeing now some of
the benefits of that work.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.510
For our audience that
may not be familiar,

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.470
can someone tell us what
Raise the Age is in terms

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.350
of initiatives and how--

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.941
what is Exalt doing to
help prepare us for world

00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:23.190
and what that world would
look like when we don't have

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.190
a Rikers, when we don't
have a situation where

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.964
we see juveniles being placed
in the system so unfairly?

00:38:29.964 --> 00:38:32.130
LATUNE FINCH: Raise the Age
is the legislation which

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.440
raises the age of
criminal responsibility

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.280
to age 18 instead of 16, which
is currently in New York City.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.980
Me and Cali-- we went
to Albany to advocate

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.650
for this law in 2016.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.972
It was recently passed in
2017, which is progress.

00:38:45.972 --> 00:38:47.680
JONATHAN PRIESTER:
Let's just give around

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.690
of applause for that.

00:38:53.137 --> 00:38:54.470
LATUNE FINCH: Which is progress.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.270
And, as in the piece, it says
that it won't pass until--

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.530
it won't officially be in
effect until three years later.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:04.640
Raise the Age and Exalt has--

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.950
we have been pushing as
a whole because there

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.400
are people and
kids, necessarily,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.030
that have been placed in these
facilities that have been

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:19.500
tortured, been abused
in adult criminal jails

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.360
because they're younger.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.220
So that makes you a target.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.780
Regardless of
where they put you,

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.030
you're always a target because
you may be the youngest

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.430
person in that cell block.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.610
Or you may be more vulnerable
because of how you look,

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.400
or whatever the case may be.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.600
And that has brung a toll,
which has brung attention.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.800
And that's what we want.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.570
We want to bring
awareness so people

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.760
know that this legislation
should be passed,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.360
and should be pushed, and
should be completed sooner

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.070
rather than later.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.110
CALI JORDAN-GOTAY: Just
to close that loop--

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.790
when you talk
about Close Rikers,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.000
and when you talk about all of
these things that are going on

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.680
with criminal justice
reform, there's

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.830
a very important phrase
or line in this piece that

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:10.830
goes, $250,000 to house
somebody at Rikers Island--

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.150
a fraction of that cost could
cover a bachelor's degree.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.590
I think that's a huge
point right there, right?

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.440
How do you strategically move
the money from the criminal

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.800
justice system, right-- from
these for-profit prisons,

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.790
which are essentially banking
on kids getting locked up--

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.420
how do you move that into the
educational system or something

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.020
that can help the youth?

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.390
What is the solution?

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:37.500
And we don't-- Exalt is a great
high-end diversion program

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.440
that, you know, works
towards that solution.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.870
But how do we actually sit
down and think about this?

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.170
I mean, the numbers are here.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.600
The information is here.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.620
Who's paying attention?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.980
And who's looking at it?

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.730
BRIAN LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:49.666
That's so well said.

00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:50.790
Please give it up for that.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.140
And they're exactly right.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.500
And the question is, where
are young people going to go?

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.090
And how are we going
to support them?

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.040
When we close
Rikers Island, when

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.050
we begin to move
young people out

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.469
of the adult criminal system
and into the juvenile system,

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:09.510
you know, how will they
continue to get services?

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.370
How will they
continue to progress?

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.290
We have a very effective
model and a blueprint

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.206
for how that can work.

00:41:14.206 --> 00:41:16.350
And so we really see
ourselves as playing

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.710
a crucial and pivotal role as
we consider-- as we continue

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.350
to think about what will happen
to the young people being moved

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.764
around from the adult system
into the juvenile system?

00:41:24.764 --> 00:41:26.430
What will happen to
the young people who

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.940
will be taken off of Rikers
Island and other facilities

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.314
in the coming years?

00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:32.730
JONATHAN PRIESTER:
So-- I'm sorry.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.060
JOLANDA PORTER: No.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.260
I was just going to
say that I agree.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.144
I think a lot of times, we're
looking to the education

00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:38.727
system, which, in a lot of ways,
is failing our young people--

00:41:38.727 --> 00:41:40.100
and I'm not using the mic, but--

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.540
which is failing
our young people.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.915
And I think the
solution is going

00:41:42.915 --> 00:41:45.640
to be with a lot of our
community-based organizations.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.310
So looking at the
people who are working

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.842
with the students on the ground
seeing what the issues are

00:41:49.842 --> 00:41:52.050
and putting the resources
there-- as Cali was saying,

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.966
we have to take the money
away from the system

00:41:53.966 --> 00:41:56.130
and put it into,
really, our community

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.720
activists and the people who are
working with our young people

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.220
every day.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.178
So I do think that Exalt
is a leader with that,

00:42:01.178 --> 00:42:03.420
and I'm looking
forward to the future.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.650
JONATHAN PRIESTER: I'm going
to ask one last question,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.080
and then we're going to open up
to the audience for one or two

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.538
quick questions because I know
we're running tight on time.

00:42:09.538 --> 00:42:12.115
But we have an opportunity now,
not only for the people that

00:42:12.115 --> 00:42:14.490
are here in this audience,
but an opportunity to not only

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:18.910
talk to fellow Googlers,
but also the entire world.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.530
So what are some ways
that today we can get

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.125
involved with Exalt and for
the fight for criminal justice?

00:42:26.125 --> 00:42:27.000
JOLANDA PORTER: Yeah.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.151
There are multiple ways.

00:42:28.151 --> 00:42:30.150
I would say that if you
know a young person that

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.810
needs our services, you
should refer them to us.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.810
If you are a business, or
you are an organization that

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.910
wants a young person
to intern for you,

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.560
then you could be our host site.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.050
You can also, if you're
interested, join our board.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.550
And I think there's
also, obviously,

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.684
an opportunity to donate.

00:42:45.684 --> 00:42:47.100
And we have those
options that are

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.490
going to be rolling for
you later on the slideshow.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.380
There are multiple
ways to connect to us,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.820
but those are the
four major ways.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.240
So refer that student, to host
that intern, to join our board,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.040
and to donate to our mission.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.540
JONATHAN PRIESTER: And for those
of you that are going to be

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.040
watching, you can go to
www.exaltyouth.org/getinvolved.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.614
That's
exaltyouth.org/getinvolved.

00:43:10.614 --> 00:43:11.280
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.450
My name is Mivan Lamb.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.470
I'm a retired professor of law.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.880
And I think the point
you made about $250,000

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.890
to keep one person in jail--

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.340
somebody should be following
that money when they close down

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.180
Rikers.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.970
That should not just
evaporate and go

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.940
into the military
parade in Washington DC,

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.990
for example, right?

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.220
That money-- I mean,
if they weren't

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:41.550
willing to pay $250,000
per incarcerated person,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.100
that should just
move automatically

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.470
to programs such
as Exalt. And that

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:50.550
has to be done via a
political campaign.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.280
Is anybody trying
to follow that money

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.710
and say, it's going to go
from this, which doesn't work,

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.710
to that, which works?

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.750
I really-- yeah.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.615
Thank you.

00:44:00.615 --> 00:44:01.505
JOLANDA PORTER: Yeah.

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:02.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:02.840
Well--

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.510
LATUNE FINCH: I mean, it
wasn't really a question.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.385
JOLANDA PORTER: Yeah.

00:44:05.385 --> 00:44:06.530
Well, I will say this.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.800
I-- historically,
Exalt has stayed away

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.279
from government and
city funding because we

00:44:11.279 --> 00:44:12.820
wanted to control
the kind of content

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.260
that we gave to
our young people.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.500
I think a lot of times, when
you are adhering to government

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.290
funding, you're not able to
make the young people the focus.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.780
And Exalt has been able to do
that now for over a decade.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.990
Now, because we have that
blueprint that Brian mentioned,

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.780
we are looking to work with the
city and government officials

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.400
to be able to
expand our mission.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.132
So absolutely.

00:44:32.132 --> 00:44:33.340
We want to follow that money.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.170
And hopefully, it will
find its way to us.

00:44:37.874 --> 00:44:39.790
CALI JORDAN-GOTAY: To
go back to that question

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.370
of who's following that money--

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.260
through Exalt, I
was actually brought

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.460
into the field of philanthropy.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.580
And I was able to
learn about how

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.472
people are able to move money to
make actual change in society.

00:44:52.472 --> 00:44:54.430
And there are actually
some really great groups

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.490
who are looking into
this, such as the Daphne

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.602
Foundation, the Surdna
Foundation, and just

00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:02.560
a whole bunch of different
philanthropic groups

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.640
who are actually looking at
how this money is being spent.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.680
And they're actually funding
great groups, such as Exalt.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.150
And philanthropy, I
think, is a great way

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.900
to learn more about
what's going on

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.760
and to actually
make a difference.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.260
JONATHAN PRIESTER: On behalf
of Google and the Black Googler

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.360
Network, I want to thank
you all for taking your time

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.620
to be here with us today.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.310
Let's give another round of
applause to our performers.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:25.797
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.797 --> 00:45:26.755
BRIAN LEWIS: Thank you.

00:45:34.207 --> 00:45:36.040
JONATHAN PRIESTER: And
I think if anything--

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.706
if we can take away
anything from today,

00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:40.840
it's that action can be taken
right now, that no one needs

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.480
to wait.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.450
There's amazing
groups like Exalt

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.040
that need our support,
that need our help,

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.640
and that are doing really,
really amazing work.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.610
And you can see the brilliant
product that is being produced.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:53.650
So thank you all again.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.050
Thank you all for
coming, and thank you.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.700
[APPLAUSE]
