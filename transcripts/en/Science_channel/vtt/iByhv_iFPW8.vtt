♪♪

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:08.701
Narrator:
THEY BEGIN BY TAKING DETAILED
MEASUREMENTS OF THE ATHLETE

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:11.033
AS SHE SITS IN A DEMO CHAIR.

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.567
THEY MEASURE THE WIDTH
AND HEIGHT OF HER KNEES

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.267
TO DETERMINE
THE BEST SEATING POSITION.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.734
THEY CHECK THE BALANCE POINT

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.100
TO DECIDE HOW THE REAR-WHEEL
AXLE SHOULD BE POSITIONED,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.868
AND THEY MEASURE HER ARMS SO
PUSH RIMS CAN BE SIZED FOR HER.

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:30.300
THEY THEN PRODUCE
A DIGITAL DRAWING

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.934
OF THE RACING WHEELCHAIR,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.634
COMPLETE WITH ANY EXTRAS
REQUESTED BY THE ATHLETE.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.100
THE FABRICATOR SELECTS
THE APPROPRIATE ALUMINUM TUBING

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.400
AND CUTS IT
TO THE DESIRED LENGTH.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.734
THIS ONE WILL BE THE MAIN TUBE
FOR THE RACING CHAIR'S FRAME.

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:55.300
ROLLERS CURVE THE TUBE SLIGHTLY
AT ONE END

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.901
SO THE FRAMEWORK
WILL ACCOMMODATE THE SEAT.

00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.767
A PRESS THEN FLATTENS THE TUBE
QUITE A BIT.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.133
THIS STIFFENS THE METAL

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.000
AND WILL MAKE THE RACING-CHAIR
FRAME MORE AERODYNAMIC.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.701
HE NOW TAPES A STEERING
MECHANISM FOR THE FRONT WHEEL

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.167
ONTO THE FRAMEWORK

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:13.334
AND CONFIRMS THAT ITS PLACEMENT
IS EXACT BEFORE WELDING.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.634
THIS DEVICE WILL KEEP
THE FRONT WHEEL ON AUTOPILOT,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:21.334
FREEING THE RACER'S HANDS
TO PUSH THE REAR WHEELS.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.434
THE WELDER NOW POSITIONS
THE OTHER END OF THE MAIN TUBE

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:29.634
PERPENDICULAR TO THE WHEEL AXLE.

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:32.133
HE WELDS THE AXLE
TO THE MAIN TUBE,

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.634
GIVING THE FRAMEWORK
A "T" PROFILE.

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:38.934
THEN, A HYDRAULIC MACHINE
BENDS AN ALUMINUM TUBE

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.734
INTO A "U" SHAPE TO MAKE
THE RACING CHAIR'S SEAT FRAME.

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:49.801
HE POSITIONS THE SEAT FRAME
ON THE REAR AXLE

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.100
AND DOES A FEW MORE WELDS.

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.968
FINALLY, HE INSTALLS FENDERS
ON THE WHEELS.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.901
THE MAIN FRAMEWORK OF THIS
RACING WHEELCHAIR IS COMPLETE.

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:11.501
BUT TO MAKE IT LOOK FLASHY,
THEY SPRAY-PAINT IT RED.

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.267
THIS IS A POWDER COATING.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.100
IT'S A THERMOPLASTIC PAINT

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.667
THAT'S TOUGHER
THAN THE CONVENTIONAL KIND.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.834
NEXT, THIS MACHINE ROLLS
THE PUSH RIMS,

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.834
WHICH THE ATHLETE USES
TO PROPEL THE WHEELCHAIR.

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:35.968
THEY WELD ON PEGS FOR ATTACHING
THE RIMS TO THE WHEELS,

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:40.434
THEN GLUE A RUBBER SLEEVE
ONTO EACH RIM.

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.834
THEY WRAP IT IN TAPE TO CLAMP
THE TWO AS THE GLUE DRIES.

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:45.234
THE TAPE STAYS ON

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.968
UNTIL THE CHAIR IS DELIVERED
TO THE CUSTOMER.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.133
THEY INSTALL THE REAR WHEELS
AT AN ANGLE

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:54.667
TO MAKE THE RACING CHAIR
MORE STABLE WHEN CORNERING.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:01.100
THEY ADD PADDING
FOR THE ATHLETE'S KNEES,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.667
THEN ASSEMBLE THE NYLON SEAT
TO THE CHAIR.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.434
NEXT COMES THE FRONT-WHEEL
STEERING FORK AND HANDLE.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.767
THEY COMPLETE THE ASSEMBLY
WITH A SPRING-LOADED CYLINDER.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:18.567
THAT'S PART OF
THE STEERING AUTOPILOT SYSTEM.

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:26.467
AFTER TESTING THE STEERING FORK,
THEY INSTALL THE FRONT WHEEL,

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.834
WHICH IS SMALLER
THAN THE REAR TWO.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.968
ONCE IT'S BEEN EQUIPPED
WITH BRAKES,

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:37.567
THIS CUSTOM RACING CHAIR

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:41.067
IS READY TO TAKE ON
THE COMPETITION.

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:44.901
AN ELITE ATHLETE WILL BUY
A NEW RACING CHAIR EVERY YEAR.

00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:48.701
SOME CHOOSE REAR WHEELS
MADE OF LIGHTWEIGHT CARBON FIBER

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.300
BECAUSE ANY ADVANTAGE
IS WELCOME IN THE PUSH TO WIN.
