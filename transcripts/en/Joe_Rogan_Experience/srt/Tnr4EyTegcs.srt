1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,850
Here we go. Joe. Thank you. Thank you
for being here. Really appreciate it man.

2
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:09,550
It's pleasure to be here.
It's a fascinating subject.

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,770
I've been really looking forward
to talking to you because a,

4
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:16,330
the conscious mind and how we,
how we evolved our conscious mind,

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:18,930
how we have our conscious
mind. I mean that is a,

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,140
one of the more unique things about
being a person. It is. How did it happen?

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,450
Oh well it's only a 4 billion year
story as a subtitle, we have some time.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,370
So shall I tell you how
I got short into it?

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,510
Where, where I, how I ended up
thinking about that problem.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,370
So I'd been working on how the brain
detects and responds to danger for most of

11
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,840
my scientific career a little bit before
that I'd actually studied consciousness

12
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:49,170
in these people who have their brain
split apart to control epilepsy called

13
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:50,220
split brain patients.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
So I got interested in consciousness
and also in how behaviors that might be

15
00:00:56,011 --> 00:01:00,840
produced non-consciously uh, affect
what we know about ourselves.

16
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,800
So we see ourselves doing something and
then we kind of consciously build that

17
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,800
into our narrative of what we
are. But a lot of what we do,

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,420
we do non-consciously. And when
we interpreted that kind of, uh,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,230
solidifies the fact that you
have a non-conscious system
that's controlling your

20
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:20,530
behavior, when in fact you, you
didn't do it, but that system did.

21
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:23,520
So you got to make sense of it and
generate an explanation and narrative.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,180
So that a, that was where I got started
and I tried to figure out, well,

23
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,780
what would it be? Some kinds of
non-conscious systems and said, well,

24
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:34,800
maybe emotion systems are producing
behaviors that we don't fully understand.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,710
And I started studying
that and ended up, uh,

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,210
figuring out how this part of the brain
called the amygdala receives information

27
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:46,920
about the environment and then controls,
orchestrates all the responses, fight,

28
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,100
flight kinds of responses to
help you protect yourself.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,020
And the, um, you know, after
many years of doing that,

30
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,310
I started asking, well,

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,780
how far back does this ability to
detect and respond to danger? Go,

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,170
we know that bugs and flies can do that.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,220
And research had been
done showing that, uh,

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,180
bugs and flies have certain molecules in
their brain that are important in these

35
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:16,620
kinds of protective defensive behaviors
and including the ability to learn about

36
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,210
them and store those as memories.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,040
So it's easier to work on
those little tiny, um, uh,

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,490
invertebrates than it is to
do studies in a complex brain,

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,790
even like a rat brain,
which is pretty complex. Um,

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,620
so given that what these people
had discovered about invertebrates,

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,590
I and others who were studying mammals
decided to see if the same molecules

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,760
might be involved in mammalian
learning. And in fact it was.

43
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,710
So now that raises the question,

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,970
you've got the same molecules doing
the same thing, the same molecules,

45
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:51,601
same genes,

46
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:56,601
doing the same thing in ancient
invertebrates and in animals like us.

47
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,770
So you ask where back in time is the
ancestor that made that possible?

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,950
You know, if we've got the same genes,

49
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,870
either it kind of happens spontaneously
separately are this common ancestor and

50
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,460
indeed there's a common ancestor.

51
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,110
And that goes back to the first organism,

52
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:20,890
first animal that had a bilateral
Bobbie, which means had left,

53
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:24,280
right front and a back,
uh, and a top and a bottom.

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,740
So it has kind of three dimensional sides.

55
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,760
Before that there were animals
like jellyfish that were radial,

56
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,680
but no, front and back, they just
have the, a top and a bottom.

57
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,120
And before that they're sponges,
which have no front back, top, bottom,

58
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,200
they just kind of randomly
organized. So that's kind of the,

59
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,120
that's the story of animals, sponges to
jellyfish, to these bilateral animals.

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,470
So the ancestor, uh, the, the,

61
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,750
the bilateral animal that we're talking
about gave rise to those two lines.

62
00:03:55,751 --> 00:04:00,550
One that became all these invertebrates
like flies and bugs and snails and

63
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,560
octopus and all those things. And
another two animals like us, vertebrates,

64
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,660
all the, um, fish, reptiles,
mammals, birds and so forth.

65
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
So those are two separate lines that
inherited these genes that make the memory

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,680
and defensive behavior
possible. So we said, well,

67
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,620
how far back they deny it. Does
it stop there? And no, it doesn't.

68
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,460
Because you can find those
genes on through jellyfish.

69
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,700
And then keep going into
single cell organisms.

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,220
Now these are like protozoa, uh,
things that give you intestinal,

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,400
um, their intestinal parasites
that they can, you know,

72
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,980
give you an upset stomach. And um,

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,630
things like amoeba paramecium that
you might've heard of and you know,

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,630
biology class in high
school or something. Um,

75
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,710
these have no nervous system and yet
they detect and respond to danger.

76
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,070
They learn about their environment,
they do all these sorts of things.

77
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,990
And where did they come from? Well,

78
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,000
if you go all the way back
to where they came from,

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,580
the even simpler kind of organism,

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
still single cell of course
like bacterial cells.

81
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,410
Now these guys go back
to the beginning of life.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,660
The first cell that ever lived,

83
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,690
some 3.7 billion years ago that gave
rise to the entire history of life was a

84
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,090
bacterial like cell that started dividing.

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,620
Now what's interesting,

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,870
that cell that started dividing is the
mother of every bacterial cell that ever

87
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:36,280
lived. So that cells, it's, it's
more like it's re, you know,

88
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:40,480
that cell is still alive because it's,
they reproduced by cell division.

89
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,900
So that still sell,
just keeps reproducing.

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,530
And part of that first cell
ever is still with us today.

91
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,240
And all the bacterial cells that are,

92
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,920
that are around a kind of a mind blowing
thing is it's incredibly mindblowing.

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,590
Do we have any idea why the first
cell decided to divide? Well, it,

94
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,880
this, I shouldn't say it's the
first cell that decided to do this.

95
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,530
It's the first cell anterial cell.
It's the first cell that was able to,

96
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,770
to sustain life long enough to give off
offspring that could sustain and sustain

97
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,093
and sustain.

98
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,170
So there were probably lots of experiments
before a kind of cell or kind of

99
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,580
group of cells had the right stuff
to be able to do that. So they,

100
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,350
those others never made it because they
didn't have quite enough of what it took

101
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,740
to be a cell that could do
that. So the first cell, I mean,

102
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,390
it's kind of a hypothetical cell.

103
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,860
It's called Luca the last universal
common ancestor of life. Whoa. Yeah.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,380
And that, so that's about 3.73
point 8 billion years ago. Um,

105
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,450
but he could have been a
bunch of cells, you know,

106
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,340
or a collection of cell cell types,
uh, that, that one of which then,

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,470
you know, populated all of life.

108
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,930
The weird thing about life is not just
that it's different and it varies so

109
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,720
much, but that it's, eh, it's

110
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,590
ever-increasing in its complexity. Well,

111
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,550
if you go back to the single cell and
then you come all the way to today to a

112
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,950
person, right? Like what a weird
sort of transformation. You know,

113
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
it's dangerous to talk about as if
we're moving towards some kind of goal

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,480
intellect, right? Is it
dangerous? We are the goal,

115
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,750
but we're not saying I don't
think we're the go. No, we're not.

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,593
We're definitely not.

117
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,730
I've been more and more thinking that
artificial life is the goal. Well,

118
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,830
the, I mean, there's no goal of
life. There's survival. This,

119
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,980
the only goal of every
organism. And that's, uh,

120
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,010
that's what that first sale was able to
do is to generate a set of biological

121
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:47,780
properties that could still sustain
itself long enough to reproduce.

122
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,810
That's all you have to do. B, you
have to live long enough to reproduce.

123
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,990
And to do that you have
to have energy resources.

124
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,740
So you have to incorporate nutrients.
You've got to balance your fluids.

125
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,551
Otherwise, you know,

126
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:02,150
you have to keep your eye on straight
or the cell will get too big and explode

127
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,890
or get too small and collapse.

128
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,030
You've got to thermoregulate cause all
of these things depend on the right kind

129
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:12,290
of internal temperature and you
have to reproduce. Those are the,

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,480
the survival requirements of a cell.

131
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,760
But there are also the survival
requirements of a human.

132
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,370
So the same things that bacterial cell
has to do to live through the day and

133
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,930
create a species is exactly what we
do every day. To reproduce ourselves.

134
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,910
We have to eat, drink,
defend against danger, uh,

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,400
incorporate nutrients and balance
fluids and ions that way, uh,

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,220
defend, you know, reproduce. And so
that was the mind blowing thing. See,

137
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:44,000
I wrote the whole three quarters of the
book as a scientific journalist cause I

138
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,880
didn't know any of this in this
stuff. I had to just learn it.

139
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,660
And there's a lot of fun, but it
took a long time. Imagine when,

140
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,980
when you think about the
original Luca and then human,

141
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,570
do you ever try to extrapolate?

142
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:01,140
Do you have ever tried to like keep the
process rolling in your mind and see

143
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,970
where, where's this going to go? Oh yeah.

144
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,390
So the end of the book I paint a not
so rosy picture of what was going well.

145
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:15,090
Yeah, but, so that, let's talk about
the end of the book. So, okay. Um,

146
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,630
I, you know, say, okay, well our,

147
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,690
we have these two kinds of, of, uh,

148
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,270
significant experiences in our lives
that uh, that occupy the human mind.

149
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,810
One is the kind that we can
call an awareness of facts.

150
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,403
You know,

151
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,950
this thing is here and the
other is what we might call,

152
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,450
um, a self-awareness where I, it's,

153
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,330
it's me that is aware that
that is a bottle. So that's,

154
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
that's a higher level.

155
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,420
And that is what appears to
be unique to the human mind.

156
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:58,140
The ability to represent the self
as a subject. In other words,

157
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:02,220
to have these subjective experiences
that have a personal past.

158
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,140
It's not just the past,

159
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:09,141
but your past you lived at and a personal
present and a potential future that

160
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:16,350
you can imagine different scenarios
of you existing in, in the future.

161
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,420
So that requires a, I mean that's
called auto Noetic consciousness.

162
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,470
The ability to, to self know
about where you are in time.

163
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,970
And it depends the,

164
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,910
this is an idea that was proposed
by a guy named [inaudible],

165
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,940
a very distinguished
psychologist who's a retired now.

166
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,960
But his idea was that
the unique aspect of,

167
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,950
of the human mind is mental time travel,

168
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,140
the ability to project ourselves
in the past, present and future.

169
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,200
And without that kind of consciousness,

170
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,670
we're limited to kind of factual
information. Something is there, you know,

171
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,100
that might, I might be able to say, Oh,

172
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,190
food is there or drink is there
or a sexual partner is there,

173
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,560
but not necessarily that I want
that food. I want, you know,

174
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,680
you might have a kind of
biological urge towards it.

175
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Now from the outside it
looks like everything we do
is intentional and willful.

176
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,980
So I think I'm controlling my behavior.
You think you're controlling yours?

177
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,330
I see you do something that I
might've done in a similar situation.

178
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,040
I think you intentionally control that.

179
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,550
We see a dog doing something that
would be similar to what we do.

180
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:33,780
We think we know why the dog is doing
that because it had some intention.

181
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,890
But the fact is if we start taking
these things apart in the brain,

182
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,640
we see that the systems that control very
simple behaviors are not the ones that

183
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:49,080
are doing all this high level conscious
thought. Take the example of a,

184
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,830
the area I've worked on for all these
years, which is threat detection.

185
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,930
Um, now this part of the brain called
the amygdala is key to the detection and

186
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:03,260
response to threat and the kind
of basic sense. Um, you know,

187
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:06,910
a threat comes up, you freeze it,
there's a snake for example. Um,

188
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,550
now it's all because of that.

189
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
It's been assumed that the reason you
freeze is because you're afraid and

190
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,360
therefore that the amygdala is also
making the fear because they make doula

191
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,750
experiences the fear and that's
why you produced the response.

192
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,820
But for the longest time and
throughout most of my career,

193
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,700
I've said the amygdala does not
consciously experience fear.

194
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,690
And yet my work is been
used to kind of sell and uh,

195
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,310
and defend this idea of the
Migdal is the brain's fear center.

196
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,030
And I think that's completely wrong. Why
do you think it's been misinterpreted?

197
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,770
It's a long, complicated
story, but you know, it's

198
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,190
partly, it's my fault
because I was not, uh,

199
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,120
as vigilant as I should have been when I
was describing it to see what I did was

200
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:58,930
I,

201
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,220
I would talk about the amygdala
as a non-conscious state of fear,

202
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,160
non-conscious, implicit fear. Um,

203
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,770
and I would say that, well,

204
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:13,720
the neocortex is where we consciously
experienced fear and those are separate,

205
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,260
but that was too complicated. You know,

206
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,330
the journalists kind of
ignored it and it was just,

207
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,670
it just became the Migdal
is the brain's fear center.

208
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,020
Even the scientists ignored it because,
you know, we were studying and you know,

209
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:30,640
I kind of gave up after one study. Okay.
We talk about it in terms of fear, um,

210
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,070
because you know that there
was a lot of money to be, um,

211
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,010
directed towards research
if you're studying fear and
how you could treat that.

212
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,840
But I think it's, you
know, it's been kind of a,

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,010
a wrong path because it's led to the
development of medications that don't

214
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:51,370
really work. So all the big
companies are getting out of,

215
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,580
of the anti-anxiety business anti fear
business because people still feel

216
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,600
fearful or anxious when they take them.

217
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,060
You mean like Xanax things
along those lines? Yeah.

218
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,010
Companies are getting out of the Xanax
business. Um, benzos annex. Yeah.

219
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,850
I mean they're not there either that
or repurposing them for other purposes,

220
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,960
you know, but so what happens is you,

221
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,450
the way these things, you
know, the, these things,

222
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,570
the basic drugs were
discovered in the 60s, uh,

223
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,980
almost accidentally in some cases, you
know, not rather than by some hypothesis.

224
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,080
So they only thing that's been discovered
since then is more versions of the

225
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,570
same thing with, you know,
slightly fewer side effects.

226
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,110
But there's been no new discovery of a
new kind of drug that's going to help

227
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:36,850
people. And why is that? Well,

228
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,500
the way the drugs are discovered
is that take a rat or mouse,

229
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,940
put it in a challenging situation,
give it some different medications,

230
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,030
and the ones that make the animal less
timid in those situations is assumed to

231
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,100
make the animal less fearful.
And that's why he's less timid.

232
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,310
So when you give it to a person,
they should be less fearful.

233
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,930
But what you find is say a person with
social anxiety might find it easier to go

234
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:06,080
to the party. They're less timid, but
still anxious while they're there.

235
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,450
And the reason is that we now know is
that damage to the amygdala in a person

236
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,360
doesn't necessarily also
eliminate the feeling of fear.

237
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,720
It gets rid of the body
responses, but not the feeling.

238
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,670
So it was a misunderstanding
of what behavior can tell us.

239
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,940
We treat behavior as if it's
an ambassador of the mind,

240
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,700
but behavior is really a tool of survival.

241
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:32,600
That goes back to those first cells that
ever lived who had to defend against

242
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,320
danger.

243
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Bacterial cells move in there in the
water and then they come across like you

244
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:42,890
know, a gradient of some chemical that's
a toxin. As soon as they detect that,

245
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,280
they bounce away and go in a
different direction. If they are gone,

246
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,590
if they find a gradient of something
that is a nutrient they keep going in and

247
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,424
absorb it.

248
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,640
So they have the ability to detect
what's useful and harmful in their lives.

249
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,400
These are not, these are
not there for psychology.

250
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,980
They're simply there to
keep the organism alive.

251
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,490
And many of the behaviors that persist
throughout the whole history of life are

252
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:07,814
like that.

253
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,620
They're there because each of the
cell and cells in the body has to,

254
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,080
you know, do all these
things to stay alive.

255
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,820
And so the organism as a whole has to
do it as well. Defend against danger,

256
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,180
incorporate nutrients, balanced
fluids, Dermer, regulate, reproduce.

257
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,050
So these are survival
tools, not mind tools.

258
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,150
Now we can use our mind in conjunction
with these things and because we can,

259
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,420
we conflate every time we're freezing
in the front of a snake to the fact that

260
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:41,480
the fear is what's causing it. But
the fear is a separate process.

261
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,780
It's the awareness that that
stuff is happening to you,

262
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,660
the awareness that that stuff is
happening to you. So no self, no fear.

263
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,770
Awe, that's my tee shirt.
That's my merge on the book.

264
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,740
Now, how do things like Xanax work? What,

265
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,540
what's the mechanical
process? Okay, so the a,

266
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:11,350
that's a part of the class of drugs
called benzodiazepine and they,

267
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,690
um, will they bind to
receptors in the brain.

268
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,660
The brain has receptors for
all kinds of, uh, chemicals.

269
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,960
And many of these things are
things that exist in nature.

270
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,610
And what the dilemma that they bind to
is a receptor called the GABA receptor,

271
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,490
which is the major inhibitory
transmitter in the brain.

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,870
So when you have a benzodiazepine
binding to a GABA receptor,

273
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,880
what it's going to do is increase
inhibition. So the, you know,

274
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:45,881
the kind of simple reason why those
things can help is they kind of inhibit.

275
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,680
So they tone down brain a bit.

276
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,890
And so things that would normally
trigger a response, no longer trigger.

277
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,040
So it's like increasing the threshold
for something to bother you in a sense.

278
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,820
And a lot of people enjoy that with
alcohol and not supposed to. Well,

279
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,280
alcohol also attacks those receptors.
So it's like you get double the effect,

280
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,940
right? Is that why they tell people don't
have Xanax? Cause you can, you know,

281
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,490
if you, if you take a lot of
sandbox and drink a lot of booze,

282
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:18,030
you can Odie or you could
just say crazy things.

283
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,370
Not totally be aware. Do you
remember that story about a woman?

284
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,630
She was a, I believe she was a
publicist and she got on a plane,

285
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,770
she's flying to Africa and
she said, I'm going to Africa.

286
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,980
Hope I don't get AIDS. Just
kidding. I'm white. LOL.

287
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,910
She thought she was just being funny and
you laughed and she landed in Africa.

288
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,040
That's a bit of a surprise.
Do you know the story? No,

289
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,350
but there are other stories on this.

290
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,500
This was one of the original stories of
someone ruining their entire life with

291
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,620
just putting, uh, you know,
one little tweet online.

292
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,560
She thought she was being funny. Like she,

293
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,230
she would say a bunch of snarky
things like that. A bunch of funny,

294
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,570
trying to be fun. Right. Um,

295
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,350
but she was on Xanax and
drinking and woke up, uh,

296
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,210
w completely oblivious and her life had
been destroyed. Yeah. She was fired.

297
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,570
You know,

298
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,570
she was a social pariah and I'm pretty
sure that was Xanax and alcohol that she

299
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:16,800
was blaming it on.

300
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,320
Yeah. Well, you know, these
are powerful drugs and so,

301
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,260
you know, back to how
they work and they work.

302
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,810
So a drug like that,

303
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,150
all of the drugs that we
take go to the entire body.

304
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,750
They don't, they're not
able to just, you know,

305
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:39,950
find their way to one little spot in the
brain and do their trick. This, this,

306
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,970
you know, talk about
magic bullet, a bullet,

307
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,010
drugs that might be able to be
targeted for specific circuits,

308
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,380
but that's a fantasy at this point.

309
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,570
So if you reduce inhibition
in the entire brain,

310
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,050
yes, you might reduce, you know, anxiety,

311
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,370
but you're also going to change a lot of
other things. So you're gonna make, um,

312
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,740
um, for example,

313
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,280
forethought and a ability
to reign in things like the,

314
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,930
the stuff the woman was saying, uh,

315
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,760
more difficult because they're attacking
the prefrontal cortex where you have

316
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,580
some inhibitory control over behavior. Um,

317
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,760
they're going to alter your ability to
retrieve and store memories and to be,

318
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,840
to attend to things. And, um, you know,

319
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:32,340
to the extent that these drugs have
a, a positive effect on some people,

320
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,360
uh,

321
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,530
it's been said that part of the reason
is that it's kind of a general blending

322
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:40,020
of emotion. It's not an antianxiety drug.

323
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,510
It's just kind of the
dulling of everything.

324
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,290
And you get anxiety anti-anxiety
as, as a part of that.

325
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,530
But if we want to understand
how to do better, um,

326
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,900
we have to, you know,

327
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,960
figure out what the brain circuit
that's really making us anxious is,

328
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,940
and not just what's
making us, you know, not,

329
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,200
not toning down to everything.
It's kind of like, you know,

330
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,990
you go to a restaurant, the
music's too loud, somebody says,

331
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,150
please turn it down. So they
turn it down a little bit.

332
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,940
The music stays the same. So the same
song, but it's not as annoying, you know,

333
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,450
because you've turned the volume down.

334
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,010
And I think that's what a lot of what
these medications can do is turn the

335
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,800
volume down a bit or turn it up. You
know, depending on what you're doing.

336
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,920
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't
there some sort of a Slingshot of fact,

337
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:30,790
like after you take these things and your
anxiety is ramped up afterwards? Well,

338
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,110
it can be a rebound. The fact
that it can also be kind of a,

339
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,740
a lot of people next day feel
depressed, know because they're just,

340
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,150
the stuff is out of your system and
just come to the, you know, if you take,

341
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,920
it's kind of like taking sleeping pills,

342
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:49,180
things like Ambien are of the same general
category of drug then so diazepines

343
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,390
and so you get this
hangover the next day. Okay.

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,420
So it's just a physiological
response to the medication.

345
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,090
It's not that if you
alleviate some anxiety,

346
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,710
then the anxiety wants to come back even
stronger. So I, you know, I've often,

347
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,360
I've proposed and in my
previous book that, uh,

348
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,640
we each have an anxiety set
point that, um, you know,

349
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:14,641
that let's say you're worried about
something and all of a sudden that gets

350
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:20,270
resolved. I just makes room for
the next thing to work with. So,

351
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,530
you know, we each have kind of fill that
void because our brain is, you know,

352
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,150
we've developed a brain that has a certain
kind of set point for everything it's

353
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:32,800
doing and that just makes room for,
you know, to fill that, fill that up.

354
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,880
If you're an anxious person, you
probably will always be somewhat anxious.

355
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,640
So there's no magic bullet
that's going to take that out.

356
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,030
What do you have to do is
attack the process from
knowledge of how it all works.

357
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,640
And that requires that we have a more
sophisticated understanding that then is

358
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,490
possible from simply observing behavior
because behavior does not tell you

359
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,570
necessarily what's on the mind.
Behavior tells you how the, the,

360
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,830
the brain has responded. But you
know, just to go back to the,

361
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,910
the fear thread example, um,

362
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,610
when let's say I bring you into the
laboratory and show you a picture of

363
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,080
something like a blue square.
Uh, my colleague Liz Phelps,

364
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:24,780
who used to be at NYU, who's now at
Harvard, did experiments like this. Uh,

365
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,950
and every time the blue
square would come on,

366
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:29,020
the person would get a
mild shock to their finger.

367
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,710
And so then she would
present the blue square.

368
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Subliminally that means, you know,
really quickly with the, you know,

369
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:39,000
something that follows
at the kind of mass that,

370
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,840
and that prevents the information from
getting into the conscious mind. Uh,

371
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,950
and so the person says,
I didn't see anything,

372
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,080
but if you put the person in
an imaging machine, FM, Ori,

373
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,820
and, uh, image, what's happening
that stimulus, that threat,

374
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,830
the blue square gets to the
amygdala, turns it on, the heart,

375
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,120
begins to race, palms are sweating.
Um, but the person has no fear.

376
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,430
The person doesn't know it's
there and doesn't experience fear.

377
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,900
The amygdala is not about fear. It's
about detecting and responding to danger.

378
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,850
In order to be afraid.

379
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:21,851
That has to reach your conscious mind
so that you can experience it as a state

380
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,630
of this auto Noetic consciousness
that we're talking about.

381
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,260
Self involved consciousness. That's
hard for people to separate. Yeah. Well,

382
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,060
but the, that there's a, a
physical response with that.

383
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,760
Your minds aren't aware of it.
Right. But when you understand that,

384
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:41,270
that's why you become to understand that's
why the medications are not working.

385
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:46,220
They're targeted to work on these
underlying systems in rats or mice.

386
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,960
But that's not where we are
experiencing our anxiety. But these,

387
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:52,790
these medications are very profitable.
Right. And people enjoy it.

388
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,880
Millions of prescriptions get written
up. I'm just going to phase those out.

389
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,300
They'll probably, you know,

390
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,300
they're probably all going off patent
and because the company can't find

391
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,170
anything new,

392
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:07,340
they're not going to keep pursuing it
because it's not going to be a profit

393
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:11,120
anymore. But don't people
still want them? I mean,

394
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:14,120
it seems like that's a really
popular medication. Yes.

395
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,920
It'll be like they'll go to, um,
you know, they'll become, uh,

396
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,180
you know,

397
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,840
generics and people will be able to get
them for less money and they'll just do

398
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,400
with whatever they want. Yeah. Off
label, whatever. Yeah. I mean it's,

399
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,210
you know, it's, I do
think that for example,

400
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,780
the drugs that are available
do help people because it's
important to reduce the

401
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:42,170
behavioral timidity and the physiological
arousal that goes with that.

402
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,430
Cause if you don't treat
that, then the conscious

403
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,520
mind will be reactivated
by those responses.

404
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,050
If you only treat the
conscious mind, then uh,

405
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,750
the physiological stuff will
bring the conscious stuff back.

406
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,930
Everything will bring back
their everything else,

407
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,690
unless you treat the whole
system and you have to do that,

408
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,650
you have to understand the system and
we've just misunderstood it I think for so

409
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:14,510
long. I have a friend who,
he takes it every day.

410
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,310
It takes Xanax every day and he says
he needs it. It says without it,

411
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,960
he's just a mess. Well, you know,
whatever gets you through the day,

412
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,860
I guess, you know, it's, I'm not a
therapist. I'm not like advocating that.

413
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,930
I know. I understand, but
from your perspective,

414
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:33,200
from an understanding of the human mind
and all the systems that are at work,

415
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,430
it seems like that's really not the
way to do it. Yeah. I mean it's,

416
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,150
you know, I'm sure that that's, you
know, in a sense, maybe that's a,

417
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,130
his crutches

418
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,010
were to get through the day and, um,

419
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,820
he's come to believe that he needs that
much like an alcoholic believes they

420
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,420
need to drink. Yup. Yeah. Um, but I'm
not calling him and you know, well,

421
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:59,150
I'll call him. He does
like to drink too. Yeah.

422
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,330
But he's a great guy. Uh, these, uh,

423
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,280
these systems that are in place and the,

424
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,670
all of the various things that have
gotten us to 2019 is a human species.

425
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,880
When you study anxiety and you study
fear and all these different things is,

426
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,110
are,

427
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,110
are we experiencing high levels of it
because there's not as much real physical

428
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,760
danger as our ancestors experienced.

429
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:30,030
And it's almost like we're looking for
it when it's not necessarily there.

430
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:34,000
Like we're, we're programmed to
be able to deal with it. Yeah.

431
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:37,350
That's a good point. Um, I
hadn't thought of it that way,

432
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,590
but I think that's a good way to
think about it. I mean, you know,

433
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:45,591
the philosopher Kierkegaard said that
anxiety is the price we pay for the human

434
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:50,640
ability to choose. And this is where
our auto Noetic consciousness comes in.

435
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:51,710
Our ability to,

436
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,450
to think of ourselves as having a
past and the future and to be able to,

437
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,590
to plan and choose in
the future. You know,

438
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:02,910
he said it started with Adam making the
first choices of human in the garden of

439
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:07,350
Eden. And that was where
it all began. Um, so,

440
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,590
and our ability, you know, you can
rephrase that statement by saying,

441
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,190
our ability, um, to choose is

442
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,920
what allows us to be
anxious because that is, uh,

443
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,760
what anxiety is a worry
about what we have. We are,

444
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:25,500
we're going to make the
right decision. You know,

445
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:27,780
how can we deal with this
thing that's coming up?

446
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:32,781
It's a worry about the future and the
ability to think about the possibilities,

447
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,270
right? Like what could go
wrong? What could go right?

448
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:40,950
Am I doing the right thing? And then to
contemplate all those various choices.

449
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,370
Right? Anxiety. Yeah.
So like, you know, you,

450
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,160
you're walking through the woods
as a snake, you might freeze,

451
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,260
but almost instantly,

452
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:54,210
that fear that is generated by you
freezing and seeing the snake, um,

453
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,400
morphs into anxiety, you know, will
the snake bite me if it bites me,

454
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:02,460
will I get to a doctor? Will
we have the anecdote if I die,

455
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,730
what will happen to my family? And you
know, that's worry, that's anxiety.

456
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,983
So these are,

457
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,640
they're kind of separate fears
about a danger that's present.

458
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,270
Anxiety is about one that hasn't
happened yet. Almost always.

459
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:18,360
As soon as you're afraid, that makes
you anxious about what's gonna happen.

460
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,750
And then there's general existential
angst. The, the, just the, the,

461
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,960
the life itself. Existence is just a wad.

462
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,630
Is this what, yeah.

463
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,860
And all of that is due to, um,

464
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,660
our prefrontal cortex, our
ability to conceptualize, to,

465
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,430
uh, you know, imagine

466
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,350
things that, that have never been
imagined before. To create art,

467
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,010
to build, create
architecture, build buildings.

468
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,570
Imagine going to the moon,

469
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:57,070
designing an instrument to do that and
actually pulling it off and make sure it

470
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,043
could get back.

471
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,310
All of that is something that our special
kind of consciousness, uh, enables.

472
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,280
But it has a dark side, which is,

473
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:11,281
it also allows us to be incredibly
selfish and self centered and narcissistic

474
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,540
and to, uh, support
tribes and groups. And,

475
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,130
you know, uh, unless we, I mean,

476
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:26,131
I think that the world survives best
when it's either completely isolated,

477
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,800
all the cultures are isolated or if we
could also somehow be together in a more

478
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,590
unified way because of the
direction we're going now,

479
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,390
where each country is isolating itself,

480
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,020
but it's still so entangled with all
the others is a recipe for disaster.

481
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Is this because we evolved
essentially without longterm travel?

482
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:53,701
I mean,

483
00:30:53,701 --> 00:30:58,020
we kind of evolved to stay in whatever
area of the resources we're in when we're

484
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:58,950
hunters and gatherers.

485
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,580
And then somewhere along the line somebody
figured out boats and how to get on a

486
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:05,160
horse. And then the next thing
you know, you're visiting people.

487
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,960
I think it's more about, um, you know,

488
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:13,961
we have a special kind of inquisitiveness
that we can because we can mentally

489
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:20,051
model the next step and
plan what are the options,

490
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,540
you know, try to anticipate the, uh,

491
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,810
the problems that are going to come
up and take those steps. Um, and,

492
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,780
and that's a pretty special thing,

493
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,990
but it also allows us to plan
and a kind of devious way where,

494
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,880
you know, me or my group
is going to benefit and uh,

495
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,530
if mine benefits,

496
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,100
I don't want the other one to benefit
cause we got to keep everything separate.

497
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,980
So it's, you know, consciousness. Our
kind of consciousness is, are, are,

498
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,550
you know, greatest achievement,
but also probably our worst aspect.

499
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,140
Oof. But it's, Hm,

500
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,860
but it's what makes us human.

501
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,740
It is imagining humans with no
consciousness is impossible.

502
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,170
There's no way to go in that
direction. That's so is,

503
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,750
is the key to this
thing as the human race?

504
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:15,830
Is it managing our consciousness
of perhaps maybe work like yours?

505
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,780
Giving us the tools to understand what
are the mechanisms involved that maybe

506
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:24,960
that can help us sort of
navigate our biological cool

507
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,840
traps. And maybe, I mean,
I think it's, you know,

508
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:35,400
certainly we don't, I think the, I mean,
I have no idea what your position on,

509
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,880
uh, climate changes.
But, uh, personally I,

510
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,110
that things are happening and
something needs to be done.

511
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,860
That's clearly things are happening
and that, you know, there was,

512
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,620
I read a couple of editorials, uh,

513
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,250
probably in the New York times or
something a couple of months ago.

514
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:56,270
One was about how, yes, the, you know,

515
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,400
things are changing and, uh,
we have a right to worry. But,

516
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,150
you know, we shouldn't worry
about the earth as a famous quote,

517
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,830
his guy as a tough bitch.
So the earth will survive.

518
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,430
But the configuration of life on it is
unlikely to continue to be the same under

519
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,550
those conditions. The more
that everything changes,

520
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,130
the conditions of life change
and the first things to go. Um,

521
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,250
and this is what happened to the dinosaurs
are large energy demanding organisms

522
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,370
because as the conditions
change, um, you know, the,

523
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,750
the climate that we've lived in,

524
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,330
we've succeeded because we were able
to benefit from that kind of climate.

525
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,580
But as the climate begins to change,

526
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,010
archine is not gonna be able to succeed
as well because those conditions are,

527
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,420
you know, the waters arising,
the desert, uh, expanding.

528
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,920
All of these things are happening
and it's just not going to be, um,

529
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,450
yeah, species don't last that long.
Know a few million years and they go,

530
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,220
so our time may be, we've
only been around for what,

531
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,090
300, 400,000 years and something, well,

532
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,830
it depends on what we call wheat,

533
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,130
but the Neanderthals were around
quite a bit longer than that. Yeah,

534
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,130
they're not here anymore.
So we don't have a, I mean,

535
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,490
I think that we can use
our minds to try and,

536
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,940
you know, help us get through this,

537
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,270
but that's only gonna work if
we can do that collectively.

538
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,920
That's the scary part.

539
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,820
We have to work together collectively
as a world because these are not local

540
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:44,940
issues. These are global
issues. Yeah. And that is,

541
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,430
how does that get locked, you know,

542
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,750
especially getting other
countries like China to comply.

543
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,810
It's small successes.

544
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:58,370
I mean like auto companies
deciding, well we need to,

545
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,330
you know,

546
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,960
reign in the ambitions and
there's probably a profit
motive a underlying that at

547
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:06,740
some point. Sure. And people
are conscious. There's
green dollars, right? Right.

548
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,040
Like you wanna like when,

549
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,330
when you think about technological
achievements and you think about the,

550
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,320
the conscious mind and the ability
to create and the creative process,

551
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:23,321
do you envision the possibility of some
sort of a technological solution to a

552
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:28,430
lot of the problems that we're facing?
I think it has to be a social solution.

553
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,170
Social. How so?

554
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,010
We have to wait,

555
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,520
we have to figure out how
to balance this worldwide.

556
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,473
It can't, this,

557
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,950
we can do whatever we want in this
country if we could do what we want.

558
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,390
But you know, if, uh,

559
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,190
if even if we were the best country
in the world for the environment,

560
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,760
that wouldn't solve the problem. You
know, it's a worldwide problem. You know,

561
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,850
Amazon forest that's affecting
a lot of people. You know,

562
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,770
it's just not a,

563
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,480
it's not a simple thing that
one country can solve, right.

564
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,600
But if one country takes steps and imposes
some sort of a technological solution

565
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,840
that pulls carbon from the atmosphere,

566
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:20,841
that does enhance some sort of a
cooling process to bring homeostasis,

567
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,260
to bring some sort of a,

568
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,000
like generally agreed upon
state of the environment,

569
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,100
if that's technologically
possible, I mean,

570
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:32,190
that's going to come out of the
creative mind. Right. Well, you know,

571
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:37,191
I don't want to go too far off into my
not area of expertise like climate and

572
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,730
saw labs. I just think there's,

573
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,780
I think of it from the kind of the social
perspective and what our brains are

574
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,400
contributing, but I don't want to,

575
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,410
I don't think I can really address
the details of all that. Right.

576
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,640
But even like socially, if
we did address it socially,

577
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:55,641
we're still gonna have to deal with
the actual physical limitations of the,

578
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,280
just the environment that we live in and
what we've done and how to somehow or

579
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:04,080
another mitigate it.
Yeah, I agree. Yeah. So,

580
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,390
but yeah, so I think, you know,

581
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,530
creators coming along and trying to
find technical solutions. That's great.

582
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,240
When you analyze the human mind and
knowing what you know about the thought

583
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,450
processes and the way
people think and work.

584
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,640
When you see people in denial of climate
change and when you see people that are

585
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,470
so enamored with the concept of capitalism
and big business that they don't

586
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:32,160
really think that it's a big deal or
they want to deny that it's a big deal so

587
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:35,700
that they can continue short term
profits. Right. What does that,

588
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,440
like those mechanisms like wa watching
that take place in the monkey mind,

589
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,650
what do you, what are you thinking
when you see that happen with humans?

590
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,490
You know, I don't think it's
simple. Um, it's not simply

591
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:54,410
denial of climate change
[inaudible] for climate reasons.

592
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:58,650
I think there's a lot of social,

593
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:00,830
you know,

594
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,980
within certain groups there is social
stigma for being pro-environment. Yes.

595
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,320
And so it's, um, tribal, tribal. It's,

596
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,580
it's uh, people, yeah.

597
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,520
People cling together and it's a
kind of form of self protection, um,

598
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,620
that by identifying a set of
issues that we all can agree upon,

599
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,780
um, because they're kind of dictated
top-down in a sense that, um, our,

600
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,760
our thing and then that thing
is somebody else's thing.

601
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,310
So yeah, that's a weird
aspect of being a human

602
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,910
being, right?

603
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,350
These tribal identity things
where if you're in this group,

604
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,400
you must be pro choice, right? If you're
in this group, you must be pro-life.

605
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,430
You must be anti-war,

606
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,300
you must be pro second amendment knowing
there's very little deviation and that

607
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,810
that's left drive. That's everything.
I mean that, that belief systems,

608
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,010
rigid belief systems, uh, you know,
part of, uh, just part of being,

609
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,460
and when you look at politics and
you know, that these belief systems,

610
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,700
when do you find it odd that we have
these like sort of polar opposites or at

611
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,930
least left right? Choices, red,

612
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:15,931
blue choices that we've limited
ourselves to these very distinct tribes.

613
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,710
Right? And that's, yeah, I think that's
unfortunate, but that's where we are.

614
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,630
Is there a way out of that?

615
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,300
I do know that political science
just has to take that one.

616
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,480
Now we're going down a weird road.

617
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,110
What do you think is the source of
creativity like somewhere along the line?

618
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,580
I mean, and we've seen it, right?

619
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:40,030
I mean there's some speculation and
scientists have sort of generally agreed

620
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:45,031
that some monkeys are in the stone
age that some primates are in.

621
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,310
What would be considered stone-age.
They're starting to use tools,

622
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,170
they're starting to use sticks and it
is a famous photograph that I love of an

623
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,690
orangutan. Where are we
going to get a copy of that?

624
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,420
We should get that orangutan with
a spear. We'll make a note of that.

625
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,930
There's a crazy Orangutang image of an
orangutan holding onto a branch and then

626
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,310
spear fishing. It's amazing.

627
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,700
And apparently he had seen humans do it.

628
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,430
So that's where he learned
the behavior imitation. Yes.

629
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,460
But still that is a primate using
a weapon to try to spear fish.

630
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,630
Look at this photo. Isn't that incredible?
Nice. I mean, that is incredible.

631
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,800
That's like really thoughtful and
skillful and the way he's hanging.

632
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:32,350
I mean, my goodness, look at
that. I've, I love that picture.

633
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:36,430
That picture is amazing. Yeah. Now this,

634
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,300
the creativity that allows you to
get food when you couldn't get food,

635
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,120
allows you to escape from
environmental conditions,

636
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,010
allows you to escape from predators.

637
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,730
All these things are awarded by the
continuing of your genetics, right?

638
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,900
So, but there are other
things that come into play.

639
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,890
One of the special days
that, uh, that came along,

640
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,880
I think as a byproduct of having language
and by language I don't mean words,

641
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,920
but what language did but what was
required for language to come out of the

642
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,640
brain,

643
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,640
which is the development of a cognitive
sort of architecture in our brain that

644
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,100
allowed all kinds of, um,

645
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,190
mental jumping around. So for example, um,

646
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,540
for most animals to learn, you know,

647
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:28,660
who to trust and who not to
trust and what some, what,

648
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,730
who's what in any given situation,

649
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:34,010
who's going to do what to whom by
just looking around, they have to

650
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,360
go through trial and error, learning it,
see the experience, all of that a lot.

651
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,330
But the human mind can simulate,

652
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,750
create a mental model and instantaneously
make those kinds of predictions.

653
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,990
On the basis of very
limited information. Um,

654
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,520
and this is based on something,

655
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:57,521
well w w the relation to languages
that syntax gives you those kinds of,

656
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,960
uh, options because you can,
you know, you have, um, um,

657
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,740
a past,

658
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:08,741
present future States that can be related
to you and to others and so forth.

659
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:13,310
And personal pronouns are very
important in terms of, uh, me,

660
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,470
I mine you years that those, the,

661
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,720
the point when those come in and a child
is the first point when I think self

662
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,800
awareness can fully be tested
and shown. Um, you know,

663
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,290
some people say, well, they have it,
but they just couldn't express it.

664
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,610
Others say no,

665
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,180
but the arrival of the pronoun personal
pronouns are very important in the

666
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:38,930
child's development of a
sense of self. But anyway,

667
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,120
so language changes, uh,

668
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,050
the brain changes the cognitive
architecture of the brain and allows for

669
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:49,550
something just to throw out a technical
term, hierarchical relational reasoning,

670
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,970
just the ability to think across
kind of conceptual categories, um,

671
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,790
laterally and horizontally. Uh,

672
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,180
so that information you
can just jump around.

673
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,220
And that's kind of what creativity is.

674
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:09,221
The ability to just jump around in middle
space and come up with something by a

675
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,710
unique combination of
those things. Do you,

676
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,690
do you think that there's variation

677
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:19,850
in terms of the types of languages like
Chinese versus Spanish versus that they

678
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,310
allow you to interface with the world in
a different way because the language is

679
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:28,920
structured very differently? I
think that's absolutely right.

680
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:32,360
But I don't know if enough about other
languages to say exactly how. I think,

681
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,130
I think it was Malcolm Gladwell.
I think it was the outlier.

682
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:39,390
So they discussed this like the
limitations of certain languages. Uh,

683
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:43,950
in terms of, uh, pilots was
that Gladwell think it was, uh,

684
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,340
well they were, they were, they were
discussing how a Korean airlines,

685
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,490
because they have sort of a
hierarchy of, uh, you know, the,

686
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:56,530
the way you're supposed to treat the
upper levels of management and then that

687
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,630
they had to force these pilots to all
speak English so that they didn't have

688
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,980
this hierarchy, like the,

689
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:09,510
this presumed hierarchy of being able
to address situations that planes had

690
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:13,410
crashed because co-pilots
were in their place.

691
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,580
They were put in their place.

692
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:17,880
And you weren't allowed to address pilots
and that once they had switched over

693
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:20,280
to English that the language,

694
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:24,330
like there's so many different versions
of dealing with your boss or someone

695
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,340
who's an upper level person that there
are so many different ways that you were

696
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:31,980
supposed to address them.
And they had eliminated all

697
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,800
that by using English. Yeah.
And it made me think like,

698
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,920
just using different styles of language,

699
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:41,730
the way human beings communicate here
is very different than the way people

700
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,060
communicate. Say, you know, in
some African countries, right,

701
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,270
that we have these different styles of
interpreting the world around us and

702
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:55,530
those in turn have a profound effect on
the way we sort of interface with the

703
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,720
world. And I think that's
definitely right. So it's, you know,

704
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:03,120
essentially interesting to think
about emotion and language.

705
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:07,560
So it's often said that an emotion like
fear is universal across the world,

706
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,520
but I don't think that's actually
correct. What's universal is danger.

707
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,850
And the way fear is interpreted by
different cultures is obviously different.

708
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:22,010
I mean, different, uh, the Asians
have a different kind of a, um,

709
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,010
perspective on fear. Every culture
has their own perspective on fear.

710
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,570
So if it's fear is the, you know,

711
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:33,580
the kind of cultural assembly that you
have in your brain in response to danger.

712
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,040
So every culture has to
have a language of fear,

713
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,150
but not because fear is universal
because danger is universal

714
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,450
and what they interpret as
danger is different. Right.

715
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,790
And fear for one person, something could,

716
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,650
could create fear whereas
for another person,

717
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:00,420
the exact same situation would not, right.

718
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:04,290
Depending upon their personal experiences
and maybe even their genetic makeup.

719
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,750
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,
genes contribute. So we, uh,

720
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,410
every part of our brain is under some
kind of genetic influence. So every,

721
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,760
for example,

722
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:19,761
the amygdala will be genetically kind of
slightly more wrapped up in one person

723
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,260
than another. So a little
more sensitive to danger.

724
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:27,210
And so that person might be responding
more to danger in part because of genes,

725
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:31,260
but also may be because of
experiences that they've had. Uh,

726
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,760
and so then the conscious mind is
seeing those responses and starting to

727
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:38,490
conclude, Oh, I'm an
anxious, fearful person.

728
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,530
And that all of that information gets
collected in what's called a fear schema,

729
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,870
which is a body of knowledge of everything
you know about danger and including

730
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:52,570
the way you react, you react
to danger, and you're, uh,

731
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,230
just you know who you
are in terms of danger.

732
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,570
And so whenever you encounter danger,

733
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,900
that schema is what's
called pattern completed.

734
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,901
So presence of a threat in the world
is enough to go into your brain and

735
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:11,100
activate those memories about
danger that give you, uh,

736
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,790
in a non-conscious representation. You
know, an activation of this fear scheme.

737
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,450
That is what then bubbles
up into consciousness.

738
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,310
That's your experience of fear is what
has been activated in your fear schema.

739
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,320
Knowing what you know,

740
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,620
and then watching whatever anxieties
or fears may play out in your own mind.

741
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,960
Is that, for lack of a better term, a
mind fuck for you? I know what I mean.

742
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,580
Well, I mean, studied this so
much and then you're a human.

743
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,240
So I assume you have the same anxiety
as a lot of anxiety that we all do.

744
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:48,190
And cheerfully, it helps to some extent.

745
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:52,720
So I used 1996 I published a
book called the emotional brain.

746
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,150
And few years later I started
finding out from therapists that, um,

747
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,700
the, uh,

748
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,490
a lot of patients were reading the
book with their therapist and they were

749
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,890
saying that it was really helping
them understand why, you know,

750
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,050
how different things were
happening, that the, uh,

751
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,550
the amygdala was causing them
to react in certain situations,

752
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but their fear was their conscious
understanding of those reactions and those

753
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:25,640
were not the same thing. And that
separation helped them, you know,

754
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,580
navigate their own situation and in a
situation of danger, separating out,

755
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,400
okay, that's my body
is responding this way.

756
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,390
My mind is responding this way and these
are two separate things I need to work

757
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:38,224
on and control.

758
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,540
Have you studied various ways that
people mitigate anxiety and fear like

759
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:47,260
meditation and yoga and all
these different things that
sort of change people's

760
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:52,130
States? I mean, I haven't, I haven't
studied it myself, but I'm a,

761
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,550
I have researched it a bit. Uh, I've,

762
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,240
I tried to do meditation myself
because I think it's the,

763
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,800
probably the most direct and effective
way in the moment to, you know,

764
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,140
sitting in the room outside waiting
for, just had my hat and sunglasses on.

765
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,730
Just trying to chill out, meditate
a little bit, get ready for you.

766
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,250
[inaudible] do you do
that on a regular basis?

767
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,680
It's hard to maintain it cause life gets
busy and it seems like the hardest time

768
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:20,050
to do it is when you need
it most, right? Yeah.

769
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:24,010
I think it's one of those things like
hygiene or you sort of have to say,

770
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:27,280
well it's hard to take a shower then
you have to take a shower. Don't stink.

771
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,820
You have to brush your teeth, you
get cavities, you have to meditate,

772
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,850
you'll go crazy. Yup. It's perfect,
but that's the way it should be done.

773
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,420
I think that is what, so when
you examine those kinds of tools,

774
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,421
like tools that people have
sort of imagined or created
S to sort of in some way

775
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:46,510
alleviate anxiety or
enhanced perspective, do you,

776
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:51,460
do you spend much time dwelling on the
creation of those things and what's going

777
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:54,940
on there? Uh, what do you
mean by the creation? Well,

778
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,580
there's like a human had to
figure out how to meditate.

779
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,740
A heart person had to
figure out these modalities,

780
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,520
these different ways to
sort of interface with.

781
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,340
So let's take that from, uh,

782
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,140
take that to

783
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,910
the nature of most approaches
to fear and anxiety today.

784
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,900
Um, hold this, hold off the
meditation part slightly. Okay.

785
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,780
So we have in a psychopharmacology,

786
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:29,360
some major line of attack and also, um,

787
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,990
what's called cognitive
behavioral therapy, which is a

788
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,630
Rose as a form first called behavioral
therapy because it came out of the

789
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:46,380
behaviorist movement, which said there's
no consciousness, you know, that,

790
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,040
that the human is a stimulus response, uh,

791
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,560
organism that is based on a history
of reinforcement with certain kinds of

792
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,450
situations. Um,

793
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,960
so behavior therapy was about using
Pavlovian or opera conditioning to change,

794
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,870
um, how the brain would respond to
threats and how people would act in those

795
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:12,730
situations. Um, it wasn't
about the mind at all.

796
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,160
It was all about behavior and
then cognition was added to that.

797
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,940
So that became cognitive
behavioral therapy. But again, the,

798
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:25,060
the cognitive change was used as a way
of changing behavior because so much

799
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,440
emphasis has been placed on,
uh, behavior in our culture,

800
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,900
including in the drug therapy world.

801
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:37,160
It's all based on changing measurable
things like behavior and physiology.

802
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,840
And that I think that that's why all
of these things in some sense have not

803
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,600
worked out as well as
we would like, you know,

804
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:49,490
the best in the best medications.
In the best CBT trials.

805
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:54,430
We'll give you like 75%
record of, of help in a group.

806
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,570
That's pretty great though, isn't it?
Jim still got 25 to 10 but I, yeah,

807
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:01,330
but you also have to extract
out the placebo effect.

808
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,590
And in many of these, uh, uh,
drug studies, for example,

809
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:10,480
depressive anti-depression drugs, the
placebo placebo effect is, you know,

810
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:14,680
only the, the drug effects only slightly
better than the placebo effect. Well,

811
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,980
when you have cognitive behavioral
therapy, there's, I mean,

812
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,970
you're actually going for the placebo
effect, right? I mean you're trying to,

813
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,220
nothing wrong with let's say
both back in that sense though,

814
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:26,980
you are trying to sort of, you're,

815
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:31,480
you're trying to use some sort of
strategy with your mind in therapy,

816
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,810
whether it's meditation or what are you
doing? You're trying to enact change.

817
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,640
Right? And if that changes enacted,
there's not a pill involved. Right.

818
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:43,650
So it is kind of like the same mechanism
that's involved in a placebo effect.

819
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,860
You, your mind is creating
this new change. Yes.

820
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,310
And so, but the question is a person that

821
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,050
goes through the motions but
doesn't get the therapy right.

822
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,410
How much are they changed by
simply by kind of going through it?

823
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,760
It just so many variations with humans
or I'd like to find out like are they

824
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:08,250
lazy, are they self destructive?
And why is that the case?

825
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,740
Like maybe all of the above, all
the, yeah, whenever you have,

826
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:15,160
I think 75% amazing.
Yeah. Can you consider,

827
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,100
if you have a group of
people, what are the odds?

828
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,720
If you have a group of a hundred people,

829
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:24,190
what are the odds of 25 of them are going
to be lazy. Pretty good, right? Yeah.

830
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,170
Pretty. I,

831
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:30,170
I would bet I'll ton of money at 25%
of those people don't do what they're

832
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:35,010
supposed to do all the
time. Right. So you know,

833
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,960
you're right. But I think the issue
is from a scientific point of view,

834
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,380
we need to know exactly what really works,

835
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,980
what's different from placebo. Right?

836
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,760
So that we can see what to build
upon for medication, for medication,

837
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:52,380
for cognitive therapy as well.

838
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,190
But the therapy thing is so strange
to be because you put, okay,

839
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:01,191
maybe we're using the wrong word with
placebo because placebo is a word for a

840
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:04,800
medication that has a
psychosomatic effect. Right? Well,

841
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,300
it's the control group that doesn't get
the treatment so that you get that in

842
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:11,970
not really doing anything physiologically,

843
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,630
but your body is interpreting it
as medicine and saying, all right,

844
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,930
change is coming and then the change
comes. Right. And that is a real thing.

845
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,290
But when you're thinking about
cognitive behavioral therapy,

846
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:26,580
you're thinking about using techniques
and strategies to change the way you

847
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:29,450
think and behave though. So the,

848
00:54:29,451 --> 00:54:32,070
the concept of the placebo effect
doesn't really apply there.

849
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,980
Well you have to have a control
group right in the study.

850
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,110
You have to have randomized
control in order to make it.

851
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,530
So when you have cognitive behavioral
therapy and you have randomized control

852
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,020
and you have a control group, did
you just give him shitty therapy?

853
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,540
[inaudible] wait,

854
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,950
we need to get a therapist on here to
give you the answer that cause I don't

855
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:52,190
know the answer. You've gone to
therapy yourself. I have. Yeah.

856
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,920
Did you do that to examine
this? Um, I, you know, I,

857
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,690
I mainly went into it with,

858
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,410
for the meditation part
[inaudible] to try and uh,

859
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,590
calm some of my restlessness.

860
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,930
Has writing and all this study that
you had to do to write these books,

861
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,030
has that enhanced you got me that you
have much more of an understanding about

862
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:18,840
what's at play than the
average person does? Well,

863
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,643
you know, I, again,

864
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,910
it's kind of like the patient who's
reading the emotional brand with the

865
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:27,660
therapists.

866
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,660
I think by writing those books I learn a
lot and it helps me see things and that

867
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,120
doesn't necessarily help
me lead my life any better.

868
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,310
But I think I understand it a
better, but no self, no fear. Yeah.

869
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:45,900
Well no self, no fear
means that you have to be,

870
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:50,901
you have to have this auto
Noetic consciousness ability
in order to be afraid.

871
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,090
And that is a special human quality.

872
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,850
The ability to put yourself in the moment,

873
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,780
in your past and in your future. Um,

874
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,980
if it's not you that's going
to be harmed by that snake,

875
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,010
then you don't have to worry
about what it's gonna do to you.

876
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,580
So if you are a part of it, then
you worry and it becomes, you know,

877
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,360
it's an emotion when you're
involved. So I think emotions,

878
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:19,830
this is a crazy idea that's in the
book that emotions didn't arise through

879
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:24,220
natural selection. Really.
Wow. That the idea that

880
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,430
they, um,

881
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,470
were byproducts of other
capacities that came along.

882
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,820
First you had some kind of crude language
that enabled this hierarchical and

883
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,890
relational reason to
jump across, you know,

884
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,330
language gave you categories
to like conceptualize things.

885
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,590
Hierarchical reasoning allowed you
to jump across those categories. Um,

886
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:51,030
and those kinds of things allow you to
conceptualize yourself as an entity with

887
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:55,714
an experience.

888
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:00,990
So you had to have a self that could
do that kind of reasoning and um,

889
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,120
uh, across those conceptual categories.

890
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,270
And that is what enabled on emotion,

891
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,510
the ability to put yourself
into a significant situation.

892
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,390
So now that it's here, now that
we have, once emotions are there,

893
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,070
then they become selected, but they
weren't selected by, for example,

894
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,320
the amygdala having evolved
to be the fear center.

895
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:25,740
And we inherited that
from animals. You know,

896
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,830
animals probably have some kinds of
experiences, but it's scientifically,

897
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:34,090
it's very hard to know what they have
really known. Like dogs have emotions,

898
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:38,430
right? Dog dogs get happy.
You see their behavior, right?

899
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,700
But I'm not saying they aren't, but
scientifically you can't measure that.

900
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:43,751
Right?

901
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,810
But if you have a dog and you come home
and he's so excited to see you in his

902
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,700
run around circles, that seems
very emotional. Well akin. Yeah,

903
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,210
but I don't said, let's talk about
the brain for a second. Okay.

904
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,240
So the parts of the brain circuits in
the brain that are involved in this kind

905
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:08,980
of auto Noetic emotion that I'm talking
about, this self involved in motion,

906
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:13,270
that's so human, uh,
such a human quality, um,

907
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,120
to I w the part of the brain
that I think is important,

908
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,140
and this is still hypothesis
is not a fact, uh,

909
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,790
is something called the
frontal poles. Very,

910
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,490
very front part of the prefrontal cortex.

911
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:32,020
That region is unique to
the human brain. No other,

912
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,110
not even another ape has that. Now,

913
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:40,210
other parts of the prefrontal cortex
are present in other primates.

914
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,180
All of the primates, but
not in any other mammal.

915
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,080
So if we can figure out in the human
brain what that frontal pole does and what

916
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,980
that other part, that all primary tab do,

917
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,840
then that gives us an anchor for
speculating about what other primates,

918
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,390
what kinds of experience
other primates have given,

919
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:03,880
what those parts of the brain enabling us.

920
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:10,230
And that would allow us to then extract
what other mammals don't have that we

921
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:14,800
have because they don't have those
parts of the brain. So it's a,

922
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,300
it's a kind of, you know,

923
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,860
you use of the brain to tell us some
things about what might exist in other

924
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:24,830
animals, but there's no way to ask
a dog what's on your mind, right.

925
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:29,510
In measure the brain with an FMR eye or
something along those lines where you

926
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:33,850
get a reading of. But that's not a,
an answer. I mean, it's Carlot, right?

927
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,730
So a human, like, I can, you know,

928
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,880
if you asked me, uh,

929
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,590
is there a pin here on
the table? I say, yes,

930
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:50,240
I can respond verbally
or I can point to it. Um,

931
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:54,520
but, uh, when I'm responding verbally,

932
00:59:54,521 --> 00:59:57,100
I can only do that for
something I'm conscious of.

933
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:02,710
I can't respond to something
I'm unconscious of by naming it,

934
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,370
follow. The other animals can
only respond non-verbally,

935
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,400
so they don't have that other kind
of response that is only reflecting a

936
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:18,310
conscious state. So I'm not
saying they don't have anything,

937
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,290
but scientifically it's very hard to,

938
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:25,210
to know what they have and the fact
that we can study it. We know in,

939
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:25,900
for example,

940
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,250
fear that the fear itself probably
doesn't depend on the amygdala,

941
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,270
but the, all the behavior
that we see does,

942
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:39,900
makes us have to be cautious about
observing behaviors that look like they're

943
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:44,800
based on fear, love, and all these other
emotions when we can't really know.

944
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:49,990
Because we can't measure that. Well,
I mean, it's a tough problem. Again,

945
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:53,860
I'm not saying it's not there. It's
just like scientifically, you know,

946
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,560
you have to, you have to be
stretched. The evidence. Yes. Yeah.

947
01:00:56,561 --> 01:01:00,910
You have to know now measuring
it in humans is, I mean,

948
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:03,880
there's this concept of people,
I'm an emotional person. You know,

949
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:07,790
I'm emotional, like people I get
emotional, like people love to say. Yeah,

950
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,560
those, those kinds of things. What is it

951
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,710
possible to measure varying degrees of
emotional response in terms of like how

952
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,890
it's affecting a person physiologically,

953
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:26,200
whether or not these emotional responses
are physiological or whether you've

954
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:31,201
gone down a well-groomed psychological
path that you've been sort of

955
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:36,310
participating in your whole life so
that you have these sort of triggers.

956
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:40,840
This happens and then up I'm gonna, I'm
gonna start crying. This happens up.

957
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,710
I'm going to get angry.

958
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,730
And people sort of fall into those
paths without self-reflection,

959
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,020
without this ability to be
objective and introspective and go,

960
01:01:50,021 --> 01:01:54,190
why am I reacting this way? Like what?
Maybe you should stop being so emotional,

961
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:56,380
Joe. Right? Anybody ever say that?

962
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:02,310
Uh, I guess my wife to say, well
what does that mean? Like what,

963
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,000
you know what I mean? Like the, this,

964
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:09,060
the varying degrees of emotional
response and whether or not those are

965
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:13,590
beneficial or whether or not they just
detract from your experience or inhibit

966
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,220
your, your ability to be
productive. So, you know, I,

967
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,400
it really nailed a lot of interesting
stuff in there and I, um, you know,

968
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:26,640
it's very kind of deep analysis
of, of what's going on.

969
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,710
So the problem is that our
language is so bad that,

970
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,490
um, all of these terms that we have,

971
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:40,650
we borrow from what's called folk wisdom
or folk psychology. You know, the,

972
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:46,010
they've come through the ages and this
is true in every aspect of science that

973
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,510
you have folk terms,

974
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,580
folk physics becomes real physics
and then the folk stuff goes away.

975
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,630
Folk biology becomes real biology and
then, you know, the folk stuff goes away.

976
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,460
But in psychology,

977
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,700
the folk stuff never goes away because
we always experienced the folk aspect of

978
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:09,960
it. When we have a conscious experience,
that's what our conscious minds is,

979
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:14,220
our folk psychology of ourselves
and of others and of other animals.

980
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,060
But the, um, um,

981
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:26,060
underneath that is the part that we can
get rid of the folk psychology because

982
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:28,770
we can understand how behavior is control,

983
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,260
how these physiological responses are
control and ain't because, you know,

984
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,730
we've had fears causing it, you
know, but when you're afraid,

985
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:43,920
you're almost always running from
the bear and feeling fear. But,

986
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,100
and, and so you assume that when
you're running from the bear,

987
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,240
fear is what causes you to run.
But fear is not the answer.

988
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:56,120
Fear is your awareness that all that
should is happening to you. [inaudible]

989
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:02,370
but also the, the ability to
contemplate the consequences, right?

990
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,830
Yeah. Yeah. Like this is
where it's going to get me,

991
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,080
he's going to Amy and so it's
all that's all, you know,

992
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,490
one interpretation after another
running forward. But no self, no fear.

993
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,830
That's no possible either. Right.

994
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,260
Well if that, I mean you need
the self to be afraid. Yeah.

995
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:24,190
So I mean that's your, and
to be consciously afraid,

996
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,740
but you can react to danger without the
self. And that's what, yeah, that's key.

997
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,370
You,

998
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:33,790
you find yourself freezing or you're
walking in New York city and you jumped

999
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,790
back in, the bus goes flying
by. So you've reacted to danger.

1000
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,900
But only afterwards do you feel fear
when you cognitively become aware that

1001
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:43,180
that's happened? Well and
that sort of a situation,

1002
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,810
but in a situation like we are walking
down a dark alley and then you see some

1003
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:51,070
guy who seems to be following you,
you're like, Oh boy. Yeah. So now you're,

1004
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,840
you're in a situation where you're
in a potentially dangerous situation.

1005
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,420
So now you're anxious about
what's going to happen.

1006
01:04:58,421 --> 01:04:59,530
So you're not starting with theory,

1007
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:02,590
starting with things side it worry
about what's going to happen. Nothing.

1008
01:05:02,591 --> 01:05:06,220
There's nothing there that's made you,
but then one of the ramps it up says,

1009
01:05:06,221 --> 01:05:09,910
Hey Joe, yeah, come over here man. I'd
like to borrow some money from you.

1010
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:13,090
And you're like, gosh, shit
sounds fear is that fear.

1011
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,960
Now you've got a specific threat
and yeah, so you now you're,

1012
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,350
and then that's going to
morph into another anxiety
about what the hell is this

1013
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:25,330
guy gonna do to me? Right. So,
but all of that, you know, the,

1014
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:30,331
the dark alleyway is gonna go into your
brain and trigger your muscle tension,

1015
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,430
your heart to race and so forth.

1016
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,080
And the dark alley is going to go to
your cortex and you're going to be

1017
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:41,290
interpreting the fact that you're in a
dark alley and your heart is racing in

1018
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,480
terms of being anxious and
fearful and all of that.

1019
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,900
But they're happening
separately. It's not one bundle.

1020
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:51,820
It's like separate things in the brain.
And once we understand that, it becomes,

1021
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,260
I think a much easier problem how to
approach problems. If you're in anxiety,

1022
01:05:56,261 --> 01:06:00,760
you've got to separately treat the
behavior and the physiology from the

1023
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:03,580
conscious thoughts. And
in between those two,

1024
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:08,581
you also got to change the cognitions
that underlie the conscious experience.

1025
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:14,050
But also the cognitions can
trigger behavior. So, you know,

1026
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:18,580
one of the things we've,
uh, we've proposed a, I
propose this in my last book,

1027
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:23,790
a anxious was a kind of test
program for exploring this where,

1028
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:29,030
uh, be kind of a three part three
step program. Um, first you would,

1029
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,210
you'd have to do it with something
simple like the spider phobic of what?

1030
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,160
A spider phobic or a snake phobia. Okay.

1031
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:41,310
So you would do exposure
therapy subliminally that
means your limit only present

1032
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:46,441
the picture of a snake or the spider
so fast that the conscious mind doesn't

1033
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,690
know it's there. So like those old uh,
hungry eat popcorn things. Movies. Yup.

1034
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,250
And that's a very common
technique in psychology.

1035
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:57,520
So they would show you a film and there'd
be one or two frames of a spider if

1036
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:00,880
you had a rock or just a picture, you
know, but it could be a film. Yeah. Okay.

1037
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:05,590
And uh, but it would have to go
very fast in the film. So it would,

1038
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,020
so with the picture you had just
presented re really quickly and um,

1039
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,410
cause you know, normally if
you show a spider phobic, uh,

1040
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,090
try to do exposure therapy,

1041
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:19,660
they don't want to do it cause I don't
want to deal with spiders, but they,

1042
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,081
they,

1043
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,900
their conscious mind doesn't know what's
happening cause it's going through

1044
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:27,700
subliminally. So the Migdal
is being tamed by the exposure

1045
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,100
and now they can look at the
picture without, you know,

1046
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,160
the body re reacting. They're
not jumping, they're not,

1047
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,220
the heart isn't racing because
the Migdal has been turned off.

1048
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,980
So all of those body
responses I've calmed down.

1049
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,470
So now the person could kind of go,

1050
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:49,180
some undergo some cognitive change
about looking at spiders and so forth.

1051
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,000
And then finally, once
you've done those two steps,

1052
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:57,090
the brain's ready for talk therapy and
meditation and other kinds of mindfulness

1053
01:07:57,761 --> 01:08:00,430
approaches. Uh, because all of the,

1054
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:05,410
the impediments to all that had been put
aside by this, these first two steps.

1055
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,310
So was anybody ever like
officially cured someone,

1056
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,790
a Veracode phobia or video field
of video phobia or you know,

1057
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:14,350
fear of snakes or spiders? Like those are,

1058
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,350
they'll seem to almost like deep-seated

1059
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:21,170
genetic fears while the
we, I mean our ancestors,

1060
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:24,920
yes. Had a snake and what they
vary, which is what's weird,

1061
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,240
the ancestors certainly
experienced venomous snakes and,

1062
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,400
but there's something about,

1063
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:36,550
some people have of almost illogical
reaction to it that it's often been

1064
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:41,510
speculated that this is some sort of
a genetic memory of someone perhaps in

1065
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:45,830
their ancestry lines surviving a snake
attack or losing someone to a snake.

1066
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,980
It's more the, you know,
turns out that the, um,

1067
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:54,340
it's more about the ability to rapidly
learn about those kinds of dangers than

1068
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:58,820
to innately respond. Hmm.
So there seems to be,

1069
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:00,440
it's called prepared learning.

1070
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:06,050
So you have an evolutionarily based thing
that's with you that everyone has some

1071
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:09,020
version of. But you know, it varies
from individual to individual.

1072
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,070
And then some people, um,

1073
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:17,470
are prone to rapidly learn that either
because of other experiences or because

1074
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:21,260
of their particular genetic makeup.

1075
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,440
And so they tend to go down the road of,

1076
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,740
of acquiring these kinds of phobias now.

1077
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:32,540
So it's the problem with treating
that by just extinguishing it,

1078
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,530
uh, through exposure is that the, um, uh,

1079
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,680
extinction is always impermanent. If you,

1080
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,520
once you've been reduced
and nothing is wrong,

1081
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,230
this is true in a rad or person.

1082
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:49,880
Let's say the rat has been given a tone
that's been paired with a shock and then

1083
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,570
it hears the tone 20 or 30
times stopped responding.

1084
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,220
But then if it goes back in the room
or the chamber where the shock had

1085
01:09:58,221 --> 01:09:59,054
occurred,

1086
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:04,390
the tone will again bring it elicited
in a spider phobic returns to the place

1087
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,500
where he or she was bitten by a spider
or a place where spiders have supposed to

1088
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:13,190
be present, it can come
back. So these are imperfect,

1089
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,170
temporary solutions. They're
not enough. Um, and uh,

1090
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,140
that's why I mean they're called,
uh, these are called, you know,

1091
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:25,400
reinstatement and things like that
because like they popped back up.

1092
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:31,310
So maybe medications can help
tamp that down a bit. So,

1093
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,970
uh, medications are useful in,

1094
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:37,190
in that sense of being able to control
the behavior and the physiology.

1095
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,660
But less so in terms of changing
the mental state. Because, you know,

1096
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:45,770
how could you possibly design a medication
that would know how to change the

1097
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:50,480
content, have a, a mental state
that seems like an impossible task.

1098
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,180
And that's what you want to do. You
don't want to change all mental States,

1099
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:57,530
right? You want to change the one
content, you know, I'm afraid of spiders.

1100
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:01,680
Yeah. Oh, it's,

1101
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,680
it's so fascinating though,

1102
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:07,850
how people vary so widely in their,

1103
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,530
their reaction to certain fears or to
certain things that could induce fear,

1104
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,250
whether it's dogs

1105
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,820
or you know, whatever irrational
thing that people have. The,

1106
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:23,060
the source of that is
really often speculated that
there's like some sort of a

1107
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:29,280
genetic component to it. Do you
buy into that? So let's say,

1108
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:34,260
let's say that, you know, in
any kind of situation like that,

1109
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:36,800
there are multiple systems in the
brain that are going to be involved.

1110
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:41,830
We're going to isolate the amygdala as
hypothetical part of that system that is

1111
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,780
detecting and responding to the stimulus.

1112
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:51,230
So we're going to go into the amygdala
and focus on one little part of it.

1113
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,090
Uh, it's called the lateral
nucleus. That doesn't matter,

1114
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:57,270
but it's the part that gets the
input from the outside world.

1115
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:02,430
So that is the gateway into the
amygdala. So now let's talk about,

1116
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,770
let's say it's got, I don't know,
100,000 cells and neurons. Um,

1117
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,780
and um,

1118
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,980
each of those neurons is
going to have a bell curve

1119
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,720
that's based on the genes that made that
cell and whatever kinds of electrical

1120
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,350
signals it's had throughout
the life of the organism.

1121
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,060
So you're gonna have a hundred
thousand bell curves, you know,

1122
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:34,820
various degrees that when the
stimulus comes in, those cells that,

1123
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,240
that are activated,

1124
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:40,140
their little bell curves are going to
determine how much they respond to that.

1125
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,020
And that's going to propagate to other
cells that have their own bell KERS in

1126
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:50,040
areas and so on down the line that what
happens at the level of behavior is a

1127
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:57,531
very complicated kind of summation of
all those bell curves of all those cells

1128
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,140
that happen to be activated. So it's not
like, you know, one thing is progress.

1129
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:05,010
It's not like a brain areas program.

1130
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,950
It's all about what's happened
at those specific cells,

1131
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,050
both through genetics and experience.

1132
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:13,410
So we often kind of oversimplified
things by thinking, well,

1133
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:18,390
there's a gene or an area
that has inherited that thing.

1134
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,980
When you think of human beings and you
think of what we used to be when we're

1135
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,950
some sort of a lower hominid
and now what we are now,

1136
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,630
and you think of all these various
components that are at play, do you,

1137
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,080
do you ever try to imagine what a human
of a thousand years or 10,000 or a

1138
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:39,510
hundred thousand years from
now we'll be like, Oh, the,

1139
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,330
they're going to be different.
You know, we're not,

1140
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,690
every organism is in
constant change. You know,

1141
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:48,990
the racial mixing, uh,

1142
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,590
interbreeding happens. Um,

1143
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,840
and so I end up mutations,
random mutations, uh,

1144
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:01,180
we were living longer. And so, you
know, that's creating, uh, meat.

1145
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:05,310
People are having babies later.
That will change a lot of stuff.

1146
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,980
So we're gonna be a different, uh, thing.

1147
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,890
And at some point we may split out
into a whole new kind of a human.

1148
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,970
The thing about people
having babies older, I mean,

1149
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,170
there's certainly
physical limitations, uh,

1150
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,200
when people start having babies
older. But on the plus side,

1151
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,720
you're dealing with someone that
has a lot more life experiences.

1152
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,960
It's raising a child. Yeah.
You know, versus, uh, you know,

1153
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:32,540
my mom had me when she was
20, 21, you know, what do you,

1154
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,130
what the fuck do you know when
you're 21, you don't know much,

1155
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:39,300
but if you're a woman who has a child
when you're 40, well, Hey, that's a,

1156
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:43,600
a rich life of a lot of experiences and
maybe you can impart some of that wisdom

1157
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,180
to your child. Yeah. And look
at things in a different way.

1158
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:50,050
And maybe that in turn will raise a
child that's more balanced. You know,

1159
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:54,250
I'm talking out of my area
here, but I, I think that, um,

1160
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,250
probably, you know,

1161
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:02,340
the eggs sit around for a long time and
I don't know what the effect of aging on

1162
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:08,200
the egg is. Mm. Uh, I
just don't know. Well,

1163
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:11,000
there's also a big factor with the
male sperm, the male sperm. Yes.

1164
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,690
They thinking that's one of the
main contributors to autism.

1165
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:18,880
Schizophrenia is supposedly a, uh,
I've heard, uh, that, you know,

1166
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:23,881
older fathers are more likely to have
male sons that are schizophrenia.

1167
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:27,760
Yeah, that makes sense. That is a
fact, but I've heard that, well,

1168
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:30,930
it all makes sense that there'd
be some glitches in the matrix.

1169
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:35,230
I maybe we're not supposed to
live that long, are we not?

1170
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,700
But what are your thoughts on people
that are trying to live longer and trying

1171
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:43,930
to sort of squeeze out as much time as
they can on this rock? I don't know.

1172
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:48,400
It's like I see a lot of old people that
just don't want to live anymore and I

1173
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:51,550
understand that you know, that
your body starts falling apart.

1174
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,930
Your mind is going, what's the point
at that point? Yeah, I get that.

1175
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:57,870
But what about the people that
can keep it together? Yeah.

1176
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,450
I guess if you keep it together,
you'd want to like, you know, okay,

1177
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,190
let's just go as far as we can. Let's go
to the moon and, uh, go to Mars. Well,

1178
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,560
pharmacological solutions too. I mean if,

1179
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:13,660
if there was some sort of
a genetic component that
they identified to aging and

1180
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:17,920
they gave the option
to reverse the process,

1181
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:21,400
would you participate or do you like it?

1182
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:26,350
Do you like the finite nature
of this existence? I do.

1183
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,860
I think so. It's like I
knew you were going to and

1184
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:36,970
I think, uh, I don't, I'm not,
I take certain medications,

1185
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:38,050
but, uh,

1186
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:42,250
I'd rather just live as most of my
life is as possible without them.

1187
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,860
So what medications do you take?

1188
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:49,990
Blood pressure and mainly blood
pressure stuff. Yeah. Do you exercise?

1189
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,470
Not enough. That's out yet.

1190
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:56,830
They got a big affect on anxiety
and a big effect on just this,

1191
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,860
a general alleviation of axed.

1192
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,890
So that's a good example of
something I know I should do. Yeah.

1193
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:08,110
Is that a discipline issue? Uh,
I used to be kind of disciplined,

1194
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:12,860
but what happened, I've been
using it a lot too. Uh, you know,

1195
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,500
to do things like, uh,

1196
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,610
I really want to do like
writing or making music.

1197
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:23,300
And so those are the things that kinda,

1198
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:27,850
I know I should like do the exercise too
so I can do more of that longer. Yeah.

1199
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,010
You think you have a finite
amount of discipline? Um,

1200
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:35,210
possibly each person has it, you know,
the find that has that sort of uh,

1201
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,540
anxiety quotient, that
discipline quotient to,

1202
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:44,420
let me kinda, you probably can work
that like a muscle and thought,

1203
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:48,080
imagine you can, yeah. Yeah. You
could become something different.

1204
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,390
Me and my friends have this thing that
we did last year called sober October or

1205
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:56,150
the entire month, you know,
no alcohol, no marijuana,

1206
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:58,460
no drugs and crazy exercise.

1207
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:01,940
Like last year we had a competition to
see like who could exercise the most.

1208
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:05,960
We wore these heart rate
monitors and we measured points.

1209
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:09,680
Like you get a certain amount of points
at 80% of your max heart rate per

1210
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:11,420
minute. What my point is,

1211
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:14,450
one of the things that I got out
of this and we all got out of it,

1212
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:17,450
we all talked about it cause we were
exercising hours and hours a day,

1213
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,140
an incredible alleviation
of anxiety. Incredible.

1214
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,660
Like to the point where
I exercise regularly,

1215
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:27,950
but I don't exercise at that level
that that level that we were doing,

1216
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,940
cause we were in this competition
was really a lot of cardio.

1217
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,290
But my God, that runner's
high is real. I felt amazing.

1218
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,020
I mean I felt like so good all the time.

1219
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,090
The alleviation of anx was unlike
anything. The internal chatter. Yeah.

1220
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,910
That sort of can fuck with your head.
Yeah. That just didn't exist anymore.

1221
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,540
Well I think that that's wonderful that
you're saying that because you have so

1222
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:54,740
many followers and I think that's such
fantastic information to convey to them.

1223
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:57,620
It is. And it's so available to all of us.

1224
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,920
I mean anybody that can move
their body can experience this.

1225
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:04,630
And I don't recommend what we did
cause we were working out five hours,

1226
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:08,360
six hours a day. You know, I'd walk,
I live in New York so I walk a lot.

1227
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,510
That's great. Yeah.
Right. You have to. Yes.

1228
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,670
But I mean just that alone is, it's,
there's many people that don't walk.

1229
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,640
You know, you just sit here
and then you move to that spot.

1230
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,620
You sit there and you get in the car
and you sit there, get on the train,

1231
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:26,840
he'd sit there and there's very little
use of the body and the body starts to

1232
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:27,674
atrophy. Yup.

1233
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,150
By pumping that blood through the system
and cleaning out the pipes and getting

1234
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:35,990
that air into the lungs and forcing
yourself to move when it's over,

1235
01:19:35,991 --> 01:19:40,280
you feel better. Breathing better
and feel it. Right. I'm imagining it.

1236
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,810
Imagining this exercise. Um, what
do you take? What about nature?

1237
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:48,080
Do you take any time in nature at
all? Do you go to central park? Oh,

1238
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:51,870
well we have a house up in Sullivan
County in the Catskills. Oh, that's nice.

1239
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,450
Yeah. How often do you get
a chance to get out there?

1240
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:56,120
We spend a lot of time there in
the summer. Oh, that's great.

1241
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:00,380
And do you feel better when you're up
there? Yeah, definitely. Interesting.

1242
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:03,350
Right? Yeah. It takes a couple of days
to like, you know, get into the rhythm.

1243
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:07,950
Yeah. But then it's good. But once
you do, do you ever think, man,

1244
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:12,030
what the fuck am I doing
living in Manhattan where
all these buildings that you

1245
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,510
know, my wife for not shooting, my
wife's a new Yorker, so I'm by birth,

1246
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:18,600
so I'm a week there. We need to go in and

1247
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:24,510
then we want to come back. My friend
Jeff has a, a, a place on fire Island.

1248
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:27,960
It's a beautiful place. Beautiful.
And he lives in Manhattan as well.

1249
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:31,340
But he says like as he's gotten
older, but the urine Bogan. Yeah.

1250
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,020
He says as he's gotten
older, he really don't,

1251
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,100
doesn't think that he could live in
Manhattan anymore if it wasn't for this

1252
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:41,430
ability to escape and go
somewhere and just, ah,

1253
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:46,320
wake up in the morning and look out, see
the ocean, having a cup of coffee. Ah,

1254
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,860
moving to Brooklyn was kind of like
that. Getting out of Manhattan. Yeah.

1255
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,870
If you don't live in New York,

1256
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,990
that may not make a lot of sense to
you and the people with differences.

1257
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,210
You know,

1258
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:01,110
Manhattan is just like this super
charged all the time and it's not a,

1259
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,040
it's not a try thing. It's, you know,
it's, it's a true thing that you,

1260
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,780
once you get out of Manhattan,
everything is just a notch down. Yeah.

1261
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:15,170
And I've done step off the subway and
you kinda feel this a little bit more

1262
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:18,610
relaxed. Do you think that's cause
Brooklyn, I mean, that's just speculative,

1263
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:22,530
but there's still a lot of
people in Brooklyn. Yeah.
But there's no skyscrapers.

1264
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:26,070
Phew. I mean, there's starting to
be lots of tall buildings and stuff,

1265
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:30,430
but once I got the tall building in
Brooklyn, 30 30 right. Residences.

1266
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:33,760
You know what's Manhattan? Like eighties,
there's like eighties and nineties.

1267
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,380
Yeah. There's some giant buildings.
I'd looked out the other day, a,

1268
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:42,400
I guess from the airplane and there's
something in North Manhattan that looks

1269
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:48,180
like it's way above the empire
state building in terms of size.

1270
01:21:48,181 --> 01:21:49,260
I don't know what that is.

1271
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:55,680
Have you thought about
that existence? Like, um,

1272
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:59,040
in terms of like how unnatural
it is and how recent it is,

1273
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,450
this ability to jam untold millions
of how many people are in Manhattan?

1274
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:04,620
Oh boy. You know,

1275
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:08,160
I have no idea that like I think 8
million or something in York city,

1276
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:11,130
but [inaudible] line then
of course computers as well.

1277
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:14,910
So 8 million plus all the people that
come in from different places to work

1278
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:19,911
there and just stuffed into an incredibly
small area and stacked on top of each

1279
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:21,054
other. Yeah.

1280
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:25,950
That has gotta be a completely new
psychological state for the human animal.

1281
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,420
Right. Yeah. There was just, I remember
when I first got into, um, psychology,

1282
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:35,520
I was reading something about
something called a behavioral sync. Um,

1283
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,413
it was about

1284
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:42,650
how rats living in an
impoverished environment under
highly crowded conditions,

1285
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:50,880
their behavioral repertoire sort of like
diminished a lot. So I think that was,

1286
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:51,300
you know,

1287
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:56,300
sort of used to kind of challenge urban
living and to blame a lot of urban decay

1288
01:22:57,301 --> 01:23:02,130
in the 70s, uh, on, uh, I don't think
it was necessarily a good idea, but,

1289
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,210
uh, it was kind of a,

1290
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:09,211
a way to explain some things that I think
it wasn't really good at explaining.

1291
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:14,260
Yeah. It's true that that the people do
live under fairly crowded conditions.

1292
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:17,000
But um, that's,

1293
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,830
you can't explain everything in
terms of very simple processes.

1294
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:24,280
Are you aware of those studies that
they did where they set cameras up on

1295
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:28,750
streets and they set them distance
apart and they measured footsteps,

1296
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:32,920
how fast people walked and then
they measured the way people talk,

1297
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:35,570
how many syllables and how
many sentences they can get in,

1298
01:23:35,571 --> 01:23:38,380
in a certain amount of
time. And through uh,

1299
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,250
measuring footsteps and how fast
people walked and the way they talked,

1300
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:46,590
they could accurately determine how
big the city was that they live now.

1301
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,340
How much they, yeah, they,

1302
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,570
they get accurately figure out whether
or not they lived in a high population

1303
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:53,171
density,

1304
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:57,040
whether or not they lived in a small
town by the way they talked and the way

1305
01:23:57,041 --> 01:24:01,480
they walk. It's interesting that there's
a profound effect. I have a call,

1306
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:04,900
I used to have a colleague at NYU
named John barge is that Yale man.

1307
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:09,640
And he used to do these studies where
he would, he was a social psychologist.

1308
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:13,870
He would have people come in,
students come into the lab and

1309
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:18,760
take these letters and they were
like scrambled and he'd have to like,

1310
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,600
they'd have to unscramble them into sense.

1311
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:25,630
I guess it was words and you'd have
to unscramble them and put them into a

1312
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:26,464
sentence.

1313
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:31,240
And if the unscramble sentence was
about being older and elder him,

1314
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,610
anything about being
elderly and uh, age, um,

1315
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,580
it would take the students longer to
walk down the hallway to get to the

1316
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:43,960
elevator afterwards as this like
activating this kind of schema of,

1317
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:49,140
of aging that top-down had some kind
of a effect on the way you walk that.

1318
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:52,960
Well, that makes sense.

1319
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:58,030
And you do see what's really interesting
to me is when you see the differences

1320
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:02,710
between people who are the same age,
who behave and think very differently.

1321
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,800
And I always wonder how
much of that is biological,

1322
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:08,170
how much of that a psychological,
how much of that is like, well,

1323
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:12,760
this person just has a better genetic
makeup, you know? And so they've,

1324
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,340
you know, in their 50s they
still have tons of energy,

1325
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,830
whereas this person maybe has shit,

1326
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:21,610
makeup and bad lifestyle choices and
they look like what we considered,

1327
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:24,430
you know, an old man when we
were younger. Right? Well,

1328
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:29,431
I mean we're also complicated and there's
so many factors that go into shaping

1329
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,830
how we end up at any point in our life.

1330
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:37,270
Where do you think selfishness came
from? Auto Noetic consciousness.

1331
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:41,410
So that's this ability to put
yourself into an experience,

1332
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:42,850
which as I said earlier,

1333
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:45,970
is responsible for our greatest
achievements as a species,

1334
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:49,810
but also is what we'll
potentially do as sin.

1335
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:55,050
It allows us to not only
envision a world in which,

1336
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,960
you know, we can be self
less self, you know,

1337
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:01,660
not selfish but help others,

1338
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,280
but also how to exclude others.

1339
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,120
And um, it, I think it's a natural,

1340
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:13,760
basic animal instinct to, uh, stay alive.

1341
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:15,560
Obviously, you know, we've, uh,

1342
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,950
Richard Dawkins said the
theory of the selfish gene, uh,

1343
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:23,150
animals are incredibly selfish and you
know, their struggle for existence.

1344
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:28,160
So that kind of, um, automatic
selfishness is there.

1345
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:33,050
But what the auto Noetic mind allows
us to do is to be intentionally,

1346
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,520
willfully selfish,

1347
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:39,020
to allow us to choose
to do these things, uh,

1348
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:43,310
for our own personal good.
For example, I think that the,

1349
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:48,311
the auto neurotic human human mind is
the only entity in the history of life

1350
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:53,930
that's been ever to put the
organism that we're talking about.

1351
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:58,190
The conscious mind being a small part
of the what's going on in the cortex to

1352
01:26:58,191 --> 01:27:02,930
put all of the rest of the brain and all
of the body at risk for the simple sake

1353
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:07,020
of a thrill. Mountain
climbing, um, you know,

1354
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:12,110
swimming in shark infested waters
are taking drugs at dangerous levels.

1355
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:14,690
Um,

1356
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:19,690
no other organism can commit suicide in
the sense of intentionally planning to

1357
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:25,511
put an end to an entity that
it knows has the possible end.

1358
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:31,790
So our conscious minds are special,
uh, in good ways and bad ways.

1359
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:37,430
The conscious mind that seeks thrills.
What do you think is the root of that?

1360
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:43,050
Like I've always wondered like why certain
people are drawn to doing like flips

1361
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:48,641
on motorcycles or certain people are
drawn to climbing mountains with no ropes.

1362
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,480
Like, what do you think that is?

1363
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,000
And I'm just guessing,
I don't really know,

1364
01:27:56,001 --> 01:28:01,001
but I think that we each have
these kind of physiological,

1365
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,320
uh, States that, that we
try to maintain. You know,

1366
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:10,160
some kids are homeostatic
levels are, are different. Um,

1367
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,480
and some people need a little more
adrenaline or a little more, um,

1368
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,360
you know, I hate to use adrenaline
and a kind of a, um, cheap way of,

1369
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,530
you know, just saying it's just more
of a rusher kind of body activity.

1370
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,500
Um, because all of that also affects
the brain. Um, and so consciously,

1371
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:35,720
um, you strive, you may go looking for
those kinds of things to get the rush.

1372
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:39,320
Um, and it's, uh,

1373
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,733
you know, it's, uh,

1374
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:47,600
it's sort of on the spectrum of
addiction in a sense where you need that

1375
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:51,050
physiological change that the
drug induces. But, you know,

1376
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:55,720
we also have addictions in our lives
that are habits and things that, uh,

1377
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,960
that we develop and pursue that
aren't necessarily good for us,

1378
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,980
but that we kind of feel compelled to do.

1379
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,680
Do you know who Alex
Honnold is? Yeah, yeah.

1380
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:07,470
I've had him on the podcast a couple
of times and every time I talked to my

1381
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,580
hands started getting sweaty.

1382
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:12,720
I get so nervous for folks who
don't know who we're talking about,

1383
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:17,721
he's a the probably the most famous
free solo climber in the world and he

1384
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:24,780
climbed these seemingly impossible
mountains with no ropes.

1385
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:27,450
And there's video of him doing it live.

1386
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:32,630
His drone footage of him climbing these
peaks and my hands just pouring sweat.

1387
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,880
But I said watch it. But
when I talked to him,

1388
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:39,690
what's really interesting is he's a calm,

1389
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,920
rational,

1390
01:29:40,921 --> 01:29:45,630
intelligent man who's
very thoughtful and he's,

1391
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:50,280
he's a very kind guy. He's, he
doesn't seem like some, you know,

1392
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:54,780
I think of when I think of someone who
likes to do flips off with a motorcycle

1393
01:29:54,781 --> 01:29:58,800
or do radical, I think of some
crazy wild thrill seekers. Some,

1394
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,350
some do to just needs to constantly,

1395
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,710
or a woman who needs to
be constantly freaked out.

1396
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:07,860
He's not that guy. And
when he describes it,

1397
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,580
what's really interesting is he
goes, it's very mellow. He's like,

1398
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:13,620
if there's any, if there's
a really a thrilled,

1399
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,990
I've done something horribly wrong.

1400
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:19,830
Like the real thrills are so scary
because it means you're about to die.

1401
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,970
So he's, instead of getting the
thrill, he's getting that piece.

1402
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:28,190
Yeah. But he's getting a piece from
putting himself in extremely risky.

1403
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:34,010
And there's also the thing of other
people praising you for your risk-taking,

1404
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:40,300
which is an odd thing about humans and
they've shown through natural, uh, well,

1405
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:45,600
there's a natural selection aspect of it
with females and mates that females are

1406
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:52,641
attracted to men that do those crazy
things and take crazy risks for some

1407
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:56,550
strange reason, whether it's some
sort of a remnant of our ancient past,

1408
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:59,810
like that thrill seeking man
has got not going to be a,

1409
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,440
he's not going to shy away from combat.

1410
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,680
He will protect our children or
something like that. Right? Yeah. I mean,

1411
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,970
there's a lot of evolutionary
psychology. Yeah.

1412
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:10,950
You know that a lot of that is
speculative. Of course, of course.

1413
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:16,440
But it's the thrill seeker is a,

1414
01:31:16,441 --> 01:31:18,450
that's why it's one of the weirder things.

1415
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:22,710
When everything's great and you have
plenty of food and you live in cities and

1416
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:25,590
like, okay, look, I'm not
getting enough juice here. Yeah.

1417
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:30,590
I'm going to have to learn how to
hand gliders, you know, and yeah,

1418
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,770
some people may do it for
attention or yes. Yeah.

1419
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:37,170
The things people do for attention. Um,

1420
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,870
creativity is a,

1421
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:44,400
that debt to me is one of
the more interesting aspects
of being a human being.

1422
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,640
So our ability to create things
and our desire to create things.

1423
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,850
And in a way that's also
along the same lines, right,

1424
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:54,950
because you're getting
rewarded for it. Well,

1425
01:31:54,970 --> 01:31:57,180
probably. Yeah.

1426
01:31:57,181 --> 01:32:00,040
So I mean all of these things are,

1427
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,640
as a child as is developing and growing
up and passing through different kinds

1428
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:09,640
of situations in life, um,

1429
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:13,300
I think a lot of stuff happens
kind of randomly, you know,

1430
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:17,770
so that the child may do something
that someone views as creative.

1431
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,260
And so as you said, the
child is rewarded for that.

1432
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,140
So then that allows them to
figure out what, you know,

1433
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:26,650
explore kind of how they did that
and, and maybe continued to do it,

1434
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:32,100
but other people may simply have
mindset go in that direction,

1435
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,790
um, on their own where it's a, as
we talked about earlier, their,

1436
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,880
their thoughts are able to jump
across conceptual categories and,

1437
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:44,350
and, uh,

1438
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:49,410
sort of transcend those categories into
new completely new ideas and so forth.

1439
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:54,370
And, you know, I don't think we
know how the brain does that at all.

1440
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,400
That's a very good
question for the future,

1441
01:32:57,401 --> 01:33:01,470
but it's not something we have a great
deal of understanding of. Uh, now,

1442
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,520
I mean, there could be an era of research
on it that I just don't know about it.

1443
01:33:04,521 --> 01:33:06,940
It's a big field. Um, but, uh,

1444
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,450
I certainly don't know the answer
to how creativity comes about. Well,

1445
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:13,240
it's interesting too. Creativity has a,

1446
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:16,600
a reward system built in for
the person who creates, even,

1447
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:18,640
even without recognition from others,

1448
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:23,900
there's some fundamentally satisfying
feeling of creating something.

1449
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,740
It's fun. Yeah. Why do you think that is?

1450
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:34,660
Well, novelty is rewarding, not
reinforcing, you know, it's,

1451
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:39,790
uh, and certainly creativity is novelty.
It's like anything that is novel,

1452
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:45,040
uh, that you do has a kind of, you know,
charge effect to it, I would think.

1453
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:48,220
Yeah. I mean, it's,

1454
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:53,550
people like you who study this stuff to
me are so important because most of us

1455
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:57,670
are just banging into the walls just
trying to figure out why we do what we do

1456
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:03,060
and to have an ability to understand the
scientific explanations for the various

1457
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:06,850
things that are at play. It's, it's so,

1458
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,980
it's so critical because
you can kind of like,

1459
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,350
almost not necessarily stop the process,

1460
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:13,480
but at least be aware of
it while it's going down.

1461
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:16,990
Is that part of what you wanted
to do when you were riding?

1462
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:23,650
Well, I wanna thank you for, um, you
know, crediting me for that, but the, um,

1463
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,230
you know, a lot of what
we've been talking about,

1464
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:30,160
we've just been having a conversation.
My work is very rather limited and all,

1465
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:32,450
I don't work on creativity and
all these things. So I'm kind of,

1466
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,910
you work on the way the mind
works I work on, yeah. I mean, um,

1467
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,020
I think about how the word the mind works,

1468
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:41,810
but I work on how the brain
detects in response to danger. Uh,

1469
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:46,390
so that allows me to go back to my early
work on consciousness and to bring it

1470
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:51,160
in and layer it on top of all that
other stuff. But yeah, it's, um,

1471
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,860
you know, I, I get tremendous, uh,

1472
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:59,060
value out of sitting there and
because when you start a book,

1473
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,750
in my case, I think this is
probably true of many people.

1474
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:06,050
You don't have no idea how you're
gonna get to the end. You know,

1475
01:35:06,051 --> 01:35:08,840
you have a beginning and
you just see where it goes.

1476
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:13,520
So this idea of writing a proposal that
lays out the whole thing to me doesn't

1477
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:18,140
work because you just don't
know where it's going. And, um,

1478
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:23,150
the fun part is getting to the
end, the brain reacting to danger.

1479
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:24,110
Do you, did you,

1480
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:29,680
did you do any interviews with people
who are soldiers or interview fighters or

1481
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:34,580
people that are involved in extreme
activities that yeah, no, I haven't,

1482
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,640
uh, I haven't done a
lot of interviews. Um,

1483
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:41,210
I mean I have talked to people
like that and um, you know,

1484
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:46,211
every individual cases are interesting
because they give you stuff but it's not

1485
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,840
data. So the data you have
to go out and collect. Yeah.

1486
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,040
What do you got there for notes?
You got a pile notes or just, Oh,

1487
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:58,720
I don't know what to discuss.
Um, I just thought, uh,

1488
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:00,530
this brought this,

1489
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,930
I think we covered most
of what I wanna say. Yeah.

1490
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:07,460
They make those as not a fear center.

1491
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:11,360
Behavior is not primarily a tool of
the mind. It's a tool of survival.

1492
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:15,170
We think we know why we do the
things we do and others do them,

1493
01:36:15,171 --> 01:36:18,050
but we don't really, because we,

1494
01:36:18,051 --> 01:36:23,051
our conscious mind is not privy to all
of the things that the body and brain are

1495
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,010
doing now.

1496
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:28,970
When you wanted to examine danger and
you want to examine the mind and how it

1497
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:31,520
reacts to danger and
fear and threats. What,

1498
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,090
what were you trying to
get out of this? Well,

1499
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:39,560
I started out thinking this was
a way to study emotion. And um,

1500
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:43,160
at the time I, you know,
I'd been studying these,

1501
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:48,161
these a human patients with the split
brain surgery and can you explain that,

1502
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,880
cause you, you glossed over that earlier.

1503
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:52,400
But the split brain surgery
is a alleviation of epilepsy.

1504
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,630
It's a way to control epilepsy. The
can't be controlled in any other way.

1505
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:00,230
Medication's not working.
So you have like young kids,

1506
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:03,250
teenagers that have lived
most of their life, uh,

1507
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:08,120
this paralyzed by epilepsy and
not being able to lead a life.

1508
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,950
Uh, there was one patient to basically
his parents constantly having to hold him

1509
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:16,460
down on a mattress. He
was seizing so often. So,

1510
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:19,820
and this is not, this is only done in a,

1511
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:24,821
in a very extreme set of conditions
and it's not done that much anymore.

1512
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:29,090
But when it's done, it's, um,

1513
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:32,480
the connections between the two sides
of the brain are, are separated.

1514
01:37:32,481 --> 01:37:37,220
So information on one side doesn't cross
over to the other. Do they do that? Uh,

1515
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:42,740
they open up the skull,
pulled the two, you know,

1516
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:46,700
you've got kind of two loaves of bread
sitting next to each other and they're

1517
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:50,810
connected by threads, which
are axons that go between them.

1518
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:55,680
And so you pull apart here and you can
see where those axons are and when you

1519
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:56,100
opened up

1520
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,150
from the top, so imagine
like a hot dog bun. Okay. Uh,

1521
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:05,270
and so you opened it up at the top and
you can look down in the center and

1522
01:38:06,241 --> 01:38:09,040
imagine that there was
like a bunch of, uh,

1523
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,970
wires crossing between
the two sides of the bun.

1524
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:15,900
So those wires would then
be surgically sectioned.

1525
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:21,000
And so now you end up with
two sides of the brain,

1526
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:25,500
separate and independent. So
typically languages on the left side,

1527
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:30,330
so you can talk to that side. The
right side doesn't have language. Um,

1528
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,550
so you have to ask, well, what can it do?

1529
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:36,990
So if you present a stimulus that
only the right hemisphere sees,

1530
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,380
and you do that by flashing, uh, uh,

1531
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,040
say a picture of an Apple
on the left side of space,

1532
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:47,280
cause everything to the left of center
goes to the right hemisphere and

1533
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:49,590
everything to the right of center
goes to the left hemisphere.

1534
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:54,540
So you send a stimulus to the
right hemisphere and you say,

1535
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:55,380
what did you see?

1536
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:59,070
And the left atmosphere answers cause
that's where the languages, he says,

1537
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,940
I didn't see anything. So okay.

1538
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:07,410
You said reach into this bag and see
what's in there. The right hand goes in,

1539
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:11,820
that's connected to the left hemisphere.
Can't find it. The left hand goes in,

1540
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:14,130
connected to the right hemisphere,
that which saw the Apple,

1541
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:16,410
it pulls out the Apple. Wow.

1542
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:21,470
So the right hemisphere has information
that the left hemisphere can't talk

1543
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:25,800
about. What is life like for people
once they've done that operation? Um,

1544
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:28,560
while slowly it,

1545
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:33,690
the left hemisphere kind of comes
to dominate again. And uh, the uh,

1546
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:39,450
you know, they, they come to live with
it. And how does it prevent seizures?

1547
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:44,400
Well, the, the folklore of it, I
don't know if this is actually true,

1548
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:48,900
but what is often said is that it prevents
the seizures from jumping back and

1549
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:52,440
forth, uh, and having,
you know, because the, um,

1550
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:57,340
the electrical activity jumping back
and forth sort of gets into kind of an

1551
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:02,340
endless loop that can't stop but cutting
that isolates the seizures in the two

1552
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:07,341
hemispheres and makes each
one more controllable by
taking the medication Jesus.

1553
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:13,380
So managing the, being the first guy
to try that out. I've got an idea.

1554
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:19,290
Let your brain like a hot dog man. So, um,

1555
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:23,970
but what we were interested in in these
patients that we were studying, my,

1556
01:40:23,971 --> 01:40:28,120
this was my mentor Michael
Khazanah gun. Um, and I were,

1557
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:31,050
we're studying these at a
Dartmouth medical school.

1558
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:32,730
We were at Stonybrook out on long Island.

1559
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:37,380
We would drive up to Dartmouth
to see these patients. Um, was,

1560
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,810
how does the left hemisphere cope with
the fact that the right hemisphere is

1561
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:45,200
performed to behavior? That the it,

1562
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:49,970
the left hemisphere that you talk
to didn't come. And so we would,

1563
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:53,620
you know, putting information in the
right hemisphere, the guy would stand up.

1564
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:56,050
Why is that? Why'd you do that?

1565
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:59,460
I needed to stretch or you know,

1566
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:03,250
scratch his hands or I had an itch
so I needed to, to scratch it.

1567
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:08,970
And so time after time
they left hemisphere would
generate a narrative that made

1568
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:11,440
its behavior. Makes sense. Oh wow.

1569
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:16,120
So that's why I got interested in how
non-conscious systems would be generating

1570
01:41:16,121 --> 01:41:20,110
behaviors that we generate
narratives to explain.

1571
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:24,160
Because at the time
that we were doing this,

1572
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:26,980
the idea of cognitive
dissonance was very popular.

1573
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:32,700
And what that means is that
when cognitively when you
do something behaviorally

1574
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:39,070
that is incongruent with
what you cognitively know,

1575
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:41,740
it's disturbing. It causes dissonance.

1576
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:44,380
And so you have to engage in some
kind of dissonance reduction.

1577
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:49,300
So our hypothesis was these narratives
that the left hemisphere is generating

1578
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:51,960
about right hemisphere
behaviors was a way of,

1579
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:56,050
of the left hemispheres
conscious mind. Um,

1580
01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:00,640
kinda keeping it all together. That
consciousness thinks that it's in charge,

1581
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:05,230
that you know, the brain and
body are, it's, you know, it's a,

1582
01:42:05,231 --> 01:42:10,170
it's the S the the control center
and everything else is there to,

1583
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,650
to satisfy its whims.

1584
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:16,480
And so it generates these narratives
to keep that sense of unity going even

1585
01:42:16,481 --> 01:42:17,740
though it's no longer unified.

1586
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:22,360
That is so fascinating that the brain
tries to seek some sort of an explanation

1587
01:42:22,361 --> 01:42:25,690
for the actions that you
provoked right externally.

1588
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:29,470
And that's why I got into emotion cause
well maybe emotion systems produce

1589
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:30,790
these. You got some Jamie,

1590
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:34,200
when I'm looking this up, uh,
alien hand syndrome came up.

1591
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:37,940
Do you know anything about this? I
don't. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. It's a,

1592
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:41,550
there's a long article explaining this
thing called alien hand syndrome and also

1593
01:42:41,551 --> 01:42:44,100
known as dr. Strange lo
syndrome picture doc.

1594
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,790
Just true explanations are very strange
about people's hands doing something

1595
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:50,350
that they're not explaining it right.
I don't know why I did it. Of the same,

1596
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:53,320
yeah. Do they generate an
explanation when they do that?

1597
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,740
It just explains different scenarios.

1598
01:42:55,741 --> 01:42:59,520
People who've had like a leg walking
the wrong direction or a sh buttoning up

1599
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:02,010
your shirt with your left hand or right
hand starts unbuttoning that seems

1600
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:05,560
to be like some sort of a neurological
problem. Flip brain patients with,

1601
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,550
you know, the right after surgery
when things are really like fucked up.

1602
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:11,650
So girly, it would be like

1603
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:15,550
pulling the pants down with one hand
and pulling them up with the, wow.

1604
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:19,150
There's one patient I saw in
the hospital, the young kid,

1605
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,680
the left hand reaches out to grab the
nurse on the ass. Can I say that day?

1606
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:28,210
Yeah. Grab the right and the right
hand is pulling it back. Oh my God.

1607
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,440
Oh my God. There's like a physical
struggle. There's like this and you know,

1608
01:43:32,441 --> 01:43:34,540
and it all kind of like over time

1609
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:37,250
they don't come back
together, but the son,

1610
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:39,980
they negotiate something
where it's not so dramatic.

1611
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:44,500
The woman who thinks her alien hand wants
her to be a better person. Yeah. See,

1612
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,810
I'm thinking these are some
sort of physiologic, yeah,

1613
01:43:48,410 --> 01:43:52,430
well it's a what? A crazy to epilepsy.

1614
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:57,350
I know there's other solutions, but
that, that is a last ditch effort.

1615
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:00,200
Yeah. And so for severe,
severe cases, yeah.

1616
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:05,300
And I can't stop done that often to
eventually sort of achieve some sort of a

1617
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:09,740
normalization. Yeah. Um, you know, that

1618
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:12,560
Dave lives,

1619
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,390
the kids have lived so long in the state
by the time they get there, they're,

1620
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,120
uh, brains change like that, that,

1621
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:22,123
um,

1622
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,640
I don't know really ultimately, uh, what,

1623
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,170
what became of all of these people because
I, I moved on to other fields and um,

1624
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:37,360
but I, I think in general they
live a, a somewhat better life,

1625
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:41,470
but I doubt they ever live a
completely full normal life. I mean,

1626
01:44:41,471 --> 01:44:44,930
how could you after all that,
but I'm really interested in the,

1627
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:48,960
the brain creating these narratives
to explain. Yeah. That's,

1628
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:51,860
there's so many people that do
things like that. Yeah. Right.

1629
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:56,290
They'll try to explain their life away
and give themselves excuses and give

1630
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:59,590
themselves a reasons for behavior.

1631
01:44:59,591 --> 01:45:03,460
And one of the things you see with the
more rational people is it's never their

1632
01:45:03,461 --> 01:45:05,230
fault. It's always someone else's fault.

1633
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:08,860
But that's the 4 billion year story
that I tell you and how we generate,

1634
01:45:08,861 --> 01:45:12,340
how we got to these narratives. That's
what it's all about. Wow. Listen, man,

1635
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:16,660
this is amazing stuff. Um, please
tell everybody your books, um,

1636
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:19,270
where they can get them,
how they can find them.

1637
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:22,350
Are they available in audio
as well, right? Yeah. So the,

1638
01:45:22,351 --> 01:45:25,330
the new book is called the
deep history of ourselves,

1639
01:45:25,331 --> 01:45:28,360
the 4 billion year story of
how we got conscious brains.

1640
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,970
And you can get that on Amazon.

1641
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:35,640
You can get the all the audible on
audible.com. You know, Barnes know,

1642
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:39,610
I think all of the, the major
booksellers have the books.

1643
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:43,870
Last book was anxious. Uh, it
also has an audible version.

1644
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:46,300
I always want it to get like
Christopher Walken to do mine.

1645
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:51,260
Why did you not do it? I didn't do
it. They didn't ask me anything.

1646
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,720
I would want you to do
it. It's your work. Right?

1647
01:45:53,721 --> 01:45:56,830
I get bummed out when
someone else reads like,

1648
01:45:56,950 --> 01:46:00,040
one of the good things about like Pinker
and glad while they read their own

1649
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:03,040
books like a, they've never
offered it to me. You should,

1650
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:07,720
you should demand next to mandate for my,
for my memoir. I'll definitely, uh Oh,

1651
01:46:07,721 --> 01:46:10,300
there you go to, well thank
you for being here. I really,

1652
01:46:10,301 --> 01:46:12,220
really appreciate it and thanks.
Thanks for all your work.

1653
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:15,670
Did I just say one thing
please? Uh, so sometimes I um,

1654
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:18,820
when I released books I also
released music to go with them.

1655
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:23,890
So anxious had a record with it and a
deep history has some songs of life that

1656
01:46:23,891 --> 01:46:27,340
are on the deep history.com website
with Oh, that's cool. So you're,

1657
01:46:27,341 --> 01:46:29,930
you are a musician. You were bringing
that up. All right. Yeah. Got,

1658
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:34,030
I've got a couple of bands and a
couple bands. Well, the main band is a,

1659
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:38,950
the MIG delights I make
delights.com. Oh, that's awesome.

1660
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:43,780
Yeah, it's a rock band we play, we
created our own a genre heavy metal

1661
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:49,030
songs about mine and brain and
mental disorders. They're love songs,

1662
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:50,250
but most rock songs

1663
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,520
are love songs about mental
disorders anyway. Yes. Yeah.

1664
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:55,770
You just being cystic duo. So we are,

1665
01:46:55,771 --> 01:46:59,220
which is a lot easier to get around
without drums and amps and stuff.

1666
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:01,080
We just two acoustic guitars. Awesome.

1667
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:04,620
We play the acoustic versions
of the Migdal Delordes.
All right, well thank you,

1668
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:09,500
Joe. I appreciate you. Thanks for
the fine. Thank you. That's great.
