00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.640
 
I've talked to lots of business people

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650
I've talked to lots of business people
 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.530
I've talked to lots of business people
about leadership and there's a

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540
about leadership and there's a
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.450
about leadership and there's a
literature on leadership but it's not a

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
literature on leadership but it's not a
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.480
literature on leadership but it's not a
good literature it's it's pretty shallow

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490
good literature it's it's pretty shallow
 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.259
good literature it's it's pretty shallow
partly because it's not that easy to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
partly because it's not that easy to
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.060
partly because it's not that easy to
define leadership and partly because

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
define leadership and partly because
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.299
define leadership and partly because
there are different you know you people

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
there are different you know you people
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.440
there are different you know you people
have different temperaments and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
have different temperaments and
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510
have different temperaments and
different temperaments can be leaders

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
different temperaments can be leaders
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.429
different temperaments can be leaders
they just do it in different ways

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
they just do it in different ways
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.960
they just do it in different ways
now there's something in common about

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
now there's something in common about
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670
now there's something in common about
being a leader though and I would say

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
being a leader though and I would say
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500
being a leader though and I would say
one is that if you're an actual leader

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
one is that if you're an actual leader
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060
one is that if you're an actual leader
you actually know where you're going

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
you actually know where you're going
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.429
you actually know where you're going
right because what are you gonna do lead

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
right because what are you gonna do lead
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019
right because what are you gonna do lead
people in circles it's like maybe

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
people in circles it's like maybe
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.009
people in circles it's like maybe
they'll follow you but you're not a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
they'll follow you but you're not a
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810
they'll follow you but you're not a
leader you're just a charlatan so you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
leader you're just a charlatan so you
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459
leader you're just a charlatan so you
have to know where you're going and then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
have to know where you're going and then
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.840
have to know where you're going and then
you have to be able to communicate that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
you have to be able to communicate that
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.600
you have to be able to communicate that
and then people have to trust you so you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
and then people have to trust you so you
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.889
and then people have to trust you so you
actually have to be honest because

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
actually have to be honest because
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.510
actually have to be honest because
people aren't that stupid at least not

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
people aren't that stupid at least not
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.750
people aren't that stupid at least not
for a long period of time and then where

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
for a long period of time and then where
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.220
for a long period of time and then where
you're going has to have some value

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
you're going has to have some value
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170
you're going has to have some value
because otherwise why would anyone want

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
because otherwise why would anyone want
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080
because otherwise why would anyone want
to go along with you so and then you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
to go along with you so and then you
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.340
to go along with you so and then you
might say well what what are the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
might say well what what are the
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049
might say well what what are the
attributes then that make you a leader

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
attributes then that make you a leader
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.979
attributes then that make you a leader
and I would say well they're

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
and I would say well they're
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709
and I would say well they're
characterological fundamentally and this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
characterological fundamentally and this
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.360
characterological fundamentally and this
is not naive optimism or or or casual

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
is not naive optimism or or or casual
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950
is not naive optimism or or or casual
moralizing it has nothing to do with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
moralizing it has nothing to do with
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.210
moralizing it has nothing to do with
that you know we know for example that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220
that you know we know for example that
 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.350
that you know we know for example that
conscientiousness that the personality

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
conscientiousness that the personality
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390
conscientiousness that the personality
trait is a good predictor of long-term

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
trait is a good predictor of long-term
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.420
trait is a good predictor of long-term
success in in most occupations not all

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
success in in most occupations not all
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070
success in in most occupations not all
but most and that one of the things

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
but most and that one of the things
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539
but most and that one of the things
that's associated with conscientiousness

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
that's associated with conscientiousness
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340
that's associated with conscientiousness
is that people keep their word they're

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
is that people keep their word they're
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499
is that people keep their word they're
trustworthy and that's certainly one

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
trustworthy and that's certainly one
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090
trustworthy and that's certainly one
element of a leader especially across

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
element of a leader especially across
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890
element of a leader especially across
any reasonable amount of time you have

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
any reasonable amount of time you have
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840
any reasonable amount of time you have
to be able to trust the person they can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
to be able to trust the person they can
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340
to be able to trust the person they can
even be harsh right it doesn't matter

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
even be harsh right it doesn't matter
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960
even be harsh right it doesn't matter
because you can see harsh leaders and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970
because you can see harsh leaders and
 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120
because you can see harsh leaders and
kind leaders but as long as they do what

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
kind leaders but as long as they do what
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730
kind leaders but as long as they do what
they say they will do then then you can

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
they say they will do then then you can
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859
they say they will do then then you can
follow them and you know that the future

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
follow them and you know that the future
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.130
follow them and you know that the future
payoff is is is secure something like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
payoff is is is secure something like
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.219
payoff is is is secure something like
that so the idea that characterological

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
that so the idea that characterological
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.990
that so the idea that characterological
development is more important to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
development is more important to
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880
development is more important to
leadership than primogenitor

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
leadership than primogenitor
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.819
leadership than primogenitor
I think that's the right word primal

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
I think that's the right word primal
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.940
I think that's the right word primal
Genesis anyways being a firstborn that's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
Genesis anyways being a firstborn that's
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429
Genesis anyways being a firstborn that's
a very crucial psychological realization

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
a very crucial psychological realization
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709
a very crucial psychological realization
that it's character logical development

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
that it's character logical development
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109
that it's character logical development
that makes you favored of God you know

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
that makes you favored of God you know
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.690
that makes you favored of God you know
and I do think we've forgotten this in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
and I do think we've forgotten this in
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.819
and I do think we've forgotten this in
many ways because there isn't a lot of

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
many ways because there isn't a lot of
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.100
many ways because there isn't a lot of
emphasis in our education system on

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
emphasis in our education system on
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290
emphasis in our education system on
characterological development and that's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
characterological development and that's
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240
characterological development and that's
very very surprising to me I think maybe

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
very very surprising to me I think maybe
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670
very very surprising to me I think maybe
it's partly because in our fractured

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
it's partly because in our fractured
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319
it's partly because in our fractured
society we can't agree on what

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329
society we can't agree on what
 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.000
society we can't agree on what
constitutes a reasonable

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
constitutes a reasonable
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.569
constitutes a reasonable
characterological goal so we just throw

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579
characterological goal so we just throw
 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.729
characterological goal so we just throw
up our hands and don't educate our kids

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
up our hands and don't educate our kids
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.369
up our hands and don't educate our kids
to any degree at all especially in

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379
to any degree at all especially in
 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.289
to any degree at all especially in
schools about what an admirable person

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
schools about what an admirable person
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.569
schools about what an admirable person
is like or even let them know that well

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579
is like or even let them know that well
 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.160
is like or even let them know that well
maybe you should actually try to be one

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
maybe you should actually try to be one
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229
maybe you should actually try to be one
you know that that's actually the most

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239
you know that that's actually the most
 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.330
you know that that's actually the most
important possible thing that you could

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
important possible thing that you could
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.880
important possible thing that you could
learn right

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
learn right
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.310
learn right
