00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.481
A new toxin has been found to kill cancerous
cells while ignoring healthy ones, and it

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:06.670
comes from Brazilian wasps.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.519
And meet the Hedgehog, a robot designed to
explore the surface of a comet.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.550
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
Researchers at UCLA have helped a paralyzed
man walk by stimulating his nerves and putting

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.609
him in a bionic suit. By combining a treatment
called epidural electrical stimulation with

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.140
a nerve-stimulating drug, the team was able
to train Mark Pollock's nerves to have a higher

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.650
motor threshold so they could connect to the
brain. The treatment is a proof of concept

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.400
and the suit acts like training wheels, supporting
the patient's legs and adjusting itself based

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.170
on how much assistance is needed. Aside from
walking, the treatment appears to improve

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.690
blood pressure, heart rate, and bladder function
to raise the quality of life for quadriplegics.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.090
Eter9.com is a website designed to create
an immortal digital version of yourself.&nbsp;

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.130
It learns about your posting habits and use
of language to create what they call your

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.390
counterpart, a virtual artificial intelligence
that will post on your behalf even when you’re

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.939
not signed on and will continue to keep posting
after you die.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.810
Virtual robots are being used to study how
cooperation amongst certain insects evolved.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.450
The robots were placed in a virtual environment
that simulated a tree with falling leaves,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.659
and then observed over many generations. While
initially the robots behaviors were erratic,

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.109
after 2,000 generations of digital breeding
the robots had developed specialized tasks

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.791
despite all starting with the same programming.
This discovery not only sheds light on the

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:42.179
evolution of insects, but also suggests that
simulations could be used to improve and adapt

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.170
real swarms of unspecialized robots to specific
tasks.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.870
The IceCube Observatory in Antartica has confirmed
the existence of cosmic neutrinos. Neutrinos

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.139
are high energy particles that are nearly
impossible to detect due to their ability

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.060
to pass through almost anything unaffected.
Detecting cosmic neutrinos is important because

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.189
they’re able to carry information across
the universe, like the origins of high energy

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.560
cosmic rays, and can even alert us to the
presence of supernovae before they’re visible

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.570
from earth.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.560
The climate engineering firm transpolar has
create a membrane that could cool entire cities.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.470
These photonic membranes reflect incoming
sunlight back into space and convert the heat

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.780
into infrared light without the use of electricity
or water. They could be used to cool large

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.260
areas sustainably, and there’s currently
an installation in Paris showcasing it that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.200
runs until October 4th.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.891
The solar sunflower is a hyper efficient way
of harnessing solar energy.&nbsp;With an energy

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:43.870
efficiency of 80% it uses a liquid cooling
system to draw heat away from the solar collectors

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.180
so that it doesn't overheat. A single device
could power 2- 4 houses, but as of now concerns

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.510
over its cost and functionality without direct
sunlight could keep it from seeing commercial

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.510
use.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.760
Real Virtuality combines motion capture technology
with VR headsets. It allows for multiple users

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.120
to interact with a virtual environment and
each other in real time. The rendering of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.930
the environment happens so quickly that two
users can toss a torch to each other without

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.440
having to remove their headsets. This represents
a huge step in virtual reality gaming and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.770
could also change the way soldiers, firefighters
and many other professions are trained.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.040
Researchers at the University of San Diego
have created 3D-printed microscopic fish.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.260
Designed for medical purposes these microfish
use iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.730
in their head and tail to change direction
and speed.&nbsp; They’re chemically powered,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.560
magnetically steered and could be used to
deliver medicine to different parts of the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.850
body or to sense and remove toxins.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.200
Meanwhile, researchers at Penn State have
created a polymer that self heals when it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.370
comes into contact with water. And it’s
made with genes from a squid. The team found

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.930
that squid teeth possess self-healing proteins
which they were able to replicate in the lab.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.530
And they hope to use this to create underwater
fiberoptic cables that can be repaired because

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.810
currently if one breaks the cable must be
completely replaced.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.690
Finally, MIT has invented a 3D printer that
can print ten different materials simultaneously.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.260
With Multifab you integrate these two worlds
of traditional manufacturing and 3D printing

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.190
and by putting them together you can create
a whole new range of objects that we haven't

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.220
been able to make today.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:05:04.180
I’m going to leave you printing glass. And
as always - thanks for watching.
