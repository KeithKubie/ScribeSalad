you felt really well about the fact that
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.490
you felt really well about the fact that
people actually building stuff they

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
people actually building stuff they
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.830
people actually building stuff they
weren't able to build before or not in

you know influence the roadmap and what
 

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.210
you know influence the roadmap and what
you guys are doing with angular there's

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.220
you guys are doing with angular there's
 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.180
you guys are doing with angular there's
a clash with what you've done already oh

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.190
a clash with what you've done already oh
 

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.529
a clash with what you've done already oh
so we actually talked about in our

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:16.539
so we actually talked about in our
 

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:19.230
so we actually talked about in our
future of angular talk and how we would

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240
future of angular talk and how we would
 

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.240
future of angular talk and how we would
like to be on top of it and how web web

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.250
like to be on top of it and how web web

yes the other thing you talked about was
how you like for developers to be able

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000
how you like for developers to be able
 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.990
how you like for developers to be able
to use parts of angular without kind of

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000
to use parts of angular without kind of
 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.519

dragging the whole thing so maybe just a

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:02.529
dragging the whole thing so maybe just a

angular into smaller pieces each focused

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:19.870
angular into smaller pieces each focused
 

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.990
angular into smaller pieces each focused
on one particular task for example that

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000
on one particular task for example that

you mentioned the dependency injection

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079
you mentioned the dependency injection
 

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.530
you mentioned the dependency injection
there is no reason why depends injection

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.540
there is no reason why depends injection
 

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.480
there is no reason why depends injection
needs to be built into angular we can

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.490
needs to be built into angular we can
 

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.949
needs to be built into angular we can
just extract it create a separate

just extract it create a separate
 

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.690
just extract it create a separate
library out of it and then use it in

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:30.700
library out of it and then use it in
 

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.970
library out of it and then use it in
angular but you can also use it without

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:32.980
angular but you can also use it without
 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.340
angular but you can also use it without
angular in node.js application or some

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.350
angular in node.js application or some
 

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.880

one of the big announcements here was
dart wonder oh I hear there's an

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:23.970
dart wonder oh I hear there's an
 

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.350
dart wonder oh I hear there's an
intersection with a regular you got a

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360
intersection with a regular you got a
 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.879

bedroom with what happened there so we

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:28.889
bedroom with what happened there so we
 

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:30.319

would like you to have a choice in which

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:30.329
would like you to have a choice in which
 

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:32.449
would like you to have a choice in which
language you want to use and in

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:32.459
language you want to use and in
 

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:34.519
language you want to use and in
JavaScript you have a coffee script

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:34.529
JavaScript you have a coffee script
 

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:35.870
JavaScript you have a coffee script
answer I know all these are semantically

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880
answer I know all these are semantically
 

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.309
answer I know all these are semantically
coolant to JavaScript so you can just

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:37.319
coolant to JavaScript so you can just
 

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:39.439
coolant to JavaScript so you can just
use them angularjs out of the box with

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:39.449
use them angularjs out of the box with
 

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:41.329
use them angularjs out of the box with
them but don't lisa is semantically a

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339
them but don't lisa is semantically a
 

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.699
them but don't lisa is semantically a
little different and so we actually made

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:43.709
little different and so we actually made
 

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.559
little different and so we actually made
a port of angular on top of dart and

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:45.569
a port of angular on top of dart and
 

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:47.300
a port of angular on top of dart and
it's actually used internally at Google

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:47.310
it's actually used internally at Google
 

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.790
it's actually used internally at Google
so it's there's real apps running on it

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800
so it's there's real apps running on it
 

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.280
so it's there's real apps running on it
I supposed to just hypothetical right

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.290
I supposed to just hypothetical right
 

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.430
I supposed to just hypothetical right
introduction at Google yeah yesterday so

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440
introduction at Google yeah yesterday so
 

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.829
introduction at Google yeah yesterday so
Google currently we run both the dart

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839
Google currently we run both the dart
 

00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:00.860
Google currently we run both the dart
applications and JavaScript occasions so

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:00.870
applications and JavaScript occasions so
 

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.100
applications and JavaScript occasions so
because one thing that we see is that

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.110
because one thing that we see is that
 

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.290
because one thing that we see is that
language is such a sensitive topic among

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300
