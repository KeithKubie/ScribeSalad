WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
The Joe Rogan experience.
Do you know the Hylo came,
uh,

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.600
not enough to really play it,
but,
um,

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.750
I spent a little bit of time pick him,
picking the brains of people who are good.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.440
Yeah,
I like it.
I enjoy it.
Yeah.
I think I can,

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.420
I think I could actually get pretty good at it.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.750
It's like the basics of it seems pretty simple.

7
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.050
It's just a matter of like getting comfortable there because I feel like my

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.940
knees are just,
I don't want to risk it,
you know what I mean?
Oh,

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.140
let's play this game a little bit.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.960
But if I find a partner that's not an asshole,

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
just like really wants to like learn together or whatever,
then I'll,
I'll do it.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.950
I'll go after it.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
Do you ever see yourself doing Jujitsu matches or anything like that?
Yeah,

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.370
I've only done maybe three of my life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:52.371
I did one my last year as competition was probably two years ago,

16
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.270
two and a half years ago.
Naga,
just like,
it was a random,

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.000
just like a random like,
oh,
okay,
I'll do not go today.
Well,

18
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:04.830
there are some MMA fighters that are at a high enough level of grappling that

19
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.510
they can compete against really elite grapplers and Jiu Jitsu matches,

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
you know,
like,
um,
Chad Mendez member,
he had that,
um,

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
that match with,
um,
Jeff,
fuck,

22
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:22.500
why am I blanking on his name?
Not Jeff Glover.
Jeff Glover.
Really?
Yeah,

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.390
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
I think he choked him out.
And thank you.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.390
Chad Mendez choked out.
Yeah.
Jeff Glover,

25
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.340
I think he took his back and tapped him.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

26
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.050
I think they were using the Eddie Bravo,

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.730
uh,
invitational rules.
Makes,
make sure that's true.
Ah,

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.100
which you start on someone's back.
Yeah.
You know,

29
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:48.780
and over time you go to a certain distance.
Is that Chael Sonnen Schmidt is,

30
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.170
it's chill Sonance organization,
in which case,
I'm pretty sure they use a,

31
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.360
the Ebi rules.

32
00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.470
So he got his back through sort of on one of those over time positions,

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.990
but he still tapped him.
And the other one is Uriah faber.

34
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.760
Uriah favors pretty fucking elite.

35
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.220
Pretty fucking elite like Jen Glover's animal.
Oh my God,
I love that guy.

36
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.740
Super,
super technical.
You know?

37
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.050
And very dangerous and relaxed.
Right.
Big Time stoner.

38
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah.
So they must have set him up on his back.

39
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.940
This doesn't show it.
It just shows them how the back man,

40
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.130
that's a hell of a fucking ruined egg.

41
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:32.310
And right there that works all day on everybody.
Even a Jeff Glover.
Wow.

42
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.090
That's why Jiu Jitsu works,
you know,
it'll,
if you're a lead it'll work.

43
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.200
Save your ass.
Yeah.
Three by overtime submission.

44
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:44.600
So we were correct.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's this,

45
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
so there's a few guys,
but it's really hard to be the master of everything.
Right?

46
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.180
Yeah,
for sure.
So for you,
is there a balance where you're like,

47
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.840
am I spending enough time grappling?
Am I spending enough time striking?
Do you,

48
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.841
do you ever like wonder what the correct formula is or do you with it at all?

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.730
I have wondered and I always wonder,
but

50
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.440
I can't like so a long time ago,

51
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.620
maybe like a few years ago,
Anderson told me like,
listen,

52
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.050
just you need Jujitsu.
Like you need it.
He's like,
it saved my life.

53
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.830
I love to strike too.
But when I learned Jujitsu,
it changed my life.

54
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.950
So you need to learn it.
Put on a g,
let's roll.

55
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.980
Like you're right there in the living room,
you know?
And I was just like,
okay.

56
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.320
So one of the things that I learned from him is just,
he's like,

57
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.140
learn the basic stuff,
like learn the basic stuff,
get really good at it,

58
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.243
and then,

59
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.210
and then like use it to save yourself and you'll,
you'll end up growing.

60
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.860
He's like,
just keep training Jujitsu.

61
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.540
You don't need this whole crazy secret system at the moment.

62
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.590
Just make sure that you're training Jujitsu and continue to learn Jujitsu.

63
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.480
You know,
like,
so that's kind of my takeaway from the conversation.

64
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.010
So I just make sure that when I'm training,
at least I'm doing Jujitsu,

65
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.330
you know,
like I focus on it,
make sure that I'm getting better,

66
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.450
make sure that I'm going with guys that are way better than me.

67
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.830
So I'm always getting my ass kicked by.

68
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:23.120
At least I'm always going with guys that are better than me all the time.
Um,

69
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.540
and like I enjoy it,
but I'm a striker.
That's it.
Like I enjoy it,

70
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.890
I know that I need it.
It's my job.

71
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.980
I know that it can get dangerous if I go against,
you know,

72
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.530
if I go against the guy was a high level Jujitsu.
I know that,

73
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.190
I understand that and I'm very aware of it every time that I trained and I,

74
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.540
so I make sure that I do my job and I go to Jujitsu class,

75
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.300
but I'm a striker and I'm always going to be focused on,

76
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.110
that's always going to be what?
Like my Goto,
anybody,

77
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.410
whether it's a strike or a grappler,
I don't care.

78
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.840
I'm going to train striking and I'm going to train Jujitsu too,

79
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.670
but I'm going into my striking always.

80
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.880
Do you think that that is like you letting everybody know,

81
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.100
are you trying to trick people and then next,

82
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.850
next fight you're going to shoot on folks.
Oh,
I don't need the shoe.

83
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.090
I'll shoot if I need to.
Like if I'm getting my ass kicked in,

84
00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:16.370
I need to take a desperation shot.

85
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.690
But you would rather just let them know that you're coming out striking because

86
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.230
one of the things that I believe you do and you're very good at it,

87
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.190
but one of the things that's interesting about real high level MMA,

88
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:29.470
when you look at the guys who were bent,

89
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.960
who've been like legendarily successful like George Saint Pierre or mighty
mouse,

90
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.250
two great examples.

91
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.460
One of the things is you never knew what the fuck they're going to do to you and

92
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:41.030
that overloading the mind with possibilities is a part of their success.

93
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:43.400
It's like how much of a part,
it's a good question.

94
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.350
Do you think that there's an argument for using the skills that you have which

95
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:53.351
are quite spectacular with that sort of style sort of style that incorporates

96
00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:54.950
way more take downs,

97
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.840
way more take down attempts way more just just different combinations of things.

98
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.780
So you never know what the fuck is happening at any given time or do you think

99
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.770
that it's better to just be the best striker you can and that'll be enough?

100
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.730
You stop those take downs.
That'll be enough for me.

101
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.800
For you or just in general?
For you,
for you?

102
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.010
I think for me it would be the best to just

103
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.430
be the best striker because you enjoy it that much more.

104
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.920
I enjoy it that much more.
Um,

105
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.290
you know,
I think,

106
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.920
<v 2>yeah,</v>

107
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.290
<v 0>yeah,
I enjoy that much more.
I still have a lot to learn,</v>

108
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.920
a lot to grow so that it's always going to get better.
I don't think that it's,

109
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.010
<v 2>yeah,</v>

110
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.140
<v 0>I don't think that's going to get bad.
I'm still learning a lot.</v>

111
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.030
Especially what you guys got to see like a few weeks ago.
Right.

112
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.920
That's only the beginning.
Like everything,
even before that was like

113
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.840
nonexistent compared to like the type of training that I've been doing.

114
00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:54.560
So I'm like,
I'm really excited.
So I'm like,
ah,

115
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.150
boy ties a lot more than just punch kicks and elbows,
you know?
And that's,

116
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.950
that's all the striking.
It's a mind game.
It's infatuated by it right now.
Yeah.

117
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:08.820
You just want to focus on 100%.
Yeah.
Like there's guys like,

118
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.280
uh,
think about like Michael Vinton page,
right?

119
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.230
Like before he fought like Paul Daley,

120
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.410
I'm sure that guy trains a lot of grappling as well.

121
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.490
And it shows like if he gets in positions,
like he's knocked out guys from weird,

122
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.190
weird positions,
but when people watch him fight,

123
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.790
they want to see like they trust in his stand up.
They're like,
oh,

124
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:31.530
this guy's going to do some crazy stuff.
Yeah.

125
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.540
And I kind of want to be able to do the same thing.
Not Crazy,

126
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:40.680
like,
you know,
worldly stuff.
But when people watch me fight,

127
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.250
they know what to expect.
And that's just like bulletproof striking.
