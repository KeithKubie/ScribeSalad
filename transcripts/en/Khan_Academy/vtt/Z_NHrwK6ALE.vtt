00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's see if we can divide
5.005 by-- let's divide it by 7,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.430
and see what we get.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:21.390
So we can rewrite this
as 5.005 divided by 7.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.704
And the key here is to
keep track of the decimal.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:25.120
But other than
that, you're really

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.920
treating it like a traditional
long division problem.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.300
So you want to put
the decimal, it's

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.250
to the right of the ones place.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770
So it's right over there.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.002
I just put the decimal
right above the decimal.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.460
And now we would
treat it just like

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.720
a traditional long
division problem.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.625
So how many times
does 7 go into 5?

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.580
Well, it goes into
5 zero times, and we

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.849
could write 0 times 7 is 0.

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:49.390
Actually, let's do
that, just to show

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.710
that it works to kind of do the
process all the way through.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.540
0 times 7 is 0.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.450
You subtract, you get 5.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.980
So you get this 5
right over here.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.830
So you get 5, and then we
can bring down another 0.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.530
We bring down this
0 right over here.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.260
So now we ask ourselves, how
many times does 7 go into 50?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.760
Well, 7 times 7 is 49, so
it's going to go seven times.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.110
7 times 7, 49.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.770
Subtract, you get 1.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.140
And now we can
bring down this 0.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.570
Let's do that.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.540
We bring down that 0.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.280
7 goes into 10 one time.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.100
1 times 7 is 7.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.320
Subtract, get a 3.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
And now finally, we
can bring down this 5.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.320
We can bring down the 5.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.940
And we ask ourselves, how
many times does 7 go into 35?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.740
Well, 5 times 7 is 35.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.760
This goes 5 times.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.270
5 times 7 is 35.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.030
Subtract, and we are done.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.370
We have divided it completely.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:02.360
And so 5.005 divided
by 7 is equal to 0.715.
