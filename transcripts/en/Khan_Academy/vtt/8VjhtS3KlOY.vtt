00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:03.673
- [Voiceover] If I were to
give you the fraction 1/3,

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:05.090
I could rewrite it.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.876
If I multiply both the numerator
and the denominator by two,

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:12.089
one times two is two, and
three times two is six.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.446
So we know that 1/3 is
the same thing as 2/6.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.781
This is true, 1/3 is just
another way of saying 2/6.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.599
Now given that we know that,

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.191
which of these, I guess you could say,

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:27.844
picture equations actually
show us that that is true?

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:29.947
Show that to us visually?

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:31.443
We could start with this first one.

00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:33.046
We have three equal sections,

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:35.344
so each of these sections are 1/3.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.665
And we have one of those 1/3 shaded in.

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:41.822
If we go on the right side,
we have six equal sections,

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:46.373
so it's divided into 1/6, and
we have two of them shaded in.

00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:48.347
One, two.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:52.178
And the important thing
to realize, is over here,

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:54.593
we divided the same rectangle to the 1/3

00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:56.579
as we divided into 1/6 over here.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.224
We are comparing fractions
of the same whole.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:03.963
So you see that if you were to
take these two magenta boxes

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:07.327
and put them together, they
actually do have the same area

00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:11.973
as this one larger rectangle.

00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:15.820
So this one looks like a
good picture explanation

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.930
or a visual explanation for
why 1/3 is equal to 2/6.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.390
You take the same rectangle,
divide it into 1/3

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.640
and take one of them, and
then you take that same exact

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.311
rectangle, divide it into
1/6 and pick two of them,

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.119
you have shaded in the same amount.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.597
1/3 over here is the same thing

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.357
as 2/6 over here.

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:39.388
The important thing to
realize is that you're taking

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:43.196
1/3 and 2/6 of the exact same rectangle.

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:45.495
When you look over at these figures,

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:49.442
you see that this is 1/3 of
this figure right over here.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.470
It's split into three equal sections,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.536
and this is one of them that's shaded in.

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:58.293
And this is, right over here, 2/6.

00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:02.415
You have six equal sections and
we've shaded in two of them.

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:05.518
And we know that 1/3 is equal to 2/6,

00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:08.025
but this picture isn't true.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:10.440
This shaded area right over here

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.412
is less than this shaded area over here.

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.154
So you say, "Why doesn't it work?

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:18.381
"Why isn't this 1/3
the same thing as 2/6?"

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:22.700
Because you're taking 2/6
of a larger hexagon here.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.161
Here, you're taking 1/3
of a smaller figure.

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.785
Here, you're taking
2/6 of a larger figure.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:31.569
You can't compare fractions
of different wholes.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.192
2/6 of a larger whole
is going to be larger

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:37.281
than 1/3 of a smaller whole.

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.363
The only time that 1/3 and
2/6 are going to be equivalent

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:44.131
is if they are of the same
whole, like we saw up here.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.314
So this is not true.

00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:50.400
And for the same reason,
this right over here is 1/3

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.629
and this over here is 2/6.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.064
This is 1/3 of a smaller
circle than this 2/6 is.

00:02:57.064 --> 00:02:58.945
So this is not true.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:03.078
By that same logic, we have
these other pictures over here.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.732
And over here, we're not
talking about 1/3 and 2/6.

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:07.907
Here, we're talking about,
let's see, splitting something

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:11.227
into one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:12.992
So we're talking about
1/8, and in this case,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:16.638
it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, 6/8,

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:18.216
and we're comparing it,
let's see over here,

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:21.277
they're dividing into four
and they've shaded in three.

00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:25.453
Now it is true that 6/8 is equal to 3/4.

00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:27.636
Six divided by two is three.

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:30.213
Eight divided by two is four.

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:33.951
So if you multiply or divide
the numerator by the exact

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:38.107
same thing, then you're going
to get an equivalent fraction.

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:42.565
Now 6/8 is equal to 3/4,
but this picture isn't true

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.794
because 6/8 would be equal to 3/4

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:47.616
if you're talking about taking 6/8 and 3/4

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:50.459
of the same size, in this case, diamond.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.247
These things are not the same size,

00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:54.523
so you can't make this picture statement.

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:56.404
Same thing for this one over here.

00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.099
These circles are of different sizes.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.674
So taking the same fraction
of different sizes,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.049
you can't say that
they're going to be equal.

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.225
This last one, you're taking

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.222
the fractions of the same whole.

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:12.401
It's kind of this weird
left-pointing arrow-looking shape,

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:14.282
but they are the same shape.

00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:17.533
And you see here, we've
divided that shape into 1/8,

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.638
and we have shaded in six of them.

00:04:19.638 --> 00:04:22.786
One, two, let me do that in
a yellow so you can see it.

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:26.070
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.691
Over here, we have divided it into 1/4,

00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:34.506
and we have shaded in three of them.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.197
So this statement is true.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:41.585
We already knew that 6/8
and 3/4 are the same thing,

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:46.114
but this picture right over
here visually shows us that,

00:04:46.114 --> 00:04:48.485
because we're taking 6/8 of the same whole

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:50.937
as we're taking 3/4 of
it, and you see that here.

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:55.327
This area, let me shade
it in a different color.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:57.997
So the area that I'm shading in,

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:02.218
six of these triangles

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:06.757
with equal area is the same thing as three

00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:09.516
of these parallelograms,
or three of the four.

00:05:09.516 --> 00:05:12.154
These have the same
area, you could see that.

00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:16.618
One of these, like that
one right over there,

00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:20.611
could be equivalent to this over here,

00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:23.112
equivalent to that over there.

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.880
Actually, let me do that for all of them.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.235
This one over here

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:30.990
could be equivalent to, let's see,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.219
if you were to flip it
over, it would be equivalent

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.727
to that over there.

00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:39.465
And finally, I think you
see where this is going,

00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:43.734
this one over here is equivalent

00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.820
to this one over here.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.606
So we have the same fraction shaded in.

00:05:48.606 --> 00:05:51.918
We just divided the one on the
left into more equal pieces

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.928
than we did on the right but
these are equivalent fractions.

00:05:53.928 --> 00:05:58.085
And this picture shows us that
6/8 is, indeed, equal to 3/4.

00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.453
Once again, 6/8 of the same whole

00:06:00.453 --> 00:06:04.159
is equal to 3/4 of that same whole.
