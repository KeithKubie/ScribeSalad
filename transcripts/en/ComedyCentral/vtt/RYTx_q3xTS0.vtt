00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.903
Alaska's weird science plot
gone wrong

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.705
Sarah Palin is back in the news

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.807
after emerging from her
bear trap to inform America

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.675
that she's as much
as scientist as Bill Nye.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.177
(imitating Palin):
Don't ya know?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.946
-The guy who's got "science"
in part of his name. -(laughter)

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.182
So the Internet naturally
flipped out. But you know what?

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.184
Let's give her
the benefit of the doubt

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.086
and compare their résumés.
Bill Nye spent

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.188
over 30 years working
in the field of science

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.623
with companies
like Boeing and NASA.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.091
Sarah Palin spent over 30 years

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.560
working in the fields of Alaska
hunting for big foots.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:30.063
-(laughter) -So, let's pretend
for a second maybe she knows

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.999
what she's talking about.
Comedians, what are some

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.334
Sarah Palin science facts?
Steve Agee.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.539
Uh, the front crack is pink,
and the back crack is brown.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.841
(laughter)

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.843
Suck it, Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.279
-(laughter, applause
and cheering) -HARDWICK: Right?

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.214
Um, interesting.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.183
Yeah, I think the, uh...

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.885
the science checks out on that.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.556
-Joints. Uh, Doug.
-Yeah.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.226
<i>The Jungle Book</i> is the greatest
documentary of the year.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.128
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
Joints to Doug Benson.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.763
(applause and cheering)

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.064
Tyler.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.299
(imitating Palin):
The reason the sky is blue

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.334
is because
God is sad about the gays.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:07.434
-HARDWICK: All right joints,
joints. -(laughter)
