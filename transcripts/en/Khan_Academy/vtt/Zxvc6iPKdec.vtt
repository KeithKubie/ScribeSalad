00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's say that I've just
won some type of contest

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.210
at a car dealership,
and they're going

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.029
to give me a brand new car.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.900
And in deciding which
car they give me,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.850
they're first going to randomly
select the engine type.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.740
So the engine will come in
two different varieties.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.000
It'll either be a four-cylinder
or a six-cylinder engine.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.370
And they're literally just
going to flip a fair coin

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.720
to decide whether I get
a four-cylinder engine

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.280
or a six-cylinder engine.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.070
Then they're going
to pick the color.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.800
And there's four different
colors that the cars come in.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.340
So I'll write color
in a neutral color.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.800
So you could get a red car.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.070
That's not red.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.910
Let me do that in actual
red color, or close to red.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.580
You could get a red car,
you could get a blue car,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:58.730
you could get a green car,
or you could get a white car.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.532
And once again, they're going
to have the red, blue, green,

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.365
and white in little
slips of paper in a bowl

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.323
and they're just going
to pick one of them out.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:09.227
So all of these
are equally likely.

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.810
So given this, that
they're just going

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.226
to flip a coin to
pick the engine,

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:16.100
and that all of these, the
colors all equally likely,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.970
I want to think
about the probability

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.130
of getting a
six-cylinder white car.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.840
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.070
and think about it on your own.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.520
Well, one way to
think about this

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.640
is, well, what are
all the equally likely

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.300
possible outcomes?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.020
And then which of those
match six-cylinder white car?

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.920
Well, first, we could think
about the engine decision.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.580
We're either going to get
a four-cylinder engine.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.370
So the first decision
is the engine.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.170
You could view it that way.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.253
You're either going to get
a four-cylinder engine,

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:51.000
or you're going to get
a six-cylinder engine.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.350
Now, if you got a
four-cylinder engine,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:04.890
you're either going to get
red, blue, green, or white.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.440
And if you've got a
six-cylinder engine,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.220
once again, you're
either going to get red,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.480
blue-- I think you see
where this is going.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.080
That's not blue.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.835
Red, blue, green, or white.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.060
So how many possible
outcomes are there?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.505
Well, you could just count.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:35.880
You could kind of
say, the leaves

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.710
of this tree diagram-- one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.010
eight possible outcomes.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.240
And that makes sense.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.702
You have two possible engines
times four possible colors.

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:47.160
You see that right
here-- one group

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.330
of four, two groups of four.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.530
So this outcome right here
is a four-cylinder blue car.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.720
And this outcome over here
is a six-cylinder green car.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.950
So there's eight equally
possible outcomes.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.400
And which outcome matches
the one that we, I guess,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.427
are hoping for, the
white six-cylinder car?

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:06.010
Well, that's this
one right over here.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.420
It's one of eight
equally likely events.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.427
So we have a 1/8 probability.

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:12.010
This wasn't the only
way that we could

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.596
have drawn the tree diagram.

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:14.970
We could have
thought about color

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.812
as the first row of this tree.

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:18.520
So we could have said,
look, we're either

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.290
going to get a-- let
me do it down here,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.330
so I have a little more
space-- we're either

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.710
going to get a red, a
blue-- that's not blue.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.150
Changing colors
is the hard part.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:44.520
A blue, a green, or a white car.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.080
And then for each
of those colors,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.910
I'm either going to get a
four-cylinder or a six-cylinder

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.650
engine.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.135
So it's either going
to be four or six.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.680
This would be another way
of drawing a tree diagram

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.604
to represent all
of the outcomes.

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.270
So what is this outcome
right over here?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.390
This is a six-cylinder red car.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.000
This is a four-cylinder
blue car right over here.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.529
Which is the one
that we care about?

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.930
White six-cylinder car?

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.490
That's this outcome
right over here.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.610
Once again, you see you have
eight equally likely outcomes.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.340
And that happens because you
have four possible colors.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.390
And for each of those
four possible colors,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.770
you have two different
engine types.
