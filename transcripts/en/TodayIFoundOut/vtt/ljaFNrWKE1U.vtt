Why Does Red Meat Turn Brown When Cooked?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.570
This is thanks to a protein called myoglobin,
which also is what makes the raw red meat

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.540
look red, not blood, as many people think.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.150
Myoglobin is a protein that stores oxygen
in muscle cells, very similar to its cousin,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.430
hemoglobin, which stores oxygen in red blood
cells.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.240
This oxygen store is necessary for muscles
which need immediate oxygen for energy during

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.649
continual usage.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.220
So how does the myoglobin end up making the
meat turn brown when cooked?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.690
This darkening effect is due to the oxidation
state of the iron atoms in myoglobin.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.539
When the myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, before
you cook the meat, the iron atom oxidation

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.149
level is +2 and it is bound to a dioxygen
molecule (O2), which makes the meat appear

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.249
bright red.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.620
As you cook the meat, this iron atom loses
an electron and goes to a +3 oxidation level

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.280
with this process ending up turning the meat
brown.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
White meat, on the other hand, doesn’t turn
dark brown like red meat because it has significantly

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.160
less myoglobin in it.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.420
In fact, the myoglobin levels are actually
one of the main factors that officially distinguish

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.890
white meat from red meat.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.970
Bonus Facts:

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.690
Contrary to popular belief, “searing”
meat does not in any way “seal the juices

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.690
in”.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.510
Water in seared meat evaporates at either
the same rate or a higher rate, in some cases,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.230
than non-seared meat.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.990
What searing does do is play a role in browning,
which can affect the flavor.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.440
But, in this case, the browning is caused
by caramelization of sugars combined with

00:01:38.440 --> 00:02:02.130
a chemical reaction with amino acids and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.500
the sugars.
