00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:01.359
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.862
in this video is get some practice

00:00:02.862 --> 00:00:05.737
estimating adding decimals.

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:09.504
Here it says 12.93 plus 6.1

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:12.234
is approximately equal to,

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.881
this little squiggly equal
sign means approximately

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.561
equal to, so try to estimate
this and pick the right choice.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.012
Pause the video and try to do that.

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:23.150
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.103
We could work this out by
hand, but the whole goal here

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:29.761
is estimation, so if I were
doing this in my head I'd say,

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.928
well, look, 12.93 is a
little bit less than 13,

00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:38.680
and 6.1 is a little bit more than six.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.132
And it's actually nice because
when I rounded I went down

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:45.793
on this number and I
went up on this number.

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:48.706
I went up 700ths to get to 13

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:51.540
and I went down 1/10th to
get to six, so I feel good

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.630
when I add them up that we're
going to get pretty close

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.224
to the actual answer.

00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:58.773
13 plus six is equal
to 19, and lucky for us

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:00.905
that that is one of the choices.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:05.104
There's multiple ways that you
could try to estimate things.

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:08.360
For example, you could do a
little finer of an estimation.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.869
You'd say, this is
approximately 12.9 plus 6.1,

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.965
and then you'd say, 12 plus
six is 18, and then, 9/10ths

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:20.315
plus 1/10th is another one,
so you'd say this is 18

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:23.284
plus one, and you'd say,
okay, that, once again gets me

00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:26.608
pretty close to 19,
or, this gets me to 19.

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:28.258
Let's do another example.

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:32.810
Here we're told five plus one plus 4.91

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.385
is approximately equal to
what, so, pause this video

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:37.883
and see if you can figure that out.

00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:41.403
Try to estimate it, try to
do it without any paper.

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:44.334
The way I would do it is
actually very similar to the way

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:45.844
we just did the last one.

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:49.671
5.1 is approximately equal to five,

00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.207
and,

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:54.151
is approximately equal
to five, and 4.91 is also

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:56.043
approximately equal to five.

00:01:56.043 --> 00:01:58.643
I rounded to the nearest
whole number in either case,

00:01:58.643 --> 00:02:02.874
and so, that would be equal to 10.

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:06.069
Once again, it makes sense
because we rounded down here

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.838
and we rounded up here, we
rounded down to go from 5.1

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.083
to five, and we rounded up to go

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:14.724
from 4.91 to five.

00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:18.082
If you're rounding down in
both cases, or rounding up

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:21.624
in both cases your estimate
might get a little bit further

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.833
from your actual answer,
so you might want to be

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.755
a little bit careful.

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:28.291
Alright, so in this last
example, once again,

00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.101
pause the video and see if you can

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:31.709
work through it on your own.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.353
We're just going to do
the same thing here.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.368
This is going to be approximately equal

00:02:35.368 --> 00:02:38.892
to three plus, I rounded down, 3.14,

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.751
rounded to the nearest
whole number, three.

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:44.085
5.92 rounded to the nearest
whole number is six.

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:46.431
And once again, just like I
mentioned in the previous ones,

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.747
this is good because I am rounding down

00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:53.160
from 3.14 to three, I took away 1400ths,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.966
and I add 800ths to 5.92,

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.632
so it's going to get me reasonably close

00:02:57.632 --> 00:03:00.927
to my actual answer, and
so, three plus six is equal

00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:04.442
to nine, which is, indeed,
one of the answers here.

00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:06.085
And this is actually
interesting, you're not always

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.646
going to see a multiple
choice, so if you're trying

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.500
to estimate things, but in
this case, you know that just

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.055
three plus five is going
to be eight, and so this

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:15.610
can't be the choice.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.343
Then you're going to have
eight plus whatever 1400ths

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:22.714
plus 9200ths is, and you
know that's more than one,

00:03:22.714 --> 00:03:26.147
so you know our answer's going
to be a little bit over nine.

00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:29.510
Once again, nine is a good approximation.
