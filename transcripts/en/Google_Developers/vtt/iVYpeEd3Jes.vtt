[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
Emily, one thing before we

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
get started are
talking about Flutter,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.616
I noticed when I looked
at our internal site

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.740
and I was doing a little
bit of research about you,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.830
your job title was
chief meme officer.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.000
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.340
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What's with that?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.840
EMILY FORTUNA: So
internally, Google

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170
has a culture of creating--
we call them memes,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.020
technically image macros,
to joke about and comment

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.080
about things that are going
on internally in the company.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.930
And amongst our team I have
done more than my fair share,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.470
so my manager started calling
me the chief meme officer,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.140
and I'm now tasked with
keeping the team up

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.272
to date on trends in
the company about memes.

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:46.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.440
I mean, I love memes, both
inside and outside of Google,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.940
of course we have
them outside, too.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.870
So I have to watch out
for some of your memes.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.860
So when you're
not meming, you're

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.193
also a software engineer, right?

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:55.290
You're working on Flutter?

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.540
EMILY FORTUNA: Dart, actually.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Dart, oh.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.710
So Flutter, Dart, how do
they all work together?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.543
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:02.280
Dart is the programming
language that Flutter is then

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.540
built on top of.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.739
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.300
EMILY FORTUNA: And I've been
on the Dart team for quite a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.550
while Dart is about
six years old,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.080
and when it was
originally created,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
it was intended to be a
web programming language.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.100
I personally work on the
Dart to JavaScript compiler,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
so if you want to deploy a
Dart application on the web,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.330
we will be assisting
you with that.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.049
But as Dart has evolved, and
there's many more use cases

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.090
aside from just the web--

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.770
I mean, internally
in the team, we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
use it as just a general
sort of scripting language--

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.670
and then Dart has also
been applied to mobile.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.550
And I'm super excited
about how Flutter

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.600
is using it to basically
deploy on iOS and Android

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.290
as mobile applications.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: So tell
me a little bit about Dart

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.170
as a language.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.190
Like what's exciting?

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.356
What's interesting about it?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
EMILY FORTUNA: So I find
it is a very approachable

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.830
scripting style language.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.930
It is syntactically
pretty similar

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.830
to things like Java,
JavaScript, that sort of thing.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.750
When I first came
to the Dart team--

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.170
because Dart hadn't
been created yet,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.700
I obviously didn't
know Dart, but I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.600
found it very easy to pick up.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.970
It's designed to
be very familiar.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.360
And I just programmed kind of
like generic C-ish language,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.820
and it worked, and then once
you got familiar with that,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.900
you can move on.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.150
There's lots of nice idioms
and it makes it very concise.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.270
It has some functional
components, as well, that are--

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: So now
I can use all of that,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.670
and with Dart to JS,
I can spit out JS code

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.130
and run it on a browser?

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.940
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.850
Yes, you can deploy so it
can run on Firefox, anywhere

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.650
on the web.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.400
And what's cool about
how Dart was designed

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.110
is it is well-suited for
being both JIT-ed and ahead

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.000
of time compiled.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.970
And so a little
compiler lesson, if--

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.990
I don't know how
up on compilers--

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.890
so basically you
have interpreters

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.290
on your extreme end
of the spectrum,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.350
literally going token by
token and executing as you go.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.130
You have ahead of time
completion for C++ and those

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.640
sorts of things,
run GCC, get x86.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.280
And then JIT-ING is in between.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.770
You're like, oh, I'm running
this particular function

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.400
a whole lot.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.720
I need to optimize it.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.360
I'll compile that little
chunk into machine code.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.610
And the cool thing
with JIT-ing is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.400
it gives a really nice
developer experience,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.090
so it's kind of webby in,
like, you save your file

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.090
and it goes and updates.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.830
Flutter takes that webby style
of development, where you just,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.870
like, I'm going to
build a button, save,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.180
and then it appears.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.480
And then, because Dart also
can be ahead of time compiled,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.010
we compile it down
to native ARM code

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.590
and it will be super smooth
and super performance.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.390
So it's pretty much like have
your cake and eat it too.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.339
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I
can see you're clearly

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.650
excited about Flutter and
how Dart fits in with it.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.820
And one of the things--

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.610
I did an interview with
Eric, and he was telling me

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.230
about how Flutter
has been designed

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.750
to run on the metal,
and something that

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.730
came to mind with me
was that it might make

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.740
it a lot easier for learning.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.570
EMILY FORTUNA: That
is an area that I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.930
think has not yet
been explored enough,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.540
but I think it has
a lot of potential.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.660
When you are learning just
computer science in general,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.220
or if you're doing
mobile app development,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.590
obviously you're going
to be making mistakes.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.590
And with hot
reloading, you can--

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.870
particularly with mobile,
you can see the part

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.130
that's working and not.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.890
And so you're like, OK, well,
I need to add this button

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.010
and I messed up a semi-colon.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.554
This little chunk is
broken, but oh, I'll

00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:08.970
just hot reload
rather than having

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.510
to wait, build, and
then like, oh, this

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.980
is a couple of screens in.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.050
I have to find it.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.020
It's just there.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've run
code labs, and a lot of times,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.800
particularly for people
who are learning something

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.480
for the first time,
and it's hard enough

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.486
to get someone to
understand, OK, this is code.

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:25.360
But you've got to get
them, OK, this is code,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.380
and now I'm compiling it,
and now I'm deploying it,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.800
and now the
emulator's booting up,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.890
and now the application is
loading in the emulator,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.160
and now the debugger
is booting up.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.720
And there's all those
concepts that they

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.678
have to learn before they
can see their button.

00:05:35.678 --> 00:05:37.830
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, and
that aren't even related

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.152
to the idea of algorithms.

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:41.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.320
EMILY FORTUNA: So just
eliminate that stuff.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: It was
great stuff to learn,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.530
but you probably don't
want to on day one.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.912
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah, you
don't need it on day one.

00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:50.370
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So the whole idea

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.424
of being able to,
like you say, just

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.840
I want a button and the button
is just there without going

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.092
through all that compiling,
it's pretty cool.

00:05:57.092 --> 00:05:58.800
EMILY FORTUNA: It's
instant gratification

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.467
for programmers, basically.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:01.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.440
So that, to me,
would be the hook.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.090
That hooks me into
Flutter, thinking,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.090
I got to check this out.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.714
I got to kick the
tires on this and see

00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:09.990
if it suits me as a developer.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.570
Are there any other cool
things about it that

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.140
would help you as a developer?

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.130
EMILY FORTUNA: So if
you are a web developer,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.780
Dart is a great segue-- or
Flutter is a great segue,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.440
because you can take what
you know, if you know Dart,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.080
and then develop in mobile.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.260
And it's a very familiar
development experience.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.330
Then the cross-platform
thing is amazing, too.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.690
So Flutter takes care of
compiling your code to iOS

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.620
and Android, so you
don't have to learn

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.750
two different
languages, you don't

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.510
have to worry about spinning
up two different teams with two

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.140
different code bases
that do the same things.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.220
And then Dart itself--

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.500
so there's Dart 2
that's just come out,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.860
that's been announced
relatively recently.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.930
As we were saying, Dart has
been evolving over time.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.590
And so we were seeing
how it's being used

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.310
and Dart 2 has a lot of changes
that modernize the language.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.400
Things like optional,
new, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.130
and then we also are
adding a more robust type

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.890
system, because it
turns out people

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.570
want to be not surprised.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.153
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, we like types.

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:27.040
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.730
So yeah, it is a lot
of things to help

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.045
make developers' lives nicer.

00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:32.670
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now one of the things

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.230
that whenever we
hear a cross-platform

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.000
and it works in iOS and
it works on Android,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.590
that gets the spidey
senses tingling,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.180
is that often we see
these kind of things

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.324
but it's just web with
a thin veneer over it,

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:43.990
and then it's lowest
common denominator.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.990
But Flutter is very
different from that, right?

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.740
EMILY FORTUNA: No.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.330
Flutter is, literally,
native code.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.530
So compiling to
ARM, what have you.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.530
And the magic of the
Dart VM, basically,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.660
is doing all of
this compilation.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:06.600
So there's no weird interaction
between native code and Flutter

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.900
code, because it is native
code, and Flutter's drawing

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.955
all those pixels.

00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:12.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So it is an app

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.430
or it is that kind of
thing actually running.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.160
It's not a bundle of web stuff.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.720
EMILY FORTUNA: Right, right.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.844
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:08:17.844 --> 00:08:19.890
So I'm a developer and
I want to get started.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.700
What do I do?

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.900
EMILY FORTUNA: Well, you can go
to flutter.io, download things.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.817
There's also a bunch of YouTube
talks, some of them teaching,

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:32.150
someone looks kind of like this.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.358
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, I
heard you did a talk at IO,

00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:35.720
and the meming came back.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.070
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.820
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You've come full circle.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.830
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes, yes.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.090
We gave a talk last year
at IO, and we'll actually

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.840
be at IO this year as well.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.725
But we were doing a
live coding in-app

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:52.710
in Flutter, 30 minutes,
both iOS and Android,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:58.530
and we were doing a live--
or an insta-meme meme chat,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.550
is what we called it, but
chatting via image macros,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.550
basically.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: I here you
had to put some very custom

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.158
memes in that, is that right?

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:07.380
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.230
Well, because we
didn't want to have

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.360
to worry about copyright
infringement of very

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.950
famous memes, we,
at the last minute,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.480
ran around and recreated
a lot of famous memes.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.800
So we got ones of
the Bart Simpson

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.185
where he's like slowly
going into the bush.

00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:29.040
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's Homer, right?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.581
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh,
yes, sorry, Homer.

00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:32.150
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I love that meme.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.702
EMILY FORTUNA: So you
have I'm like slowly

00:09:34.702 --> 00:09:36.011
sinking into the bushes.

00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:36.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
I gotta see that one.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.190
I really want to
do a facepalm one.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.481
EMILY FORTUNA: Oh, we did that.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.630
We had a triple facepalm.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.052
We had a couple of people on
the Flutter team all be like--

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.840
So that that's your IO
talk and that's online?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.330
EMILY FORTUNA: Yes.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:49.830
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, well, we'll

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.572
put a link to in the comments
below so people can see it.

00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:54.030
So again, if I want
to get started,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.945
I want to build
this kind of stuff

00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:57.630
for myself, so your talk is
going to show me how to do it.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.270
But then I download the
bits from just flutter.io?

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.220
OK.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.520
EMILY FORTUNA:
And Flutter is now

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.420
beta, which is super exciting.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.500
It means it's a
level of stability

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.550
that some people were unsure
about in the early days,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.020
but yeah, it's great components,
lots of awesome support

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.582
with Firebase.

00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:21.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've
heard of Firebase.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.123
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.590
Oh, and something that is
near and dear to my heart,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.630
but Flutter supports
animated gifs.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.624
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh.

00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:32.540
EMILY FORTUNA: For added
meming opportunities.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Added
meming opportunities.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.210
And you call them
"gifs" not "jifs."

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.507
but hopefully our viewers--

00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.215
EMILY FORTUNA: Hopefully
no one hates me.

00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:40.815
Depending on what
team you're on, it's--

00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:42.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
one thing, though,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.232
that really stunned me when
I've been learning a little bit

00:10:46.232 --> 00:10:48.440
about Flutter was that it
was alpha for a long time--

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.630
and you just mentioned it's
only just gone into beta--

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.430
but despite it being
alpha, lots of people

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.210
were building great apps on it.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.580
And that, to me, is very rare.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.170
Usually when
something is in alpha,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.820
developers will play
with it and think

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.602
about planning for
the future, but you've

00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:02.060
had lots of great
apps built on it.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.620
Do you have any favorites?

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.020
EMILY FORTUNA: A
favorite of mine.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.930
I mean, personally, I
love the Hamilton app.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.520
Based on the Hamilton musical,
it is the official app.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.850
You can get ticket lotteries
and all sorts of things.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.370
There's fun native overlays.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.410
You can picture yourself
with a King George crown.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.967
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What comes next?

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:29.800
EMILY FORTUNA: Yeah.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
have the app myself,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.560
and I enter the lottery every
day, but I haven't won yet.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.240
Because it's running in
Seattle, I'm from Seattle,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.573
and you're based in Seattle too.

00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:40.599
It's almost done in Seattle,
but I have won a ticket yet.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:42.432
EMILY FORTUNA: I haven't
seen it yet though.

00:11:42.432 --> 00:11:44.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.405
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK,
so again, flutter.io,

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.780
if somebody wants
to get started.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.080
So thank you so much, Emily.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.300
This has been so much fun.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.550
Thanks, everybody, for
watching this episode of Coffee

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.270
With A Googler.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.615
Again, if you have
any questions for me

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:56.214
or if you've any
questions for Emily,

00:11:56.214 --> 00:11:57.880
please leave them in
the comments below,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.838
and we'd love to see what
you build on Flutter.

00:11:59.838 --> 00:12:00.710
Thank you.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.860
