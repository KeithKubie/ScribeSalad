The term data science is actually pretty new to me

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.100
as well, even though now I think about it, I have

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.100
been doing data science since the day I was at

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.870
in Taiwan doing a Masters in, in speech recognition. The way

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.960
we would understand speech is to collect a lot of

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.830
data and understand how to model things like a phoneme in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.930
speech. And how to understand you know, people's language processing

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.910
requires a lot of data collection as well. And at Google,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.840
which is a company that collects a lot of data, I also did personalization

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.480
there which requires a lot of data

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.220
going in, you know, understanding a person's behavior.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.400
So, that to me is data science. Using data to build a useful model or

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.360
to understand a particular pattern that is

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.870
useful, then later on, for other software applications.
