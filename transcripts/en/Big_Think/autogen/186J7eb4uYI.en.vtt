people believe in mau anymore so
therefore it meal ticket has been the

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490
therefore it meal ticket has been the
 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.830
therefore it meal ticket has been the
fact that it has delivered this

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840

of debates within China about how to
 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.440
of debates within China about how to
deal with it whether it's sensible to

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370
things that's leading the government to
 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.529
things that's leading the government to
try and deal with some of these social

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539
try and deal with some of these social
 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.300
try and deal with some of these social
problems because they think if they can

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310
problems because they think if they can
 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.680
problems because they think if they can
