My story is about the ups and
downs of friendship,

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:09.802
specifically between me

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.805
and a horse that did--

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:16.809
did not belong to me but show
pasture

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.811
I climbed into,

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:21.814
because I thought it would
bring us closer together,

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:26.452
and it came close to tearing us
apart, so...

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.421
[laughter]

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:33.326
But just--backtrack.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.829
I--the only thing I knew about
horses when I met her

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.867
is that I thought that they
liked carrots and apples.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.605
And so I met her because I'd
moved back to Austin

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.841
in 2012, and I lived in a part
of the city

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:49.809
that was almost out in the
country.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.845
And there were a few places
that had horses.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.847
And one day when I was walking
my dog,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.849
this horse came to her fence,

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.852
and she walked the whole length
of her fence

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.855
along with us, and then when we
were on our way back,

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:05.291
she did the same thing in the
other direction.

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:06.859
And she started doing that
every day,

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:09.862
and I never saw any people in
her pasture,

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:14.767
so I thought that she probably
wanted me to go pet her,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.569
because I thought...

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.504
[laughter]

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.874
I thought I had heard that
horses are like

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:23.876
really big dogs, but...

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.778
[laughter]

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.514
I honestly believe that when
people say that,

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:30.883
if someone says that, it's
'cause they

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:35.354
were dealing with a big dog
that they thought was a horse.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.891
Because they're not anything
like dogs.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.662
And I--finally, I went to pet
her,

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.897
and at first, she would kind of
back away.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.899
And then she finally let me
pet her,

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.902
and there were some early signs
that there might be trouble

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.305
down the road.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.908
She did a couple times look
like

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.810
she was gonna try to bite my
hand,

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.948
and then one time when I turned
my back on her,

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:06.819
she grabbed my ponytail and
pulled it really hard.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:10.923
But I thought that that was,
like,

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:12.925
maybe how horsed play,

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.928
and I didn't know--

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:18.931
and I forgot to say I'd started
bringing her

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.933
carrots and an apple every day.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:23.569
I would walk my dog and stop
and give her--

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:25.972
and so I thought that we--
I thought

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.441
that's--like,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.843
you could easily by my
friendship

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.945
if you brought me a good snack
every day.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:36.983
So I felt--and she she seemed
to like it.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.586
So--so this is where things

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.855
kind of go south,

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.725
but it started--it seemed at
first like they were--

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:48.461
we were entering a new phase,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.997
because I found--

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.966
I took my dog in for a checkup,
and I found out that

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.970
he had a really fast-growing,
untreatable type of cancer

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.973
and that he probably only had a
few weeks to live,

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:05.978
and I know that's not a great
topic for a comedy show, but...

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:06.979
[laughter]

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.649
But it's relevant to the story.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.985
So that--I was devastated,
because I--

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:14.987
he was my first dog.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.390
I totally treated him like a
person

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.725
and loved him like a person.

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.395
And I--it's terrible that
someone's laughing

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.929
at that part.

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:25.031
[laughter]

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.999
That's really--

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:32.004
that's--that's in poor taste.

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:35.007
But--so I'm just saying--

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.009
I'm not--but it was
devastating,

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:41.013
and so I got the news,
and I took him for a walk.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:44.016
And I stopped to her her her
carrots and apple,

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:47.053
and for the first time, she--

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.021
after she ate the snacks,

00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:53.926
she leaned over the fence and
pressed her forehead

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:56.028
against my head and just stood
there.

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:59.632
And I thought, like, "Wow,
horses are really sensitive.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.468
Like, she could sense that I
was really sad."

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.036
That's what I thought.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.074
In retrospect, she might have
been trying to, like,

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.009
psyche me out or something.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.410
I don't know.

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:14.914
I don't--I don't know what...

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:19.051
But...so then my dog passed
away,

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:23.956
and then I got another dog,
who's great, but...

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.057
[laughter]

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.059
That's not part of this story.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.628
But so a little bit later,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:33.065
I kept visiting her and feeding
her and petting her,

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:36.068
and then I--just one day...

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.104
This--this person.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:42.074
I can't...
[laughter]

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:45.077
So one day I think--

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.079
I don't know what was going on
with me,

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:51.951
but probably some, like,
reckless daredevil,

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.086
once-in-a-blue-moon thing came
over me,

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.955
and I just thought,

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.090
"I bet if--like, she's like a
dog.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:01.093
I bet she would like it if I
was petting her inside

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:04.730
her fence, and...
[laughter]

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:06.132
Because that's what a dog would
want want:

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:08.067
you to stand next to him.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.102
And I should also say,

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:13.072
this had been a couple of
months or more,

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:17.109
and never once did I even just
Google "horses."

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.978
[laughter]

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.114
It never occurred to me to do
that.

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:25.117
So this day I just decided to--

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.621
I climbed the fence and got in
the pasture with her.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.123
I thought I would have, like,
a story tell

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.758
my friends later, which I
did,

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.861
but it wasn't the kind of story
that...

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:38.631
I thought it was gonna be like
I was really courageous,

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:42.868
but I climbed in with her.

00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.137
She ran away, and then she came
back.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.640
And then I just walked next to
her petting her

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.142
and in a soft voice talking to
her,

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.978
and then she kind of moved in
front of me

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.648
and turned her back legs to me.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:59.051
And then I went, "Uh-oh."

00:06:59.084 --> 00:06:59.985
[laughter]

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.155
"This seems--this is what
horses maybe do

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:05.791
right before they kick
somebody."

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:07.927
So I stepped out of the way,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.664
and then she turned around and
reared back on her hind legs

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:15.201
and started flailing her hooves
at me and whinnying.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:19.071
And I still wanted to think she
was playing.

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:20.172
[laughter]

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.174
But it was kind of terrifying,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:26.078
so I just started going, "No,
uh-huh, no, ma'am, no."

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:27.179
[laughter]

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.182
And then--and then I ran,

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:33.552
and so she chased me behind a
tree,

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:36.188
and--and she wouldn't leave.

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.190
Like, she--I thought maybe
she--

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:40.559
once I got behind the tree and
she couldn't get me,

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:42.561
she'd give up, you know,
following,

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.097
and then--so at one point I
looked over,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.701
and then her head popped out on
the other side.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:52.104
And so then I'm standing there
for maybe, like,

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:53.239
15 or 20 minutes.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:57.209
I'm like, "Nobody I know knows
I'm here.

00:07:57.242 --> 00:08:01.113
No one I know even knows that
I'm friends with this horse."

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:02.214
[laughter]

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:04.216
"So no one's gonna come look
for me.

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:08.220
I've never seen any people come
and take care of her."

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:13.225
At one point a car slowed down.

00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:15.127
And I--they were looking at me,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.130
and instead of flagging them
down for help,

00:08:18.163 --> 00:08:21.734
I thought, "I don't want them
to know that I'm an idiot

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.871
who climbed in here," so I just
gave them the wave that's,

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:28.674
"Oh, it's okay.
We're okay over here."

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:33.045
And I found--later I found out

00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:35.247
those were the owners.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.251
And--and they--I went like
that,

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:40.619
and they drove away.

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.288
Like, they didn't--I don't know
why--

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.124
they just saw some weird lady

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:48.127
trapped behind a tree with
their horse,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.262
and, "Oh, she waved.
I guess it's fine.

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:51.263
We'll drive."

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:55.267
So they drove--so finally I saw

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.271
this horse go towards the other
part of her pasture.

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:02.274
So I slowly walk out from
behind the tree

00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:05.277
and start kind of trying not to
upset her,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.279
walk toward the fence,

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:09.782
and then she came back and
chased me again,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.985
so I ran behind the little
structure

00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:15.321
that she had her hay in.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:18.290
And then that lasted for, like,
another 15 minutes

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.292
of having to wait for her to
get bored.

00:09:20.325 --> 00:09:22.294
She walked away again.

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:25.297
I ran behind another tree
closer to the fence.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.334
And then the last--

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:31.203
that was the last tree that,
you know,

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:33.806
was the closest to the fence,
and I thought I could make it,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.009
so when she lost interest and
walked away,

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:39.311
I ran for the fence, and in my
mind,

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:43.315
in movies when people take a
run at a fence...

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:44.249
[laughter]

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:47.319
They get--they jump at the last
minute,

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:50.222
so they land high on the fence,

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:53.225
and then they just throw a leg
over, and they're done,

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:56.195
but I ran at the fence,

00:09:56.228 --> 00:10:01.233
and I tried to jump, but I
still landed at the bottom.

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.336
And then--and then I--

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:09.341
I climbed as fast as I could,
and she was running towards me,

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:11.844
and I threw a leg over, and it
got caught.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:15.347
My jeans got caught,
so they ripped,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.816
and then I--finally I got to
the other side.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:22.354
And so at first

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:24.356
I really was mad at her,

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:27.259
and I felt like...

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:29.028
I was like, you know, I'm not--

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.697
I'm not gonna come visit her
anymore.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.267
We're--like, this is why I
never see people

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.171
in her pastures, 'cause she's
not a nice horse,

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:44.376
and then later I realize I have
to keep going to visit her,

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:46.378
because she's a terrible horse,

00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:49.815
and no one else is ever gonna
be friends with her,

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:52.384
so for the rest of the time I
lived there,

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:54.053
I kept bringing her food,

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:56.689
and I wish there was an ending
to this story,

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:59.258
but thank you for listening.
