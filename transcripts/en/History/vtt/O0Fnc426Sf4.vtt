00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.210
NARRATOR: Cusco, Peru.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.880
Today, the Church
of Santo Domingo

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.210
sits on the foundation
stones of what

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.500
was once considered
the most important

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.040
temple to the ancient Inca--

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.380
the Coricancha
Temple of the Sun.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.040
The original structure, which
is believed to predate the Incan

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.080
civilization, was rebuilt
in the 15th century

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.380
by the ruler Pachacuti after
he came into possession

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.380
of a mirror disc.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.920
EDWIN BARNHART: Pachacuti is the
first Inca who really created

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
the Inca as an empire, not
just as one of many cultures

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.080
in the Andes.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.500
ASHLEY COWIE: A legend
has it that Pachacuti

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.830
traveled to a spring
to the east of Cusco.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.750
A disc was said to have fallen
from the sky into the spring,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.250
and when Pachacuti lifted
it out of the water,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.620
he saw an image of
Viracocha the Creator.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.420
The apparition told Pachacuti,
You will win many wars.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.420
Within 10 years,
Pachacuti expanded

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.080
the empire in a way that's never
been seen in history before.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.960
The myths say that he
held that mirror with him

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380
for the rest of his
life, and any answers

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
he wanted, to look into
the future or what to do,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.620
he consulted the mirror, and
the mirror told him what to do.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.380
ASHLEY COWIE: The disc
that Pachacuti found truly

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.920
was his key and his driving
force to become one of the most

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.830
powerful emperors in history.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.000
NARRATOR: Pachacuti began
the expansion of the Incan

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.830
territory from the
Valley of Cusco

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.920
to encompass 2,500 miles of the
west coast of South America,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.790
from Quito, Ecuador,
to Talca, Chile.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.290
Worldwide-- it doesn't
matter what ancient culture--

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.830
there is some type of
a worship of a disc

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.000
that came from the sky.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
It is possible
that this disc had

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.420
some type of an
extraterrestrial connection

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.710
and that this disc was
a technological device.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.210
DAVID CHILDRESS:
You have to wonder,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.380
was it some kind of an
extraterrestrial object

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.290
that Pachacuti was now carrying
around with him that allowed

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.880
him to communicate with these
extraterrestrial gods that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880
were guiding him?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.330
DAVID WILCOCK: We've
already had smartphones that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.210
have come out in our own
history where it's a lot

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.330
more than what it appears.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.960
You're looking at
all of your apps,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.330
you can watch movies on
it, you can send email,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.120
you can have telephone
calls, you can have video

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.500
calls-- all kinds of things.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.880
So that disc may have been
something with a great deal

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.670
of computer circuitry
in it, something

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.580
that had far more
capability than we

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.000
could ever normally imagine.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.080
NARRATOR: If the accounts
of Pachacuti's magic disc

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.420
are true, could
it have contained

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.080
some sort of alien technology?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.880
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.250
further evidence that
alien discs exist on earth

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.670
can be found in the Hayu
Marca mountain region of Peru.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.750
At the site known by the locals
as the Puerta de Hayu Marca,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.830
or Gate of the
Gods, is an enormous

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.040
23-foot-high door-like
structure carved

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.830
into the solid rock face.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.420
Contained within it is a
smaller, T-shaped opening

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.420
just under six feet in height,
with a circular depression

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.960
inside.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.710
WILLIAM HENRY: Local legends
tell us that the gods would use

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.920
this as a gateway,
or a stargate,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.250
through which they
would come and go.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.580
They opened the doorway
through this disc

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.880
that was placed in a little
alcove, or etching place,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.460
inside the doorway.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.040
DAVID CHILDRESS: One
of the stories, too,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.580
is that a high priest
named Amaru Meru utilized

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.120
a disc to open this door.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.790
And so this was his
computer, or key, that opened

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.830
this dimensional doorway.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.000
Once again, the
disc is the key.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.790
Here we have an apparent
extraterrestrial technology

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.670
in the form of a disc.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.080
And you would then pop the
disc into where the door is,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.420
and that would open the portal.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.960
This circular area
has been found

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.330
where the door is located.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.080
And so it does suggest that
there may be some veracity

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.080
to these ancient legends.
