00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.640
and with your support I'm excited to say:

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.240
Here's just a few of the things

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180
that we've been able to accomplish together.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.620
We now cover a wide range of academic subjects

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.960
including history, science, grammar, and much more.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.040
Khan Academy is now available in more than 190 countries

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.120
and translated into 18 languages.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.920
Millions of students and teachers around the world

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.400
are using Khan Academy videos,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
interactive exercises and assignments.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.460
Teachers use new Khan Academy tools

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.079
to assign practice exercises, identify gaps in learning,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.760
and track student progress.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.840
Nearly 1 million students took part

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.620
in our back to school challenge

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.340
developing new skills and growth mindsets

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.860
while celebrating their achievements.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.040
"Are you ready to keep going and keep growing this year?"

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.520
Yeah!

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.220
Research found that students who use our Official SAT Practice

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660
We've partnered with the Advanced Placement program

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.540
to provide free official practice resources

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.860
for over 20 AP courses.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.380
We're really proud of the impact we've had so far,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.020
but we're just getting started!

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.500
We have big plans for 2018 and beyond.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.220
We're going to be working on lessons across subjects

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
for learners around the globe,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.080
and as a nonprofit, we need support from people like yourself.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.760
So please consider becoming a monthly donor.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.440
Because together, I think we really can
deliver on the mission of

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.000
a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.
