[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.044 --> 00:00:05.710
SPEAKER: Please put
your hands together.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.924
Welcome to the stage
Peter Godfrey-Smith.

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:11.209
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.480
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: OK.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.920
This talk will be a
fast underwater tour

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.930
of animal evolution,
and in particular

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.580
the evolution of the mind.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.860
The first fact here,
I think, is the fact

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.300
that the mind evolved
in the sea this idea has

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.620
several sides to it.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.560
Firstly, just the fact that
for all the early stages,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.140
the first and crucial period,
until about 400 million years

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.610
ago, just about all life and
all animal life was in the sea.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.350
That was the context.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.040
And in that period before a life
on land, most of the essentials

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.970
were laid down.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.550
So the evolution of
animals themselves,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.480
the evolution of nervous systems
and brains, the evolution

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.930
of complex senses such
as eyes and of bodies

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.240
that can act in complex ways.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.430
And to some extent, all
the rest is fine-tuning.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.370
Now, I'm not saying that
everything was in place

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.710
before we came up on land.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.280
Mammals certainly have special
features, as do humans.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.170
But the basics are in place.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.710
And the question
that then arises

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.250
is whether what was
in place included

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.830
those aspects of the
mind that philosophers

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.000
have found most mysterious,
subjective experience

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.410
and consciousness.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.720
Now, this is a famously
difficult question,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.420
but I think we can work
towards answering it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.510
and I think the answer
to the question is yes.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.730
Now, one more aspect to the
idea that the mind evolved

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.070
in the sea is related
to that last point.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.210
So when you think about how it's
even possible for a physical

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.860
system to have mental states,
especially experiences,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.800
part of what makes this
problem seem so hard, I think--

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.410
so hard that people
despair of it--

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.750
is the fact that people
have a particular picture

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.240
of the physical in
their heads when

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.610
they think about this
aspect of the problem.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.690
They have a kind of dry
land macroscopic picture

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.840
of the physical and how
physical things interact.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.010
Or perhaps they have in mind the
particular kinds of interaction

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.920
you find within
present day computers

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.230
with a processor
or many processors,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.020
various kinds of memory,
and a cascade of read

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.850
and write operations.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.480
Now, I think this
is part of what has

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960
steered people the wrong way--

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.890
not so much the computational
electronic picture

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.620
of the material, and I think
that's an interesting topic

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.630
to think about here at Google,
but the more general picture

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.890
of the physical and the earlier
mechanistic conception I think

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.770
has been a significant
source of trouble here.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.500
Instead, we should think about
the distinctive properties

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.220
of cellular life, the
particular kinds of goings

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.630
on within cells.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.800
It's an acquiesce environment
and a nano scale environment.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.880
Everything is in
water in solution,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.480
there's continual
spontaneous activity.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.360
And the way things
get done within a cell

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.910
is by means of
essentially a multitude

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.820
of biased random walks.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.190
So the physical itself
is different in the sea

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.300
and in cells.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.770
Now, I'm not saying
that's itself

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.870
enough to remove
all mystery, but I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.040
think it's important to
think in the right way

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.530
about the biological
basis of the mind

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.600
as we think about this problem.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.040
And when animals
moved up on land,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.510
this is an animal that has
not yet moved off on land,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.190
they took all this with them.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.000
They hauled up in their cells
the chemistry of the sea

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.740
where they came from.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.130
Now, as the title
of my book suggests,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.230
we're working towards
the special role

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.590
in the story of octopuses
and other cephalopods,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.600
but we're not there yet.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.840
The next thing to think
about is the overall shape

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.310
of the history of animal life.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.430
Now, life in general
forms the shape

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.500
of a tree, roughly speaking.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.760
So from a single root, a series
of branching events usually

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.630
with no rejoinings extend
to the present day.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.420
There are branchings
and then divergence.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.540
This process began with
single-celled life.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.310
We don't know the
original forms,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.300
but based on what we know about
single-celled organisms now,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.160
the picture to have
in your mind is not

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.340
little cells that are
self-contained little islands,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.100
but systems that are
open to the world,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.260
sensing and responding,
exhibiting behavior,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.910
including even social
behavior, on a tiny scale.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.740
Now, animals are one branch
of multicellular life.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.110
And the first way to
think about animals

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.630
is they are one pretty big
branch of the tree of life,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.980
a branch that comes off around
900 million years ago or so,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.370
perhaps.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.360
And in that transition
to multicellular life,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.160
the sensing and
signaling that cells

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.280
had been doing as whole
organisms in the unicellular

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.250
state is now used to
coordinate activities

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.610
of cells within the
new collective entities

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.240
that had arisen, making
possible coordinated

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.950
and coherent action.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.910
So the social behavior of
cells becomes the means

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.790
for all animal action.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.120
Now, there's no fossil record
of the very earliest stages.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.960
The first stages of the
history of animal life

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.590
that we do have a
fossil record of

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.510
are from the Ediacaran Period,
roughly 635 to 540 million

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.870
years ago.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.490
This is a photo of a typical
Ediacaran fossil in the South

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.690
Australian Museum and it's
the sort of round thing

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.020
that is the likely animal
fossil, something that looks

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.870
a little bit like a bathmat.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.530
So life was very
different back then.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.230
All animals were
soft-bodied and life also

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.480
seems to have been fairly quiet.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.970
This is, I think, a
gorgeous reconstruction

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.560
of Ediacaran life by the
English artist John Sibbick.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.970
And one of the
distinctive things

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.680
that this sort of
illustration captures

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.541
is the fact that animals--

00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.790
well, it's not even clear
which of these living things

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.080
were animals--

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.730
but animals in
particular don't seem

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.380
to have had too much
to do with each other.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.010
Many of them probably
didn't move around at all.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.490
So that's the first stage.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.020
And now I want to start to
place all this into a larger

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.080
historical context
also looking forward.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.010
So there is a summary
picture of part of the animal

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.670
branch of the tree of life.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.370
This is from the book.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.370
So with all these tree pictures,
you should think of time

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.620
as running up the screen.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.460
And so we have a series
of branchings giving rise

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.760
to, at the top, various
different present day

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.900
kinds of organisms--
vertebrates there on the left;

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.180
mollusks, including cephalopods,
which I'll talk about shortly;

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.180
arthropods, including
insects; then you

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.560
get things like jelly
fish and sponges.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.140
And the next thing
to note is that many

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.900
of the deep branchings
in animal evolution

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.590
took place in the
Ediacaran Period.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.720
That's when the sort of
separations occurred.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.470
Now, here's another
picture not from the book,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.450
from another paper of mine.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.520
What the orange band
there represents

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.310
is the fact that the deep
historical branchings giving

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.470
rise to the various
present day groups,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.830
those branchings took
place in the Ediacaran,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.180
at this time of very
limited interaction.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.980
A particularly important
animal living at that time

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.627
might have looked
something like this.

00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:51.460
This is a sort of little
worm-like creature.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.420
There's no fossil
record, this is very much

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.090
a sort of tentative
reconstruction.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.790
But it was something
like the first animal

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.270
that had left-right symmetry
as part of its body plan.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.040
It had a left and right, as
well as a top and bottom.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.510
And this body plan
evolved in the Ediacaran.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.720
Most of the animals
that we're familiar with

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.330
are bilaterians animals,
they have that kind

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.790
of left-right plant that
was originally laid down

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.560
in something like this.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.440
This was probably a very
small animal, quite simple.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.100
It did have a nervous
system, almost certainly,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.230
but a simple nervous
system, most likely.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.970
So on a slide like that,
we have that animal

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.940
placed at its particular
moment in the tree

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.900
and everything downstream
sort of on its branch

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.030
is a bilaterally symmetrical
organism, including ourselves

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.830
and animals like octopuses.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.320
So the branchings
occurred earlier,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.170
before what's known as
the Cambrian Explosion.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.590
Then in the Cambrian,
life changed dramatically.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.180
Rather than soft
bodied-animals that

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.150
look a bit like
macaroons or bathmats,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.110
you'd have animals that
looked something like this.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.270
You'd have hard
parts-- spines, claws;

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.730
you'd have complex
sensory mechanisms,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.160
especially complex eyes.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.170
And it is very
likely that this is

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.480
when animals began to have much
more to do with each other,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.890
especially as
predators and prey.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.380
From there, you get lots
of downstream evolution

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.150
and this takes us
through something

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:31.940
that can be roughly summarized
with a picture like this.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:39.140
Lots of animals come from
this early bilaterian lineage,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.950
and in a few groups you have
the evolution of large brains

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.290
and complex behavior.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.870
You have firstly the
evolution of large brains

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.110
and complex behavior in our
group, in the vertebrates.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.920
Many vertebrates are like this,
especially mammals and birds.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.100
And in what we informally
refer to as invertebrates,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.560
all the others, you
mostly have animals

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.950
that have small nervous systems
and relatively simple behavior,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.420
but with one big
exception, the cephalopods,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.760
a group of mollusks.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.080
Here we have a large
nervous system, one

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.660
in the vertebrate range--

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.280
roughly 500 million neurons
in the case of an octopus--

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.200
and the most recent common
ancestor of you on one side

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.670
and an octopus on the
other, with its very large

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.290
nervous system, was that very
simple worm-like creature

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.930
living in the Ediacaran
600 million years ago.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.190
So what we really have
is independent evolution

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.520
from that point down
two sides and something

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.110
we can think of as two
independent evolutionary

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.660
experiments in the origin
of large nervous systems

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.520
and complex brains.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.040
So a cephalopod is--

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.280
we're looking at the results
of the one experiment

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.720
outside our line in the
evolution of a large, really

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.280
large nervous system.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.320
And I think this,
consequently, as the closest

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.167
we'll ever come to meeting
an intelligent alien.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.750
When I say that, I
mean the following.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.230
If you think about what it
would be like to meet an alien,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.490
the big fact about
an alien is that it's

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.390
an intelligent form of life that
has no common ancestor with us

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.660
at all, coming from a totally
separate evolutionary lineage.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.230
An octopus is certainly
not like that,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.320
but the common ancestor is
so far away and probably

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.710
quite simple, and as a
result, most of what we see

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.650
arose independently in the
roughly 600 million years ago

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.590
since that common ancestor.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.840
So what did we get on the other
side and why did we get it?

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.810
Well, we get a mixture of
similarities and differences

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.540
from things like our cells.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.200
The most conspicuous
similarity between a cephalopod

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.140
and a vertebrate is the eye.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.200
Cephalopods independently
evolved a camera eye.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.940
So this is a giant
cuttlefish, which

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.490
has the same kind of eye
as an octopus, a camera

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.720
eye with a lens that focuses
an image on a retina.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.690
You also have various
sophisticated kinds

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.400
of learning.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.590
And lastly, something
that was really

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.750
the beginning of my own
fascination with these animals,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.400
there's a kind of engagement
that these animals display

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.990
when you interact with them.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.780
The first ones I came across
myself were not octopuses,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.020
but giant cuttlefish
like this guy here.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.320
This animal was probably sort
of between two and three feet

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.250
long, they're not small.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.730
I was snorkeling
near Sydney and saw

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.980
under a ledge something
moving around,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.080
went down and had a look at it.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.850
And as I thought
from the surface,

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.850
it was a large animal and
something very active.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.730
And the two most
striking things about it

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.450
were firstly, the astounding
array of color changes

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.640
that it was producing
as I watched it.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.940
These animals can change the
entire color of their skin

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.190
in much less than a second.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.870
And secondly, the
fact that this animal

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.530
seemed about as interested
in me as I was in it.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.480
There's a kind of a
feeling of meeting

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.930
you can have with these animals,
which is, I take it unique,

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.670
when a person meets another
invertebrate and quite rare

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.910
when we meet any animal.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.180
Just to give you a sense of
the capacity for color change,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.970
these two photographs were
taken four seconds apart.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.020
So a giant cuttlefish
can completely

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.110
transform it skin to that
yellow in less than a second

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.100
and then take it back
to that reddish pattern

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.030
a few seconds later.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.270
And this image also
gives you a sense

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.640
of the fact that it's not
just whole colors that they

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.350
can produce, but very complex
stripes and bands, dynamic

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.030
as well as static
patterns, as well.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.340
So how did there
come to be animals

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.480
that could do these things?

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.020
Let's talk a little bit
about the cephalopod brain

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.870
and the kind of being
that these animals are.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.440
So as I said, there are
roughly 500 million neurons

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.344
in an octopus.

00:14:12.344 --> 00:14:14.260
The number is not really
known for cuttlefish,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.710
but they may have even
a slightly higher ratio

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.210
of brain weight to body
weight than octopuses have.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.160
The big difference
between them and us

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.090
is the fact that more than half
of the neurons in an octopus

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.550
are not where you would expect
to find them, in the head,

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.190
but spread through the body,
especially within the arms

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.300
themselves.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.250
And each of the arms appears
to have some degree of autonomy

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.280
as a kind of quasi agent.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.280
Now, how did this
come to happen?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.020
We can put some
of it into context

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.540
by looking at the
lives that were lived

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.830
and the history of
this particular group.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.670
So here's is a
reconstruction of what

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:59.680
an early-ish ancestor of
present day cephalopods

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.320
might have looked like
back in the Paleozoic.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.990
This is a large
shelled predator.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.750
At some point in
animal evolution,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.530
the shells were abandoned
and what you were left with

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.490
was a body with a kind
of immense flexibility.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.500
You should think, by the
way, about an octopus'

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.830
arms or a cuttlefish's
arms not so much as arms,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.820
but really as kind of
eight or 10 enormous lips.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.990
And those enormous
multi-shaped lips

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.050
are extremely useful things
if you can control them,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.430
but they are extremely
difficult things to control.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.620
Now, in us when we
move, our joints

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.290
give our movements guidance.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.860
You don't have to tell your
every detail about where to go.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.370
In an octopus with no joints
and no hard parts at all,

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.400
the arm can be essentially
any shape and length.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.170
So you would either
have to specify

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.220
exactly the fine details
of all its motions

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.050
or give the arm a
little bit of freedom

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.230
to work out the details
of its motions itself.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.430
And it does seem
that there has been

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.750
a sort of partial
delegation of control

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.600
to the arms of an
octopus by evolution.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.670
Each arm has many senses.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.560
Whenever an octopus
touches you, it's

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.830
tasting you, as well
as feeling your shape.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.770
And they seem to
sort of determine

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.100
at least the details of many
of the emotions themselves

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.117
and also engage in a kind
of exploration on their own.

00:16:31.117 --> 00:16:32.950
So here are a couple
of photos that give you

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.970
a sense of the contrast here.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.860
So firstly, we have
two screen shots

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.290
from a video in which
this octopus is reaching

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.670
aggressively for another one.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.180
And in a shot like
this, the arm seems

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.430
very much like a
sort of tool directed

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.050
by the animal as a whole.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.220
It's reaching with
one arm for this guy,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.890
and in this case
successfully seizing it.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.250
This kind of picture gives
the opposite impression.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.250
I don't have a video of this
sequence, unfortunately, just

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:06.930
an image.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.263
But it's an octopus and it's
sitting there doing nothing

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:09.970
in particular.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.740
And one of the
arms, the red arrow

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.630
there indicates
the extent of it,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.180
has just kind of wandered
off in a way that

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.150
looked to me as if it was
apparently more or less

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.030
self-directed, a kind
of exploratory behavior

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.140
by the arm on its own.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.130
Now, given all this,
a natural question

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.230
to ask next is, what might
it be like to be an octopus?

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.250
Is it like anything
to be an octopus?

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.970
Look I think-- these questions
are, of course, very hard

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.470
to answer.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.860
I think the answer, does
it feel like something

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.350
to be an octopus is yes.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.020
The harder question is
how to address rigorously

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.900
a problem of that kind.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.640
Now, the first thing
to note, I think,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.570
is that a reasonable view
has it that a certain kind

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.270
of experience in
animals just comes

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.130
with a certain
degree of complexity

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.450
in sensing and responding
and acting upon the world.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.490
That runs deep in
animal evolution.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.600
Octopuses are exemplars
of that kind of capacity.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.580
Another more specific thing I
think it's worth looking for

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.140
is evidence of things like pain.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.340
So lots of what might
look superficially

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.920
like pain-related behaviors
in various animals,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.060
especially invertebrates,
are probably or possibly

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.500
quite misleading.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.400
They may not be good
indicators of felt pain,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.220
of the kind of interior
sensation of the sort that

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.504
comprises pain in us.

00:18:40.504 --> 00:18:42.170
So then the question
arises, how can you

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.200
look for a behavior that
shows something non-reflexive,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.960
something that's indicative
or suggestive at least that it

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.570
feels like something to be
an animal of a certain kind

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.701
in pain?

00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:54.200
And one good example that's
been looked at in several groups

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.150
recently is wound tending.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.300
You can ask the question, which
animals will tend a damaged

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.960
part, protect it from being
touched by other objects

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.680
and stimuli as time goes on?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.570
We got an interesting series of
shots of an octopus exhibiting

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.070
pain-related behavior.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.850
This is in some ways a
sort of comical shot,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.410
not so much for the
octopus I think.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.900
This was a large
aggressive octopus

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.480
who was trying to dominate
a particular site I'll

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.040
talk about shortly.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.830
And one of the things he did
in his attempts to dominate

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.980
was raise his rear end
very high above his body

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.012
in these sort of size displays.

00:19:33.012 --> 00:19:34.470
And in one particular
occasion when

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.500
he raised his rear
end very high,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.840
a fish came in and
bit him really hard

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.570
right on the end
of his body there.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.580
And you can see the fish biting.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.500
These fish, by the way,
are very unpleasant to bite

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.500
even if you're a person.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.190
I've been bitten by
them and it's not nice.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.680
The octopus behaved
exactly like a person,

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.130
sort of with this very startled
leap and arms going everywhere.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.130
I was curious whether
he would tend the wound.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.100
He did not.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:08.400
Instead, he went back to
beating up other octopuses.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.330
So an octopus has sort of
reasonably good evidence,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.180
I think, of various kinds
of subjective experience.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.957
The special elements
and the question

00:20:15.957 --> 00:20:17.540
I think that's
particularly intriguing

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.510
here concerns what
kind of sense of self

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.210
there might be in an
animal of this kind

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.610
and how different that
would be in an octopus

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.060
and in a more neurally
centralized animal

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.470
like ourselves.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.650
So we can ask which
activities an octopus engages

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.570
in are experienced
as my actions,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.770
as authored by the individual,
as opposed to things that just

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.970
happen and are observed
by the central animal

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.930
by means of those
semi-agent-like arms?

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.890
In a talk I gave last week, a
grad student at the University

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.380
of Pennsylvania made a
suggestion that seemed obvious

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.960
in retrospect, that I hadn't
thought about it much before,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.300
which is, well, there need
not be a single answer

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.030
to this question.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.488
It might be that
when an octopus is

00:21:06.488 --> 00:21:09.310
doing a very sort of focused
intentional behavior,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.920
like that reach in
the photo I had there,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.070
then there's a kind of
single agent-like subjective

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.210
experience.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.480
But that might sort of lapse
or fall away and be replaced

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.480
by a more distributed,
less self-like entity

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:28.034
when you're seeing individual
exploration by the arms.

00:21:28.034 --> 00:21:29.450
So these are some
of the questions

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.250
that we'd like to
ask, a sort of mixture

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.510
of philosophical and scientific
questions about these animals.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.220
And work is continuing on this.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.710
In the last part
of this talk, what

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.100
I'll do is just show some
shots and some videos

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.520
from a particular site where a
lot of these photos were taken,

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.250
an octopus site that
we call Octopolus,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.760
which is written about in
some detail in the book.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.470
This is a site on the
east coast of Australia.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.970
OK.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.080
Here's the first video.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.891
Here we go.

00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:01.890
This just gives you a
sense of what this site is

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.280
like on a sort of typical day.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.680
You've got a large number
of shells on a shell bed

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.210
and various octopuses
who are in residence.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.000
And what's believed about
octopuses in general

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.010
is they're not very
social animals.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.990
It's unusual for them
to have to interact

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.380
with each other
in decent numbers.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.480
But at this particular site
in Australia that we study,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.510
they've essentially had
to learn to get along.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.860
The view we have is that
it's a site where there's

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:38.250
an abundance of food but a great
scarcity of decent den sites.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.860
And one particular
area, an area but that

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.080
was perhaps seeded by
a single human left

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.310
object of unknown origin,
provided a kind of seed

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.590
around which a
crystal-like growth

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.520
occurred whereby octopuses
came to live in large numbers.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.620
And a lot of the time,
they engage in sort

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.110
of mild controlled aggression.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.220
Occasionally, they engage
in more intense aggression.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.830
So this animal on the
left here is, in fact,

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.750
the octopus who was
bitten on the rear end

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.240
by the fish we saw earlier.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.100
And this is a sort of
typical day for him,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.470
engaging in a series
of fights where

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.550
he attempts to control access to
this pretty large site, a site

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.820
about the size of his stage.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.050
And he's appeared to be able,
so far as we can tell, determine

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.750
with some reliability
the sexes of individuals

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:32.460
coming on and off the site and
tried to exclude other males.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:37.410
So he engaged in a series of
fights and much of the time

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.250
did succeed in excluding them.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.270
A feature that's also
unique at this site

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.000
is a kind of signaling.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.130
This is the kind of display I
talked about briefly earlier,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.620
where animals who are aggressive
will go up very large and dark,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.270
maximizing their
darkness and size.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.820
And if you look closely
at the animal who

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.750
it is about to chase, you'll
see this animal has gone pale.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.150
But more specifically,
you'll see

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.330
that it has done a color change
such that half of its body,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.170
the half facing the
attacking octopus,

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.260
is a kind of high contrast
mottled sort of color

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.380
and the other half of
its body facing away

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.690
is a kind of simple camouflage.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.000
Now, we're not sure
exactly why that is.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.010
The sort of high contrast
pattern on the side facing

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.640
has a role in various
cephalopod behaviors

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.646
as a kind of sometimes
called a diematic display.

00:24:34.646 --> 00:24:36.270
The idea is you show
this to a predator

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.815
and it might startle
the predator.

00:24:37.815 --> 00:24:39.690
It's possible that it's
being sort of pressed

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.070
into service as an attempt
to, in a futile way,

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.680
startle this oncoming octopus.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.830
However, many individuals
produce this display

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.590
when they're not
trying to run away,

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:58.470
but trying to kind of
creep onto the site

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.800
under the gaze of another animal
in a non-aggressive manner.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.710
So we suspect that it may
have been pressed into service

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.820
as a kind of indicator of
non-aggressive tendencies

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.290
in these animals.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.510
And then the question
arises, is this something

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.830
that isn't a widespread
but hitherto unseen

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.530
feature of this behavior
across the species,

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.300
or is it something
that just develops

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.900
into a particular peculiar
social milieu of this site?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.500
Another thing that's an
unusual feature of this site

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.140
is what we've come to call a
kind of high five behavior.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.070
So this octopus on the
right there is moving across

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.080
towards the others
and as it goes,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.740
there will often be a kind of--

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.950
I originally called
this boxing, but now I

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.700
realize I was being too
pugilistic in my metaphors

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.610
and it might be a kind
of slap of recognition

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:51.120
or of something like indication
of roles on the site that

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.100
animals do by just
by sort of jabbing

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.340
at each other with their arms.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.550
This is a picture of
me at the site trying

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.410
to fix a camera while
a whole bunch of stuff

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.550
goes on around me, none of
which I'm able to see going on.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.800
So we only sometimes
successfully look at them.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.420
They often quite
successfully observe us.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.130
This is an octopus inspecting
one of the GoPro cameras,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.370
possibly as a preliminary
to taking it apart.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.270
So I'll stop there.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.070
Happy to take a few questions.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.700
I think you'll agree these are
truly fascinating and stunning

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.611
animals.

00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:31.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.940
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the
talk it was very, very

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.080
cool to see that.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.240
So probably the most
remarkable thing

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.780
about the mammalian experiment
with intelligence, I would say,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.760
is our incredible memories.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.000
It's quite difficult to
imagine what my sense of self

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.490
would be like without
that kind of memory.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.560
What kind of memory do
the cephalopods have?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.810
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: There's
some interesting new work

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.170
on this in cuttlefish, which
is interesting particularly

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:07.140
in continuities between
the human and this case.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.070
So in the case of
humans, there's

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.260
sort of a standard
distinction between forms

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.010
of memory, the sort
of memory of how

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.900
to do things, procedural
memory; what's

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.600
called semantic memory,
memory of facts, the fact

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.990
that Paris is the
capital of France.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.180
And episodic memory is memory
of what happened to you,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.102
of experiences.

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:28.060
And the kind of memory
that you were describing

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.560
as very sort of distinctive to
human experiences is that kind.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.330
So a good question
is, which animals

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.850
might have something like
episodic memory, memory

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.100
not just of facts--

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.370
where things are-- but
of what experiences

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.740
I had when I was in that place?

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.600
And recently, some
work that's been

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.040
used to study episodic memory,
or rather episodic-like memory

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.740
in birds, has been also
applied to cuttlefish.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.765
And I won't describe
all the details

00:27:57.765 --> 00:27:59.140
of the experimental
design, which

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.290
was very clever and subtle,
but the upshot of it

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.520
was that it appears that
cuttlefish do have the ability

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.220
to remember not just
facts like this food

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.820
can be found there, but
facts of the form I was

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.270
at this location
an hour ago and ate

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.880
or I was at this other location
two hours ago and didn't eat.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.060
So a sense of kind of not just
sort of facts about the world,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.370
but facts about what I have
done and where I have been.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:34.870
So this I find especially
enticing because things

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.490
like this, there's
just no chance

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.620
that was present in the
common ancestor of us

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.090
and these animals.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.150
So independently, the
same kind of sense

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.640
of a self-behaving
in time appears

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.440
to have arisen in
several different lines.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.810
AUDIENCE: What do we know
about the visual processing

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:55.680
in these animals?

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.210
You said that the eye is quite
similar to the human eye.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.980
Does the animal have a similarly
organized visual cortex?

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.660
PETER GODFREY-SMITH:
Not similarly.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.150
In general, once you
get past the eye,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.480
everything becomes
different in these animals.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.670
I'm not that knowledgeable about
the neurophysiology of vision

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.540
in octopuses.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.520
I can certainly tell
you where to look.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.020
One of the labs that
specializes in this

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.270
is Benny Hochner's lab at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.090
They're probably the
leading lab with respect

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.000
to the project of
trying to work out

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.240
how different the
organizational properties are

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.270
of an octopus' brain and ours.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.980
And one thing that
they're looking at

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.390
and have sort of made
some claims about

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.880
is the idea that
within our brains,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.390
you have quite a number of
sort of map-like structures

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.600
where the sort of sensory
array on the body maps

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.350
to sort of adjacent or
neighbor [INAUDIBLE] neurons

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.220
in the brain and that seems
to be absent in octopuses.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.620
And you might think,
oh, right, that has

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.500
some linked to the
idea that there's too

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.200
many degrees of freedom to
control centrally so you leave

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.680
that stuff to the arms.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.930
Or it might have some other
explanation, I don't know.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.960
But his papers will be
the ones to look at.

00:30:21.805 --> 00:30:24.180
AUDIENCE: It's really nice to
see an actively researching

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.880
scientist not deflationist about
subjective experience, that's

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.630
pretty refreshing.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:33.929
But I just wanted to say
you were getting at our very

00:30:33.929 --> 00:30:35.720
linear view on what
conscious experience is

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.960
like as potentially clouding
our view on what it can be

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.011
and how to fit it into
a scientific worldview,

00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:44.510
but you didn't really flesh out
what sort of future research

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.790
program you had in
mind for the types

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.310
of different
organizations of, say,

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.600
like sea-like cells for
the future of fitting

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.350
subjective experience into
the scientific kind of canon.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.620
So what sort of research
program for solving

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.830
the Chalmers-style hard
problem do you envision?

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:06.190
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: OK.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.070
That's a very big
question, indeed.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.250
And my answer would
be sort of so many

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.830
pronged that it's sort
of hard to organize it

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.464
in a brief reply.

00:31:17.464 --> 00:31:19.630
But let me say a couple of
things just very quickly.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.990
One is I think that with respect
to the sorts of challenges

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.100
that people like Chalmers
make, some of that

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.090
should be treated in a more
critical way where you say,

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.950
no, this kind of
barrier is not real

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.410
or this problem for a
materialist view is not real.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.010
So I think a first move
that one should make

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.250
is to reorient our
thinking about the problem

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.570
in a way that's more
critical about the sort

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.590
of imaginable separability of
the mental and the physical,

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.160
the basis for the arguments
of Chalmers and others.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.630
So criticize that.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.610
Then choose the right
thing to explain.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.390
And I think the right
thing to explain

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.080
is not sort of consciousness
as the sort of first target

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.960
or what's also often referred
to as qualia, the kind

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.360
of raw feel of experience.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.140
But subjectivity,
that's the right target.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.070
How is it that some physical
systems can comprise subjects

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.940
that have a point of view?

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.607
Once you understand that
and where they came from,

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.190
I think it will be
possible to explain

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.650
subjective experience
as something

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.870
that happens to subjects.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.240
Now, how can we give
a scientific road

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.560
into the understanding of
subjectivity in a sense that's

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.095
relevant to that question?

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.730
Here I think there are lots
of things to think about.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.100
I mean, giving a talk at
Google, it's very tempting

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.200
to say something about
attempts to come up

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.340
with artificial systems
that are relevant.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.420
And I think what evolution
had to do that was a big deal

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.740
in this area was take quasi
autonomous cells that can sense

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.680
and signal and interact in
certain ways and that have

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.040
a kind of subject-like status
in a very minimal sense

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.200
on their own and coordinate
them such that the sort of proto

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.250
subjectivity of those
parts becomes sort of--

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.230
subsumed might not be
quite the right word,

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.520
but it'll do for now--

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.580
into the subjectivity of
the collective that results.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.520
I think classical
AI did not think

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.130
about the problem
like that at all

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.650
and even contemporary
robotics tends

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.650
to start from a more sort of
straightforwardly centralized

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.270
organization.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.120
And I certainly think it will
be intriguing to sort of think

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.260
about the problem via the same
path by which evolution thought

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:51.370
about the problem,
which is unity

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:54.370
and collectivity with respect
to systems of that kind.

00:33:58.092 --> 00:33:58.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.830
It's been a great talk.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.115
So-- oh sorry.

00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:03.490
PETER GODFREY-SMITH:
That's fine.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.150
Please go ahead.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:04.691
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.530
A lot of what I've been reading
about intelligence from sort

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.860
of a neuroscience point
of view seems to me

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.360
to lead in the direction of
saying that intelligence as we

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.520
understand it is sort
of irreducibly social.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:28.360
I mean, I think the
signaling aspect

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:33.100
and this idea of a
sense of self coming out

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.230
of a model of others.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.780
And so I'm intrigued because
it seems that these animals are

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.330
capable of very, very
complex signaling,

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.489
but also you said
they're not very social.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:50.770
So I wonder how much do you
think their intelligence is

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:58.180
social, is engaged in signaling
and sensing the other animals.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.415
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: I think for
the most part, cephalopod are

00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:05.260
a lesson pushing against those
highly socialized conceptions

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.330
of intelligence that are very
popular in many theoretical

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.040
domains at the moment.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.950
So I mean, as a philosopher
much of the time,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.490
there are some philosophers
who emphasize this sort of

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.740
to and fro of sociality and
there are some philosophers who

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.400
emphasize the richness of
the individual's experience

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.780
and of particularity.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.660
And cephalopods are sort
of with the second group,

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.490
they're with William James, a
sort of individualist style.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.580
And I think that's just
something we learn from them.

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.900
We learn that by means of
some kind of combination

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.710
of the challenges of living
the lives they live where

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.800
they're soft-bodied, they're
prey for anything of a decent

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.470
size in the sea,
they're also predators--

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.110
they have to get around,
they have to be continually

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.380
exploring and looking for food--

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.680
and with their bodies that are
both so rich with possibility

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.810
but so hard to
control, I think we

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.340
learned that and
that's enough just

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.680
to build a very big and
complex nervous system.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.160
Once you have that big and
complex nervous system,

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.910
it appears that if you
put a bunch of them

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.580
together in an unusually high
density setting, they all--

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.820
here I'm going beyond what I can
back up scientifically so I'm

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.320
being very speculative.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.090
I think a lot of the
signaling behaviors

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:31.590
that we see at Octopolus,
the site in Australia,

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.840
are a kind of
improvised sociality.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.910
I think the animals
sort of work out a way

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.280
with their general
cleverness to interact

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.360
in ways that are not too sort
of destructive and chaotic.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.140
So I think they are sort
of a case on that side.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.930
Just while we're talking about
the ways in which they push

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.170
against the familiar ways
of talking about or thinking

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:56.160
about the advantages in
evolutionary terms of having

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.770
a large brain and
high intelligence,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.480
the other weird thing
about these animals

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.620
is their lives are so short.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.880
An octopus is dead
usually within two years,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.140
which is astounding.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.540
So in two years, they kind of
rush through their early stages

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.180
and acquire quite a
large body in many cases.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.980
Even the giant
Pacific octopus, which

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.140
is several hundred pounds of
octopus, that can live often

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.070
to about four years,
but that's about it

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.910
and that's the biggest
octopus of the species known.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:30.390
No one knows the lifespan of
the giant squid, the really

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.180
colossal squid, but it's thought
to be of the same kind of order

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.190
of five years or so.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:38.520
So they rush through their
lives and that would normally

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.060
be thought to be something that
tells against the advantage

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.620
of developing a large brain.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.040
All that learning, you've got
no time to put it to any use.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.160
So it just compounds
the puzzle in many ways.

00:37:53.456 --> 00:37:55.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
this very interesting talk.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.560
So what do you think about the
correlation between parenting

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.180
and intelligence?

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.110
Because octopi do have
kind of parenting.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.360
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: Not of
the sort that should help.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.310
That's sort of the perfect--

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.184
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it is
some kind of parenting.

00:38:11.184 --> 00:38:14.322
When you care about your young--

00:38:14.322 --> 00:38:16.030
PETER GODFREY-SMITH:
Only about the eggs.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.655
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:16.655 --> 00:38:18.430
PETER GODFREY-SMITH:
So this is exactly

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.010
the right sort of next
puzzle to sort of mention

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.140
after the previous
gentleman's questions.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.110
So in many animals
that are smart,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.750
you have significant
parental care

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.760
and the guidance of
the next generation

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.920
along the first steps.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.710
With octopuses in general,
I'll mention an exception

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.330
a couple of exceptions in a
moment, the general pattern

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:45.340
is the female octopus
lays some eggs

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.190
and she tends and
broods them and fans

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.220
them to get exactly the right
level of oxygen in the water

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.960
that they're interacting with.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.050
And the eggs hatch
and the larvae

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.080
float away as plankton and
that's it and she never

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.400
sees them again.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.060
So there's care in the sense
of the eggs are not abandoned.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.060
Cuttlefish eggs, by
the way, are abandoned.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.040
So the female
cuttlefish lays eggs

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.600
often on the underside of a
ledge and then just goes off

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.130
and those eggs will hatch.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.830
They're much more larger
and better provisioned

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.710
than octopus eggs and
they're a bit more robust.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.480
But when they hatch, the
parents are long gone--

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.150
dead, in fact.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.726
And with octopuses,
there's a bit more care,

00:39:28.726 --> 00:39:30.100
but not care that
you would think

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.280
would help with the sort of
intellectual side of life

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:33.850
very much.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.680
Because once the eggs hatch,
the larvae just become plankton.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.330
Now, there are a few
exceptions where the larvae

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.390
may at least settle locally.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.950
The larvae are larger when
the eggs hatch and don't just

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.480
float away and become plankton.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.020
Not very much is
known about them.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.890
There are a few sort of
larger-eyed octopuses.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.170
But I think in
general, the picture

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.580
is if you're an octopus, from
the day that you're hatching

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.160
from the egg, you're
pretty much on your own

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.360
and your days are numbered.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.084
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the tree structure of life

00:40:16.084 --> 00:40:18.250
and you mentioned in some
cases there are junctions.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.336
I wonder if you could
mention an example of this.

00:40:20.336 --> 00:40:21.460
PETER GODFREY-SMITH: Right.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.920
So once you get to
animals, genuine junctions

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.180
tend not to occur.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.850
But in single-celled
life, so in bacteria,

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.690
you have a quite
different shape.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.950
I mean, the tree metaphor
or the tree model

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.540
doesn't apply particularly
well to bacteria.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.810
They're continually exchanging
bits and pieces of DNA

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.845
in a kind of freeway.

00:40:45.845 --> 00:40:49.330
The eukaryotic cells
that make up our bodies

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.460
are the products
of an event where

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:57.730
one ancient prokaryotic
cell essentially swallowed

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.310
another and the two of them
came to live as a unit.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:05.190
So that's a kind of
merging in the tree where

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.650
all the cells in your body are
descended from a merging event

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.710
that took place probably
perhaps something like 1.8

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.160
billion years or so ago.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.190
So if you think about the tree
of life in a more exact way,

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.300
you should think
that it's a network.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:28.090
The network in its old and
unicellular domains or regions

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.870
has a sort of a somewhat
haphazard not really tree-like,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.880
but more complex structure.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.520
And in some groups,
especially animals,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.790
the thing sort of evolves
into a more definite tree

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.490
where you have
two-way branchings

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:49.430
and few or no rejoicings.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.350
So the full picture
is not quite a tree,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.090
but we animals, we form
a pretty good tree.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.960
OK.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.904
There's time for one more if
anyone would like to pop up.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.680
AUDIENCE: So you
had an illustration

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.195
of the common ancestor of
the octopus and mammals.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.560
From my perspective when
I look at an octopus,

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.480
it seems to have a lot of
similarities with mammals just

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.970
in terms of the
level of advancement

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.630
and complexity and
some things like you

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.050
mentioned the design of
the eye are quite similar.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.260
How much of that
do you think was

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.730
latent in the DNA
versus how much of that

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:53.360
was truly independent because
it was required in the same way?

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.630
Do you think that there
were independent mutations

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.884
in the DNA that were
independently selected for?

00:42:59.884 --> 00:43:01.800
PETER GODFREY-SMITH:
It's a very good question

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.470
and the word you
used, latent, I think

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.220
is exactly the right
way to ask the question.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.460
So you have some
similarities of design

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.770
in the present coming
from something that looks

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.930
very different in the past.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.900
And there's a school
of thought in biology

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.150
that I think would
answer your question

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.324
with a kind of emphatic yes.

00:43:21.324 --> 00:43:22.490
They'd say, oh, yeah, right.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.020
They look very
different, but there

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.750
was a kind of
architecture that was

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:31.040
kind of latent in a way in the
first bilaterally symmetrical

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.540
animals with a certain
kind of head to tail axis,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.060
a certain organization
of the relationship

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.250
between the nervous
system and the rest.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:44.450
And you know you should
think of the subsequent

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:49.370
unfolding down the two
lines as just variations

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.600
on a theme in a way and a
theme that was set down early.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.372
That's one kind of
school of thought.

00:43:55.372 --> 00:43:57.080
I'm describing this
a bit metaphorically,

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.716
I think it's clear in this case.

00:43:59.716 --> 00:44:01.340
Then there is another,
and in some ways

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.590
more traditional school of
thought, that says, look,

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:07.130
evolution can do anything it
pretty much wants with bodies.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.170
And you start with
something very simple,

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:13.770
and the fact that you have
certain similarities here

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.520
and here means that natural
selection disfavored

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.580
similar things and there were
mutations occurring quite

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.120
independently, quite
different in character

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.460
that built a similar structure.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.240
Now, in the case of
having an eye with a lens,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.830
the second view is
certainly right.

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.500
So there's no sense in
which the eye lens was

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.680
latent in the common ancestor.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.840
And octopus lenses
and vertebrate lenses

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.690
are built from different stuff,
they have a different role.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.870
So one distorts and one moves.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:50.330
So camera lenses don't
distort, they move.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:54.440
Some animal lenses distort, they
change shape, and some of them

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.510
move.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.480
But the presence
of an eye at all

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.660
in the animal, forget the lens
and the particular structure,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.720
but just whether you have
light sensitive things

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.450
roughly where they are,
plenty of biologists

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.810
think oh, yes, that
was probably laid down

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.380
and it's not something that
was independently invented,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.750
it's something that
was laid down one time.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.970
So I mean, my
expertise, such as it

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.800
is, is such that I can't
give a sort of richer

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.890
answer to the question than
that because what you're putting

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.220
your finger on there is a part
of biology which is intensely

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.110
and actively debated
and there are

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.835
different reasonable positions.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:39.290
OK.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.270
It's about five to.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.940
Natural to wrap up
right about now?

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.440
OK.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.040
Thanks.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.790
[APPLAUSE]
