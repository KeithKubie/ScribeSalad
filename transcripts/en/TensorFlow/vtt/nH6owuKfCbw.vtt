00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:06.765
Hi everyone.

00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:08.974
Now I was going to talk to you

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.714
about my plans to reanimate
dinosaurs with TensorFlow,

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:15.804
but I didn't want
to steal those guys' thunder.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.554
Actually I'm here to talk
about Open Source collaboration

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.164
in the TensorFlow project.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:22.576
That's my job at Google,

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:26.446
to work on growing the participation
and the collaboration

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:28.676
in the project in the whole community.

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:32.797
So you guys all here and everybody
watching on the live stream

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:34.507
are a huge part of this already.

00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:36.527
If you saw a slide like this

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:38.564
at the beginning
of the day in Rajat's keynote

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.714
you'll have seen the numbers
have already ticked up.

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:43.464
In fact in the five days
I've been monitoring this slide

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:44.784
I've kept increasing the numbers

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:48.774
because the amount of participation
on TensorFlow is kind of staggering.

00:00:49.434 --> 00:00:53.080
As an Open Source project it blows
my mind when I came to work on it.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.399
So much of that
is due to the participation

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.459
of everybody here in the community.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.608
There are parts of TensorFlow
that wouldn't exist,

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:04.727
many of them,
without that collaboration.

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:06.634
For instance, whether
it's spark connectors,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.822
whether it's support for particular
architectures and accelerators,

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.122
or maybe certain language bindings.

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:17.412
We don't only benefit from a huge amount
of adoption by being Open Source

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:19.252
but, as the adoption grows,

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:21.852
this is the way we sustain
and grow the project.

00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:25.803
You saw this map earlier as well.

00:01:25.803 --> 00:01:28.725
This is just some of the github stars

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:31.965
that gave their locations
that we could map,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:36.471
as far north as Norway
and as far south as the Antarctic.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.108
And what is really obvious right here now

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:42.408
is that although there is a large team
at Google developing TensorFlow

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:47.368
there are far many more people outside
in far many more places who are using it.

00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.696
And the truth of a popular
Open Source project

00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:52.566
is the more adoption, there's more demand.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.914
There's so much for us all
to do together to grow TensorFlow.

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:01.680
Now, do you ever have that thing
when you show up at a party

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.520
and everyone's having a good time

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.270
and they all seem to know
what they're doing and why it's such fun.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.233
But who am I going to talk to
and what are they all looking at?

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:14.672
Sometimes a large Open Source
project can be a bit like that.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:18.265
You want to get involved in contributing
to TensorFlow but where do you start?

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.717
You think this module,
this feature over here,

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:23.674
is something that you want to work on

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:26.424
but who do you find, where do you find
the right person to talk to?

00:02:26.424 --> 00:02:29.582
How do you learn, what we're
thinking about, the direction for this.

00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:33.861
So we've heard some
of those things from you.

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:37.306
We recognize that we want
to improve our openness,

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:40.216
our transparency and our participation.

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:43.457
We're trying to work on making it easier
to get involved in TensorFlow.

00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:45.896
We've already, for instance,
refreshed our road map

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:47.876
which you can find
on the TensorFlow website

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.059
about the general direction
of a lot of the code

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.292
and we'll do that a lot more regularly.

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:56.015
But I want to talk about four initiatives
that we have going

00:02:56.015 --> 00:03:00.405
that will enable us all to work
together more effectively and faster.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.768
The first of these is simple,

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.288
it's essential community

00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:08.898
for everybody who's working
on contributing to TensorFlow.

00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:12.096
Github has so much energy going on,

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:14.886
there's so much great debate
in all the issues if you look in there

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:18.869
and the pull requests, really thoughtful
conversations and contributions.

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.120
Thank you for your input in that
and thank you for being part of that.

00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:25.529
But what we don't have is a central place
where we can collaborate.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:29.220
So what we'll be bringing online,
in fact you can go and subscribe now,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.300
is a mailing-list:
<i>developers@tensorflow.org</i>.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.228
And that's a place for contributors
to TensorFlow to work together.

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:39.827
So, if you're contributing to TensorFlow
or want to contribute towards TensorFlow,

00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:45.047
go and join and we can work together
as a community to discuss design ideas,

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:47.997
to get feedback, to coordinate together.

00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:51.418
And many of the projects you've heard
about today have mailing lists

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.758
that you can also find
at <i>tensorflow.org/community</i>

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:57.707
Whether it's <i>TF Lite</i> or <i>TensorFlow.js</i>

00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:02.038
So that's collaboration.

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:06.167
Nobody talked about the fact
that there are many use cases

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:10.237
outside of Google
that the core team just don't see.

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:11.538
In fact, many more.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:14.317
Much more happens outside
than inside the core team.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:17.459
So we want to make it possible

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.759
for people with shared interests
in a project to work together.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.285
This is where the beauty
of Open Source comes in.

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:25.058
How do we do that?

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:29.965
So we're setting up a structure for groups
to work on areas of TensorFlow together:

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:32.155
Special Interest Groups or SIGs.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:35.302
We've been piloting the first
of these for a few months now,

00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:37.142
this is called <i>SIG Build</i>,

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:41.332
and it's all about building,
packaging, and distributing TensorFlow.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:45.122
Familiar with TensorFlow,
you'll know we build it in a certain way.

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.222
Well guess what, not every
architecture, not every application

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:50.262
finds that the best way for them.

00:04:50.262 --> 00:04:52.562
For instance, Linux distributions

00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:55.421
want to build against the shared
libraries in the distribution,

00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:56.971
that's not something we do.

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.471
So we've brought together

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.521
a bunch of stakeholders
of the Linux distributions,

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:05.991
companies like SUSE, Canonical, Red Hat,
companies like IBM, NVIDIA, Intel

00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:10.671
to collaborate in a group that will look
at the build of TensorFlow

00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:13.611
and make that work more effectively
for more people in the future.

00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.562
That's just one group, the pilot,
and we want to pave the cow paths.

00:05:18.562 --> 00:05:20.083
So where there is energy

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.533
and where there are people
collaborating on a particular thing

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.953
that's a great candidate for bringing
a Special Interest Group together.

00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:29.031
This week we're also bringing online
a group for TensorBoard

00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:31.781
where key stakeholders
of the TensorBoard ecosystem

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.937
can focus on design and collaboration

00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:36.817
and also for the Rust language bindings

00:05:36.817 --> 00:05:40.224
which is a completely
community-driven part of TensorFlow.

00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:43.699
Each SIG is going to have
a different personality,

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.999
a different way of working,
a different community,

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.259
but the common thing is
we're going to provide forums

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.639
where if you have a shared
interest in TensorFlow

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.349
in a particular area,
we can focus on it.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.694
Now I'd like to talk
about the design of TensorFlow.

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:03.392
One of the most amazing things
and the benefits of TensorFlow

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:05.232
is that the code that we release

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:08.352
is the code that Google
uses on a daily basis.

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:11.313
That's kind of remarkable
for an Open Source project.

00:06:11.974 --> 00:06:15.023
So we're really careful about changes,
we're really careful about design.

00:06:16.234 --> 00:06:20.573
We have a commitment obviously
to the API through the 1.x series release.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.342
And we have design reviews internally.

00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:26.701
So when things change
and we have proposals, we get feedback.

00:06:28.205 --> 00:06:30.001
But by now you're thinking,

00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:33.691
"Well you just said that so many use cases
and so many users are outside of Google,

00:06:33.691 --> 00:06:35.721
yet you're having
these design reviews inside."

00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.123
So what we're going to do
is open up a public feedback phase

00:06:40.123 --> 00:06:44.713
to our design process so we can engage
much more broadly with every contributor,

00:06:44.713 --> 00:06:49.233
every user about how that might affect
their needs and what their opinions are.

00:06:51.493 --> 00:06:53.850
Keep an eye
on the <i>developers@tensorflow.org</i>

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.170
mailing list for this
because that's where we'll notify it

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.140
coming online
in the next couple of months.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.829
My hope is that this process
will also be a way that everybody

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:04.369
can communicate
and discuss in a known process

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:06.359
about the future direction of TensorFlow

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.779
whether you're in the core team here
at Google or in the broader community.

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:19.007
So contributing to TensorFlow
isn't just about issues or PR requests.

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:22.537
In fact, I would say, I reckon that there's
so much more probably more energy

00:07:22.537 --> 00:07:26.507
going into people who are blogging,
running meet-ups, doing presentations,

00:07:26.507 --> 00:07:29.877
teaching, doing courses,
in so many universities around the world.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.541
We want to amp up
and support the amount of content

00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:36.231
that educates and highlights TensorFlow.

00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:41.140
So we're really excited already
that so many of you do such amazing jobs

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.110
and we'd like to be able to point
everybody in the TensorFlow community

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.550
to the work that you're doing.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.870
So there's a couple of things
that we've launched to support this.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:51.570
The first you've probably already heard.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.839
We now have a blog for TensorFlow
at <i>blog.tensorflow.org</i>

00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:59.048
One of the things that I'm most
excited about with this blog

00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:03.058
is that as well as important announcements
and education that we can put out,

00:08:03.058 --> 00:08:04.878
we're setting it up from the beginning

00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:08.548
to involve content from around
the web and the community.

00:08:08.548 --> 00:08:11.799
That's one reason we're using the Medium
platform for this to make it easy

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:14.689
for us to integrate content
from around the web

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:17.779
and still give you the credit
for the work you've done.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.522
So we'd really like to hear from you.

00:08:19.522 --> 00:08:20.712
If you have a blog post,

00:08:20.712 --> 00:08:23.512
an article you want
to get into the TensorFlow publication,

00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:24.810
get in touch.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.902
Secondly, and if you're
on the live stream watching us,

00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:31.352
you've kind of found out about this,

00:08:31.352 --> 00:08:33.832
we have a YouTube channel
that's launched today.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.111
Now one of the things
I'm most excited about in this

00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.871
is a show called <i>TensorFlow Meets</i>.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:42.403
This is where we were able to get out

00:08:42.403 --> 00:08:47.253
into the world of contributors and users
and really highlight some of the use cases,

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.113
highlight the work of everybody.

00:08:49.113 --> 00:08:50.831
Again this is a chance for you, too.

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:53.095
We'd love to meet you,
we'd love to chat with you

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.635
about what you're up to, and have you
featured on the YouTube channel.

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:59.766
Again, reach out to us
we'd love you to be a part of it.

00:09:03.806 --> 00:09:07.176
There is one URL to get involved
in all these things that I've mentioned

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:09.576
<i>tensorflow.org/community</i>

00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:13.402
So if anyone's mentioned a mailing list,
or a group, or something about that today,

00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:17.578
please go that URL
and you'll find resources there.

00:09:18.478 --> 00:09:21.415
It's my hope that TensorFlow's
going to continue to be a party

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:25.593
but maybe one you can find yourself
part of a lot sooner and have more fun.

00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:29.692
Please feel free to reach out to me.

00:09:29.692 --> 00:09:34.127
There's my email address: ewj@google.com
and talk to me about anything

00:09:34.127 --> 00:09:36.157
to do with your experiences
in collaborating,

00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:38.277
around Open Source, and TensorFlow.

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.346
I'd love to hear about it.
Thank you so much.

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.317
