00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.110
Concrete vs Cement

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.270
Have you ever wondered what the difference
is between cement and concrete?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.950
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
In general terms, the word cement refers to
any kind of binder that tightly holds other

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.360
materials together.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.770
Concrete, on the other hand, is a mixture
of materials like sand, gravel, and small

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.580
rocks combined with any type of cement and
water.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.439
The concoction is then allowed to dry and
harden.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.000
Basically, concrete is the stone-like structure
formed after cement and other materials are

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
mixed together.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.690
The cement is just a part of the recipe.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.830
Cement has been used as a binder of materiel
for millenia.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.190
No one knows for sure who first came up with
the idea to use a cement substance to bind

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.260
materials together to make concrete, bricks,
and other building materials.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.710
The process can be traced back to Ancient
Macedonia, but was more widely popularized

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.220
during the Roman Empire.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.940
Early forms of cement used things like lime
and pozzolana, a type of volcanic ash.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.510
The Romans were able to produce massive structures
like the Pantheon and the Roman aqueducts

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.180
using this formula.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.420
Currently, cement comes in two forms: Hydraulic
and Non-Hydraulic.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.180
Hydraulic cement refers to any cement that
uses water to begin a chemical reaction that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.350
hardens the mixture and, when fully formed,
creates a water resistant product.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.010
This reaction is independent of the water
content of the mixture so allows for the material

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.110
to harden even underwater.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.270
This makes it a very versatile construction
material.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.250
Most all cements used today are hydraulic
cements.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.750
Non-hydraulic cement uses materials that do
not harden when exposed to water.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.620
While this type is much cheaper than hydraulic
cement, the problems of long drying times,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.980
combined with the inability to use it in wet
environments makes it a poor choice in most

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.090
applications.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.920
The most common type of modern cement is portland
cement (sometimes referred to as OPC for “Ordinary

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.979
Portland Cement”).

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.940
This type of cement is typically made by grinding
small rock-like bits of sintered limestone

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.650
and aluminosilicate minerals into a very fine
powder.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.260
Its fast drying times combined with its higher
compression strength compared to other cements,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.560
makes it a great choice for use in concrete,
mortar, grout, and stucco.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.869
Concrete is a mixture of cement, water, and
aggregates.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.680
Aggregates make up approximately 60-75% of
the mixture and cement and water make up the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.780
rest.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.100
Aggregates are usually inert course materials
like gravel, crushed stone, sand, or recycled

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100
concrete.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.510
The type of aggregate selected depends on
the application of the concrete.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.349
Given that concrete starts out as a semi-liquid,
has great weather proof properties, and high

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.260
strength, its applications for use in construction
are almost endless.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.000
The benefits of concrete include its durability,
fire-resistance, low maintenance, energy efficiency

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.670
and environmental friendliness.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.770
In fact, concrete is the most widely used
man made material on earth.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.560
From all this, it’s easy to see why some
people would use the terms cement and concrete

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.730
interchangeably.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.300
One is a main ingredient in the other.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.770
Bonus Facts:
• “Concrete” comes from the word “Concretus”

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.830
which is Latin for “compact or condensed”.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.180
• On March 21, 2011 Ed Byrne broke 55 concrete
blocks with his bare hands in 4.86 seconds,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.100
setting a new world record.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.390
The previous record for this same amount of
blocks was 17.49 seconds.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.220
• The Three Gorges Dam in China is the largest
concrete structure in the world.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.420
It contains 27.2 million cubic meters of concrete.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.910
The previous record was held by the Grand
Coulee Dam in Washington State, at 9 million

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.270
cubic meters of concrete, which is enough
to build an 8 foot wide sidewalk around the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:48.239
equator of 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.660
the Earth.
