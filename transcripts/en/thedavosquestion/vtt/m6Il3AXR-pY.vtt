00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
&gt;&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Abdullah Abdhullah, the
former Foreign Minister

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.269
of Afghanistan and also a candidate for the
presidency in Afghanistan.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.090
The issue of good education which is so important
not only as far as

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.450
eliminating poverty, but also providing a
secure environment and some

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:30.880
environment for the people to live.
World peace is mainly ignored by the donor

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.890
communities or sort of not
taken that serious.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.670
What's the reason for that?
First of all, I think that because it's not

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.109
so visible sort of
contribution, and it's not that much in the

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.460
scene.
So we would like to do things which are more

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.219
visible in the scene like
bigger projects.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.909
Any contribution in helping education, it's
an investment on the future

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.840
of our world.
I mean, it has to be taken as such.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.180
And in such, it has to be dealt with such
importance.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:23.641
And we should have a year which would be called
the year of education

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:29.500
for all.
And also the way to capping the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.630
which millions of people
are deprived from the education anything at

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.009
all.
Illiteracy is widespread in many parts of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.880
the world and try to tackle
the list of the problems is only dealing with

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.939
this the symptoms,
education is the key for our future well-being.
