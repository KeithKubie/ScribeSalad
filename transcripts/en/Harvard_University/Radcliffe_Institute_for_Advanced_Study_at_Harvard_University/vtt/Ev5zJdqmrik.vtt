00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.790
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.160
- OK, welcome back
to our conference

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.970
on Universities and Slavery.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.030
After this very powerful
and moving beginning

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.350
this morning, I'm delighted to
announce the first panel, which

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.820
is going to be on the
Universities and Slavery

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.710
in the United States.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.229
And I'm delighted
and honored to be

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.980
able to introduce my
colleague, my co-conspirator

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.450
in this project, and also
friend, Professor Evelyn

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.344
Higginbotham.

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:45.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.430
- Well, welcome.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.370
This is really a
wonderful morning.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.840
Few recent conversations
in academia

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.740
have elicited more publicity
than the conversation

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.160
on the historical relationship
between universities

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.480
and slavery.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.600
Inspired by Brown University's
President, Ruth Simmons

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.210
in 2003, the investigation into
the connections between slavery

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
and Brown prompted researchers
at many universities

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.600
to conduct similar studies.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
And so now we are well
over a decade later,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
and this research has
revealed many universities,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.030
southern and northern,
private and public,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.910
to have histories
tied to slavery.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.780
And we now know that slaves
worked on university campuses.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.520
And they were owned
by universities.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.010
Universities engaged in
the buying and selling

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.870
of enslaved workers,
and they drew

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.050
upon the profits of
their labor, and they

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.190
drew upon the profits generated
by the Atlantic slave trade.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.130
And the research on
universities and slavery

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.030
has also attracted widespread
controversy as we know,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.765
from articles written in the New
York Times and in other places.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:04.470
And so this panel on slavery
and universities nationally,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.710
will discuss those issues.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.380
We will hear from James
Campbell, formerly

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.190
at Brown University, and
now the Edgar E Robinson

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.460
Professor in the United
States history at Stanford.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.300
Our second panelist is Adam
Rothman, Professor of History

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.190
at Georgetown University.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.440
And finally, Craig Wilder,
the Barton L Weller Professor

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.590
of History at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.690
Now you can read their
full bios in your program.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.490
After their presentations,
and after our conversation,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.780
we will entertain questions
from you, from the audience,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.460
and index cards have been given
to every registered attendee

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.580
in Agassiz and in Knafel.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.850
And audience members should
write their questions

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.100
on index cards--

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.240
you can do that as
you're listening--

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.710
and there will be
staff members who

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.290
will walk quietly up
and down the aisles

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.570
to pick up your cards.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.530
And those cards have
different colors,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.980
so we want to make sure that we
get people from both locations,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.070
and that we will be able to
answer some of those questions.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.480
And in addition, we will be
taking questions from Twitter.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.040
And we are using the
hashtag unislavery--

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.730
can you see that?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.470
Hashtag unislavery, so
that people watching online

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.290
can submit questions.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.040
So let's start.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.840
Professor Campbell, you
played a pioneering role

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.980
in the study of slavery
and universities

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.170
with your work with
the leadership of Ruth

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.960
Simmons at Brown University.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.030
I'd love to hear
your reflections

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.300
on the particular
set of contingencies

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.450
that came together at Brown.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.010
And if you can
also share with us

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.970
your thoughts about the
politics of confronting

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.180
this difficult
matter at that time.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.460
- Well a couple of things.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.620
First of all, thank
you all for being here,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.790
and thanks for having me.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.080
The historically
contingent thing at Brown

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.130
has to do with the
reparations debate.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.560
And I'm going to go around a bit
of a mountain to get to this.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.875
But in 2001, 2002,
before Ruth Simmons

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.750
had become the President
of Brown University,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.400
but shortly after
her appointment

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.690
had been announced as the first
African-American president

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.660
of an Ivy League
university, there

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.270
was an advertisement that
was taken out-- a paid

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.280
advertisement in the
Brown Daily Herald

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.830
and a variety of other college
newspapers around the country

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.179
by a conservative columnist
named David Horowitz mocking

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:00.220
the reparations movement.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.530
It was called Ten Reasons
Why Reparations For Slavery

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.080
is a Bad Idea and Racist Too.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.270
And with all respect,
I think it was

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.450
meant to be a kind of
political provocation.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.430
It sort of was a series
of 10 escalating reasons,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.370
each of which was more
provocative, I guess,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.400
than the previous, that
African-Americans should

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.040
be grateful that their ancestors
were enslaved because they was

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.380
so much better off by virtue
of being here than being

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.440
in Africa, that reparations
had already been

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.080
paid in the form of welfare.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.960
That African-Americans
were not sufficiently

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.660
grateful to the white
Christians who freed them.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.710
And I think the 10th one was
that any disparities that

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.740
existed between black and white
people in the United States

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.890
today were not a function of
an institution that had ended

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.770
hundreds of years
ago-- his words--

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.250
but merely reflected black
people's own failures

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.290
of individual character.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.900
Well, if it was meant to
provoke a response, it did.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.060
It did on a number of campuses.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.550
At Brown he hit the jackpot,
where a group of students

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.110
incensed by it, demanded
that the editorial be

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.480
rescinded by the editors.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.940
When they refused,
this group of students

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.940
announced that they would
prevent the Brown Daily Herald

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.760
from circulating until such
time as the editors met

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.600
their demands.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.930
Well, I don't know if you can
steal something that's free,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.890
but the next day when the Brown
Daily Herald was distributed,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.440
there were protesters at each
of the distribution points

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.236
and they made off with
the day's press run.

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:31.610
And the day after
that, Brown was

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.901
on the front page of the New
York Times, the Washington

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.650
Post, the Wall Street Journal,
the Christian Science Monitor.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.560
It made the London
Times, MSNBC, BBC

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.500
News as an example
of an institution

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.050
where the students were
so politically correct

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.700
that when confronted with ideas
that made them uncomfortable,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.300
their only response was
to smash the presses.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.719
It was not a happy day
for the University.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.280
Given that background,
and it sort of

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.410
was a convulsion on
the campus that we

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.230
dealt with for some
number of weeks,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.870
one might have thought
that a president coming

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.810
to Brown at that moment,
very conspicuous given

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.930
the circumstances, would
have given this issue a very

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.160
wide berth, but Ruth, in
her courage and her vision,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.390
did precisely the opposite.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.460
Her very first speech
at Brown at Convocation,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.120
she reminded students that
universities were conflicted

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.240
places where we had to have
the courage to debate even

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.400
the most painful issues.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.280
And shortly thereafter,
she announced a commission

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.847
to actually investigate not only
Brown's historical relationship

00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:40.680
to slavery in the
Transatlantic slave trade,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.230
and to publish
the facts of that,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.610
but also to organize
public programs that

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.300
would help our students and
the nation reflect thoughtfully

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.720
in academically rigorous ways
on the complex legal, political,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.280
ethical, moral questions raised
by the slavery reparations

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.140
issue.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.460
This was an act of
transcendent courage.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.020
And when she did it,
she was all alone.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.070
And I must say, with respect to
all of the other institutions

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.770
that are engaged
with this work now,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.080
there wasn't a single peep
from another university

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.710
even suggesting that this was
an act worthy of a university.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.340
Sort of people just
kind of waited to see.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.490
And so I think the first
answer to your question

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.400
is that we're here because
of the courage of a rather

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.380
singular woman.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.760
But there's other
things as well.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.860
I was struck this
morning, just to broaden

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.350
the lens a little
bit, Dean Cohen,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.570
in her introduction talked
about how we are here

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.309
engaging urgent questions.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.740
And it's kind of interesting
to reflect as a historian

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.480
why a question
becomes urgent when

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.500
the matters about which you're
talking are centuries old.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.816
And there's a history here.

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:52.440
And it's kind of been
interesting to me

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.020
that our movement,
if I might call it

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.970
that, which is predicated on the
importance and value of history

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.670
has been so unselfconscious
about thinking

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.000
about its own
historical predicates.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.460
And so I'd like to just,
in a couple of minutes,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.650
suggest a few of them.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.130
Clearly the work we are
doing at universities

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.110
is part of a global movement.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.970
The period since the
Second World War,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.510
and certainly the last couple
of decades in particular,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.390
have seen a growing
international consensus

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.390
on the need for societies
to confront legacies

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.760
of gross historical injustice.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.350
And of the development
of a variety

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.590
of modalities for doing so.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.200
Truth commissions
being one, war crimes

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.340
tribunals, memorials,
monuments, reparations programs

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.040
of various kinds.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.020
So that global context I think
is really important here.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.200
I think that global context
also both reflects and feeds off

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.670
of other broad changes
in political culture.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.030
One is, and I don't have time
to elaborate this much, but is

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.960
what one might call the
therapeutic culture,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.730
particularly the emergence
of the trauma paradigm.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.630
So axiomatic is
it to us, the kind

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:18.360
of logic of PTSD, the idea
that events in our past that

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.150
are painful, if
left unaddressed can

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:27.225
continue to remain and hinder
and create dysfunction.

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:29.100
That it's hard for us
to remember that that's

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.840
a pretty novel concept.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.810
PTSD is only recognized in
the American Psychiatric

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:39.610
Association's DSM
I think in 1983.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.180
But it is now something that
we all just take axiomatically,

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.310
that if something traumatic
happens, you need to deal with.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.250
And what's been fascinating
in those years since 1983,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.700
and I think in interesting
ways rather uninterrogated,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.660
is the ways in which
what began as a diagnosis

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.210
for an individual
psyche has increasingly

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.062
become, through the
use of metaphor,

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:05.770
a way in which we talk
about collectives,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.570
and we talk about
entire human society.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.870
So we now routinely
talk about societies

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.570
having traumatic histories,
and about the need

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.970
to confront these
painful pasts in order

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.310
for the society to move forward.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.720
I don't offer this
comment as a skeptic.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.590
I think we need to think
carefully about it,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.230
but simply because
again, I think

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.790
is one of the contexts in which
these kind of investigations

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.800
become plausible.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.810
Another one very
briefly is, I think,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.120
what philosopher
Charles Taylor calls

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.370
the politics of recognition.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.610
The emergence and, at
least in Western societies,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.760
a shift in the way in
which rights claims, which

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.920
historically might
have been enunciated

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.930
in terms of individual's access
to certain basic civil rights

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.350
are increasingly
articulated in group terms,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.860
and in the right of people to
have the collective identities

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.490
that they cherished acknowledged
in the public sphere,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.750
including histories of trauma
or histories of violation.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.510
And I think that too, is
one of the contexts that

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.670
is behind the kind
of transformations

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.170
that we're seeing.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.090
And finally, and
this was obviously

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.050
germane to the thing at Brown,
is the reparations movement

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.520
itself.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:25.320
As Ta-Nehisi Coates mentioned
today, there's a long history,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.500
and it's one we're tied to at
Harvard from the Belinda Royall

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.020
petition, and
reparations demands

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.210
have been made and articulated
and movements have emerged off

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.660
and on for more than 200 years.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.420
But in the 1990s, inspired by
a series of settled lawsuits

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.760
involving Holocaust
reparations, a new front

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.810
was opened there in
which the idea was

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.930
to bring claims
against corporations

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.660
that had profited from slavery.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.910
And that was a new approach.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.360
And it was one that immediately
brought universities

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.850
to the center.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.440
And so I think, as you
might remember Yale,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.160
Harvard, Brown, all of them
were threatened with litigation.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.920
Some lawsuits were filed.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.550
In the end, those lawsuits
were consolidated and heard

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.720
in federal court in
2004 and thrown out.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.830
But, the fact is, that again,
when the events at Brown

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.850
happened, there were just a
host of broad developments

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.710
that had set the stage
for a kind of response

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.520
that seemed logical,
inevitable, even

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.989
though a generation
or two before nobody

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.030
would have thought of it.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.960
So I hope that helps.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.550
- Thank you, yes.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.480
Professor Rothman, Georgetown
has already been mentioned

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.330
and it offers perhaps
the most dramatic case,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.930
in recent years of a
university's coming to terms

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.440
with its past because of
the historical research

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.450
that was done.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.990
However, you have
identified, and indeed

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.020
you even emphasize the unique
role of memory in regard

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.040
to Georgetown's response.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.780
So talk to us about memory,
how you think about that

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.360
in relation to history.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.040
- Thanks very much.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.500
I should just begin by
saying it's a real honor

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.610
to be here, to be able to
discuss this issue that

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:29.160
is so important and so central
to the identities and politics

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.650
of our own institutions.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.090
I'm a historian of slavery
at an institution that

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.600
owes its existence to
the history of slavery.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.640
And I just think about
that all the time.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.800
I was a member of the
working group at Georgetown.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.860
The title of the working group
was the Work Group on Slavery,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.340
Memory, and Reconciliation.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.970
And I want to really focus
on that idea of the memory

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.770
of slavery at Georgetown.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.860
But to talk about memory, we
have to talk a little bit first

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.350
about the actual history.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.590
I'm sure many of you by now are
very familiar with the history

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.260
of Georgetown and slavery.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.320
That history is really a
microcosm of the entire history

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.690
of slavery in North America.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.820
Georgetown was founded in
1789 by Catholic and Jesuit

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.380
leadership in the Chesapeake,
especially in Maryland.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.200
That Catholic and
Jesuit leadership,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:36.630
that elite derived its wealth
and power from slave owning.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.160
The Maryland province
of the Society

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.850
of Jesus in the
18th century became

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.090
one of the largest slave owners
in the colony of Maryland.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.380
And the idea, when
Georgetown was founded,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:59.510
was that the the Jesuit farms
and plantations out in Maryland

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.570
would essentially
subsidize the educational,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:07.060
and religious mission
of the Catholic church.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.120
So there's a very
intimate relationship

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.545
between slavery and Georgetown.

00:16:10.545 --> 00:16:16.560
Georgetown is part-- was part
of a religious economy rooted

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.930
in slavery.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.560
Enslaved people
worked at Georgetown.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.990
Georgetown hired slaves
from neighboring owners

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.150
and from students.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.301
At one point in the 1810s, about
10% of all the people on campus

00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:34.800
were slaves.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.970
But after the War of 1812, as
the economy of slavery changes

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.650
in the Chesapeake,
the Jesuits begin

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.850
to debate what to
do with their slaves

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.560
because the plantations
were no longer profitable,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.610
they weren't making money.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.160
The Jesuits have
a 20-year debate

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.520
about what to do with
them, whether to free them,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.995
whether to sell them, whether
to send them to Liberia.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.700
These were all things
that were discussed.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.619
But ultimately, by the
1830s, the Jesuit leadership

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:17.824
decided to sell virtually
their entire inventory

00:17:17.824 --> 00:17:18.574
of human property.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.950
One of the reasons why
they decided to sell

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.076
was because Georgetown
was in debt--

00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:33.450
accumulated debt
through building

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.840
in the 1820s and 1830s.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.750
So the sale of the
slaves in the 1830s

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.140
actually kills two
birds with one stone.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.340
They sort of liquidate
their human assets

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.280
and at the same
time, raise capital

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.820
to resuscitate the
finances of the university.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.040
So when Mr. Coates
talks about the debt

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.370
that this country
has to slavery,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.980
that debt, with respect
to Georgetown University

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.480
is very real.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.770
You can actually
put a number on it.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.980
The Jesuit leadership
sold 272 people,

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.150
give or take, for
about $115,000 in 1838.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.270
And some of that money
flowed back to the University

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.340
to pay off the debts.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.760
That's the history
in a nutshell.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.930
But here's the thing, that
history was never a secret.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.010
Jesuit historians had
been writing about it

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.620
since the early 20th century.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.680
In the 1980s and 1990s, the
American Studies program

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.750
at Georgetown actually
integrated this history

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.000
into its curriculum.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.590
Some people around
the University

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.010
knew it, scholars wrote about
it, the bicentennial history

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.030
of the University written in
1989, discusses this history.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.960
It was never a secret.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.060
But it is also not widely known.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.480
So when President
DeGioia at Georgetown

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.800
initiated the working
group on slavery, memory,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.360
and reconciliation
at Georgetown,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.568
a lot of people around the
University and the broader

00:19:03.568 --> 00:19:08.440
public were just
shocked at this history

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.600
because they had no idea
that this had ever happened.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.490
And so when we
talk about memory,

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.354
I think we have to talk about--

00:19:17.354 --> 00:19:19.270
and this is to all the
scholars and the room--

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.600
we have to talk about the
failure of scholarship

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.270
to reach the broader public.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.230
We have not been successful
telling the stories

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.170
that we know are true.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.380
So I think part of the work
that we've been engaging in

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.060
in Georgetown is to try to
dig deeper into this history

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.680
and find out new things.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.490
But even more important perhaps,
to tell the story in ways

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.406
that make it known.

00:19:47.406 --> 00:19:48.155
So memory.

00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:51.950
How have we done that?

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.080
Well, partly just the
working group itself,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.270
excavating the history,
telling the story.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.850
We created a website called
the Georgetown Slavery

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.190
Archive, to put documents on the
web so people could see this,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.940
see the original
materials for themselves.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.790
It's one thing to be told
that the Jesuits sold

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.000
nearly 300 people.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.240
And it's another thing to see
the contract where their names

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.660
are listed from Isaac on down.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.110
So I think that is a way
of recovering that memory.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.870
The discussions that we've had
about the naming and renaming

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.480
of buildings, about
memorialization,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:33.350
all are about
resuscitating that memory.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.600
But memory is not
just about archives.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.559
It's about the uses of history.

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:39.350
It's about the fights
we have over history.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.130
And over the course of last
year, we had a couple of things

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.090
happen that really elevated
this history into a kind

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.490
of new level of consciousness.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.090
One was a series of protests
by students at Georgetown

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.850
last fall, insisting
among other things,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.730
that the names of
buildings that were

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.780
named after the architects
of the sale be changed.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.300
They did not want to live
with those names anymore.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.490
So that was an invocation
of a new form of memory.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.790
But we tried to find new
names for those buildings that

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.790
would not erase this
history but remind us

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.242
of this history in new ways.

00:21:19.242 --> 00:21:22.890
So I think that's
part of our challenge.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.840
The second thing
that happened, and I

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.173
think one of the things that
really makes the Georgetown

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:30.450
story so powerful, not
unique but powerful,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:36.270
is the revelation that so
many living descendants

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.360
of the people who
were sold in 1838

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.100
are walking among us today.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.010
They live in Louisiana
in a little town

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.150
where their ancestors
were sold in 1838.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.100
They live in New Orleans, in
Minnesota, and California.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.620
Some of them live in Maryland.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.910
Some of them are at
Georgetown today.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.160
We have to thank Rachel Swarns,
New York Times reporter,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.560
and Richard Cellini of the
Georgetown memory project

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.780
for really elevating that story
and making it an important part

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.490
of our own history.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:16.810
But I think that we
need to tell the story.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.360
We need to tell it accurately.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.670
We need to tell it thoroughly.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.160
And we need to find
new ways to tell it.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.470
That is part of the
process of reconciliation,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.430
which is the third
basket of ideas

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.860
that the working
group was operating

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.600
with-- reconciliation.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.470
Part of reconciliation
is telling the story,

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.420
not just having
historians write about it,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.220
but having playwright's
craft plays,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.020
and philosophers wrestle
with the question

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.420
of moral obligations
across time,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.470
and people studying economics
to look at the finances of it.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.350
Reconciliation involves
telling the story in new ways,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.910
incorporating new people's
perspectives and opinions

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:17.180
and archives to just develop a
much richer and more compelling

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:22.280
story that speaks to us today.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.980
That's what we try to
do on the working group.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.070
The working group is
actually concluded,

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.120
but the work continues.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.320
At Georgetown, in all
sorts of partnerships

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.310
with other institutions and
organizations and people,

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:43.500
this work of slavery memory
and reconciliation is not over.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.900
And our hope at Georgetown,
is that it's actually

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.500
just beginning.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.600
- Thank you.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.364
Thank you.

00:23:49.364 --> 00:23:51.780
Now Professor Wilder, you've
written a wonderful new book.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.640
And one of the concerns
that you have is obviously

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.530
related to what
we've just heard,

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.990
and that's about
the controversies in

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.540
regard to naming and renaming.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.450
So please talk about
the politics of this

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.710
and why naming has become such
a crucial part of activism.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:13.980
- Thank you.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.850
And thank you all for having me.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.510
It's been extraordinary
so far, and I

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.950
hope I don't make it less so.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:23.250
- That's my goal that's
what I'm shooting for.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.430
I want to go back in time to,
n part because I'm at Harvard,

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.384
so I want to talk a
bit about WB Dubois

00:24:32.384 --> 00:24:34.050
because you can't
have a conference here

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.690
without doing that, so
let's make sure it's done.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.960
Dubois' In Souls
of Black Folk has

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.870
an essay of Alexander
Crummell that I've read

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.920
dozens and dozens of times.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.360
I've taught it.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.940
It's become sort of a
part of the way I think

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.340
about the world, about
African-American history,

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.770
about the history of education.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.103
And it's an extraordinary essay.

00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:58.235
It begins in fact,
with this paragraph.

00:24:58.235 --> 00:25:01.270
"This is the history
of a human heart.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.620
The tale of a black boy, who
many long years ago began

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.440
to struggle with life that
he might know the world

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.810
and know himself.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.060
Three temptations he met
on those dark dunes that

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.480
lay gray and dismal before
the wonder eyes of the child.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.380
The temptation of hate that
stood out against the red dawn,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.680
the temptation of despair
that darkened the noon day,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.870
the temptation of doubt
that ever steals along

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.030
with twilight.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.950
Above all you must hear
of the vales he crossed,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.290
the valley of humiliation
and the valley

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.070
of the shadow of death."

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.070
It is hardly the
introduction that you

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.520
would expect to read to
a biography of someone's

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.950
educational journey,
but that's exactly

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.800
in fact, what Dubois offers.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.240
Dubois follows
Alexander Crummell

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.750
from his childhood in New York
in the old African school.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.790
He follows him and
two other teenagers

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.180
from New York City, who
journey alone up to Canaan,

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.820
New Hampshire to a school
that's willing to accept

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.750
black students.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.830
The school is surrounded by
a mob of 300 people on August

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.750
10th, 1835.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.090
The mob dresses the
building in ropes and chains

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.520
and spends the next
two days ripping it off

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.150
of its foundations,
dragging it through town,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.976
depositing it at the rear
end of a Baptist church.

00:26:14.976 --> 00:26:16.350
And then celebrates
their victory

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.570
by turning on the
children with guns,

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.810
and using a cannon to
chase them out of town

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.030
under the cover of night.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.424
He then follows Crummell
back to New York City.

00:26:27.424 --> 00:26:29.340
And yet again, on another
educational journey,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.910
this time up to
Petersboro, where

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.760
the abolitionist
Garrett Smith had

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.710
opened a school for black kids.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.330
He followed him
again to Oneida where

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.840
the radical white
minister, Boriah Green,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.550
had had a school
where he had promised

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.410
to take in a black student.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.060
He follows Crummell
back to New York.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.300
He follows him to
Yale, where apparently,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:56.910
like GWC Pennington, a fugitive
slave from Maryland, Crummell

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.620
was allowed to take
a course, but not

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.880
allowed to actually speak,
matriculate, get a degree,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.720
or participate in any other
formal way in the institution.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.360
He just follows him.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.310
The temptation, hate,
despair, and doubt framed

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.810
Dubois short
biography of Crummell.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.020
And Dubois will write, 'out
of the temptation of hate,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.570
and burned by the fire of
despair, triumph over doubt,

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.450
and steeled by the sacrifice
against humiliation,"

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.520
Crummell becomes, in
fact, the black leader

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.250
who Dubois meet in the
late 19th century in Ohio.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.970
The black man, the
black leader who

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.150
Dubois feels he can actually
bow before and really

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.032
come to understand.

00:27:37.032 --> 00:27:39.240
And one of the things I've
always found extraordinary

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.522
about that document is that
it repeats throughout much

00:27:43.522 --> 00:27:45.480
of Dubois' work, but it
repeats throughout much

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.130
of African-American history.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:52.050
This story, this narrative
arc of struggle and triumph,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.920
of trials and tribulations
and then success.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.750
In Dubois' 1928
novel, Dark Princess,

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.230
he does much the same thing.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:10.140
This time he has a black
medical student who he basically

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.900
positions him before the
dean of a new medical college

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.940
The student's in his
second year in the novel.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.240
And the whole administration
and the trustees

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.930
conspire to actually put
him out of medical school

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.850
and make sure that
he doesn't graduate.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.130
The novel then has the
young man basically

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.480
on a ship heading to Europe
where he falls in love with--

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.340
DuBois liked, in fact,
third world exoticism.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.525
So he falls in love with a
beautiful South Asian woman

00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:37.650
and the two of them join
the international struggle

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.670
against imperialism.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.220
- And so you have DuBois.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.720
But one of the things that
I've always been struck by,

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.350
and I should say that
character in Dark Princess

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.990
is actually based on the
very real black students who

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.800
came to Harvard Medical School,
including Martin Delaney, who

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.310
were actually conspired against
and removed from the school

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.660
before they graduated.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.580
And so it actually
involves in fact,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.940
DuBois' understanding of
African-American education

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.160
and African-American history.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.220
DuBois regularly reproduced
narratives of black struggle

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.670
and black sacrifice,
this sort of heroic theme

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.520
in African-American history that
repeats over and over again.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.460
He was fascinated by these
figures, many of us are.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.150
It's hard to read about
Anna Julia Cooper and others

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.880
without actually really
embracing this idea.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.340
And I know as a student, I did.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.940
I read Souls Of Black Folks,
and DuBois read himself

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.470
into Alexander Crummell.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.040
He came to understand his life
through Crummell's sacrifices.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:44.170
And I was very much attracted
to that same possibility

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.450
as an undergraduate.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.050
But now that I've
lost my hair, and I've

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.840
read that multiple
times since, there's

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.310
something else that I've found
much more troubling about it.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.579
That that sort of
triumphant story

00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:00.370
in African-American
history and the history

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.500
of African-American
education also

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.470
tends to normalize
black sacrifice,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.710
black struggle on our campuses.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.650
I was reminded last night
of the demands and protests

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.400
of law students at Harvard
around the royal seal,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.930
the crest on the
Harvard Law School seal.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.360
We can also remind
ourselves of the fact that

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.300
since the Brown report,
since Ruth Simmons'

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.540
extraordinary courage and
opening up this conversation

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.110
and challenging, not just
Brown, but all of Brown's peer

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.150
institutions to
take a close look

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:39.250
at the relationship between
those institutions and slavery.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.140
One of the groups
that has helped

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.940
to keep the
conversation alive has

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.550
been students on our campuses.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.500
Very often black
students on our campuses,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.797
but not only black
students on our campuses.

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:51.880
Student protests and student
struggles have helped

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.680
to actually keep us honest.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.160
They've brought our institutions
into a confrontation

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.800
with history that
we're now challenged

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.540
to wrestle with ourselves.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.870
And so one of the things I
want to take from WB DuBois

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.700
description of the
glory of black struggle

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.920
and black sacrifice
is the possibility

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.710
that perhaps it's time
for us to stop that.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.830
And perhaps it's time for us
to really take responsibility

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.680
for our own histories, our
faculties, our trustees,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.700
our administrators to confront
that past and actually,

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.000
rather than depending upon
our students yet again--

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.840
we're about to approach
the 200th anniversary

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.120
of the graduation of
the first black student

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.250
from a United States college.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.060
And that's 200 years
of triumphant stories.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.790
It's time to stop
that narrative arc.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.650
It's time for us
to actually take up

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.840
the burden of social
justice on our campuses

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.240
rather than transferring
it to our students.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.030
It's time for us to support the
students in the most direct way

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.760
that we can, which is
by actually living up

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.150
to the values that we
define ourselves by.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:03.190
And rather than having our
students rescue us and address

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.510
our past, perhaps take this
opportunity to really take

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.690
a close reading of ourselves,
understand the moment that

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.970
we're in, and give
our students--

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.660
this next generation,
the kind of--

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.050
address one of the central
demands of student movements,

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.290
which is the right to exist
on these campuses in dignity,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:31.290
without the burden of actually
being insulted, demeaned,

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.640
or actually placed in positions,
situations, and contexts

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.250
that are by definition
insulting and demeaning

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.070
because they're by
definition dishonest.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.376
Thank you.

00:32:42.376 --> 00:32:51.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.560
- Well, thank you.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.570
So now, I'm always curious
about these kind of projects,

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:01.950
when we get involved and we get
so intensely involved, there's

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.580
always something that is
absolutely surprising that we

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.020
discover or striking
that we discover.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.611
I'd like to your stories.

00:33:12.611 --> 00:33:13.110
- Sure.

00:33:16.422 --> 00:33:18.880
I'll start by telling a few
things that didn't surprise me.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.100
It didn't surprise me
that the day after Brown

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.960
press released what
we were intending

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.910
to do that there was a
chorus of denunciations

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.360
about a black woman
president who'd lost her mind

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.730
and was about to cash
out Brown's endowment

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:41.530
and give it out and reparations
checks to her friends.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.880
I knew that there would
be a political backlash

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.020
and I wasn't surprised by that.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.270
I wasn't surprised by the
fact that other universities

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.380
would eventually join.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.660
One of the very
first conversations

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.010
I had with Simmons about
this I said, people

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.410
are going to come after you.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.410
And she said, look, as
long as what we are doing

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.480
is constant with the
values of the university,

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.490
they can't touch us.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.710
But this is what
universities are.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.050
If you don't like
universities, don't come.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.750
But don't tell universities
that they can't investigate

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.460
their own histories,
that they don't

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.340
have a linkage to their pasts.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.370
To be a part of a university is
to exist in the community that

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.710
exists across time,
a procession that

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.290
started before we got here and
will continue long after we're

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.179
gone.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.330
And so universities
are also places

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.909
that are set up to engage
difficult questions.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.750
So I think a lot of what
we tried to do at Brown

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.840
was if we just made it clear
that what we were doing

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.540
was in keeping with the
values that we profess

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.600
as institutions, that
it would soon enough,

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.449
the question would not be why
would one university do this,

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.810
it would be how could a
university not investigate

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:53.830
this.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.100
I'll tell you one thing that
did surprise me was discovering

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.560
that we were late to the party.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.712
That the questions about what
the university's relationship

00:35:04.712 --> 00:35:06.670
to slavery in the
Transatlantic slave trade was

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:11.860
was in fact, one that had been
debated on our campus almost

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.520
from its beginning, most
notably in the case of the Brown

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.700
brothers themselves.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.599
If you've read the
report, you know--

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:22.390
by the standards of
Rhode Island merchants,

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.630
the Brown brothers were not
big players in the trade.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.630
But they did send two
slave ships to Africa,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.510
both were disasters, after
which three of the four

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.460
never engaged in
the trade again.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.540
And one of them,
Moses Brown became

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.520
one of the founders
of the movement

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.310
to abolish the
Transatlantic slave trade.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.130
The first prosecution
for illegal slave trading

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.500
in the United States
federal courts

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.380
is a prosecution of John Brown
brought by his younger brother

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.030
Moses.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.030
So you realize that
in fact, that this

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.490
was an-- and the
correspondence between them

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.650
is in our archives.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.800
And you realize that in fact,
they've been debating this.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.330
You realize that
in fact, there were

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.810
a series of subsequent cases
in which members of the Brown

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:09.850
board of trustees were
bringing prosecutions

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.390
against other members of
the Brown board of trustees.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:16.300
You've probably been in
contentious corporation

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.230
meetings, but maybe never
quite as contentious as this.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.650
There was one
moment, the students

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:27.550
too talked about this, and
so just one quick anecdote.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.220
I got a phone call one day
from one of the university

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.490
archivists who said, we have
all these Brown commencement

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.270
addresses delivered by students,
would you like to see them.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.060
Maybe some of them
talk about slavery.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.790
And so he sent them
to me in digital form,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:46.180
and one of them I recognized
was James Tallmadge

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.399
Now if you're
American historian,

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:50.440
he's the author of The
Tallmadge Amendment, which

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:56.650
precipitates the Missouri
crisis in 1819, a congressman.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.590
And James Tallmadge gave the
Brown commencement address,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.650
I think it's 1794,
I could be wrong.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.580
And he says, I
take as my subject

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.930
the subject of this
barbarous traffic.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.200
And you've got to imagine half
the people in the audience

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.070
are merchants participating
in the slave trade.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.490
And he works through,
just eloquently and quite

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:25.360
satirically in some
cases, a set of arguments

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.760
that are advanced in
support of this traffic

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.500
and knocks them down.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.350
And he ends by saying, but
the most absurd one of all

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.350
is this newfangled
idea that somehow

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.380
a person with darker skin is
inferior to a person of lighter

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.270
skin.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.220
An idea, he says, which if
taken to its logical conclusion,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.960
would make the most powerful
Washington subject--

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.170
a man as virtuous as Washington
subject to a puny albino.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:59.170
And he says, this idea is a
matter for future generations

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.150
to investigate.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.920
And I remember reading that.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.400
It was late at night and
I was sitting by myself

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.670
and I just started to cry
because it was that somebody

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.380
had left a message in a bottle.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.030
And so that discovery that
we were not, as some allege,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:20.110
projecting our values on some
past and you couldn't-- we were

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.260
in fact, engaging a past in
precisely the terms that they

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.790
had given us.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.465
And we were re-entering
a conversation

00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:30.640
that'd been going on campus
for a really long time.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.280
And that surprised me and,
in its way, delighted me.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.140
- I'll tell a story that
also ends with me crying.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.854
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:45.854 --> 00:38:47.270
- The most surprising
thing for me

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.410
has really been just
the emotional power

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:56.130
that is vested in
archival material

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:03.410
in the way that sort of springs
out at unexpected times.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.550
So a lot of what I was
doing on the working group

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.600
was just digging into a
collection called the Maryland

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.480
Province Archives, which is 130
odd boxes of material produced

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.340
by the Jesuits over a
couple of centuries.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.860
And quite a lot of
material in there

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.600
has to do with Jesuit
slave holding--

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.630
their attitudes towards
slaves, sacramental

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:32.960
registers that contain
records of the baptism

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.870
and marriage and
burial of slaves

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.580
on the Jesuit
plantations, and even

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.557
in some cases at the college.

00:39:40.557 --> 00:39:42.140
And it's really
remarkable-- it's just

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.390
remarkable historical material.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.810
If you're a
historian of slavery,

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.620
it's really an amazing resource.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.160
I'm fully convinced
that the sale in 1838

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:58.310
is the single best
documented mass sale

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:02.060
of people in the history of
the domestic slave trade.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.530
So it's a really
valuable resource

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.780
for historical research.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.080
Last April, during
our emancipation week

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.670
at Georgetown, we culminated
or our series of--

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.370
culminated our University-wide
event sponsored by the working

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.460
group with a series
of talks and lectures,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.239
talking about the history
of slavery at Georgetown,

00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:26.030
and more generally.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:30.770
And I gave a presentation at our
special collections in a room

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:31.820
there.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.600
I'm just presenting
the archival material

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.850
that we had uncovered and
put on the website including

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:47.150
baptismal records for
slaves and including letters

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:51.470
that Jesuits had written
about slavery, including

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.760
records from this sale.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.600
And I gave a pretty
conventional academic talk

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.650
to a fairly conventional
academic crowd.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.580
There was a Q&amp;A at the end.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.070
And as the Q&amp;A went on,
there's a gentleman standing

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.292
in the back of the room,
it was a crowded room,

00:41:10.292 --> 00:41:11.250
people were interested.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.666
But there's gentleman standing
in the back of the room who

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:15.090
didn't quite fit in the mold.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.860
He was African-American.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.080
He was wearing a
kind of track suit.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.760
He had tattoos all over his
body, the arms and neck.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.630
And he raised his hand and
he just started talking.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:33.780
And he started to say that
the names that he was reading

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.230
on the bill of sale were
names that he recognized,

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.550
names from his ancestors.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:46.810
And he was just
breaking down, crying,

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:55.480
talking about how
those priests, who

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.630
were supposed to be
shepherds of their flock,

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:02.170
could sell those people,
how they could send them

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.520
to the wolves.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.270
And he was having a crisis
of faith right there.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:12.080
And he asked me, how
could this happen,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.050
and what are we
going to do about it.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.790
And I had no answer for him.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:24.340
And by the end of it, we
were pretty much all crying.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.850
And it just revealed to me
the tremendous emotional power

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.320
of the archives, the
different ways that people

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.140
read them and connect to them.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.500
That they're valuable,
not just as places

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.950
we go for information to
make historical arguments,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:48.990
but for some people it's really
personal and very meaningful.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:52.100
And that just really--

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.870
I was starting to realize that.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.010
But that moment really
made me understand

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.130
that we have to
do more to connect

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.270
people in visceral
and material ways

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:09.230
to the artifacts of history.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.390
Not that the artifacts
speak for themselves,

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.260
they don't, but people
read different things

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.170
in those artifacts, and they
bring different perspectives

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.220
to them.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:26.120
And it just was a reminder
that history really matters.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.270
And I think sometimes
that's an important reminder

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.400
to get because we
often forget it.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.974
- Thank you.

00:43:36.974 --> 00:43:37.640
- I'll be brief.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.730
I'll just add something
I think, to the two.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.990
One of the things I've been
struck by in the past decade--

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.410
actually now more than a decade,
since Brown did it's report

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.140
is that I've always had this
sense, especially recently,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.810
that there's this interesting
connection between Brown

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.610
and Georgetown.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.650
And that they sort of sit at
the ends of two different parts

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.000
of this movement.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.940
This process I think is
really quite interesting

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.440
because I think the arrival
of Ruth Simmons at Brown

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.650
created a kind of public stir,
but also a kind of moral moment

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.100
in which Brown's relationship
to the history of slavery

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.870
became a kind of
inescapable question.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.930
And she handled this
with extraordinary skill.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.490
And we've talked
about this before,

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.290
but left this real
template for everyone

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.092
who wanted to do this work
and how you guide this.

00:44:33.092 --> 00:44:35.300
And how you do the difficult
work of actually looking

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.060
at something that's
extraordinarily painful,

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.270
very personal at
times, and use it

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.170
to do real community building
and institution building

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.230
and make a better institution
out of that moment.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.520
And so at Brown
you have that sort

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.520
of extraordinary
set of circumstances

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.180
that produces this discussion.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.260
And then at Georgetown,
at the other end--

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.410
Georgetown is-- of all the
colleges and universities

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:03.110
established before
1800, it's the only one

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.050
that maintains its
religious identity.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.240
And it's precisely
that in some ways that

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.030
has created this sort
of moral stir, that

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:14.690
has made the moral
dimension of the 1838 sale,

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.390
but also the long history
of Jesuit slaveholding

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.420
in Maryland, and the way in
which the Jesuits plantations

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.210
funded the entire institution.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:27.650
There's no tuition for the
first 50 years or whatever.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:31.070
And it's precisely that
religious dimension

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.310
that has made this moral problem
of slaveholding on the campus

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.540
inescapable.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.760
And one of the interesting
things that's happened,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.180
and I think in some ways both
institutions deserve credit

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.660
for helping us to return that
dimension to the conversation.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.450
We're talking about
a historical problem

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.351
that has all sorts of
moral consequences to it.

00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:51.100
They're very real.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.280
They're very immediate.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.640
They affect the way that we
think about our own positions

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.700
and our own histories, our
places on these campuses

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.490
in the extent to which we
take ownership of and feel

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:04.940
part of the very institutions
that we have histories with.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.920
And so I think, for
me, one of the--

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.000
it's not so much surprising,
but it is something

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.980
that I've been really taken by
is that it has really required

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.690
a very long discussion,
a lot of protest,

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.835
a lot of what I've been
calling grassroots activism.

00:46:23.835 --> 00:46:27.290
Sven, in faculty who just
started teaching classes

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.420
on Harvard and slavery
and Colombian slavery.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.350
It required an
extraordinary amount of work

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.690
to get us to a moment
where we can actually

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:38.480
talk, not about the history
of colleges and slavery,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.510
but actually admit that there's
a moral dimension to it,

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.390
that it actually brings
real responsibilities.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:48.260
And that that moral dimension
does not give us permission

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.240
to escape the problem.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.730
It actually gives
us a greater burden

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.980
to actually address
that problem.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.520
- Thank you.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.152
I am fascinated when
I think about 2003,

00:47:03.152 --> 00:47:06.540
and now we're in 2017.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.190
And I am curious
about the why now.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.400
Why is it that just in
the last couple of years

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:22.930
though really, we've seen
this real ferment of activism.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:26.890
Why is the topic of slavery in
the universities so compelling

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:34.770
now and not, maybe 10
years ago or 20 years ago?

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:39.030
Let's reflect upon that
a bit in conversation.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.730
- Let me offer a cynical answer.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.680
I mean one of the things when--

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.210
so the reparations
coordinating committee,

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:50.730
I remember published an op
ed in the New York Times

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:54.240
identifying Harvard, Yale,
and Brown as probable targets

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.740
of lawsuits.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.670
And there were a series of class
action suits against Aetna,

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.990
Fleet Bank, you might remember
the CSX Railroad and others.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.360
And I think it was
in that context

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:12.000
that most universities just
wanted the problem to go away.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.920
It was not only awkward
and embarrassing,

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.650
but there was a fear that if
you said a word about this

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.454
that you were about to get hit
with a subpoena in a lawsuit.

00:48:20.454 --> 00:48:21.870
When we started
the work at Brown,

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.787
we talked about this, that we
had to be prepared for the fact

00:48:24.787 --> 00:48:26.370
that everything we
were talking about,

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.090
we were likely to be
subpoenaed to disclose.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.690
And the fact that
those cases, when

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.360
they were heard in federal
court in northern Illinois

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.650
and dismissed, statute
of limitations grounds,

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:43.540
failure to establish standing,
political questions doctrine,

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:48.780
a bunch of dismissals was
pretty overwhelming legal defeat

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.150
took the immediate threat
of litigation away.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.570
And it made it easier.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.150
So that's just one cynical one.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.545
It's like universities can
take this on without the fear

00:48:58.545 --> 00:49:00.670
that the next day they're
getting hit by a lawsuit.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.430
So I don't I don't
normally think about it.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.829
I don't think that's an
overwhelming part of it,

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:07.120
but it certainly is part of it.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.410
It's safer now.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.990
And it's also safer now simply
because the more institutions

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:14.650
have done it, the less
controversial it becomes.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.890
- And even after that,
there's no upside to doing it,

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.630
for much of that history.

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.920
There's no positive reason.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.640
It doesn't bring
anything-- benefits

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640
and all sorts of things.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.223
And it might well actually stand
in the way of something else.

00:49:27.223 --> 00:49:28.666
And I would give a different--

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:30.040
would just add
something to that.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.100
I really think also
the audience changed.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.576
In the past 20
years the audience

00:49:34.576 --> 00:49:35.950
for the discussion
of slavery has

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.070
changed in the United States,
and actually in the West.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:43.390
If you think about this sort
of European anniversaries

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.930
of the end of the slave trade
and both the scale of those

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.220
and the audience for them.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.810
I think around the
world, the audience

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.434
for the subject of
slavery is shifting.

00:49:51.434 --> 00:49:53.560
And the United States has
shifted on our campuses,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.150
it shifted.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.410
What was, perhaps in the 1970s,
when you go through the first

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.600
big process of
both co-education,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.290
but also the racial
integration of these campuses,

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.720
what might have been an issue
for small groups of black

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.910
students to organize around--

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.620
at Dartmouth after 1969,
its 200th anniversary,

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.940
when it commits to Native
American education,

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.880
one of the consequences of
that is the anti-Indian art

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.930
that saturated the visual
culture of the campus.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:30.040
Graphic, obscene
images of native people

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.590
that was deeply rooted
in the sort of, really

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.380
the 20th century
history of Dartmouth.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.750
It's invented largely
in the 20th century.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.100
That there was a conflict
between native students--

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.460
the commitment to students
and that visual culture.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.590
And so the campus has
to go through a process

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.010
of reconstructing
itself to accommodate

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.270
the change that happened.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.160
And the people pushing that
conversation at Dartmouth,

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.900
at the time are
the incoming class

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.371
of Native American students.

00:50:57.371 --> 00:50:58.870
They're the ones
writing the letters

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:59.870
to the school newspaper.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.120
They're the ones protesting
in the president's office.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.150
They're carrying the
burden of actually rescuing

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.100
the college from its history.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.854
And but I think now that
audience has changed.

00:51:08.854 --> 00:51:10.270
There's not a lot
of reason for us

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.840
to assume that there are lots
of students in the majority

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.150
population who want to sit
in front of stained glass

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:20.290
windows of happy
slaves picking cotton

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:23.620
and embrace that as a part of
their educational experience.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.700
And among the alumni,
among our trustees--

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.710
and then I also
want to give credit

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:33.340
to the surrounding communities
around our campuses

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.730
who've put extraordinary
pressure on us.

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:41.920
Black New Haven has organized
around the Calhoun College

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.700
controversy and some of the
other controversies on campus.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.220
And so I actually
think the landscape

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.610
has changed for us a bit so
there is a much harder issue

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.938
to escape increasingly.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.350
- I would just add that
I think that part of it

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:05.750
has to do with having more of
a critical mass of students

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:10.970
and faculty of color
on campuses who

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:17.990
can push for these sorts
of acts of recognition.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.760
I just think that's
a big part of it.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.470
Obviously, I mean
at Georgetown, it

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:29.720
was a combination of
national and local politics

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.100
making this an opportune time
to investigate this history.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:43.400
It was also a weight of
scholarship, a critical mass

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.850
of scholarship like
Craig's book, which

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.480
I know our university president
had read before he initiated

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.400
the working group.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.550
Scholarship that helps
to inform these sorts

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.280
of investigations, the
models of other universities

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.180
that make it more plausible
to do this sort of work.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.596
And this is not
a huge bit, but I

00:53:04.596 --> 00:53:06.470
think technology has
something to do with it.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.660
We can communicate
with each other.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.720
We can tell these stories using
new digital tools that weren't

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.520
available to us 10 years ago.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.820
And I think that's made
a difference as well.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.460
It's made a big
difference in our ability

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.030
to publicize the stories--

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.490
to publicize the stories
that we're discovering

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.350
or perhaps that we already knew.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.890
- One of the things I was
thinking about from all of you,

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:35.990
and it's something you said,
but it does need, I think,

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:39.170
more explicit discussion.

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:42.590
The people who are
outside of the university,

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:47.130
and for people who have
tried to register for this,

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.110
we had so many people who wanted
to participate in this audience

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:53.780
and weren't able to,
but many of those people

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.520
were not academics.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.090
Many of these people are from
the surrounding communities.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:03.380
And I'm just wondering, how
does that surrounding community

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.430
factor into projects
such as these?

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:11.580
- One of the interesting
things about the geography

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.010
of elite higher education
in the United States

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:18.090
is these venerable
institutions tend

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:22.050
to be established in
northeastern or East coast

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:26.220
cities that, in the
aftermath of 20th century

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.530
deindustrialization,
tend to have

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.930
very high black
populations, often

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:37.500
black populations living in
great poverty, that are sitting

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.927
right next to these campuses.

00:54:38.927 --> 00:54:41.010
That's certainly the case
at Penn, it's the case--

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.640
I guess Princeton
would be an exception,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.181
but it's certainly
the case at Brown,

00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:48.030
it's the case in
various ways here.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:49.740
Columbia, certainly.

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:54.160
And so I think one of the
really interesting questions

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.660
is, how you address this.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.450
The most creative response,
of which I'm aware so far,

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.600
is the University of
Virginia, which actually

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.960
has used the President's
Commission on Slavery

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.760
there to actually--

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.630
it has representation of
the surrounding community,

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:15.330
and it is worked very carefully.

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.730
Kirk [INAUDIBLE] is here so
he can perhaps speak to this.

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:22.290
But worked very thoughtfully
to use this as an occasion

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.040
not only for UVA to come to
terms with its own history,

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.760
but to repair a relationship
with the black community that

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.900
is, in many cases, descended
of the enslaved people who once

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.700
worked on the campus
and who have then

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.050
continued to labor on the
campus for generations.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:43.920
So I think that question
about renegotiating, using

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.980
these moments as opportunities
to interrogate and renegotiate

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.476
these institutions relationships
with the surrounding

00:55:52.476 --> 00:55:53.850
communities of
color around them,

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:58.790
I think that's actually a really
interesting part of the work.

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.730
- I think we have
at Georgetown there,

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:05.150
we've discovered multiple
audiences and publics who

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.940
are interested in the
history of our university

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.190
and its connection to slavery.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:14.000
And I think at the beginning
of the formation of the working

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.730
group, we were quite insular.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.000
It was really about the
university community

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.220
and different constituents
at the University

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.010
relating to each other
around this history.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:26.660
But I think over
the course of time,

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.620
we've really been stretched
beyond the walls of the campus

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:34.040
to multiple publics
and audiences.

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.020
My colleague, Professor
Maurice Jackson is here.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.580
Mr. Jackson has been involved in
a project for a long time that

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:43.580
produced a book called
Black Georgetown Remembered.

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:47.660
Georgetown used to be a heavily
African-American neighborhood

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.720
as late as the mid 20th century.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.754
And then it basically
got gentrified

00:56:53.754 --> 00:56:55.295
and the black
community of Georgetown

00:56:55.295 --> 00:56:58.850
was moved out or forced out.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:02.400
But they come back for events
around Black Georgetown

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.100
Remembered and
still have a stake

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.980
in the neighborhood and
institutions that exist there.

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.070
And they're
interested in history.

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:13.700
The Catholic community in the
greater Washington area, this

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.390
is also their history,
white and black Catholics

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:18.990
beyond the University.

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.474
So they're interested.

00:57:20.474 --> 00:57:21.890
Of course we've
seen the formation

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:25.940
of essentially the
descendant community out

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.280
of the genealogical
research and organization

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.540
by descendants themselves.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:32.240
And that's another public
and audience that's

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.610
engaging in different ways.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.330
So I think as those of
us who are scholars here,

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:40.340
you really have to
be aware that there

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:42.230
are all these
people out there who

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.990
could be really interested in
what you're doing if you just

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:48.860
find the right language,
the right stories,

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.670
and listen to them.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.680
So it's really
exciting actually.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.710
- And I'll just
say very briefly, I

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.740
think one of the
things that I suspect

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.810
a lot of people
worried about when

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:07.220
these conversations started
was that the study of,

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:10.010
and the publishing of the
history of these institutions'

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:14.210
relationship to slavery would
somehow tarnish our gates.

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:17.420
And in fact, actually what
happened is it opened them.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.090
That real consequence
has been that we've

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.000
begun to see in fact,
surrounding communities

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.200
feel really empowered to make
claims upon the institutions

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.177
and to really be involved in the
decision making that happens.

00:58:30.177 --> 00:58:31.760
Now that has all
sorts of consequences

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.250
to it because we can
talk about history,

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.540
but our present
isn't that great.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.640
We're not necessarily
good neighbors now.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.570
And so there are
consequences to that,

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.240
but actually I love
the fact that one

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.490
of the consequences of
what we've been doing,

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:50.300
of what all of these different
movements on campuses have done

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.610
is it's made people
feel like they have

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.980
a much greater stake in the
institutions themselves,

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.420
and certainly a
right to be heard

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.630
in institutions that are
supposed to be serving

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:01.070
in the public interest.

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.632
And they've now defined
themselves as that public.

00:59:03.632 --> 00:59:05.215
And I think that's
a great consequence

00:59:05.215 --> 00:59:08.030
and it's a great
opportunity for us now.

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.010
- Thank you very much.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:13.520
So we're going to open up
now to questions and answers.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.520
And here are the questions.

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.530
So from Agassiz--
we have not been

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:25.460
successful at telling the
stories we know are true.

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.540
The people who
arguably need most

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.350
to understand these
stories and don't yet,

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:34.040
are some of the most
resistant to listening.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.990
How can we break through, not
just leading them to the water,

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:43.730
but making them drink, or put
it this way as it's written,

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.280
making drinking more attractive.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.290
- Who would like to take that?

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:52.556
- It's your quote.

00:59:52.556 --> 00:59:53.080
- Yeah, OK.

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.790
Well one the one thing is--

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.850
one strategy to get people
to think about something

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.280
they're not really
willing to think about

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.190
is just connect it
to where they are,

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.550
where they live, where they
study, where they teach.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.100
So I think that's
something we've all

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.990
been finding as we
do this research

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.640
at our own universities.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.380
When you tell students
that you would not

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.890
be sitting in this
Georgetown classroom

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:29.700
if it were not for the history
of slavery, It's more real.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.530
It's less abstract.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.360
It's closer to home.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.860
It's not so remote.

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:40.370
And you might not convince them,
and they might still resist,

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:44.970
but they at least have to
confront the fact in a new way.

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.590
So that's part of it.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:51.140
You're not going to
convince everyone,

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:56.610
but you might get more people
to listen a little more closely.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:01:00.190
- OK, now here's actually
the most popular question,

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.610
or the most I guess,
highest number of people

01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:05.440
have asked this question--

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.410
what will Harvard and
other universities

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.730
do-- now you can
answer for Harvard but,

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:15.490
what will other universities
do specifically to redress ways

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:19.450
that they have benefited from
their own institutional racism?

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:26.146
Would institutions take the
idea of reparations seriously?

01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:28.180
- That they give reparations?

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.290
- Yes, In other words that these
universities have all in them,

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:37.130
obviously racist stories,
and even institutionally,

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.520
when we talked about the
medical school, for example,

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.630
and that kind of issue
that happened in the past,

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:48.840
so would these institutions
take the idea of reparations

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.660
seriously?

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.410
- Yeah.

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:56.070
I think that-- the
Brown report includes

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.130
a set of recommendations.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:02.120
And part of, it
seemed to us, that it

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.010
would be rather incoherent for
us to do this investigation,

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:12.340
to disclose all of this and
say, well, glad the work's done.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.900
There has to be some act
in the present that you--

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.990
some response to what you now
know about your institution's

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.370
history.

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.530
And so, in some
ways, that consumed

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:27.830
as much of our attention as
the historical research did

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:31.970
and trying to think through
what would be meaningful.

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:34.010
I think our guiding
principle was

01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:38.750
that Brown was a university,
and that whatever remedies

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:45.330
we proposed should be
commensurate with Brown's

01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.670
nature as a university.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.280
Rhode Islanders made a
huge fortune, much of which

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.250
flowed into Brown through
the West Indian provisioning

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:57.990
trade, actually
providing salt cod which

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:03.162
became the staple diet of
enslaved people in Jamaica.

01:03:03.162 --> 01:03:04.620
Well there's a lot
of heart disease

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.220
in Jamaica as a result of
the diet that people have.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.770
So should Brown give everybody
in Jamaica a heart transplant?

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.460
No, because that's
not what we do.

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.560
So for us, we thought
really very carefully

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.840
that whatever actions
we took should

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.140
be in keeping with our
fundamental nature, which

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.220
is to produce knowledge,
to disseminate knowledge,

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.950
to deploy that knowledge
in ways that creates

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.710
a better, more just world.

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.830
And so our recommendations kind
of flowed from that premise,

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:39.180
so it included some comments
and recommendations related

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.890
to endowment
policy, gift policy.

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:47.899
It did not include, we
debated this, scholarships.

01:03:47.899 --> 01:03:49.440
One of the things
that we've decided,

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.040
and this is true at Harvard as
well, Brown was a need blind,

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.950
need based institution, so
that everyone who was admitted

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:02.280
had the ability to receive
financial aid to make

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.980
it possible for them to
come, and that Brown didn't

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.370
have a policy, as Harvard
and others don't, of any kind

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:11.670
of scholarships that are
tagged to particular categories

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:15.090
of people, be that a football
player or whatever else

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.180
it might be.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.200
And we actually decided
that that was right.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.890
That that's where it should be.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.230
But that Brown could act
much more aggressively

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.630
in diversifying its classes.

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:27.870
That brown could also
provide financial aid

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.270
for students from Africa
and the West Indies, who

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:34.560
are at that point were
not eligible for need

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.120
blind admission.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.630
We also thought a great
deal about our relationship

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.130
with the surrounding community.

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:44.160
And so several of
the recommendations

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.250
were just in the spirit of
making the resources of Brown

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.530
available more broadly.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:56.880
So we provided curricula
for local schools, students

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.760
who wish to teach in the
Providence public schools

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.210
get free scholarships
to come and do

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:07.920
master's degrees in
teaching at Brown.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.840
Ruth Simmons devised
something which

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.480
I thought was really quite
creative, and I had thought

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:17.010
might be emulated, that
Brown raises funds now,

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.200
as part of its
endowment, and manages

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.440
funds that can be
designated as a trust fund

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.060
for the children of Providence.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:30.630
And so Brown people
can make donations

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.840
and it will be to facilitate
educational programs

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.730
for the children of Providence.

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.580
And that those funds
will be managed

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.980
and that endowment
will be managed as part

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.250
of Brown's regular endowment.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.947
So I thought that was a
really creative device.

01:05:45.947 --> 01:05:48.030
At the end of the day,
apropos of the conversation

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:54.150
we heard this morning,
nothing you do in the present

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.720
even approaches the
significance and scale and scope

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.306
of the crime.

01:05:59.306 --> 01:06:00.963
That doesn't mean we
can't do anything.

01:06:04.195 --> 01:06:05.820
- Anybody else want
to tackle that one?

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.520
- I know there's something
of a debate about

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:14.330
whether or not what Georgetown
has proposed and done

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.715
constitutes reparations or not.

01:06:16.715 --> 01:06:20.320
That sort of depends what
you think of as reparations,

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.420
whether you have a broad
idea of reparations

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.660
like gestures of reconciliation,
or a form of reparations

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.601
or not.

01:06:29.601 --> 01:06:35.480
One of the most tangible
and discussed consequences

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:41.330
of the discussion at
Georgetown was the provision,

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:45.050
basically saying that the
descendants will receive

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:47.570
legacy status, something
like legacy status

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.770
for purposes of admission.

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:53.780
So they'll be treated the same
as the children of alumni.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:07:03.560
And that gets towards a kind of
reparationist kind of policy.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.090
But it's pretty modest at best.

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.220
And some of the
descendants themselves

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.520
have been saying, well
what about people who

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.110
don't want to go to Georgetown?

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:18.200
What about people who
can't get into Georgetown?

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.950
Doesn't Georgetown have some
kind of moral responsibility

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:28.595
to help subsidize and pay for
the education of those folks?

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.590
I'm so tempted to ask for a show
of hands, how many people think

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:39.870
that would be a good idea,
but I'm not going to do that.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.620
- But it might be good, it
might be good just because--

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.380
can I just say that someone
else has asked very specifically

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.100
about what have the Jesuits
done for the descendants.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:53.690
And then the second question
to that was, are they in need,

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.760
I guess the descendants.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.260
What, if you do
something for somebody,

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.300
do you address
their specific needs

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.400
or do you address
something else?

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.590
So what has Georgetown
done, was the question,

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:07.745
so you can continue.

01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:10.910
- All right.

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.284
How many people
in the room think

01:08:12.284 --> 01:08:16.100
that Georgetown should
subsidize tuition

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.710
for descendants who attend
other schools than Georgetown?

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:22.100
Let me see you hands.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.540
- At least.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.360
- At lease.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.520
At least, OK.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.590
- Well the majority has it.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:30.399
- Done.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.535
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:32.535 --> 01:08:34.475
- Call DC.

01:08:34.475 --> 01:08:35.600
- They're going to call me.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.120
This is one of the
reasons why I say

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.069
that the recommendations
of the working

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:46.670
group and the policies that
have been enacted to date

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.319
are really a beginning.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.970
I think we've opened
up a conversation

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:53.630
where this sort of discussion
is now possible perhaps.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.430
I don't know where
it's going to go.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:59.060
I don't know if
Georgetown will ever--

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.770
or the Jesuit Order
will ever make

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.479
that additional commitment.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.260
I just don't know.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.229
I think it's basically
a matter of politics.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:10.009
People fighting for it and
seeing what will happen.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.510
There's a difference between--

01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:16.370
today the Georgetown
University is

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.850
separate from the Jesuit
Order organizationally and all

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:22.609
of that, so there are sort of
separate questions about what

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:24.680
Georgetown is doing
as the university,

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.580
and what the Jesuit
Order is doing.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.600
I'm not speaking for
either institution.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.479
But I do think that the question
of Jesuit responsibility

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:40.920
is really important
and interesting one.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.859
It's not just the
Jesuits, though.

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:45.200
Maybe next year we
could have a conference

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.970
called religion and
slavery, and look at all

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.910
of the religious institutions,
like the Jesuits,

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:56.060
who are deeply implicated
in the slave economies.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.250
And of course, as
Craig has shown,

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.200
so many of these
universities began

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.210
as religious institutions.

01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:03.920
So the question of
religion and slavery

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.420
is intimately tied
to the question

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.190
of universities and slavery.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:10.340
But it's just another
area of American life

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.610
that is rooted in the
history of slavery in ways

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.990
that we do not--

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:20.180
most of us do not even
know the extent of.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.090
- OK here's another question.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.790
This morning Ta-Nehisi Coates--

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:34.350
Ta-Nehisi Coates warned
against self-congratulation.

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:39.540
How can we guard against that
danger and still do real work,

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.630
but not allow ourselves
to think we are better?

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:46.080
And I am assuming,
by allow ourselves

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.230
to think we are in the
sense that, well, we

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:53.910
have addressed this issue and
now we have finished our work.

01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.030
Can you speak to that issue
of self-congratulation

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:04.500
or the fear of doing that.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.150
- I think one of the concerns
for a lot of the people who

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:13.800
are involved in these
struggles and on campuses

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.450
is what happens?

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:17.220
What happens with their work?

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.710
And the universities that
have produced reports--

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:23.010
the universities,
and conferences,

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.060
if you use the report
or the conference

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:29.660
as the punctuation marks
of your relationship,

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:33.210
your engagement with an embrace
of your history with slavery,

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:35.580
then by definition
in fact, there's

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.300
going to be a large audience
of disappointed people.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.160
And there's going to be a lot
of self-congratulatory behavior

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.820
because you have a kind
of spectacular moment

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.300
and then you move on.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.900
And so I think one of the things
that we have to really think

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.970
about at all times
is how we start

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:54.660
to institutionalize
what we're learning

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:58.500
and what we're investigating
at our universities,

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:03.960
and put into practice real
policy and ways of thinking

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.740
about how we will
actually use this history

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.220
to transform ourselves.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.220
And in the first question
that you had asked me,

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.950
which I kind of
didn't answer, which

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:17.340
was about the naming
practices on these campuses,

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.150
really in many ways I'm
not that interested in what

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.480
happens to most names of
buildings and structures

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:25.980
and things.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.688
I think there are
egregious examples that

01:12:27.688 --> 01:12:30.150
just need to be changed
because they're outrageous.

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:31.794
There are a lot
that are actually,

01:12:31.794 --> 01:12:33.460
what we might refer
to as academics, who

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.501
have teachable moments,
things that we can really

01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:38.400
use to talk about our history
and to get the public engaged

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.840
with that history.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.670
But there's also--

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.070
I think one of the
things we can do

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:47.190
is we can actually start
to take an honest look

01:12:47.190 --> 01:12:50.750
at our own traditions and
our own internal cultures,

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:54.210
in the way that we actually
use history and tradition,

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:56.220
we sort of weaponized
those terms

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.370
to shut down conversations
from students of color,

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:02.340
communities of color, and often
white women who make demands

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.080
upon our institutions.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.580
Our traditions tend to be
extraordinarily unstable.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.560
We change things all the time.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.110
We're sitting in a
complex that has been

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.440
transformed by coeducation.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.070
Coeducation at Dartmouth brought
a change to the Alma mater,

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:20.300
to the song.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.673
Men of Dartmouth
doesn't work anymore.

01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:26.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.790
- They changed the whole
curriculum in order

01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:31.770
to keep the number of men, while
increasing the number of women.

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.860
You go to the quarter system.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.260
We made radical changes
to the curriculum.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.210
We made radical changes
to our campuses.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:40.390
Yale tried to buy Vassar.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.960
As its way to
coeducation, it attempted

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.330
to just get Vassar
to move to New Haven

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:47.990
and solve its problems that way.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:51.950
And when that didn't work it
created a 12 college consortium

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:54.330
so that they could share
students and actually

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.470
experiment in coeducation
in the late 1960s.

01:13:57.470 --> 01:14:00.590
Williams did something that
today would seem outrageous.

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:03.080
In order to go coed, they got
rid of the entire fraternity

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.520
system.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.870
We know for a fact that
a lot of our traditions

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.680
have been extraordinarily
unstable over time.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.890
And one of the most unstable
things on our campuses

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:14.017
has been building names.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:15.350
- Well, can I ask this because--

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.920
- Which only become sacred
when people complain.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.810
- No, no, this is a
really good point,

01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:25.610
and I have a question from
a Yale student who is glad

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:29.720
to live in Hopper College
rather than Calhoun College,

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.440
but and this is an important
question that's being asked

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.080
here, does re-naming just let
universities off the hook too

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.010
easily?

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:41.930
- Well, it depends
on what they do.

01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:44.980
You have to actually
memorialize the renaming.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.520
The renaming doesn't
erase history

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.110
because the name change
actually becomes part

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:49.520
of the history of the building.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.970
And history is a
record of change.

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:55.050
History assumes change.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:58.190
And so you're not
erasing history at all,

01:14:58.190 --> 01:15:00.350
you're in the process
of creating history.

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.060
And part of our
obligation, if we're

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:05.020
going to be honest about these
conflicts and these moments,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.160
is we have to historicize
the name change.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.030
With Georgetown, it certainly
wasn't good enough just

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:15.590
to take the names of two
Jesuits who negotiated the 1838

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:17.690
sale off the buildings.

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:20.210
That doesn't do a
lot at all except

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:23.030
hide the embarrassment
of that one moment.

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:27.830
The real test of character
comes when one actually renames

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.900
the building and
then memorializes

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.610
the reason for the change.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:36.200
The ground shift in the way
that you think about your past,

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.630
the way that you use
your past on campus,

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:43.160
and the way that you actually
deploy the past in presenting

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:43.690
yourself.

01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:45.710
I think the big
challenge for us today

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.930
is not so much that our
students are making demands

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.060
or their communities
outside making demands,

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.340
the big challenge
is really what is

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:56.750
the obligation of 21st
century universities

01:15:56.750 --> 01:16:00.560
with global influence,
whose reputations and status

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.600
depend upon maintaining--

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.300
depend upon maintaining
diverse communities

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.710
of students and scholars.

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:08.836
What is the public
presentation that we want.

01:16:08.836 --> 01:16:11.210
And that's the conversation
that we need to start having.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:14.000
And it's one that really
I think that's where

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.570
we need to start incorporating
history into our policymaking.

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:21.080
- You know, I just on
that I've become, partly

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.740
as a result of getting involved
in the enterprise at Brown,

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:28.070
increasingly less a historian
in the first sentence

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:31.940
of investigating history,
one, what actually happened,

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.610
and increasingly a historian
of memory or somebody

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:36.950
who is interested
in that other sense.

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:40.400
We use the term history of
the stories that people tell.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.860
And there is a relationship
between those two things,

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:45.950
but it's not a very tidy one.

01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:51.260
And I've become persuaded that
almost every time a human being

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.180
makes a political
claim in the present,

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.580
they are implicitly
or explicitly making

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.430
a claim about the
past, and vice versa.

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:01.730
And so that when we
alter the stories

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:04.850
that we tell about our past, as
a society or as institutions,

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:08.300
we alter the matrix of political
possibility in the present.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.550
And we've seen, there was
a reference earlier today

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.205
to Gone With the Wind.

01:17:12.205 --> 01:17:13.580
Here's a little
footnote for you,

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.190
everybody knows that Roots,
when it was broadcast,

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:19.520
was the most watched television
show in American history

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.720
at the time.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:24.260
What most people don't know
was it was a, over two nights,

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.170
rebroadcast of Gone
With the Wind four years

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:31.070
before that it displaced.

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:33.260
And we've seen
the kind of damage

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.310
that the romancing of
slavery and the effacing

01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:39.680
of the essential
violence and plundering,

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.640
to use this morning's word
of the Jim Crow regime,

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.320
the implications that had in
massive resistance in the South

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.930
and so forth.

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.190
So we've seen the ways in which
bad or incomplete or distorted

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:56.690
histories create political
impulses in our present

01:17:56.690 --> 01:18:02.370
that are unnerving,
dangerous, hurtful, damaging.

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:05.960
And I think we're living through
such a moment now to be sure.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.326
So part of the faith of this
is that if you alter the--

01:18:10.326 --> 01:18:13.610
you transform what people
understand about their history,

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:16.310
you also create new political
possibilities in the present.

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.350
But it doesn't
happen automatically.

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.750
What it does is it just
changes the terrain

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.280
of political struggle.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.320
But you still have
to do the work.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.390
And if anybody thinks
you know that, OK we

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:28.400
changed the name
of John C Calhoun

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.970
or we published our report or
we apologized two weeks ago,

01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:35.150
our work is done, then
they're just delusional.

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:38.000
The struggle never goes away.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.790
- Can I say one thing about
this self-congratulations idea.

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:48.170
I think if you really appreciate
his history in the right way,

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:54.090
it teaches humility rather
than self-congratulations.

01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:56.240
Has anybody here heard of
this musical, Hamilton?

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.656
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:57.656 --> 01:18:59.150
- So George Washington sings--

01:18:59.150 --> 01:18:59.941
- Tell us about it.

01:18:59.941 --> 01:19:01.370
- --sings a song, he says--

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:04.130
the lyric is, history
has its eyes on you--

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:05.990
history has its eyes on you.

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:08.150
So I think one of
the lessons here

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:13.100
is we are now judging
and condemning

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.550
these institutions for their
participation in slavery 150

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:21.100
years ago, 150 years from now,
what will we be judged for?

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.230
What will history what will
historians 150 years from now

01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:30.380
say about universities
complicity

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.180
in the production
of knowledge that

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.580
supports war, mass
incarceration, and poverty.

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.600
What will they say about that?

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.070
So that's the thing
that haunts me

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:43.740
as the core lesson
of this history.

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.960
And it is an antidote
to self-congratulations.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.610
- And can I just--

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:52.440
- This is absolutely critical.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:56.370
The great danger of these
kinds of enterprises

01:19:56.370 --> 01:20:00.270
is that we can point our hands,
or point a finger accusingly

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:02.310
at somebody in our
past and in the process

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:05.730
congratulate ourselves on our
own superior moral wisdom.

01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:07.500
And I just echo what Adam said.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.590
For me, there's
this kind of moment

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:13.460
of reflection of
people are going

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.700
to ask the same question
of us in the future.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.660
And part of what you want to
do through these exercises

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:23.880
is in investigating the
boundaries of moral imagination

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.120
of people in the past, that's
an invitation to investigate

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.580
the moral and
political boundaries

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.330
of your own imagination
in the present.

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:32.707
That's what these
things are for.

01:20:32.707 --> 01:20:34.290
- And I was just
going to add, I think

01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:37.860
they allow of ways to
create the constituencies

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.470
for different kinds of
conversations on campus.

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:43.650
So for instance, engaging
with the history of slavery

01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:46.560
and the slave trade
doesn't actually

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.480
negate or block
our ability to talk

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.779
about Native American
history on our campuses

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.320
and the ways in
which that's actually

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.240
built into the landscape
of our campus--

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.550
the built environment
of our campuses.

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:57.990
That it doesn't
negate our ability

01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:01.590
to talk about contemporary
problems of universities

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.310
and society.

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:03.990
Well, in other words,
we often in fact

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:08.970
use history, or other histories
and put them in competition,

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:11.130
so that we can pretend
we're not capable of a kind

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:12.840
of moral multitasking.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.871
And we are.

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.380
- We are, yes.

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.630
Now this is an interesting
question for you, Professor

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.850
Rothman, and many
people don't know this,

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.640
I happen to know
this but, Healey--

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.864
President Healey was a person
of African descent and he --

01:21:26.864 --> 01:21:29.280
and in fact there were two of
them, the brothers actually.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.100
This person, Patrick
and, what was one's name?

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.900
James, I think.

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.370
James.

01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:37.550
There's a few.

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:38.470
- Yes.

01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:44.730
So he was the president
of Georgetown,

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:46.420
a person of African descent.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.440
It's been a question, and
the person wants to know,

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.710
do people at Georgetown know
that part of their history,

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:56.070
or is that even identified?

01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:58.900
In the Washington area, all
the people in Washington,

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.390
and I'm from Washington, that
story is told and retold.

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:05.580
And even during the day,
there's a big debate,

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.320
well was he just passing.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.690
And then they'll
say, well no, he

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:13.740
wasn't passing because
in that period, what

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:14.930
was that late 19th--

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.805
- It was 18--

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:16.680
late 1870s and 1880s.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.340
- Yeah, 1870s, yeah.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:22.230
That he's speaking in
the black community.

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:24.000
And then so then so
they just cover it

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.400
and that's why he
lost his position.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.250
But then there's some people
that have other stories.

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.770
So do they talk about Healey?

01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:32.550
- At Georgetown?

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.910
- Yes.

01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:33.493
- Incessantly.

01:22:33.493 --> 01:22:36.480
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.045
- It's-- it's my birthday
today and that was a gift.

01:22:39.045 --> 01:22:40.800
- Oh, happy birthday.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.320
- Because I get to talk
about Patrick Healey,

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.570
one of the most fascinating
characters in Georgetown's

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:46.069
history.

01:22:46.069 --> 01:22:49.440
So Patrick Healey
was born a slave.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.940
His mother was an
enslaved woman in Georgia.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:59.940
His father was a Irish
immigrant cotton planter.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.010
Patrick Healey's parents
lived together as peers

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.537
and almost like a common law--

01:23:05.537 --> 01:23:07.620
it would have been illegal
for them to be married,

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:11.190
but they lived together for
years in a kind of common law

01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:12.660
marriage.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:17.130
The father recognized the
paternity of his children.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:20.727
He sent them to Northern
Catholic schools.

01:23:20.727 --> 01:23:21.810
- There's even a daughter.

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:22.830
- There's a daughter.

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:24.480
So Patrick Healey
becomes a Jesuit

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.610
and becomes president
of Georgetown.

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:29.130
One of his brothers becomes
the Bishop of Maine.

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:34.050
A sister becomes the prioress
of a convent in Montreal.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.420
And in the black
sheep of the family

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.940
goes out and becomes a Coast
Guard captain in Alaska.

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.860
- So it's a fascinating family.

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:48.030
And basically they're
very light skinned.

01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:51.000
Patrick Healey essentially
passes for white.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.680
Most people in Washington--
the Jesuits know his heritage,

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.590
his background, but
most other people don't.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.150
And if they did,
he would never have

01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:02.340
become president of Georgetown.

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.280
It wasn't until the
1950s that historians

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.250
began to unearth his ancestry.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:10.890
And then in the
1960s, Georgetown

01:24:10.890 --> 01:24:13.260
begins to celebrate Healey
as the first African-American

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:16.050
president of a major
white university,

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:19.560
even though nobody
knew it at the time.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.610
So it's a very--

01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:22.950
so now we're trying
to tell a bit more

01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:26.397
of a complicated and
nuanced story about Healey.

01:24:26.397 --> 01:24:28.230
But I think it's also
important to recognize

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.810
that as the story is
told about Healey being

01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:36.660
the first African-American
president at Georgetown, what's

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.952
not usually told as
part of that story,

01:24:38.952 --> 01:24:40.410
is the fact that
Georgetown did not

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:45.890
admit its first African-American
student until 1950.

01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:50.270
So I think that juxtaposition
is an interesting one

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:51.920
to think about.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.420
- Thank you.

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:55.520
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.670
