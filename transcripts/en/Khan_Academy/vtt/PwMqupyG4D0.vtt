00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:02.848
- [Instructor] Ali is in
charge of the dinner menu

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:05.605
for his senior prom, and he
wants to use a one-sample

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:08.283
Z interval to estimate
what proportion of seniors

00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:11.130
would order a vegetarian option.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.880
He randomly selects 30
of the 150 total seniors

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.194
and finds that seven of those sampled

00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:19.653
would order the vegetarian option.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.916
Which conditions for constructing
this confidence interval

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:25.487
did Ali's sample meet?

00:00:25.487 --> 00:00:27.053
So, pause this video, and you can select

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:28.659
more than one of these.

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.138
Alright now, let's work
through this together.

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:32.924
So one thing that you might
be wondering is, well,

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:36.303
what is a one-sample Z interval?

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.355
Well, you could really interpret
that as he's gonna take

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:40.949
one sample and then construct
a confidence interval

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.175
based on that.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.627
The reason why it might
be called a Z interval

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.270
is the whole idea behind a
confidence interval is you're

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.960
going to pick a number of
standard deviations above and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.362
below the true parameter that
you are actually trying to

00:00:54.362 --> 00:00:57.716
estimate, and then use that
to make your inferences.

00:00:57.716 --> 00:01:00.930
And one way of thinking
about the number of standard

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.405
deviations, people will
often call that a Z score,

00:01:03.405 --> 00:01:06.128
or Z is often used as a variable
for the number of standard

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.045
deviations above or below something.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:11.296
So really, he's just trying
to construct a confidence

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.329
interval, but remember,
in order to construct

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.241
a confidence interval, we
have to make some assumptions.

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.391
He's taking, there's 150
students, right over here.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.741
He's finding it impractical
to survey all 150

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:26.611
to figure out the true
population proportion.

00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.028
So instead, he samples 30 of the seniors.

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.391
So, N is equal to 30.

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.907
And from that, he calculates
a sample proportion.

00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:39.043
Looks like seven out of the 30 are,

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:42.029
they want the vegetarian option.

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.170
And he's going to determine
some confidence level

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.538
and then construct a confidence interval.

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:49.651
But remember the conditions
that we've talked about

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.987
in the previous videos.

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.956
The first thing is, we
have to be confident that,

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:54.901
is this a random sample?

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.294
So that would be the random condition,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.272
and that's what choice A is telling us.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:02.370
The data is a random sample
from the population of interest.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.372
Do we know that?

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:05.466
Well, it tells us in the passage here,

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.486
he randomly selects 30
of the total seniors.

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.584
So I guess we'll take their word for it.

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:13.312
We don't know his methodology
of what he considers random,

00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:15.259
but we'll take their
word for it, that yes,

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:16.528
this has been met.

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:19.556
The data is a random sample.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.432
If it said he sampled
the football team, well,

00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:24.669
that would not have been a random sample.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.770
The next condition here
looks all mathematical,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.613
but this is really the normal condition.

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:32.698
And the idea behind the
normal condition is that,

00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:35.149
in order to construct
these confidence intervals,

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:36.785
we're assuming that the
sampling distribution

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:39.650
of the sample proportions
is roughly normal,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.662
and it is not skewed to the right

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:46.329
or skewed to the left like this.

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:51.402
And so, right here it says,
look, the sample size times

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:53.759
our sample proportion has to
be greater than/equal to 10.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.569
Or our sample size times one
minus our sample proportion

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.355
has to be greater than/equal to 10.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:01.282
Well, another way to think about this is,

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:04.449
our successes in our sample need to be

00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:10.286
greater than/equal to 10,
and our failures need to be

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:12.166
greater than/equal to 10.

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.745
Well, how many successes were there?

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:15.162
There were seven.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.488
And you could even say,
look, our N is 30 times

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:21.971
our sample proportion is seven over 30,

00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:23.606
which is going to be seven.

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:27.027
So our successes is less
than 10, so actually,

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:29.045
we violate the normal condition.

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:32.101
Once again, this is a rule of
thumb, but this is telling us

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:36.854
that our actual sampling
distribution might be skewed.

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:38.751
Remember, this is just
based on one sample,

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.090
what we're able to figure out.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.189
This is one sample Z interval.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.278
We might be wrong, but
we wouldn't feel good

00:03:43.278 --> 00:03:45.129
that we're meeting the
normal condition here,

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.128
so I would rule this one out.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.659
Individual observations can
be considered independent.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.826
Well, if he randomly selected
people with replacement,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.503
then they could be independent.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.975
Or, if the people he is
selecting, if his sample size

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:03.217
is less than 10% of the total population,

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.439
then it could be considered independent,

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.678
even though it wouldn't
be perfectly independent.

00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:11.600
But we see here that he
sampled 30 people out of 150.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.683
So his sample size was 30 out of 150,

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:17.794
which is the same thing as
one fifth of the population,

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:20.091
which is the same thing as 20%.

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:22.664
And since this is greater than 10%,

00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:26.177
we are violating the
independence condition.

00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:28.566
We could have met the
independence condition if he was

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:32.008
sampling with replacement, which
it doesn't seem like he is,

00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:35.333
or if this thing right over
here was less than 10%.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.057
But we're not meeting that, so we cannot

00:04:38.057 --> 00:04:40.296
feel good about that constraint.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.161
And so, since we're not meeting
two of the three constraints

00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:46.540
for, I would say, valid
confidence intervals,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.044
or confidence intervals we
would feel confident in,

00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:53.211
this is not so good of an
analysis on Ali's part.
