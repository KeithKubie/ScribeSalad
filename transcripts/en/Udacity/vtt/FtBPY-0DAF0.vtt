00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.578
We don't know the first amount, so that's x. And we don't know the second

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:09.403
amount, so that's y. If we add the two amounts together, we get a total amount

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:14.127
of $25,000, just like in our problem. For our second equation, we know our

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:18.796
interest rate for this first amount was 7%. So I have 0.07, 7 hundredths times

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:23.701
x. Our second amount gained 8% interest. So we have 8 hundredths times y, and

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:28.447
our total interest was 1900, that was written in our problem. If you're able to

00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:33.359
write both of these equations that's exceptional. This is strong algebraic

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.129
reasoning.
