00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.620
SALMAN KHAN: This is Sal again.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.911
I'm here at Stanford Medical
School with Doctor Abraham

00:00:03.911 --> 00:00:05.789
Verghese and what are
we going to talk about?

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:07.330
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
We're going to talk

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.717
about the ritual of the
physical exam, the bedside exam.

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:12.550
SALMAN KHAN: The physical
exam, the ritual--

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.440
why do you call it a ritual?

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.314
That's interesting that
you call it a ritual.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.760
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Yeah,
I think the lesson

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.550
I've learned from hanging around
with my anthropology colleagues

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.450
here at Stanford is that rituals
are all about transformation.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.940
A ritual signals the
crossing of a threshold.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.630
You baptize to signal the
crossing of a threshold,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.600
we marry to signal our departure
from a life of solitude,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.570
loneliness, and misery
to one of eternal bliss.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.780
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.374
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
So our lives are

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.040
full of-- You shouldn't
be laughing Sal.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.680
SALMAN KHAN: No.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.497
It resonates so
strongly with me.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.330
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So
crossing a threshold is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.616
why we have a ritual.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.000
And I would say that the
act of one individual

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.380
coming to another, and telling
them things they wouldn't tell

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.440
their rabbi or their preacher,
and then incredibly disrobing

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.209
and allowing touch, I
would say that that signals

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.690
a ritual of
incredible importance.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.960
And the fact that
we, in the postmodern

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.390
sort of medical world,
have stopped seeing it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.410
that way and just see it as
another data gathering tool may

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.990
work for us, but I don't think
it works for the patient.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.790
And I think that a major
disconnect between us

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.110
and our patients is our
failure to see what they see,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.240
which is a profound ritual in
which they're highly invested.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.520
And we then come and just
stick our stethoscope

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.620
on top of the shirt, or don't
examine them thoroughly,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.440
we are sort of short
changing ourselves

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.820
of an important ritual.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.290
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, and
I'll feel short changed.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.100
I'm kidding.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.610
Sorry.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.568
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But
I'd love to list for you,

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:48.270
if I may, those aspects of
what makes this a ritual.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.430
So if you look at
it, first of all

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.790
there's always a
specialized space.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.990
You don't examine a patient
out in the corridor.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.820
It's always a special room, a
ceremonial room if you will.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.310
Mysterious looking objects on
the walls, a very specialized

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300
bed that you sit on.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.030
These are all signals
that this is a virtual.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.580
Then when the physician
walks in the physician

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.630
often is wearing
a ceremonial garb,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.470
which happens to
be a white coat.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.511
SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.

00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:22.977
This is interesting just from an
anthropological point of view.

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.560
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: The physician
is wearing ceremonial garment.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.390
The patient is also
instructed to disrobe

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.439
and gets a patient garment.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.230
SALMAN KHAN: Which
seems specially designed

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.299
to put patients in a
position of weakness.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.340
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I know.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.400
It's quite unfortunate.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
We should be rethinking
the [INAUDIBLE] garments

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.930
[? major. ?]

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.070
And then the physician then
begins a systematic exam,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.600
which at some level is
mysterious to the patient.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.770
It's not always
clear to the patient

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.090
why the physician is
thumping on their chest

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.450
or why the physician is
saying take a deep breath,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.000
or cross your arms, or stand
on tiptoe, or take your hand

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.540
and touch your nose rapidly.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.130
So there's mysterious and
ritualistic aspects to it.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160
And very often the
physician is using

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.140
terms that are somewhat
Latinate and arcane, and utterly

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.629
mysterious to the patient such
as fremitus, and percussion.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.170
SALMAN KHAN: What
does fremitus mean?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.880
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Fremitus means
you ask the patient to say 99,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.670
and you listen, you put
your hand on their chest.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.370
You pick up the vibration,
and if they have consolidation

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.369
or collapse the
fremitus is not what

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.035
it should be compared
to the other side.

00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:36.010
SALMAN KHAN: The fremitus,
so was it the sound or the--

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.070
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: It's
more like the vibration.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.800
Sound being transmitted
through and being picked up

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.410
by your hand.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.880
SALMAN KHAN: Interesting.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.175
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
So the thing that's

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:47.800
most interesting to
me about the ritual

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.260
is that the person
coming in might

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.950
be a policeman, a
teacher, an entrepreneur,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.290
but in the process of
putting on that gown,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.360
and sitting on that
ceremonial chair,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.070
they have sort of been
stripped of all that identity,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.069
and they are taking on the
identity of being the patient.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.610
But conversely, I think there's
something very important that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.329
happens, which is that just
before this the patient has

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.120
been vocalizing all their
symptoms and their complaints,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
and at that point the physician
could order ten tests,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.050
and go and look at
images, but there's

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.230
something about the
physician then laying

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.280
hands on the patient,
that sort of gives weight

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.670
to what the patient
just talked about.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.440
You talk about
your belly hurting,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.870
and then this individual
carefully examines your belly.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.910
It's sort of
validating your soma.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.060
Your body is being
validated in this ritual.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
And then when you
finally have the tests

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.700
all sent off they become sort
of-- what follows intuitively

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.080
on the ritual of first having
it validated on your body.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.020
One of the things that
I bemoan sometimes

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.670
is that at times the
patient in the bed,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.990
I feel, in hospitals
around America,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.170
has almost become an icon
for the real patient who's

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.450
in the computer.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.079
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.620
It's just something
to interface with

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.240
to get to that data
structure in the computer.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.160
It's interesting.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.860
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
I've coined a term

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.450
for that entity in the computer.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.916
It's the iPatient.

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:22.430
When the iPatient is getting
fabulous care the real patient

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.965
I think has a need to feel
their complaints validated.

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:29.160
To feel it validated
on their soma,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
and to engage in a ritual for
which there's a transformation.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.480
And you might well ask me,
what is the transformation

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.950
that takes place in this ritual?

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.580
And, I think the
transformation is

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.180
the sense of the patient
has delivered the story,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.680
the physician in the
process of the ritual

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.650
has validated that
they've heard the story

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.120
and tried to locate
it on the soma,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.300
and the transformation
is really the ceiling

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.050
of the patient
physician relationship.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.940
And so I think what
has happened Sal,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.740
unfortunately, is
that because we

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.390
have so much technology we've
become very sloppy in the way

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.520
we examine patients.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.730
I think that we should be a
hundredfold better at examining

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.160
people given that we
have real-time feedback

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.289
with echocardiograms,
angiograms, and all that.

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.080
Instead of which, I
think people have never

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.564
been less certain of
their bed side skills.

00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:23.230
SALMAN KHAN: What
about this phenomenon,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.810
just talking to physicians
I know in my own family,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.610
that there's so
much time pressure.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.030
They have to see so many
patients, one every 15 minutes,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.113
and all of this, and they
wish they could do this,

00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:35.080
but they'll say that I have
so many other things to worry

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.240
about, and the
paperwork, and all that.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.510
Is it realistic?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.110
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: No, I think
that's a very real concern.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.609
But I think if you
can do this well.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.860
And our goal at Stanford
is to teach our students

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.870
to do it very well.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.987
You actually save time.

00:06:45.987 --> 00:06:48.320
Because if you do a quick
exam and you find that they're

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.120
tender in a certain spot you
can order the test that sources

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.260
just that out,
rather than, which

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.427
I think is much more common,
which is I don't really

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:58.343
know what's going on,
I'll tick off every box,

00:06:58.343 --> 00:07:00.430
and maybe something will
fall out of the sky.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.050
So I think a directed exam,
not only fulfills the ritual,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.980
but if you're any good
at it, it actually

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.880
allows you to ask better
questions of a test you order

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.930
and minimize the patient's
exposure to radiation.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.330
And I think the trouble
is we get all these tests,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.980
and we get back
results we don't know

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.839
what to do with, we stumble onto
what we call incidentalomas.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.880
Have you heard that term?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.005
SALMAN KHAN: Incidentaloma.

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:24.650
Well, I have heard that VIP's
often get worse medical care

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.394
because they do
everything for them.

00:07:26.394 --> 00:07:28.060
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
Yeah, exactly and they

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.470
wind up with finding things
they don't know what to do.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.762
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly yeah
over diagnosing things.

00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:34.720
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But to
come back to a ritual,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.250
I think we at Stanford
are very proud to feel

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.410
that, as much as we
represent this great bastion

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.570
of technology and
advancement, we also celebrate

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.970
the fundamental ritual aspects
of the patient physician

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.280
relationship, which
is best symbolized

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.520
in the physical exam.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.760
SALMAN KHAN: I think this
is why a lot of physicians

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.519
originally want to
enter the field.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.060
It sometimes gets lost, but this
is why they wanted to do it.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.460
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
And you're right.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.050
I think they often
get disappointed

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.150
when they learn to do this
and arrive on the wards

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.454
and find that no one's
carrying a stethoscope,

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:06.870
and no one's carrying-- I mean
they carry the stethoscope.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.810
I think it's like
a mating symbol.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.240
SALMAN KHAN: No you gotta
carry one to look legitimate.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.710
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But they
don't carry the knee hammer,

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.390
and they don't carry
all the other tools.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.431
SALMAN KHAN: I once visited
my wife at the doctor

00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.510
and I wore her coat,
and I felt very good.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.530
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Did you
drape your stethoscope

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.220
around the neck too?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.675
SALMAN KHAN: Oh I did.

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.550
Yeah, I looked
very authoritative.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.410
ABRAHAM VERGHESE: That's a
great signal that you arrived.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.220
So I think that we
have so much to learn

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.692
from our anthropology colleagues
about the importance of ritual.

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:32.650
I think sometimes we
operate as though medicine

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.069
is all about reason, but it's
really reason, ritual, emotion.

00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:37.280
They all tie in together.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.840
This is art and science.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:38.919
SALMAN KHAN: No.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.752
This is fascinating.

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.650
I'm going to reflect
on some of the rituals

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.560
I do now to see if they are.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.060
Very cool.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.750
Well, thank you for this.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.600
ABRAHAM VERGHESE:
Thank you so much.
