00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.040
In the last few videos, we
evaluated this line integral

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.790
for this path right over here
by using Stokes' theorem,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.850
by essentially saying that
it's equivalent to a surface

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.000
integral of the curl
of the vector field

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.120
dotted with the surface.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.320
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.445
to show that we didn't have
to use Stokes' theorem,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.190
that we could have just
evaluated this line integral.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.630
And the thing to
keep in mind is,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.600
in this case, it's
kind of a toss

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.230
up which one is
actually simpler to do.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.530
But Stokes' theorem is
valuable because sometimes,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.155
if you're faced with
the line integral,

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:30.700
it's simpler to
use Stokes' theorem

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.119
and evaluate the
surface integral.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.940
Or sometimes, if you're faced
with the surface integral,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.620
it's simpler to
use Stokes' theorem

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.500
and evaluate the line integral.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.630
So let's try to figure
out this line integral.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.770
And hopefully, we're going
to get the same answer

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.254
if we do everything correctly.

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:46.670
So the first thing we want to
do is find a parametrization

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.260
for our path right over here,
this intersection of the plane

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.290
y plus z is equal to 2.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.440
And essentially, you can
imagine this hollow pipe

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360
that intersects the xy-axis
at the unit circle that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.720
goes up and down forever.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.500
And we get this path right over
here with this orientation.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.550
And since we're only
parameterizing a path,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.382
it's only going to deal
with one parameter.

00:01:07.382 --> 00:01:09.090
And so let's think
about it a little bit.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.506
We've done this
many times before,

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:12.870
but it doesn't hurt to go
through the exercise again.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.820
So that is our y-axis.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.230
This is our x-axis.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.420
That is our x-axis.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.590
And the x and y values
are going to take

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.164
on every value on
the unit circle.

00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:24.830
And then the z value
is going to tell us

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.454
how far above the
unit circle we needed

00:01:26.454 --> 00:01:29.590
to be to actually
be on this path.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.260
So x and y are going to take
on all the values on the unit

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.210
circle.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.877
And we've done that
many times before.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.710
The easiest way to think
about that is let's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.250
introduce a parameter called
theta that essentially measures

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.040
the angle with the
positive x-axis.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.350
And theta, we're just going
to sweep it all around,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.940
all the way around
the unit circle.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.120
So theta is going to
go between 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.620
So 0 is less than theta, which
is less than or equal to 2 pi.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.249
And in that situation,
x is just going

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.540
to be-- this is just the unit
circle definition of trig

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.890
functions-- it's just going to
be equal to cosine of theta.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639
y is going to be sine of theta.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.570
And then z, how
high we have to go,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.140
we can use this constraint
to help us figure it out.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.280
y plus z is equal
to 2, or we could

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.090
say that z is
equal to 2 minus y.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.790
And if y is sine
theta, then z is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.670
going to be equal to
2 minus sine theta.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.420
And so we're done.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.500
That's our parametrization.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.791
If we wanted to write it as
a position vector function,

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:35.210
we could write r, which is
going to be a function of theta,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.790
is equal to cosine of
theta i plus sine of theta

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.870
j plus 2 minus sine of theta k.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.160
And now we're ready
to at least attempt

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.730
to evaluate this line integral.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.770
We need to figure
out what F dot dr is.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.869
And to do that, we need
to figure out what dr is.

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.410
And we just have to
remind ourselves,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.760
dr is the same thing as
dr/d theta times d theta.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.260
So if you take the derivative
of this with respect to theta,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.680
derivative of cosine theta
is negative sine theta i.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.690
Derivative of sine
theta is cosine theta

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.330
plus cosine theta j.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.810
And the derivative
of 2 minus sine theta

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.390
is going to be negative
cosine theta k.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.000
And then all of that
times-- we still

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.374
have this d theta
to worry about.

00:03:29.374 --> 00:03:31.342
This is dr/d theta.

00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:32.300
Let me write this down.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.900
So then we still have to write
our d theta just like that.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.220
And now we're ready to take
the dot product of F with dr.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.930
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.630
I'll write dr in this color.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.410
F dot dr is going to be
equal to-- so we look first

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.600
at our i components.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.034
We have negative y squared
times negative sine of theta.

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:02.700
That's going to be--
well, the negatives

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.700
are going to cancel out.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.880
So you're going to get--

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.020
So you're going to get y
squared times sine theta, that's

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.820
from the i component,
plus-- now we're

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.270
going to have x
times cosine theta

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.130
And then we're going
to have plus z squared

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.630
times negative cosine theta.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.565
So that's going to be negative
z squared times cosine theta.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.840
And then all of
that times d theta.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.280
All of that business
times d theta.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.150
And if we're actually going
to evaluate the integral,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.070
if we're going to
evaluate it over that path

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.720
that we care about, now we
have it in our theta domain.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.590
So we could just say this is
a simple integral from theta

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.020
going from 0 to 2 pi.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.360
Actually, we're not fully in
our theta domain just yet.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.124
We still have it expressed
in terms of y, x's, and z.

00:05:04.124 --> 00:05:06.040
So we have to express
those in terms of theta.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.770
So let's do that.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.580
So that's going to be equal to
the integral from 0 to 2 pi.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.580
And actually, let me give
myself some more space

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.410
because I have a feeling
this might take up

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.250
a lot of horizontal real estate.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.570
This is going to be the
integral from 0 to 2 pi.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.820
y squared, well, y
is just sine theta.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.200
So it's going to be sine squared
theta times another sine theta.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.700
So this is going to
be sine cubed theta.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.100
Let me write it in a new color.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.350
I'll write it in blue.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.350
So this is sine squared theta
times another sine theta,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.390
so this is going to
be sine cubed theta.

00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:43.180
Let me color code it.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.750
So that's sine cubed theta.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.520
Put some parentheses here.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.080
And then x is cosine theta
times a cosine theta.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.340
So this is going to be
plus cosine squared theta.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.140
And then z squared,
this is actually

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.610
going to get a
little bit involved.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.540
So let's think about
it, what z squared is.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.110
I'll do it up here.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.930
z squared is just going
to be 4 minus 4 sine theta

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.740
plus sine squared theta.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.310
There's going to be negative
z squared times cosine theta.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.360
So negative z squared is going
to be equal to negative 4

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.520
plus 4 sine theta minus
sine squared theta.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.270
So that's negative
z squared, and we're

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.850
going to multiply that
times cosine theta.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.290
And I'll do it in orange.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.510
So all of this business
right over here

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.670
is going to be equal to cosine
theta times all of this,

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.880
cosine theta times all
of this right over here.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:59.430
So it's going to be negative
4 cosine theta plus 4

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:11.490
cosine theta sine theta and
then minus cosine theta sine

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.320
squared theta.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.447
And looks like we're done, at
least for this step, d theta.

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.530
And so now we just have
to evaluate this integral.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.500
So we saw actually setting up
our final integral, getting

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.617
to a simple one-dimensional
definite integral,

00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:29.200
is actually much
simpler in this case.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.130
But the actual integral
we have to evaluate

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.550
is a little bit
more complicated.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.880
We might have to break out a
few of our trig identity tools

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.180
in order to solve it
properly, but we can solve it.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.970
But I'll leave you there.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.386
In the next video,
we'll just work

00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:43.630
on actually evaluating
this integral.
