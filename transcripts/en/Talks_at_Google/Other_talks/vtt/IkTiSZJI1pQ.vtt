MOLLY KNIGHT RASKIN:
I just wanted

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.280
to start out by
thanking Google here

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.700
in New York for inviting
me here to speak today

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.120
about my book, which
was just published

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.270
a couple weeks ago
by Da Capo Press.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.220
It's called "No Better
Time-- The Brief,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.860
Remarkable Life of
Danny Lewin, the Genius

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.130
Who Transformed the Internet."

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.360
First, just a little
background about me.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.600
I am a journalist.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.590
I've worked in the
field since my first job

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.186
as a local radio
reporter in college.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.560
Actually, even
earlier than that,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200
since my first
job as a newspaper

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.970
reporter in elementary school.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.900
And over the past 15 years,
I've had the good fortune

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.900
to work in print, television,
and documentary film,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.997
and often, when possible,
travel the world

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.080
in search of a good story.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.090
And I got my real start
here in New York, actually.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.640
I moved here right
after college.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.760
Like a lot of idealistic,
young college graduates,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.670
I packed up a U-Haul
with some friends

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.660
and moved here into a
tiny, cramped apartment.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.410
And I was thinking
about it last night.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.430
It's almost funny to
stand here today and think

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
how I applied for
jobs back then.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
To date myself a
little bit, I applied

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.650
with paper cover letters,
which I hand-delivered

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.210
to offices all over New York.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.930
And I followed up with
phone calls from landlines.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840
And that's really when I
set out on my career path

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.330
here in the city.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.980
And at the time,
I guess, I could

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.280
say the internet was
in its-- I look at it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.860
as its teenage years, still
finding its identity and place

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.560
in the world.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.870
And we were all trying
to figure it out

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.780
as users and businesses
and academics and thinkers.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.900
And I'm often
asked how I decided

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.570
to write a book about a
mathematician and computer

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.130
scientist, particularly
by those who know me well.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.640
I didn't have any math
or science training.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.880
I somehow, as an
English major, managed

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.810
to avoid any math and science
subjects all through college.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.325
And I didn't pass calculus.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.560
But the answer is really simple.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560
The reason I wrote
this book is because it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.780
was a story that was
so inspiring to me,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.170
so exciting and so captivating
that I couldn't go of it.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.220
And that's what I'm here
to talk to you about today.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.980
It's the story of Danny Lewin.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.860
And of course, given the
audience here at Google,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.410
talk a little bit also about
the innovation and the science

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.700
underlying the technology
that Danny helped create.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.320
The story of "No Better
Time--" the subtitle of my book

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.280
is "The Brief, Remarkable Life
of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.920
Transformed the Internet."

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.880
And I realize that at
a place like Google,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.410
that's probably a
bold claim to make.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.010
You probably have a lot
of people who you know,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.320
or many of you may
be geniuses yourself,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.240
and you're working to
transform the internet.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.340
But I hope the book
makes a case for--

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.450
and I'd like to make a case
today for-- Danny Lewin's

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.220
genius, the genius of his
company, the people who

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.850
surrounded him, and the great
things they did with Akamai

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.587
Technologies, and
how it was born.

00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:38.920
I'm just going to read you a
little bit from the preface

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.950
of the book to give you an
idea of the incredible span

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.425
of Danny's short life.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.820
"No Better Time" is the story
of Danny Mark Lewin, who

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.300
was almost certainly the first
victim of the 9/11 attacks.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.940
It's the story of an
extraordinarily gifted

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.150
young man who believed
that anything was possible

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.630
and let nothing
stand in his way.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.800
Of an all-American kid who moved
to Israel against his will,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.000
ended up falling hopelessly
in love with the country,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.750
and served as an officer
in the most elite unit

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.690
of the Israeli army.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.550
Of a young soldier who was
trained to hunt and kill

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.910
terrorists and who, in
a tragic twist of irony,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.350
later died at their hands.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.870
Of a loud, irreverent young
computer science student

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.660
who formed a
beautiful friendship

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.620
with a soft-spoken,
reserved professor.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.530
Of a husband and
father who spent

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.780
years struggling to make ends
meet and became a billionaire

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.620
almost overnight.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.430
Of a theoretical mathematician
who wrote a set of algorithms

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.500
that would change
the internet forever.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.440
Until now, it's a story that
has remained largely untold.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.740
When Danny Lewin was
alive, business journalists

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.970
categorized him and
his company, Akamai,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.180
as breakout stars
of the dot-com boom.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.840
After his death on 9/11,
the mainstream media

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.270
eulogized him as one of the
2,975 victims of the attacks,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.570
but never fully
investigated his actions

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.030
on American Airlines Flight 11.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.250
His family and friends have
remained largely silent.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.000
They are certain that
Lewin courageously

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.166
tried to stop the terrorists,
and that he was likely

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.550
the first victim of the attacks.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.960
But they have been
reluctant to share publicly

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.680
why they believe
this to be fact.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.330
Some stories, I
have learned, simply

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.660
can't be told without
the passage of time.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.300
You can dig at them, push
them, and pound the pavement

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.690
in search of ways to
bring them to life,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.180
but you cannot be true to them
until their keepers are ready

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.700
to share a part of their lives
long shrouded in privacy.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.570
It's not until that point
that they will reach willingly

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.150
into the wells of
their memory, perhaps

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.750
even back to those
moments hardest to relive,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.220
and begin to tell the story.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:13.320
So Danny Lewin was born in
Denver, Colorado, in 1970.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.230
And in many ways, he had
an all-American childhood.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.150
He was the eldest of three boys.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.870
His parents were both
doctors, and they

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.430
lived in a very nice
suburb of Denver

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.640
called Englewood, Colorado.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.610
He and his brothers
were athletic and smart.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.070
And they just enjoyed a
very nice childhood there

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.930
near the mountains.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.600
They skied and played all sorts
of sports, loved the outdoors.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.540
But his childhood was
different for a few reasons.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.290
And I think many of them help
explain the success he later

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.160
achieved as an academic
and entrepreneur, computer

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.670
scientist and mathematician.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.540
First, there was the fact
that Danny's parents believed

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.440
strongly in nurturing their
children intellectually.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.780
And they taught them all
subjects around the kitchen

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.170
table while other
children their age

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.220
were probably watching
cartoons or playing outside.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.410
One of the stories Danny's
brothers, who still live

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.010
in Israel today and work
in business and high tech,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.230
love to tell is the
time they were sitting

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.710
around the breakfast table,
and their father promptly

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.600
removed the cereal
box that they were all

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.800
enjoying reading the
cartoons on the back.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.950
And he returned a few minutes
later with the cereal box.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.920
And on it, pasted
over the cartoons,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.510
was an article from
"Scientific American" magazine.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.160
And that led to sort of a
family tradition of these almost

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.700
intellectual jousting
matches over the table

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.570
and around the table
where they would

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.100
speak about subjects
in math and science.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.590
And truly, it excited them all.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.010
Another interesting fact is
that Danny's father brought home

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.720
a home computer
very early on, when

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.560
Danny was just a young
boy, and his brothers.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.180
And it was a
make-at-home computer.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.160
It was an Altair.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.720
And it was a
build-it-yourself kit.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.270
And that was followed
by an Apple II

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.370
when Danny was only
about nine years old.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.974
And from neighbors
of theirs, I've

00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:17.140
learned that they were the
first family on the block

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.200
to have a home computer, and
that Danny and his brothers

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.460
taught themselves to program it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.230
And by about age 10, Danny was
going around the neighborhood

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.530
helping anybody
and everybody who

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.190
got a home computer to
program it and teach them

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:31.860
how to use it.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.950
Then at age 14, Danny's life
took a pretty unexpected turn,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.290
and an unwanted one for him.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.450
He grew up in a family
of practicing Jews.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.840
His father became increasingly
enamored with Zionist ideology,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.000
and in 1984, a little
bit before then, decided

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.330
to uproot the family
and move to Israel.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.310
And this was not
a popular decision

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:09.340
with three children in
their early teenage years.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.630
They didn't speak Hebrew.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.210
They didn't have any friends
and family in Israel.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.720
And they were happy in Colorado.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.750
So they protested.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.750
And of all of them,
Danny, as the eldest

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.260
and perhaps most
vocal in the family,

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.290
went to Israel
kicking and screaming.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.690
He was very unhappy.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.280
And at first, it was
very difficult for Danny

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.790
to find his way
in a new country.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.410
Israel in 1984 was a
difficult place to live.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.090
The economy was in a bad place.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.060
There was, obviously,
and still is,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.750
the daily threat of terrorism.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.440
And all these things
were very new to a family

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.910
from Denver, Colorado.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.240
But they moved there.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.660
And Danny was just too
innately bright and grounded--

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.070
and, many of his friends
say, wise beyond his years--

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.560
to rebel in the typical
teenage way, which

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.250
we don't need to
elaborate on here.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.350
But if any of us were
rebellious teenagers,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.090
we know some of those ways.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.490
Instead of going
out late at night

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.710
and doing things he
shouldn't be doing,

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.590
Danny kind of rebelled
in his own way.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.490
He didn't spend a
lot of time at home,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.030
and he didn't speak
to his parents a lot.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.100
But he was very
productive with his time.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.080
And as a young teen,
he spent a lot of time

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.800
at the local
gymnasium, which was

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.310
filled with tough Israeli guys,
building his physical strength

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.340
into what his friends
called this almost

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.250
Biblical-like proportions.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.220
By age 16, he was a spectacle
at this gym in Jerusalem,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.590
where he was bench
pressing and weightlifting

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.720
more than guys
two times his age.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.546
And he also managed to
sail through school.

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:57.420
He went to science and
technology high school

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.400
in Jerusalem.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.790
And despite what some say was
not the most stellar attendance

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.120
record, he sailed through.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.950
He found school very easy.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.190
And he taught himself a lot.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.640
He loved to read, and
loved to go to the library,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.420
and loved computers.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.880
And his best friend,
Marco Greenberg,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.700
who works and lives
here now in New York,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.590
said he remembers that it
occurred to him just how

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.550
smart Danny probably was when he
mentioned that if Danny wanted

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.380
to go to college in
the United States,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.220
he would have to take
the SATs or the PSATs.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.140
And Danny looked at him and
just said, I already took them.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.010
And Marco was somewhat taken
aback, and said, really?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.210
Well, how did you do?

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.620
And the answer, which he
said without any fanfare,

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.630
and very modestly,
was, well, perfectly,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.666
almost perfectly on both
the English and the math.

00:11:51.666 --> 00:11:53.290
And that just wasn't
a big deal to him.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.600
That was the way he operated.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.280
At age 18, like native
Israelis, there's

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.860
compulsive military service.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.580
And Danny, as I
mentioned in the preface,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.370
joined the Israeli
defense forces.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.260
And much to the
surprise of anybody

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:15.740
who knew this bubbly, cheerful,
sometimes-all-American teenager

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.410
who was still speaking
in broken Hebrew,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.130
there was a lot of
surprise when he

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.380
was admitted to a unit
called Sayeret Matkal, which

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.800
is the most elite
counterterrorism

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.260
unit of the Israeli
Defense Forces.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.300
Up until the 1980s, this was
a unit that was hand-selected.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.550
And Danny set this
goal early on of being

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.820
admitted into this unit.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.520
And he achieved it.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.710
And not only did he achieve
it, but he rose very quickly

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.490
to the rank of
officer in that unit.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.430
From there, Danny went
on to the Technion

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.590
in Israel, which
I'm sure many of you

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.510
know is often called
the MIT of Israel,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.870
the best and brightest minds
in science and engineering,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.610
and a really wonderful place,
where everybody says Danny

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.720
really for the first time
found his intellectual haven.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.950
He was an incredible
student there.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.130
People today still
marvel at what

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.030
he was able to accomplish
there in just three years.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.120
I spent some time in Haifa
researching the book.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.880
And one of Danny's professors,
who's still there today,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.920
said he'll never forget this
bright-eyed, excited student

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.740
crashing into his
office one day,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.399
telling him how excited
he was about knot theory,

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.940
and how, even though
it wasn't really

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.250
a part of his curriculum,
he would absolutely

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.740
love the opportunity to work
with this professor on a paper

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.070
he was doing on
robots and knots.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:48.280
And that led to the first of
many intellectual courtships

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.370
and partnerships that Danny
had in his short life.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.640
He really became
interested at the Technion

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.120
in the hardest problems.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.000
He was someone who
really always wanted

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.910
to take the most
challenging problems,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.200
the problems everybody said
you can't possibly solve.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.260
Oh, everybody's
working to solve that.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.300
And he went straight
for them with almost

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.050
a guided-missile-like precision.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.660
And what he was interested in
was using the highest level

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.650
of math to solve the problems.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.860
At the Technion,
Danny juggled two

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.430
of the most difficult
degrees, computer science

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.750
and engineering, which
very few students did,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.440
and very few still do today.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.930
He also juggled a wife
and two young children

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.640
and a full-time job
at IBM Research Labs

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.460
in Haifa, where he
quickly stood out

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.260
among the crowd for his research
in verification processes.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.860
And two years into his
time at the Technion,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.070
he won Best Student Paper award.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.810
And by 1996, he was bound
for MIT, the Massachusetts

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.030
Institute of Technology.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.630
The wonderful part of
Danny's story-- and there

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:05.720
are many-- for me was the reason
that he decided to attend MIT.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.790
He was accepted, after all, to
the top 10 graduate programs

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.420
in computer science in
the country, in the world.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.170
And turns out that
there was one book

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.290
that he found in the
library that spoke to him.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.630
And it spoke to
him so beautifully

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.720
that he decided that MIT was
the place he simply had to go.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.770
The author of the book,
who was a professor

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.650
at MIT's Lab for Computer
Science, the legendary lab

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.480
where the internet
was, in part, born,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.380
was a professor named
Tom Leighton, who

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.580
had been at both
Princeton and MIT

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.270
and was already a world-renowned
expert at a very young age

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.780
on algorithms and
distributed systems

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.820
and using theoretical math to
find ways to route information

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.800
through these
distributed systems.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.880
Danny pulled this book out
of a shelf in the library.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.690
He looked at it.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.390
And he said to himself
and to his family,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.770
this is the man that
I want to work with.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.750
And this was a time before
algorithms were considered

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.020
sexy or interesting in any way.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.580
It was still a term that
scared people in some ways

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.240
when applied to math
or computer science.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.460
But Danny saw in Tom's work
something truly spectacular.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.160
And more specifically, it was
that he spoke the same language

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.680
as Tom, this rarefied
abstract language

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.570
of theoretical computer science.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.530
Tom Leighton and his
colleagues at MIT

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.240
had been working for some time
by the time Danny arrived there

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.930
at MIT on a way to end what they
had called the World Wide Wait.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.230
I probably don't have to tell
any of you here about this.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.640
But as a reminder-- and it's
very hard to imagine now,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.210
at a time when we can type
anything in and have instant

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:02.080
gratification-- there was
this interminable wait, often,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.210
when you logged on the
internet in the mid-'90s.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.920
And we can all remember
that chirping, beeping,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.329
and straining of the
modem as it connected,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:15.079
and then the very frustrating,
sometimes infuriating message

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.880
you would receive that was,
please try again later.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.849
The server is busy.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.729
And at the time, this was
obviously a huge impediment

00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:24.520
to the growth of the
internet, particularly

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.790
in the business community.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.020
So at MIT, in the Lab
for Computer Science,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.490
Tom Leighton's group was working
on using theoretical math

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.790
to solve this problem.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.670
And Tom will say today
that nobody was really

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.660
looking at their group
for real answers.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.900
They appreciated the
work they were doing,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.600
but it was looked at
as kind of ivory tower

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.680
and too abstract
and too high-minded

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.200
to have any real
practical application.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.320
And at the time,
the way people were,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.180
as you know, trying to solve
this problem of the World Wide

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.350
Wait and problem of
congestion on the internet

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.730
was to build out their hardware,
build these huge server

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.840
farms, experiment with caching
and mirroring technology.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.970
And all of these
worked, but they

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.190
didn't work in a way
that would survive

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.940
a huge crush of traffic.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.740
And by the mid-'90s, we were
obviously learning this when

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.445
huge events would take place,
and everybody would try and log

00:18:22.445 --> 00:18:26.080
on, and major
websites would crash.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.600
So Danny joined up at MIT and,
eager to impress Professor

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.820
Leighton, started working on an
idea for his master's thesis.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.030
At the time, he didn't
think it was a great idea.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.270
He was, like a lot of
graduate students at such

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.530
a prestigious
academic institution,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.480
slightly insecure
about his research.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.180
Initially, he didn't get
great feedback on it.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.420
But he came up with this concept
called consistent hashing,

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.540
which, as you may know, is
a method of accessing data

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.600
by assigning it a set
of unique numbers.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.970
Hashing schemes work very well
when the number of servers

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.220
is known and fixed.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.060
But on the internet, when the
number of servers is in flux,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.920
it can be relatively useless.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.100
So with this in
mind, Danny set out

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.340
to develop a new
set of algorithms

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.510
that would claim something
that no other caching

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.930
strategy could, which
was fault tolerance.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.260
He thought the idea was OK.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.220
But he did deep-down
believe that it

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.700
could have some
practical application,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.190
despite the early
feedback he received.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.130
Fortunately for him,
Tom Leighton agreed.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.890
They spoke this same
beautiful, rarefied language

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.970
of theoretical math that
I spoke about earlier.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.090
And when Danny took his thesis
to Tom for Tom to look at,

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.660
Tom had a bit of an
aha moment where,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.730
as he explained it to me,
he looked at the papers.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.610
And he saw immediately
something that he

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.260
called a gem of an algorithm,
something that he believed

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.590
actually had
practical application.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.280
And told Danny,
this needs a name.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.420
We need to do
something with this.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.340
And that's how
Akamai Technologies,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.770
the Cambridge-based company
that Tom and Danny co-founded

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.490
with two others, was born.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.810
By 1997, they had formed
the start of a company that

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.600
promised to end the
World Wide Wait,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.170
an audacious claim in
the mid-to-late-'90s.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:33.080
And Akamai, as you
may know, exploded.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.180
Despite the early naysayers, and
there were many-- businessmen

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.090
who called algorithms logarithms
and looked at Danny completely

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.820
perplexed when he would get up
and do his work on a whiteboard

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.680
and lay out all of
his theoretical math.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.650
And they would sit there
scratching their heads and say,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.890
this sounds really interesting.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.890
But maybe you should go
back to your ivory tower

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.690
and just keep this to
your academic community,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.860
because we've got
our own solution.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.180
But Danny was unrelenting.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.700
And he built a group
of people around him

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.800
at Akamai in the early days
who were also unrelenting

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.430
and believed in the
power of the business

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.630
that they were
proposing, which was

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.270
to program these servers with
intelligent software that

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.770
would effectively route traffic
around the internet in a way

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.440
that nobody had
really done before.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.190
It was a magic layer
on the internet,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.360
or what they called back
then, as a marketing

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.310
term, the FedEx of the Internet.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.360
That by using Akamai's
technology, these companies

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.660
that were experiencing
crushes of traffic

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.500
could seamlessly,
effectively, and quickly

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.180
transmit information to
users, despite traffic jams.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.930
They could circumvent
the traffic.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.450
By 1999, the company
had exploded.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.400
Fortunately, because of a couple
of early evangelists of Danny's

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.526
message, he won over a couple
of key people in the early days.

00:22:01.526 --> 00:22:03.400
The stories are in the
book, but some of them

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.920
are pretty incredible.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.380
I think by-- it was 1998, Steve
Jobs was calling and saying,

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.750
I want to buy the company.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.950
Danny was still probably in
his MIT dorm at this point,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.130
or maybe had just moved out.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:25.340
And by 1999, just nine months
after the company was founded,

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.570
Danny, Tom, and their
co-founders and investors

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.730
took the company public
in October of 1999.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.100
And the company became stuff
of the dot-com boom legend.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.670
It was the breakout star.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.020
It was the fourth most
successful or largest IPO

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.238
of the dot-com boom.

00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:46.740
And because of this, Danny
and Tom and their colleagues

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.580
became overnight billionaires
and millionaires.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.530
There were, of course,
others in the game

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.940
with caching and
mirroring technologies.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.740
There were competitors
to Akamai and still are.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.720
But the magic in
Akamai's solution,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.390
which effectively
created this magic layer

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.570
on top of the internet,
circumventing the traffic,

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.210
could be found in Danny
and Tom's algorithms,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.419
or what they called the secret
sauce, and they still do today.

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:15.960
I've been talking
a lot about my book

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.190
recently to various audiences.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.400
And I typically don't linger too
much on the word "algorithm."

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.300
It still sort of scares people.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.600
And within these walls, you
may find that surprising.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.590
But if you ask 10 people on the
street, what is an algorithm,

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.880
you're likely to get some
rather bewildered looks

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.516
and some puzzling answers.

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:38.890
And I have to say,
I was the same

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.130
before I started
working on this book.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.710
And here I am today at Google,
where algorithms are king.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.130
And of course, just last
night, the very exciting news

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.780
of a new search
algorithm, one that

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.230
promises to be even more
precise and faster than the one

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.380
that we use today.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.890
And so I had to
think last night,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.210
when I heard that news, that
no doubt it would be something

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:09.760
that Danny would be
absolutely thrilled by.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.320
Donald Knuth, who is often
called the father of computer

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.040
science, once
said, "An algorithm

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.520
must be seen to be believed."

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.500
And I love that quote.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.930
And I think it's one of
the extraordinary things

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.360
about Danny Lewin's story.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.900
It's that, at first,
the power and the beauty

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.160
of these algorithms were
not obvious to people.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.620
Professors rejected them.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.330
People in the academic
community rejected them.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.510
One of Danny's papers
came back with a stamp

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.190
on it saying something like,
this is very interesting,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.550
but it has no
practical application.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.710
But those who could really
see them and understand them

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.000
and appreciate what Danny and
Tom and others were trying

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.060
to do knew that what
they had on paper,

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.160
and then in a prototype
at MIT, had the potential

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.195
to change the way
the internet worked.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.400
Danny's story is spectacular in
many ways for all the reasons

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.650
I've talked about
up until this point.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.530
But by this time, when
Akamai had taken off,

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.880
Danny was still in
his late 20s, the time

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.080
before most people have
achieved most of their dreams,

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.900
or any of their dreams.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:42.420
And unfortunately, Danny's
story has a very sad ending,

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.120
his personal story.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.560
On 9/11, he got on a
flight from Logan Airport

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.700
bound for Los Angeles.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.940
It was a tough time for
Akamai, as you know.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.570
By 2001, the bubble had burst.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:01.350
And Akamai and Danny and
Tom and all of the others

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.370
who they worked
with were struggling

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.910
to keep the company afloat
in a time of a lot of change.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.260
And they were really struggling.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.430
And that morning, Danny
got on this flight

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.480
bound for Los Angeles.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.060
He had made that flight
so many times that year

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.530
that he knew the flight
attendants by name.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.170
He had his seat.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:28.030
He was on his phone
making phone calls,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.510
working up until the
minute the flight took off.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.220
And we don't know
exactly what happened

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.940
on that flight that day.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.940
But we do know that 14 minutes
into the flight, a hijacking

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.620
began on board.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.550
And it began in
business class, where

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:52.070
Danny was seated in his
Gap jeans and T-shirt,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:57.180
looking nothing like an
entrepreneur or billionaire.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:02.490
And we know from the very
courageous and harrowing

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.090
recordings that the
flight attendants

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.450
transmitted to ground
control that there

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.250
was a struggle in
business class,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.470
and that the passenger
in Danny's seat,

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:16.090
which was 9B in business
class, had been engaged

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.400
in a skirmish with
one of the terrorists

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.310
and had been stabbed in
the neck from behind.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.450
Again, we don't know exactly
what happened on that flight.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:31.310
But if Danny was killed
instantly, which is likely,

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.080
he would be the first victim
of the September 11 attacks.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.410
And if, as the
evidence, I think,

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:42.010
strongly suggests, and also
the anecdotal evidence,

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.950
which I gathered from more than
120 interviews with his friends

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.329
and family, all of whom
said, without question,

00:27:48.329 --> 00:27:50.620
that the moment they knew
the flight had been hijacked,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.170
that Danny had fought back.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.050
Danny was only 31.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.470
He left behind a wife
and two children.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.510
And in a very tragic
twist of irony,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.200
that day proved so
much of what Danny

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.780
predicted for the
internet to be true.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.470
It was the web equivalent
of the 100-year flood.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:18.700
News organizations,
federal agencies,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.070
airlines were all struggling
to keep their websites

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.020
live in a complete
crush of traffic.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.975
Many people, myself
included, sitting at home,

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:34.190
trying desperately to find
out information about friends

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.030
and loved ones and
exactly what was going on.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.290
And phone lines were down.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.810
And it was chaos.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.250
And at that time,
unbeknownst to anybody

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.970
that Danny was on
that flight, a lot

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.510
of these news organizations
and federal agencies

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:59.950
were picking up the phone to
call Akamai and ask for help.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.990
And the company,
which was already

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.800
struggling, as I
mentioned, with the weight

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.800
of the dot-com crash, that
day lost the heart and soul

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.560
of their company and still
managed to press forward.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.330
They say today that they
did so in Danny's name

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.790
and in his spirit, and that he
would have never, ever let them

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.000
be discouraged, consumed
by grief, or given up.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.610
So that day, Akamai
Technologies helped

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.340
major websites stay live.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.610
CNN, which went down
for a little bit of time

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.650
that morning, was
back up and running

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.940
that day and in
the following days,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.640
and managing unprecedented
traffic seamlessly because

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.364
of Akamai's help.

00:29:41.364 --> 00:29:42.530
And that's just one example.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:52.940
And I think that it's really
an honor to be here today

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.830
at Google to speak about
Danny and his legacy.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.930
Akamai Technologies,
as most of you know,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.960
is still very much alive today.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.730
At any given moment, the
company controls almost 30%

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.465
of the world's internet traffic.

00:30:07.465 --> 00:30:10.300
It had offices around the
world, thousands of employees,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.060
and is a multi-billion
dollar company today,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.670
something Danny would
have loved to have seen.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:23.710
But the honor is really that
the beauty and the inspiration

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.680
and the excitement
in the story of Danny

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.860
and what he and his
co-workers achieved at Akamai

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.670
is one that bears so many
similarities to what happened,

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.730
for example, in Menlo Park
in a garage 15 years ago

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:44.450
and what, as we sit here today,
is happening in dorm rooms,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:50.220
laboratories, college
campuses across the country.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:55.840
And it's really not just
the spirit of innovation,

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.190
but also the belief that we
can achieve something so much

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.190
greater than ourselves
and achieve something that

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:06.690
has a lasting impact
beyond our time.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.415
An algorithm must be
seen to be believed.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.990
It's no doubt that if
Danny were alive today,

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.970
you would know his name.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.240
He would be a household name.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.920
And more people would
know his incredible story.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.050
But we don't have to see
the algorithms clearly

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.830
to believe that we can achieve.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.110
It does seem somewhat
like magic, especially

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.260
to those of us with no computer
science or math to their name.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.920
But we see the fruits and
benefits of it every day

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.390
when we log on to the internet.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.020
And the power of
these algorithms

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.840
allow us to do so many
extraordinary things.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.740
So again, it's an
honor to be here today.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.040
And if you have any questions
for me about the book,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.780
please ask.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.750
And copies are available.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.800
If you like what you read,
and you're excited about it,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.890
please spread the word on social
networking, whatever you use.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:14.890
And if anything today, I think
this is a wonderful place

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.750
to be and to take inspiration
from Danny's story.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.320
He toiled away at a
cubicle, and in a dorm room,

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.870
and in a laboratory, and
in an academic setting,

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.740
for enough time to
have gotten discouraged

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.860
and to have gotten
down, and to have

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.220
moved on to something else.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.960
But he believed.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.680
And it's an incredible thing,
an extraordinary story,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.460
and I hope that you enjoy it.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.433
Thank you so much
for having me today.

00:32:42.433 --> 00:32:46.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:46.992 --> 00:32:49.200
MOLLY KNIGHT RASKIN: Does
anybody have any questions?

00:32:53.182 --> 00:32:54.640
AUDIENCE: I actually
had a question

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.870
about-- I mean, as
best as you can tell,

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.360
was his intent when he
went to graduate school

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.780
at MIT to become an academic,
and then he sort of evolved

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.490
into this entrepreneur
because of his relationship

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.470
with his professor?

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.577
Or was that a driver
all along with him?

00:33:12.577 --> 00:33:14.660
MOLLY KNIGHT RASKIN: That's
such a great question.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.580
It was never a driver.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.112
His big dream was to become a
professor like Tom Leighton,

00:33:21.112 --> 00:33:25.700
to get his PhD at
MIT, and to become

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.510
a professor of computer
science and math.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.530
And he dreamed of going back
to the Technion in Israel.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.900
In fact, his professor
there really believed

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.370
that he would come
back some day.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.270
And I think he
probably would have.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.870
And another wonderful
part of this story

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:47.220
is that, as I mentioned,
Danny and others

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.720
who were studying
at MIT at the time

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.870
became very rich off
of Akamai's success.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.350
And I set out as a
journalist sort of thinking,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.130
oh, come on, really,
that much money?

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.400
It must have changed him.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.490
It must have.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.550
And the skeptic in
me really wanted

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.790
to find out what that meant
for him, because, again,

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.389
his dream was absolutely and
squarely to be an academic.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.810
And he came to
Boston, Cambridge,

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.610
with really no other plan
other than to stand out

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.080
in the world of theoretical
math and computer science.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.860
And Akamai was, in
some ways, an accident,

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.620
in the sense of the
business success.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.010
I mean, if it hadn't happened
at that precise moment,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:41.719
and these beautiful ideas
hadn't been given life to

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.791
by this person with
such incredible drive,

00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:46.499
the story would have
been very different.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.287
So really, to wrap up my
answer to your question,

00:34:52.287 --> 00:34:53.870
I think this really
speaks for itself.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.620
So Danny became very
rich very quickly.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.410
He had, obviously,
very little time

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.540
to enjoy it, which is very sad.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.950
But he didn't want to, really.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.160
He went out and
bought a couple toys--

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.920
some motorcycles, a new house.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.000
And then he just really
went back to work.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.930
And when I asked his colleagues,
what did he want to do?

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.060
What was he going to do
with all that wealth?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.040
Tom Leighton, who was
still teaching at MIT

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.120
at the time, and his
wife, who was also

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.660
a very successful professor
at MIT and world-renowned,

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.400
said, he wanted
to go back to MIT.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.970
And before his death, he
enrolled to get his PhD.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.380
And that was his goal, and
that's what he really wanted.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.880
And when somebody
said to him, well,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.380
a PhD will be easy for you.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.010
Now you can just go back,
write up Akamai's secret sauce,

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.080
and you'll be handed your
PhD on a silver platter.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.485
So, you know, no problem.

00:35:49.485 --> 00:35:52.110
And he looked at them-- this was
actually Tom Leighton's wife--

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.760
and said, no way.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.390
I have to find something
so much better.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.850
I have to do something
totally different.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.140
I have to change
the world again.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.020
And that was really his goal.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.170
And according to everybody,
he was a wonderful teacher.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.790
And his work at
the whiteboard is

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:14.270
what won over so many
skeptical businessmen

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.420
and corporate
entrepreneurs at the time

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.207
when Akamai was
first taking off.

00:36:22.207 --> 00:36:23.040
Any other questions?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.359
Well, thank you again.

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:33.400
It's an honor again to be
here at Google New York

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.580
to speak to you, and I
hope you enjoy the book.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.390
Thank you.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:42.342
[APPLAUSE]
