00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.670
Sometimes, I just stand in the grocery store
and weep.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.080
I don't know what to buy!

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
There are too many choices!

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.680
WHY IS THIS SO HARD!?!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.270
choosers
25 years ago, the average supermarket had

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.970
9,000 products, today, there may be 40,000;
but we only need about 150 on average to fulfill

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.080
our shopping needs.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.170
If you're like me, hearing I have to pick
150 out of 40,000 things causes anxiety.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
During each visit, we decidedly ignore thousands
of items choosing only what we need.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.950
The immutable George Carlin spoke often on
the illusion of choice, we have hundreds of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.830
brands of dog or cat food, but only a handful
of oil companies, political parties and banks.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.030
But choice is hard!!

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.210
When confronted with the sheer number of options,
some people become paralyzed!

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.260
As Neo said, "The problem is choice."

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.040
All decisions can be difficult, even if they're
meaningless.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
What should i do?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.670
Delete that email, or mark it as spam?

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.670
That's a decision!

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.790
Albeit a lame one.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.960
The neurons in our brain can't really tell
the difference between a small decision and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.210
big one, we still expended energy to MAKE
the choice.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.760
Stress, fatigue and our own emotions affect
our decision processes.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.820
We have to weigh the cost and benefit of each
thing, what does it COST me to buy the "wrong"

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.370
dog food (even if they're all basically the
same), what BENEFIT do I get marking this

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.370
as spam?

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.090
Registering for wedding gifts, planning a
big event, deciding what to do on each day

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.880
of a big trip… these things all cause decision
fatigue.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.159
Just like with the judges, as we get fatigued,
we become more susceptible to shortcuts, or

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.620
simply more susceptible to suggestion.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.310
After a while, people just want the decisions
to be over.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.210
Why are decisions so hard?

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.800
A 2015 study in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, found this anxiety can

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.320
heavily weigh on some people's lives.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.210
They found, judges of a parole hearing granted
the parole 65 percent of the time in the morning,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.540
decreasing throughout the day to zero.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.030
If the judges were given a break, their grant
rate jumped back to about 65 percent.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.750
Being "the decider" is hard, and it fatigues
the brain.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.180
Even when we feel positively about our choices,
decisions give us anxiety.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.340
Researchers from Princeton looked at win-win
choices in humans in another decision study.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.770
Using a functional MRI to see where blood
was flowing in the brain, researchers found

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.150
the striatum and prefrontal cortex are both
involved when making a decision.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.610
They asked participants how they were feeling.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.220
According to their findings, the more items
people have to choose from, the higher their

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.900
anxiety about the choice!

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.819
We're worried about making the "wrong" choice,
and that gives us anxiety; and these were

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.110
win-win situations, remember!

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.900
The participants were picking between winning
a camcorder or a digital camera at auction,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.800
or a desk lamp and a water bottle.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.180
Not exactly tough choices.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.310
These researchers believe the feelings and
the anxiety evolved for different reasons;

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.010
that they come from different "circuits."

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.520
The lead researcher said, "One [circuit] is
about evaluating the thing we're going to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.420
get, and the other is about guiding our actions
and working out how difficult the choice will

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.420
be."

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.150
Over multiple experiments they found how much
time we have to make the decision isn't important…

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.590
Which explains why I stand in the grocery
aisle so long looking at the same few cans

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.459
of chili tomatoes.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.930
Their findings suggest "the anxiety stems
from the conflict of making the decision,"

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.220
rather than what they can win from making
the right one.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.810
When it comes to big decisions, like going
to college or whether to get married, this

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.920
anxiety can be paralyzing.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.700
In the Steve Jobs biography, it was described
that his house was stark and empty, and that

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.400
it took him months or years to pick a couch
to buy… sounds like decision paralysis;

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.360
also called analysis paralysis.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.640
The anxiety causes people to over-analyze
a decision with too many options and to escape

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.920
the anxiety, they simply avoid the decision
altogether.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.070
Humans are terrible multitaskers.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.720
We can hold onto about three things at once,
and when making a decision we can benefit

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.470
from trimming the fat.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.430
That might explain why some "geniuses" don't
tire themselves by having a variety of clothes

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.060
to choose from, or going to a coffee shop
with lots of choices.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.229
One shortcut is to just have a regular choice.

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.239
Always getting the club sandwich, for example,
or grabbing the black turtleneck every day;

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.449
will cut back on "decision fatigue," freeing
up mental power for more decisions later!

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.169
What do you think about decision fatigue?

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.169
Is it real?

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.169
YOU DECIDE!!

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.150
I'll make another decision for you, though,
so you're not tired, YES, you want to sub

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
to DNews!

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.150
See?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.150
Isn't that better?

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.800
Here's another decision I can make for you,
grab a ticket for our live show in San Francisco

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.889
coming up next week October 22! DNews After
Dark is going to bring together some of DNews'

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.550
favorite people for a night of science on
stage, live at the Castro Theater!

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.560
Tickets are available through the link in
the description and I'd love to see you at

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.720
our first-ever show!!

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.910
If you don't live nearby, that's okay too.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.610
I've got this video you can watch about how
NOT deciding what to wear might help you get

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.259
a job.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.119
Thanks for watching DNews, y'all!

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.749
Happy decisionmaking!
