00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.370
Excellent. Ready? Boom. All right, we're lot. Hello John. What's up man?

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.740
How are you Joe? How you doing? Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.270
Thanks a lot for having me, man. It's great.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.250
I heard you on media podcasts and uh, it blew my mind. I mean, I,

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.390
I could not believe, let's just let everybody know what this is about.

6
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.900
You were a game warden or you are a game warden, right?

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.040
And what that normally entails is like, you know,

8
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.580
you find a guy and he's got three trout when he's only supposed to have two.

9
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.690
It's normal stuff like catchy catching people doing something they're not

10
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:36.530
supposed to. Just make sure people follow the rules. Right.

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.030
Along the way,

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.420
you guys started discovering these illegal grow ops where cartels were growing

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:49.761
marijuana and you turn from being a regular game warden to essentially,

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.810
well, why don't you let us know how it worked out? Yeah, Joe, it was,

15
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.980
it was a crazy journey because you don't think of game wardens doing the type of

16
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.310
work we were doing when it come to the trespass grows in the cartel issue.

17
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:04.440
You know? And what do everybody think? They think game warns,

18
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.220
check fishing licenses, check your deer tag or elk tag. Look for too many,

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.090
you know, animals poaching, spotlighting. And honestly, when I started the job,

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
I got hired back in 1992. That's what I dreamed of doing. You know,

21
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.230
I grew up hunting and fishing and I got my a hundred safety certificate with

22
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.090
dad's help at nine years old. So I was all in the woods, you know,

23
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:27.300
the woods are my church. I just loved it. It cause three generations of family.

24
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.040
My grandfather's career, Navy, my dad, you know, as an army guy and you know,

25
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.640
we just had conservation in our family, you know, um, for generations.

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.850
So I got the job, did it, and I did all the traditional stuff to start.

27
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.300
We came down here to Southern California to start my career in Riverside County.

28
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.550
So it was just over the Hill, you know, from,

29
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:48.510
from LA here and working all the traditional stuff, fishing regulations,

30
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.130
night hunting, you know,

31
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.190
working deer openers is really cool to be a deer Hunter for all those years.

32
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:54.310
And then actually go, you know,

33
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.750
talk to guys on the other side and see all the good guys out there and some

34
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:02.220
problems. Um, and then in, uh, 1995,

35
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.200
I got to go back home towards the Silicon Valley.

36
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.350
That's where I'm originally from. Born and raised, so live in the suburbs,

37
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:10.770
kind of the Foothill areas of the Silicon Valley South, the San Jose there.

38
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.290
And in 2004, I F I stumbled into my first,

39
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
uh, you know, cartel, what we call a trespass marijuana grow site and you know,

40
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.700
to specify this stuff now, now that we're regulating, you know,

41
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.350
the last couple of years here in California,

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.660
these are not sanctioned marijuana sites.

43
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.930
This isn't the legitimate industry that's doing it by the numbers and trying to,

44
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.270
this is always illegal. Uh, these are always here, you know, on public lands,

45
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.410
destroying our environmental waterways and our wildlife and on private land as

46
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.510
well. And on that situation.

47
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.930
I had a good friend of mine that I grew up with on that was doing his master's

48
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.370
thesis at San Jose state university, both of our Alma mater on steelhead trout,

49
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.190
endangered species, red legged, yellow legged frog,

50
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:54.930
and all the aquatics in these two creeks.

51
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.770
And this was right below Henry COE state park where I really met my first game

52
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:00.040
or, and

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 1>that was an inspiration to get the job. So these waterways are really sensitive,</v>

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.700
headwaters coming down through this stretch for like three miles.

55
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.700
All these endangered species in it, black tail, deer, you know,

56
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.730
all these other great animals we like as conservationists,

57
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.200
they're thriving on this Creek. And he called me one day in April and said,

58
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.580
Hey John, this is weird.

59
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.390
One of my two creeks is bone dry and all the fish,

60
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.890
the steelhead fry are dead. You know, everything living on this Creek is dead.

61
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.480
There's a bunch of like debris and plastic lining and it looks like camping

62
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.210
stuff that's down at the bottom of where this Creek feeds out.

63
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.170
So I get them in the truck and I figured, I'm thinking, okay,

64
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.640
someone's diverting water up there.

65
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.160
It's probably a ranch or Nina for cattle operation, whatever.

66
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.470
We only top of the Hill joke and we start the hike down and I'm by myself,

67
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.460
you know, I got my, my got my rifle, got my gear, don't have any radio coverage,

68
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.890
don't have any cell phone coverage. I have an unarmed civilian,

69
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.450
my partner biologists with me.

70
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900
And we're expecting to find something very predictable that I'd seen up to that

71
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.110
point. And that would've been a normal water diversion.

72
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.410
And when we found the water source in a beautiful Canyon,

73
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.940
I mean crystal clear water, trout Creek, the whole nine, start hiking down it,

74
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:11.740
following this. Uh, we see the dam,

75
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.640
we see the waterline go about a hundred yards down this beautiful little grand

76
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.720
Canyon like Creek. And there's much marijuana plants and they're short.

77
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.880
Cause it's early in the season, they're only about two feet tall.

78
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.870
And we see two growers and they're not the growers on tip, you know,

79
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:29.140
that I would have suspected these guys are, you know, they got rifles,

80
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200
they got handguns,

81
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.820
they got knives and they're kind of cruising work in their plants coming toward

82
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.120
us. And that was that Oh shit moment. You know,

83
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.540
if something crazy goes down right now and I got no backup,

84
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.180
I got a civilian with me. These guys are armed.

85
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:46.660
They're not your typical poacher that I've ever encountered. And um,

86
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.890
we didn't get seen. We kinda hit out, you know, he's a Hunter. I'm a Hunter.

87
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:55.450
We stayed, you know, using our stocking and Stan to the Creek bank and just,

88
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.800
just watch as these guys work their plantation and went on up the Hill and I

89
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.090
looked at this and went, what did we just walk into? This is crazy. Um,

90
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.030
we got out safely and that's when I started to bring in other agencies,

91
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.530
narcotic groups, task forces, the Sheriff's office, um, met, you know,

92
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:15.610
started to learn other agencies in my area. This is really on in the game.

93
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.940
What did you guys do about that one? Grow up like when you found it,

94
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.340
like how did, how did they resolve that? Well,

95
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.600
we got a team together as fast as we could safely and usually it takes a couple

96
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.820
of weeks and I want to say within a month we were back there.

97
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.170
Now the interesting part was game warns aren't known for doing this type of

98
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.500
work. Just like you said at the start, right? So they're like, well,

99
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.010
you guys know the area, you went in there, help us find it,

100
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.040
get us into the area, but we're going to lead the raid and we'll,

101
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.070
so of course this is your jurisdiction. We don't normally do this type of stuff.

102
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.400
So, uh, so go for it. So we were the bird dogs.

103
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:53.380
We kinda guided them into the area. We had like 20, 30 officers. We, uh,

104
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.950
kind of led them down to the Canyon, got 'em in there safely. Um, we,

105
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.200
the two growers, we spoke to them, they didn't get caught that day. They,

106
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.440
they ran down the Canyon. Nobody pursued, some of us wanted to,

107
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.810
obviously because of the environmental damages.

108
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.130
But the biggest thing that changed the game for me that day was seeing the

109
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.430
environmental damage. So that was a 7,000 plant garden.

110
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.090
And at the time we didn't know about these ban and toxic substances,

111
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:21.690
these insecticides Carbofuran that they're bringing up from Tijuana and,

112
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.910
and transporting actually smuggling from cross the border to put on these plants

113
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.850
to keep everything living off of it, not to impact their cash crop.

114
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.120
And that was out there in some extent, but it was so early.

115
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.140
We weren't really aware of the level of toxicity to this stuff and how damaging

116
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.850
it is. Um, so it was all new, but we eradicated that, that garden.

117
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.040
And then when we were done eradicating it, we had all this mess in the Creek,

118
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.110
right? We had camp trash, we had fertilizers, pollutants, propane tanks,

119
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.400
um, all over in this beautiful channel that's now dry cause it's been diverted.

120
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.490
Unbeknownst to us, all that water was totally poisoned,

121
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.850
that they were diverting to water the plants. That's why that Creek was so dry.

122
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.780
Um, and we, we, uh, we eradicated everything and then it was like, okay,

123
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.740
we're out of here. And I looked around and went, Oh, wait a minute man.

124
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.400
I know we got the, I know we got the illegal marijuana out,

125
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:15.650
but what are we going to do about all this environmental damage?

126
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.480
And nobody was recommitting the damage or, or, or cleaning up any of this mess.

127
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.520
So I, the first thing I thought was we have a resource issue. That's crazy.

128
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.310
I mean, I've, you know, spent my whole career up to this point,

129
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.570
protecting wildlife, preserving waterways for all of us to enjoy, you know,

130
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.790
conservationist enthusiast, whatever side of the fence you're on. And uh,

131
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.080
nothing was getting done on that.

132
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:43.010
So kind of the light bulb went off a little bit that we need to do more to this

133
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.410
if we're going to get involved and we need to get involved in these types of

134
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:49.790
grow operations because it was a biggest environmental, uh, you know,

135
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:50.960
train wreck I'd ever seen.

136
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:53.600
And I'd worked a lot of traditional game worn stuff to,

137
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:55.620
to protect those resources. So once they

138
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.120
<v 2>gotten everyone out and chopped all the plants up or did what they did,</v>

139
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.030
did they try to reclaim the Creek?

140
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.780
Do they try to remove the dam and get the water to run back again?

141
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.140
<v 1>At that time? No. No one was doing it right. And that's,</v>

142
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.040
that's exactly rather what, what really, really kind of upset me. And again,

143
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.200
we were new at the game. We were the game wardens.

144
00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:20.370
Nobody really thought of us as mainline law enforcement or you know,

145
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:22.860
narcotics task force guys or anything like that at the time.

146
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:26.310
So I wasn't gonna make waves. We just wanted to integrate and work together.

147
00:08:26.311 --> 00:08:30.090
We wanted to unify these teams and what I really wanted to do at this point is

148
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.990
get back with my command staff, add, you know, my bosses and go, Hey,

149
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:35.940
we got a big, big problem out there man.

150
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:40.290
And there's more of this going on and we need to be involved even though it's

151
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:44.070
not traditional because we're sworn to protect our resources and we'll,

152
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:47.640
besides everything game wardens do that you think of from the wildlife

153
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:51.480
standpoint where mainline law enforcement, just like every police officer,

154
00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:51.751
right?

155
00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:55.260
We go through the same training and then what people don't realize is we through

156
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.040
two more months of

157
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.550
<v 0>additional training in a really long Academy that's all wildlife specific,</v>

158
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.420
wildlife forensics, wildlife ID, weapons identification,

159
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.830
all the things you really need to do the game or inside of it with wildlife,

160
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:10.590
you know, in the back country so to speak. Um,

161
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.650
but we needed to integrate with other agencies and kind of bring them into our

162
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:15.270
world if we were going to participate.

163
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:20.271
So that one case started the change in me to try to build those relationships

164
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:25.170
and get into tactics and tactical circles with some of these, you know,

165
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.950
SWAT and special operations units that would go in and do this job under normal

166
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.580
circumstances. If that was just being diverted by a rancher.

167
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.030
So if a rancher had done that and the Creek was dry, how would you,

168
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.620
how would you fix that?

169
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.210
We would've got with him and it's what's called a stream at alteration violation

170
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.270
and is 1602 and our fish and game code is the section, but,

171
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.170
and it's a very common section cause water's diverted for a lot of reasons and

172
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.840
you can divert water with a permit and certain circumstances,

173
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:55.380
but you can't completely denude a Creek that as wildlife thriving,

174
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:58.770
that's a waterway of the state for everybody to enjoy. Which this one was.

175
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.110
And if normally the case would be that they would have to re just have the,

176
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.130
the flow come back to exactly how it was before the dam and yep.

177
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.560
Yeah. That would be up to the rancher.

178
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.470
That would be up to the ranch or be part of a penalty. You know,

179
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.060
it could be a civil, it could be a criminal,

180
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:19.050
it could be a probationary fix it and you're okay. So there was no real,

181
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.440
there's no law involved or nothing in place rather to S when you found these

182
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:28.740
grow ops, like there was no previous precedent. Right, exactly. It was,

183
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:31.740
it was completely brand new. And this was, you know,

184
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.340
one of the first grows I think that any of us had found throughout the state of

185
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.440
California's game or in,

186
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.610
I mean there are other guys finding some things and working,

187
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:42.630
but being from the Silicon Valley and being inspired by those wild lands to

188
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.380
everything I became later and what I stand for, it was home, you know,

189
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.160
when it did hit home.

190
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.630
But seeing that and getting to meet certain guys from the Sheriff's department

191
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:55.500
in my first book goes into this whole learning experience of, you know,

192
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:59.160
ad hoc jumping in with other agencies and doing it. Is this the hidden war? Uh,

193
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.560
this was the first book more in the woods. War in the woods.

194
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.880
So we wrote war in the woods and then hidden war is the new one. Yeah,

195
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.880
hidden Wars, the brand new.

196
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:08.070
And that just came out and they're basically 10 years apart.

197
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.370
And the cool part about that, Joe, is when you look at the differences,

198
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.810
we do some major comparisons.

199
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:15.870
And what Warren woods covers is that chapter one's,

200
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:18.510
that first mission I'm telling you about right now because that was like being

201
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.900
live here. It is, you know, we're not in Kansas anymore. So it was crazy.

202
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.970
The people in the higher ups yeah.

203
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.090
That were in charge of trying to eradicate the grow up and take the cartel the

204
00:11:30.091 --> 00:11:34.860
guys down what, so there, that was their job was just handling that.

205
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.310
It was just handling the, the marijuana aspect of it. Right, right.

206
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.380
And then the armed cartel guys.

207
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.610
So there was no one in place that was supposed to take care of the waterway.

208
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.910
There wasn't, that seems so crazy to me. It does.

209
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.440
It was one of those things that it was,

210
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.830
it was based on the fact that a conservation group,

211
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.690
like from an agency like fish and wildlife like us,

212
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.690
we just weren't involved where we would be looking at those environmental

213
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:02.170
damages. Right, right. But from a narcotics officer's standpoint,

214
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.740
you may see the damages, but it may not register. There might not be an,

215
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.960
you know, a mandate or even objective to clean that stuff up. And,

216
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.240
and back at the time,

217
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.640
DEA was funding all of our States and all of our County teams based on the

218
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:17.440
number of marijuana plants we eradicated.

219
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.040
So there wasn't any recognition of the environmental damages and any type of

220
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:26.800
funding based on how much reclamation and clean up you didn't know that would

221
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:29.110
change fortunately. And we were the,

222
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.750
we were a big part of making that change fortunately, but,

223
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.780
and there wasn't a lot of um, funding or, or you know,

224
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:37.720
point kickback or value to catch 'em bad guys to catch.

225
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.460
And some of these guys that were doing the damages,

226
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:43.240
so a lot of teams then were dropping it on helicopter lines,

227
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.930
cut and plants getting a big plant count, getting funded for it, taken,

228
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.320
taking the weed out. And that was it. So crazy. Like, yeah, I would imagine,

229
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.480
I mean, obviously I'm, I don't work in law enforcement,

230
00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.430
but I would imagine there would be one person who would like detailed plan.

231
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.960
Right. And I would think that, well,

232
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.200
what happened while we found out that this Creek was dry? Yeah. Okay,

233
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.360
well we've got a resume. The Creek. Yeah.

234
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.450
Wouldn't that be like part of the plan? It would,

235
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:15.100
you would think it should be. Right. But it's all basically new territory.

236
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.970
Completely new. And so we're only talking about 15 years ago as well,

237
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:20.980
which is really crazy. Yeah, it was,

238
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.480
it was the start of a big shift in my career because I saw this as a big

239
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:30.460
problem. I also, up until in 2005 we were on, you know,

240
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.020
one of our first, second, third since third operations.

241
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:38.620
Since this one we just mentioned in 2004 and in August 5th of 2005,

242
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:41.440
the game completely changed cause that's when we were involved in our first

243
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.450
gunfight. And that's when my partner warden, who I trained in the Academy,

244
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.770
we were partners in the squad.

245
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.920
I had promoted to be the Lieutenant for two and a half counties,

246
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:54.280
the Silicon Valley, Santa Clara County, Monterrey part of, uh, um,

247
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.610
San Benito 20 days before this incident happened.

248
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.510
And I had young wardens that wanted to participate and do some of the stuff I

249
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:05.200
was doing with the other agencies on the marijuana, you know, operational front.

250
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.210
And this was, you know,

251
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:10.420
right above the tech capital of the world right there in Silicon Valley and Los

252
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.120
Gatos. We were in really steep, arid country, you know, August,

253
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.970
right before the age zone, dear opener, where you're all gearing up for that.

254
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.120
And was three game wardens, three Sheriff's officers.

255
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.140
I'm good Sheriff's officers that we've met on that first separation in 2004.

256
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:27.730
I just gave you the story on. And um, they were in harvest time,

257
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.920
they were fortified, they had heavy weapons like S K S is the AK 47 derivative,

258
00:14:32.921 --> 00:14:34.000
sawed off shotguns.

259
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.450
And they had the growth set up where they were basically defending it.

260
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.670
And when we came in there was an ambush shot from one of the growers and that

261
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.390
was the one shot the bad guys got off.

262
00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:48.790
And unfortunately that's the shot that hit my partner, um, through both legs.

263
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.640
And that bullet went through the right thigh and tumbled through his right leg,

264
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.900
then kept going through his left.

265
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:58.901
So he's down and we're trying to keep him from bleeding out of four holes for

266
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:02.930
the better part of three hours waiting for an air rescue. And we had, you know,

267
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.620
nobody in the country from the standpoint of a law enforcement team had ever

268
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:10.370
been attacked by these growers. We'd, you know, we chase them around,

269
00:15:10.371 --> 00:15:13.790
they'd run away. Sometimes we'd find weapons. Oftentimes we wouldn't.

270
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.940
But so this was just a real eye opener.

271
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.140
Like what the fuck did we just walk into?

272
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.560
And plus my partner was real close to not making it.

273
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:23.390
And fortunately he did survivor.

274
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.120
I don't know that we'd be sitting here telling this story and talking about it,

275
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.570
but that day when I saw how well they were equipped,

276
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.180
the type of weaponry they had, um,

277
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.630
and the fact that I almost didn't come home that day, I went, okay,

278
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.460
this is super dangerous. We can't do this as standard patrol game or ins.

279
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.560
We can't do this doing just the traditional stuff.

280
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.180
We should stay involved in it. Because aside from being so violent,

281
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:49.850
the environmental damages Joe were the worst I'd still ever seen.

282
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:51.170
And they just kept getting worse and worse.

283
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:54.680
The more operations I'd worked in my home County. Right. Um,

284
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:57.380
so we learned a lot from that. There were a lot of tactical lessons there,

285
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.920
a lot of team lessons, a lot of things we could've done different.

286
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.070
And that kinda changed the game where we eventually got to what we're going to

287
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:05.420
talk about a little bit later now,

288
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:10.421
since 2004 have there been plans implemented to clean up Oh,

289
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.780
and also restore waterways and all the different absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

290
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:18.050
And so now there's like a whole, they realize this is an issue and so there's,

291
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.200
there's precedent, there's very much so and,

292
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.100
and that largely came from what we saw, you know, in those early years.

293
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:30.101
The 2004 first stop on down there on Dexter Canyon Creek and then what we had on

294
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.050
Sierra Zola,

295
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.870
my partner was shot in 2005 about then we started also see the band poisons in

296
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:40.250
these grows like the carbo fear on bottles. Um, and just to give a background,

297
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.470
this stuff is so deadly. Um,

298
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:45.860
it was made as an insecticide or rodenticide just to kill anything that you put

299
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:47.450
on any type agricultural product.

300
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.100
And it was made originally back in I think like the 50s for legitimate

301
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:52.910
agriculture.

302
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.910
And then they found out how toxic it was and EPA banned it from U S or even

303
00:16:58.221 --> 00:16:58.701
possession.

304
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:01.940
It's a felony to have it in the country and use it anywhere without special

305
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:05.660
licenses, um, through legitimate channels here in America.

306
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.300
And they ban it like 15 years ago cause it was so nasty.

307
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.810
But because it does keep everything off the marijuana plants,

308
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:15.020
I mean nothing can even get near it without dying almost instantly.

309
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.480
They still get it in third world countries.

310
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:20.630
They can get it in Mexico and it gets smuggled across the border with the grow

311
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:21.150
groups,

312
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.400
the drug trafficking groups because it's so effective regardless how poison it

313
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:25.581
is.

314
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:29.000
And we were starting to see more and more of that stuff as we were starting to

315
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:31.490
ramp more of a specialty to do in this job more, you know,

316
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.390
thoroughly and safely and get into the cleanup of this is one of the many

317
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:35.600
things.

318
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.910
I brought this up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I talked about you and um,

319
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.720
cause he's a against federally making marijuana federally illegal.

320
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.870
And I said one of the problems with it being illegal is this,

321
00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:50.880
and I was explaining these grow ops that for the rest of the country where

322
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:54.290
marijuana is illegal, the vast majority,

323
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.500
like what was the number that you said the percentage that was grown in

324
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.820
California that's illegally sold through the rest of the country? 70 80%.

325
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.970
So 70 80% of the entire marijuana population or marijuana product that you're

326
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.930
buying, if you live in, in place like South Dakota where wherever it's,

327
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.960
I don't even know it's legal in South Dakota where it's illegal. Right?

328
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:17.970
They're buying it from here. Exactly.

329
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.860
And it's because one of the reasons is because our state laws say that,

330
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.521
well first of all,

331
00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:26.940
we're close to Mexico so the cartel members can come up really quickly. Right.

332
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.120
And then the other problem is that our state laws,

333
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.620
when we made marijuana legal recreationally here weeks,

334
00:18:33.621 --> 00:18:38.621
severely lowered the penalty for an illegal grow up became a misdemeanor.

335
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:43.260
Correct. That was the, that was the thing, you know, when, when we started the,

336
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.630
the departments special team,

337
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.800
the spec ops marijuana enforcement team that had more goes into, um,

338
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.370
part of my job as being the cofounder of that and the team leader was outreach.

339
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:58.430
So I was speaking to legislative groups before we legalized under prop 64 and

340
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:03.870
then the tighter medicinal marijuana laws that came about that same time. Um,

341
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.490
and I was talking to anybody,

342
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.180
conservation groups that you and I would be part of. Um, preservation,

343
00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.950
animal rights groups, high school kids assemblies, right. Watch out. You know,

344
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.130
if you're using weed, make sure you're not using this stuff cause it's so nasty.

345
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.330
Things like that. Um, and my whole point was if we're going to regulate guys,

346
00:19:21.331 --> 00:19:23.520
we see a common, let's just regulate smart,

347
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.870
let's not lessen any penalties for the trespass grow that the cartels are doing

348
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.680
in our public lands and private lands and also the other gang groups.

349
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:35.700
And there's, there's other groups, you know, to a smaller extent. Um,

350
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.420
but unfortunately when we did regulate and all that was passed two years ago,

351
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.040
they did water it down so publicly and cultivation went to, like you said,

352
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:45.300
it's a felony to a misdemeanor.

353
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:50.250
And if you're at juvenile cultivator on public private land and one of these

354
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:53.400
juvenile, you know, cartel members and there's a lot of young ones learning,

355
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.840
it's an, it's an infraction.

356
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.220
And that took a lot of emphasis away from that part of the problem and left us

357
00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:02.100
out there basically alone with a couple other agencies to fight it. Well,

358
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:05.850
for the average person that would sound before you knew about the cartel grows,

359
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.880
that would sound like a good idea. Well, Hey, if marijuana is legal,

360
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.770
what's the problem? What's the big deal? Exactly.

361
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.120
And then the other problem is these people that are buying this marijuana in the

362
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:15.901
rest of the country,

363
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:19.620
it's highly likely that they're going to have some of that pesticide on it.

364
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.870
Right. And how bad is that stuff?

365
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.740
Is that stuff ever killed someone from smoking this illegal marijuana?

366
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.550
We don't know if it's killed anybody directly because by the time it gets

367
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:32.190
distributed throughout the country, it does dissipate a little bit,

368
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.140
but it's still highly toxic. To put it in perspective, about three years ago,

369
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.740
we had two federal officers back East. Now even in California,

370
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.400
in a public land grow that had all that toxic on it.

371
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.400
So they have cartel grows out there. They do. They do. They actually,

372
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.930
we have them in about 2025 to 27 other States to a much lesser extent.

373
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.010
And something we need to look at is California. I mean,

374
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:59.530
we're one of only six Mediterranean climates on the whole globe.

375
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:02.500
So we are a great weed growing state, just like our wine industry, man.

376
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:06.100
We got great, great weather for it so we can grow outdoors and indoors.

377
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.210
I mean February to almost December. Right? And that's why it's grown here.

378
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:12.870
And that's why the black market, both in, you know,

379
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.820
the private land communities and the cartels are everywhere across the country

380
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:20.020
with this stuff. But they'll go wherever they can to, you know,

381
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:23.800
diversify the network. So we do have it in other States to a much lesser extent.

382
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.960
And then something we need to remember is,

383
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:28.720
even though about half the country has these, grows in him too,

384
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.850
to a lesser extent than California,

385
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.190
the same groups are under the same enterprise.

386
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.440
They're human doing human trafficking, doing gun running, you know, to fuel the,

387
00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:40.750
the fight down in Mexico, uh, methamphetamine production.

388
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.410
And now the new synthetic fentanyl that's just killing thousands,

389
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:47.110
especially on the East coast, are coming from these groups.

390
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.000
So it's all one enterprise.

391
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:52.990
And of course we focus on the cannabis issue because that's what's affecting our

392
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:56.230
wild lands in our waterways. It's right at the hub. So yeah, it is.

393
00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:59.500
It's nationwide. It's not a California problem. And we made really,

394
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.220
really careful, even though we're talking about a team in California,

395
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:04.054
game wardens,

396
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.480
we're trying to tell a nationwide story cause the nation needs to know,

397
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.840
well it seems like you, I mean not just seems like it is,

398
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:15.250
you guys were not trained for this and there was no one else there.

399
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.860
So it was like, Hey, put it on the game wardens,

400
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.260
they're going to have to handle this now. Which is really, to me,

401
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:23.340
kind of insane. It is. But then at the flip side, we're,

402
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.830
we're really passionate about protecting what you and I love, right?

403
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.950
Our Wildlands and our waterways and our wildlife especially.

404
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:34.900
So we have a passionate interest in protecting those resources and not to

405
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:36.580
mention keeping our public safe in the same,

406
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.750
in the same breath because these are in public areas. I mean,

407
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:44.740
we have a lot of these national parks. Um, we have like, you know,

408
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.320
not only you'd have the armed gunman that could, you know,

409
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.720
shoot at a Hunter or a hiker and a question,

410
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:52.300
anybody in the outdoors and enjoys our, you know,

411
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:57.130
what the great outdoors have to offer. Um, but you have, you know,

412
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.530
uh, all, all the other threats that come with that, you know,

413
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.470
it's not just an armed gunman. They're putting punji pits,

414
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.130
literally Vietnam era punji pits on some of these trails when upon Zipit for

415
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:07.450
people don't know. Absolutely.

416
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.070
So back in the Vietnam conflict with the via calling when do to detour our

417
00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:17.071
American soldiers is they dig a pit underground on a trail and it'd be about 18

418
00:23:17.261 --> 00:23:21.100
to 20 inches deep and you know, square to kind of cover a whole trail.

419
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.830
Then they cover it up with bamboo or leaf litter.

420
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:27.100
So it just looked like the trail and then our soldiers would kind of walk and

421
00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:30.490
they'd step into that. And here's the sharpen sticks out of bamboo.

422
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:34.000
They're super sharp and they're pointed upward. So when you step into it,

423
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.180
you're going to share a shin, you're going to puncture, you know, your leg,

424
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:41.500
maybe an artery. And they would put human excrement, excuse me,

425
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:45.160
on the points to induce bacteria induced infection.

426
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.540
And basically you take our soldiers, you know, out of the operation.

427
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.410
What we started seeing in 2015 and the first one he found was actually in

428
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:54.990
national park up in Shasta County, a whiskey town. And uh,

429
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.670
it was a punji pit going into a gross site on a public trail.

430
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:01.070
I mean it was hundreds of yards, Joe from the Crow,

431
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.020
but anybody could have walked in on it.

432
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.050
We were running an operation with Shasta County and this was when we had our

433
00:24:06.051 --> 00:24:10.100
full time dedicated team in the hidden warrior. Um,

434
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:15.130
and our point man was about to step into this thing and Arcanine Phoebe that I'm

435
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:15.951
sure you know,

436
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:19.070
we talked about it on Steven's show a little bit on mediator and also, uh,

437
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.060
Mike Ritland who has a show called Mike drop and he's a seal team,

438
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:26.660
three veteran and canine trainer. He really got into the dog stories, right?

439
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:29.510
We talked about that. But Phoebe, amazing dog,

440
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.650
she had been trained to sniff these banned poisons so she could smell it,

441
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:36.140
you know, a mile out with that. Amazing knows our canines have.

442
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.740
And right before our point man was about to step into it.

443
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.440
Phoebe alerted and Bryan pulled everybody back,

444
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.950
her handler and my teammate and sure enough he did some digging and pulled back

445
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:46.371
the tarp.

446
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:50.420
And then here's this punji pit and it had the band toxics actually on the

447
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:53.900
sticks. So what would that have done if one of us had stepped into it?

448
00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:58.220
So that was a real aggressive anti-personnel technique that could, you know,

449
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.330
that could have decimated a Hunter or hiker or anybody else. So.

450
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.300
So that was wildlife or wildlife. Yeah, yeah.

451
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:09.170
Some of these pit traps for wildlife and these big, you know, Wells,

452
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:12.740
they're digging in cisterns and they're doing this to keep people out or they're

453
00:25:12.741 --> 00:25:15.230
doing this for animals. Like what are the, what are they doing?

454
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.040
Something like that. It has to be targeted against people. But we have,

455
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:20.810
there's a lot of different things for animals too.

456
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:24.020
There's a lot of things to keep animals away from the plants. They'll do, um,

457
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.140
you know, they'll dig big pit traps that are,

458
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.150
they'll put garbage in them or they'll use them.

459
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.540
Like when we were in the middle of our really severe drought that we just came

460
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:34.400
out of here in California a couple of years ago.

461
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.550
All these mountains streams were just bone dry,

462
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.520
so they would go to the lower lands when we were doing a lot of work, you know,

463
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:43.760
in the Delta region, in the Sacramento Delta and the lowlands. And they,

464
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.290
even if they, you know,

465
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.960
were getting water from the Delta and the race land would dry up.

466
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.320
They would dig handbag Wells 2030 feet deep and they leave them open and they're

467
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:55.610
getting water from them pumping out water out of the bottom.

468
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:57.290
But those stay opens. So yeah,

469
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.560
our big and our big game animals drop into those or we could drop into them.

470
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.140
So multiple, multiple hazards. Yeah, exactly. What is the,

471
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.890
is there an estimate of how many cartel members are growing in this country

472
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.620
right now? If you say there's 27 28 States, is that what you said? Yeah.

473
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.900
What is the,

474
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.980
is there a rough estimate of how many cartel members are here right now doing

475
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:21.630
this kind of shop, this kind of stuff? You know, it's,

476
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.520
it's a real approximation because you only know based on who you catch or been

477
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:29.720
able to debrief. But like in California, we know from the amount of grows we,

478
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.990
we deal with every year just on the trespass, you know,

479
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.310
cartel front and the number of operatives it takes to run a grow and get it

480
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:41.780
started and then harvest it. I mean, conservative estimate, 10,000,

481
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.980
10,000, I'd say conservatives

482
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.070
<v 1>and California just in California. And the reason we say that,</v>

483
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:51.480
and I always go very conservative because it's such a kind of a silent

484
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:54.060
enterprise and it's really hard to get some of this data, but we've,

485
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:58.380
we've just validated it through the numbers of things we run across. You know,

486
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:03.240
when you look at the fact that it takes to skill growers that are vetted because

487
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:06.040
they cut their teeth down in Mexico, doing it effectively under the federal,

488
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.940
Alice knows and they grow well. And, uh, and,

489
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:10.950
and you mentioned this when you had Mike Baker on the show,

490
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.280
which was interesting, and you hit it on the head when you said, man,

491
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:15.840
these guys are really resourceful. You know,

492
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.430
you've got to respect their work ethic and, and you have to, because they're,

493
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.550
they're hiking waterline, they're hiking infrastructure in,

494
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.630
they're covering their tracks. Um, they're out there for six months at a time.

495
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.260
They were walking around with carpet strapped to their feats and they didn't

496
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:33.960
leave footprints. Yeah. And, and hitting more, especially,

497
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:37.260
we have a whole lot of photos in that book about things we've seen on trail

498
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:40.860
cameras and they will put felt lined, lined soft,

499
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:44.310
felt on their shoes, time up tight.

500
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.260
And if they're walking like an old forest road, you know,

501
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.800
this got a gravel base, you'll never see that track. I mean, you know,

502
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.790
you've tracked big game. I've done it. You know,

503
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.930
it's the same type of technique. And if you don't have any sign,

504
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.900
I mean they're really good at disguising. And we actually found a guy,

505
00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.140
and I have a picture of this in the book and also in the PowerPoint when I,

506
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.810
when I teach to this throughout the country, um,

507
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.880
cow hooves actually carved out of wood because a couple of years ago we were,

508
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:10.260
you know, the us forest service,

509
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.650
a lot of this grow problem is on our national forests. You know,

510
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.870
Northern California in Northeastern California,

511
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:18.930
not so much Silicon Valley where I started, but the rest of the state,

512
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:20.830
even down here, and I'm,

513
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.520
what these guys would do is there's cattle leases on those properties where,

514
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.250
you know, ranchers can run cattle on part of the forest and you know,

515
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:30.720
or a joint on private property. And we were getting tips on a bunch of grows,

516
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:30.961
you know,

517
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:34.290
or you've seen him from the air or a Hunter or angler would report him or we'd

518
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:37.950
have a suspicion because of a waterway or we get see some plants from satellite

519
00:28:37.951 --> 00:28:40.260
or whatever and we go try to find this girl.

520
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.090
And we weren't picking up tracks and we're, you know,

521
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:44.400
we were pretty good at finding these things.

522
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:47.610
Now we've been trial and error in it for a lot of lot of years. Um,

523
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:50.250
but we're seeing a lot of cattle tracks cause we're running around with cows.

524
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.900
And sure enough they were putting on cow hooves and strapping them on top or on

525
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:59.400
underneath their, their boots clomping around to disguise themselves as cattle.

526
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.690
Clever. Right.

527
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.320
And then once they get way up into a deep Canyon where they're going to put

528
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:04.651
their grow,

529
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:07.320
they just take them off and throw them in a backpack and then the light bulb

530
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:10.500
went off. Would we better look at, you know, our tracks a little more carefully.

531
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.980
So how do you guys try to go about finding these things? Do you,

532
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.030
do you rely on people reporting them or do you have like aerial surveys?

533
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.100
Like how do you, it's a mix of all of that. Um,

534
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.620
we get a lot of reports from people in the ground and our,

535
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.680
our best reporting parties are what we call our PS are hunters and anglers when

536
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:32.940
it comes to the outdoor public.

537
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:36.240
But anyone in the outdoors could run across some, but hunters and anglers,

538
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.090
especially because where do we go when we're,

539
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.130
when we're going to find a good water hole for elk or, you know, we're hunting

540
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.520
<v 0>rock tail, we're going to go, you know, we're not gonna stay on the beaten path,</v>

541
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:47.440
man. We're going to go down to the headwaters,

542
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:49.810
we're going to find a pristine area. We're going to get away from people.

543
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.800
So the people that are going the deepest into the back country. Absolutely.

544
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.000
Absolutely. And then they're finding the water, you know, source and they're,

545
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.430
maybe they're following it and it's dry or it's diverted.

546
00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:04.010
Like what I found in 2004 that started this whole craziness. Um,

547
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.320
and then they run into a gro. We also, um, do find it from the air. You know,

548
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:12.740
we do all agencies. It's no, no secret, no, no tactical reveal. We've,

549
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.380
we fly to look for this stuff from the air.

550
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:18.550
I have a friend and found one on to hone ranch. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

551
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.490
A few years back. And, uh, I didn't think anything of it.

552
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.980
I thought it was just a,

553
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.530
some crazy person decided to try to grow pot and this is back before it was

554
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.900
recreationally legal. Okay. And um,

555
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.660
there was no shootout or anything crazy like that they do here.

556
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.940
They got there after. Yeah.

557
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:38.320
Either they realized that their grow up had been compromised and they took off,

558
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.420
but you know, to hone ranches enormous.

559
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:44.060
It's like 270,000 acres and uh, just the,

560
00:30:44.061 --> 00:30:48.400
the gall of these guys to go deep into that ranch and set up this grow site.

561
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.240
Right. And the guys who worked there, they, I guess they just stumbled upon it.

562
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.810
I think they stumbled upon it because of garbage too, if I remember correctly.

563
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.180
Yeah. That, that, that follows track. And the thing,

564
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.880
now you're talking about a private hunting ranch.

565
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.040
It's got a catalyst and all that tones. Huge.

566
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.800
We'd done a lot of good stuff with toe and ranch and supported, you know,

567
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:09.250
good hunting programs there. But an interesting statistic,

568
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:12.700
when I retired last year in December in 2018, you know, I mean,

569
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:15.670
we keep stats ever since. One of the cool things about the,

570
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:20.110
our specialized team start in 2013 is we solidified all the documentation to be

571
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:23.890
spot on. You know, reporting was kind of haphazard throughout the state.

572
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:25.660
We weren't sure what other agencies were doing,

573
00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:28.810
but we knew what we were doing now. And so I'm keeping that data.

574
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.610
And there was a real shift in just public land presence of these cartel growers.

575
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.810
And by the time I, uh, retired last year, I was almost a 50, 50 split.

576
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:42.070
So ranches like tone ranch, a private hunting club in the Silicon Valley,

577
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:44.320
one up in Shasta County. So you know,

578
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:48.640
where they're doing big time conservation projects to get black tail and mule

579
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:51.100
deer and Tulia elk and everything else up in numbers.

580
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.640
And now they've got this presence on their hunting club hitting one of their

581
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:57.010
sensitive waterways, you know, so, so it's,

582
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.160
it's not just a public land thing and it's really good for everybody listening

583
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:04.000
to know that you could find it anywhere and you stumbled on it. And, uh, it's,

584
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.240
it's funny you mentioned the reporting party's the cool thing after I did

585
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.530
Stephen's show on a, a mediator and talk to those guys. Um, we sort of get tips.

586
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.350
I actually got a tip and you know, and it's, it's in play.

587
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.850
I won't say too much more about it, but we'll definitely be,

588
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.190
we'll be talking when it's all over and done, but it's gonna get handled in a,

589
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.570
it's so cool to see the guys like you and I that hunt and love it and love the

590
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:28.510
passion of what's out there are out there stumbling on this stuff and getting

591
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:31.720
out safely and, and we're fired up enough not to wait. You know, we're,

592
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.430
we're calling people to say, Hey, it's out there.

593
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:37.000
Can you help us Ritz the warden sheriffs or are you ever guys getting incidents

594
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:41.420
of hikers or anyone getting shot at or, yeah, it's happened. It's happened.

595
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:45.230
Fortunately it doesn't happen a lot where we have a lot of fatalities.

596
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:49.190
But I want to say about five, six years ago, we had a, uh,

597
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.600
a father daughter combination on a deer hunt up in one of the DS owns in

598
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:57.350
Northeastern California and they were shot at by cartel growers going in on a

599
00:32:57.351 --> 00:33:00.170
deer opener to try to harvest her first deer. You know,

600
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.960
she was coming up through the program. Yeah, it was horrible.

601
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.170
Unfortunately they weren't heard. They got out of the area, they reported it.

602
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.910
Um, we've had people run out of, you know, run out of gardens, um, by,

603
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.190
by some of these growers we have,

604
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:16.280
have other shots fired and we've had people just stay out of areas cause once

605
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:20.180
they see it or they see a guy holding a weapon like that in a marijuana

606
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:23.360
plantation, they know isn't legit. They're out of there.

607
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.910
So is there an area with a C?

608
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.050
I mean it's all public land mostly and private land. Ranch land, right.

609
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.980
But is there an area of the state where they, there's more of them, you know,

610
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.550
that's what I thought when I started. I mean, you hear about the humble,

611
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.570
you know, Trinity, the Emerald triangle, right, where just the hub of it.

612
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.960
And I thought it was more prevalent there and it's certainly massive up there.

613
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.410
Um, but I mean not from Silicon Valley where I'm from.

614
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:51.580
You wouldn't think of those foothills in that part of the state, you know,

615
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.190
being so overrun and during those, what I call, you know,

616
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:58.490
the formative years of learning this and getting involved in it and specializing

617
00:33:58.491 --> 00:33:59.390
in it. And we were really,

618
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.330
I got to give a shout out to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office and the

619
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:06.680
guys then that took us on as equals and my partners that really brought us in as

620
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.281
you know,

621
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:11.630
not only tacticians but tracking and able to identify sign as wardens do in

622
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:15.790
hunting thing in the woods where we could go and really specialize at this and,

623
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.130
and be a lot safer and do a lot better than when my partner got shot,

624
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:24.131
no five and we were doing 25 public and private land cartel grows in the Silicon

625
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:30.140
Valley at least 20 to 25 a season. Geez, that's a ton. That's insane.

626
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.070
And that doesn't seem,

627
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.940
I mean you only for folks who don't know what the season has explained that

628
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.370
yeah, the eradication season, what we call the, you know,

629
00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:38.570
the grow season when we operate,

630
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:42.890
the heaviest is usually an early start would be some time may.

631
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.560
And then we'd go all the way to like about the end of September.

632
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:46.460
And I mean there's, you know,

633
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:49.400
there's some wiggle room on both ends of that depending on water and how long

634
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:52.880
the winter goes. But, but from may to pretty much the end of September.

635
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:56.420
So it's going on just somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six months.

636
00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:59.730
And you're looking at 25 different operations. Yeah.

637
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.810
And that's in just Santa Clara County as an example. And we,

638
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.200
when we formed the full time team in 2013 and we had representatives and we have

639
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:11.930
representatives on our marijuana enforcement team, our fish, you know,

640
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.340
our agency specific team,

641
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.830
we would have guys covering every part of the state and responsible team members

642
00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:23.720
spread out covering every County. And as of now, and we've been, well,

643
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.580
we had six full operational years before.

644
00:35:25.581 --> 00:35:29.000
I retired now it's in good hands and the team's doing fantastic work.

645
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.160
We've had at least a grow,

646
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:34.360
if not several in every County in the state and most counties multiple.

647
00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.550
So to put it in perspective, um, on an average,

648
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.890
your team have do 125 missions if not more.

649
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.780
So that's a 125 gross sites that we were responsible for doing the workup,

650
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:48.300
the planning, going in and doing the apprehension,

651
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:51.570
the stocking to catch these guys with our canines and with our tactics.

652
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.500
Then doing the eradication. And 90% of them are all, you know,

653
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:57.410
tainted in that Ferdinand and the carbo fear.

654
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.800
And sometimes to the point that it's so freshly applied that we can't touch the

655
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:05.010
plants for a couple of weeks. We can't even, even with protective gear,

656
00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.030
with nitrile gloves, face protection masks, the whole nine long sleeves,

657
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.380
dangerous, that dangerous and no exaggeration. To put it in perspective,

658
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.040
the two officers on the federal level that were exposed just ingested some of

659
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:21.870
those fumes. And you get blindness, you get nausea, you can't breathe.

660
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.330
They were at a circulation, fortunately not fatally,

661
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:28.260
but they're at a circulation for weeks, sometimes months. And um,

662
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.680
federal OSHA came down with the forest service and of course working closely

663
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.670
from the state level,

664
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.710
we suddenly were under a lot of protocol on can decontamination what we couldn't

665
00:36:37.711 --> 00:36:39.120
touch. And you know, new,

666
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.040
new basic tactics for our safety for human safety came down and it changed the

667
00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:46.440
game. So these guys putting this stuff on there,

668
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.310
we may not be able to even touch the plants or even cut them safely or put them

669
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:53.850
in nets and contaminate all our gear until it has a chance to sit, uh,

670
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.950
dissipate a little bit. And that's 14 days.

671
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.010
So what would you guys do if you stumbled upon something and you knew that it

672
00:36:59.011 --> 00:36:59.940
was freshly applied?

673
00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:04.770
Would you just have a bunch of officers standby and guard the area to make sure

674
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.980
that these guys didn't come back to try to reclaim the plants is as best we

675
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:10.590
could because here's the problem with that. You know,

676
00:37:10.591 --> 00:37:13.680
you get a big grow and you know, you can't go in and touch these things for,

677
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.600
you know, a couple of weeks maybe could be,

678
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.280
I mean it could have been applied that day.

679
00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:20.430
It could've been applied four days ago. We hit it, we're not sure.

680
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:23.070
So we'll give it a 14 day window, we'll, we'll keep an eye on it.

681
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.540
But at the same time we're doing all these other missions and we're not getting

682
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:30.360
everything. And in how deep we're talking in.

683
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.440
I mean w we'd guys have to camp there sometimes. Yeah, sometimes.

684
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:37.320
So your guard can hike and yeah, we've, we've set on grows,

685
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.240
we've camped out overnight for several days.

686
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:42.480
We've surveilled drop points and you know, watched, you know,

687
00:37:42.481 --> 00:37:45.420
these guys come and go and try to make sure they don't come back and you have

688
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:47.100
limited resources to begin with. Right.

689
00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:51.090
So you guys are the initial jobs to protect wildlife and you're supposed to be

690
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:51.481
doing that.

691
00:37:51.481 --> 00:37:54.540
So how much of an impact has that had on wildlife because you guys have been

692
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:58.830
diverted to these illegal grow ops. Exactly. Well, you know,

693
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:00.750
you hear the term, the thin green line, right?

694
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.290
And kind of what I'm all about being a game ward and now in phase two in

695
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:04.861
retirement,

696
00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:08.250
I'm really trying to speak more nationally to what the Finn green line is and

697
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.110
it's never been thinner.

698
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.690
And through the thin green line basically just represents, you know,

699
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:15.000
game wardens and forest Rangers, border patrol,

700
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.160
but from the wildlife in the military of course.

701
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.280
But from a wildlife protector standpoint,

702
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.820
now that we have this cartel grow problem and you, you just hit it on the head,

703
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:24.150
brother,

704
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:27.510
look at the resources it takes and all that traditional stuff that we used to do

705
00:38:27.511 --> 00:38:30.480
that we still do. Those problems aren't going away, right?

706
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.750
So we still have to check, you know, the night Hunter,

707
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.070
we still have deal commercial, wildlife sales and all

708
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.130
<v 1>this, the ivory importation issue in the wildlife trafficking.</v>

709
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:40.180
That's just blowing up.

710
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.300
So we're getting thinner and thinner and stretched further and further.

711
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.140
Game warden numbers aren't growing very much anywhere in the country yet.

712
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.830
The population and the impacts of people destroying wildlife,

713
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.390
especially on this cartel front,

714
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.990
<v 2>just keep as acerbate ING, you guys are in charge of ivory</v>

715
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.370
<v 1>[inaudible] as well. We deal with all that. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. We have teams now,</v>

716
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.420
um, in our agency and most of the States do call wildlife trafficking teams.

717
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.320
And it was a good program that came out of the Obama administration that all the

718
00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:11.780
States had to do it. We were kind of already doing it,

719
00:39:11.781 --> 00:39:13.250
but we had to formalize a little bit.

720
00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:16.190
And that was an added challenge that happened right after we formed the whole

721
00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:19.520
cannabis enforcement program, which started with, uh,

722
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.700
with the tactical unit that I, you know, co formed and ran.

723
00:39:22.701 --> 00:39:26.000
And then all these watershed enforcement teams popped up for cannabis regulation

724
00:39:26.001 --> 00:39:27.800
to check the new licensed growers,

725
00:39:27.801 --> 00:39:30.920
people trying to do it legitimately in water use and make sure there weren't,

726
00:39:30.921 --> 00:39:35.360
you know, abuses. Um, then wildlife trafficking became a huge issue, um,

727
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.890
the commercialization of wildlife as a huge billion dollar industry worldwide on

728
00:39:39.891 --> 00:39:43.130
everything from abalone to sturgeon road. Uh, um,

729
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.080
black bear gallbladders and now ivory,

730
00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:48.920
especially the black belt girl gallbladder was so weird and crazy.

731
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:53.970
<v 2>Yeah. It's, it's just, it's like a Chinese medicine thing, right? Yeah, yeah,</v>

732
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.660
yeah. It's an aphrodisiac. Yeah. But it's not, it's, no, it's not real.

733
00:39:57.661 --> 00:40:02.010
But in Alberta, I think it's BC, now, BC, you know, uh,

734
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.120
black bear hunting's legal for food. You know, you can't open up the,

735
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.040
the stomach contents. Right.

736
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:11.100
They don't allow them to gut it because they don't want people to be

737
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:15.210
incentivized to sell gallbladder. Grab that goal. So strange.

738
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.830
So you can eat the bear. Yeah. But you can't even open up the cavity,

739
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:20.880
the body cavity.

740
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.320
So like the heart goes to waste all the other parts that people might eat. Yeah.

741
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.390
Yeah. Which, which we never like to see strange. It is. But again,

742
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:30.840
it gets back

743
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.970
<v 1>to greed and profit and the market. Right.</v>

744
00:40:32.971 --> 00:40:35.390
When a gallbladder can be worth 40,000 or more,

745
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.830
<v 2>well sees. Yeah. 40,000. That's how much,</v>

746
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:41.920
that's how much a gallbladder can be worth for the black market. Right.

747
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:45.430
Is that freaking crazy? Doesn't do anything. That's crazy. It doesn't,

748
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.170
but because it believed that it does.

749
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.590
And it's one of those exotics that I got to have and I can't get Blackberry

750
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:54.920
rhino horn. Exactly right. Like [inaudible]. So we,

751
00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.590
<v 1>I did a lot of that type of work before I went into this, this met focus.</v>

752
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.390
And it just shows you how many challenges game wardens have to do and it's not,

753
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.520
you know, the old traditional game or, and just out checking those

754
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.880
<v 2>since there's anymore, I mean over text we're overwhelmed. Yeah.</v>

755
00:41:08.881 --> 00:41:10.320
That's no exaggeration. Now,

756
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.860
because this is now a problem that people are aware of.

757
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.370
There have been significant resources that have been allocated to try to handle

758
00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:17.851
this stuff.

759
00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:22.851
Like cause are there new programs to train these young officers coming up?

760
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.870
Is there like a specific task force that handles that and then the rest of the

761
00:41:27.871 --> 00:41:29.910
guys handle fish and wildlife?

762
00:41:29.911 --> 00:41:33.650
Or is it just same people but now you have a whole different level of

763
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.543
responsibility?

764
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.030
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

765
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.080
that it's really cool in California because we are one of the most progressive,

766
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.690
you know, game worn agencies. Um,

767
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.200
and it's interesting because I just spoke at the, uh, back in July,

768
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:46.580
I spoke at the new Ouija conference,

769
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:50.450
which is basically the annual game wardens conference for all of us from all

770
00:41:50.451 --> 00:41:53.360
over the country. So get to work with all the States and you know,

771
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:56.390
Florida has so tactical unit for some stuff. Texas has it.

772
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.090
And we're the first state to have a dedicated, you know,

773
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.220
kind of tactical unit for this, this cartel growth threat because it's,

774
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.880
it's so big in California. Um,

775
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.650
but to share that with everybody nationally in my world, in the fingering line,

776
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.440
and for them to start having it happening on the refuges.

777
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.090
And even just to know this stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and

778
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:18.950
poisoning their, their cannabis users, you know,

779
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:22.010
unsuspectingly horrible information, right?

780
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.170
But we need to know it and a lot of guys didn't know it.

781
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.440
And so that was one thing to see, Hey, we need to have a baseline training.

782
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.310
And the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really stringent

783
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:34.310
Academy. Everyone gets their basic tools, arrest, control,

784
00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:35.930
and defensive tactics.

785
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.080
She owned firearms training and all of that and get good at being the

786
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:42.020
traditional game warden and doing all the traditional stuff and they get,

787
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.610
you know, get their feet wet out, doing their own thing for a couple of years.

788
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.450
And then we start to find the people that have the motivation or want to get

789
00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:54.910
onto a specialized unit like our met team or one of the watershed teams or the

790
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.090
wildlife trafficking team.

791
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.690
Very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know,

792
00:42:59.691 --> 00:43:01.940
I think to really be a good game warden,

793
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.190
you got to cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff.

794
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.280
That's critical of just how I end up having to check guys with guns all the

795
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:11.180
time. You know, most cops look at that and go, that's crazy.

796
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.970
I mean everybody you check has a knife or a firearm. Yeah,

797
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.410
well fortunately 99% of them are guys like you and me that want to see a game

798
00:43:18.411 --> 00:43:19.880
warden and game warn wants to see us.

799
00:43:19.881 --> 00:43:23.570
But for that one felon that's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out.

800
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.310
And we run across that a lot. And I,

801
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.700
I ran across a ton of that down here and Soquel railing at the start of my

802
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:31.250
career and I've got some interesting stories about that. But,

803
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:36.050
so guys who are like the skip bail and then they go and hide and they've got

804
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:39.050
like a no bail warrant, their wanted on some warrant somewhere.

805
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.660
And so they're off fishing and they have an illegal firearm.

806
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.330
Maybe they're a felon in possession of a firearm they can't even have.

807
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.900
And now they're out in remote area where no cops gonna find me here.

808
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.660
And then I'm the new game warden in Riverside County, you know,

809
00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:54.890
all fricking motivated, really green. I don't know totally what I'm doing yet.

810
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.460
Right.

811
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.700
And I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just

812
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:02.230
crazy. But I will say this, it was a heck of a learning curve and I'm,

813
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:04.940
I'm really blessed to went out the way it did. And it was, I was safe in it,

814
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:05.990
but, um,

815
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.820
we would get gang bangers from LA here and they would go over into Riverside

816
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.680
County and get into my kind of rural, you know,

817
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.790
foothills and on the edge of the national forest and they'd have a K 40 sevens

818
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:18.230
and they'd have, you know,

819
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.100
automatic pistols and they would spotlight through these canyons,

820
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.030
gun and for everything. They kill rabbits and kill coyotes. They kill deer.

821
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.290
They get to the end of like a Canyon that has like a, an outlet of a damn,

822
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.030
throw a net out and spend all night there.

823
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:36.360
Just gillnet and fish and hunting freely and shooting and killing everything

824
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:39.810
with their spotlights. Grabbed their gilnet, grab hundreds of fish,

825
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:44.340
pack up and then head back, you know, back to the LA basin gang bangers.

826
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.390
I'm not kidding. And the craziest part. Gang bangers. Yeah, commercial.

827
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.390
Almost commercial fishing does. It does, it sounds nuts. Right, right.

828
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:53.400
And what would they do with the fish? Oh, they'd eat them.

829
00:44:53.401 --> 00:44:54.990
Maybe they'd sell them, you know, who knows?

830
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:57.180
Usually with quantities that big they were getting sold.

831
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.560
But the thing that was crazy as I would be, you know, alone, I'd be in my truck.

832
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:04.620
I didn't have a canine yet, you know, and now I just, uh,

833
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:08.550
I just retired with like your Marshall. I have Apollo yellow lab, English lab.

834
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:10.800
She's amazing. Never going to bite a bad guy,

835
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:14.160
but she's gonna lick them to death and try to, to try to, you know, uh,

836
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.870
turn them away. Um,

837
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.900
but I didn't even have a companion dog at the time and I would go and run into

838
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:21.660
these guys and go, okay, this is what I learned in the Academy that you know,

839
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:23.640
that, that head on spotlighting stop,

840
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:26.730
that you never want to have her getting behind and blacked out and tracking him

841
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:29.160
down. Um, and next thing I know,

842
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:33.300
I got a case and I got all these freaking prohibited exotic weapons and I'm

843
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:35.910
going, this is crazy. I'm pulling these guys out alone.

844
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.570
I don't have a lot of baskets. It was just me. How many guys did you run into?

845
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.800
Sometimes it'd be two. One night I pulled like eight people out of a man.

846
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.350
Oh shit. And I was alone. Oh shit.

847
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:50.430
And they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest, most intense cases.

848
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:52.260
And I had been on one year,

849
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.520
so this was 1994 and what we were doing in the Riverside squad is we were just

850
00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:59.700
saturating the area cause we were getting everybody from over on the LA side

851
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:02.850
here, spotlight and all our games. So we're like, okay, let's saturate this.

852
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:04.890
And back then Joe,

853
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:08.710
the game was to catch a spotlight or red handed cause there's so deliberate.

854
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.240
Explain spotlight. Oh yeah, yeah I should've, I should've done that.

855
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.910
But spotlighting is where you use a, an artificial light,

856
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:17.280
whether it's a handheld spotlight, a flashlight, whatever.

857
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.880
And you go into remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they

858
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:22.650
freeze, they're really relaxed,

859
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:25.050
their eyes glow and then you shoot them that way.

860
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.250
You kill him illegally at night after dark, which has never allowed, you know,

861
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.160
it's usually inner out of hunting season cause anyone's gonna spotlight a deer.

862
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.360
Nine times out of 10, they're,

863
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:37.830
they're not licensed or they're not gonna do it during season like we do. Um,

864
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:41.310
so they're doing that. So in the, in our world as game wardens,

865
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.240
that's the ultimate wildlife criminal because they're gonna kill dos, you know,

866
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.390
that, that have that unborn trophy buck for good genetics.

867
00:46:48.391 --> 00:46:51.630
They're going to kill a trophy deer way in the raw, you know, that, you know,

868
00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:54.840
needs to go another year or whatever. Um, so that's what we focused on.

869
00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:57.320
That was like, if I can cut my teeth and get, you know, become a,

870
00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.960
a reputable game or, and going after the hardcores, that was the game then.

871
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.840
So it was 94 and I'm pulling these guys out and calling him out on loudspeaker,

872
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.910
have got my weapon on him and I'm like, Oh man, there's a lot of guys out there.

873
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.630
I can't get them to jail. I'm calling back up. I got Riverside County coming in.

874
00:47:12.631 --> 00:47:13.650
I mean we even have the, the,

875
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.840
the Sheriff's office helicopter come in several nights.

876
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.350
Once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game worn and what

877
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:22.590
are these game warns Riverside County going out into just crazy areas by

878
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:23.424
themselves.

879
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.760
They'd monitor our traffic and they'd come in on the helicopter and light it up

880
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:27.460
and call them, you know,

881
00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.610
call these bad guys out on loudspeakers just to make sure we were okay and it

882
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.190
feels good when the Calvary comes on those nights. Man, let me tell ya.

883
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.750
So crazy sort of situations they just didn't know that you would ever run into

884
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:42.310
someone that's that arm that many guys in the van or what have you.

885
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.270
Eight people. Right. So they're,

886
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.840
the reason why you're patrolling by yourself was because they didn't anticipate

887
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.300
anything like this. Well and we didn't have the bodies, right.

888
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.980
This was one of the things that was crazy.

889
00:47:50.981 --> 00:47:54.580
We get back to the thin green line concept and realize that one game warden is

890
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:59.110
responsible for 200 to 250 square miles.

891
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.460
Give or take. Whoa.

892
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.950
And you know how big Riverside County is on the inland empire,

893
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:05.530
hundred square miles, maybe more, you know,

894
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:08.230
depending on what part of this dangerous one game warden.

895
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.640
So a squad of seven game wardens to put in perspective, check this out brother.

896
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:16.570
So when I was supervising traditional patrol before we started the special ops

897
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:18.730
met team in Santa Clara County,

898
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.150
we always have vacancies because we always low on bodies.

899
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:24.220
We couldn't hire game warns fast enough.

900
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:25.900
We weren't funded for to where the case may be.

901
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:29.770
So we might have four or five game wardens for seven positions and we had to

902
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:31.360
cover all the Santa Clara County,

903
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.910
which is everything from the city to all those foothills.

904
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:35.680
And there's a lot of it in Silicon Valley.

905
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:40.210
People don't realize all of San Benito County, which is huge.

906
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.340
Hollister Gilroy, right where I'm from in Gilroy,

907
00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:43.720
that whole area down to the South,

908
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:47.380
that is just massive mountain country full of wildlife. Um,

909
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:50.620
and then like part of Monterey County and I had five people in myself as a

910
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:53.080
Lieutenant. God is insane. I can't believe that.

911
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:56.470
So to go out on a spotlighting patrol to that point, um,

912
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.340
and have a partner with you, just one other game warden. That's tough. You know,

913
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:03.820
you're basically pulling a whole nother area you can't work night on or so is

914
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:05.520
spotlighting that common it,

915
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.120
it is still going on in the state and it's going on a lot. Um,

916
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.500
back then here,

917
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.220
because there had been so little presence here in Southern California,

918
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.460
it was off the hook. It was crazy.

919
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.710
One week in 1994 I remember I was a,

920
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:25.030
I had a really good ride along with me,

921
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:28.000
a wildlife biologist that just as savvy Hunter, great eyes.

922
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.980
He became kind of like my right hand man, Brian. Um, and we, I said,

923
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:35.770
we're gonna catch a spotlight or every night this week. He goes, you think so?

924
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.870
I go, what's that crazy, let's see if we can do it.

925
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:42.010
And so we went and worked all night long. We started on Monday night.

926
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.170
How do you catch them? Do you look for a spotlight?

927
00:49:44.171 --> 00:49:47.120
Like would you get to a vantage point in glass? It's, yeah,

928
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.270
it's just like class in a big basin for elk, right?

929
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.660
You get in a really good Overwatch. So you get the most visibility, you know,

930
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:54.110
hide the truck and um,

931
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.540
you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen and it takes a while to

932
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.960
learn where that's going to be just because you got this huge district and you

933
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:04.150
could have 20 places where guys spotlight.

934
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.540
But until you get into the areas of new warden and really get to figure it all

935
00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:10.840
out, you don't know where to be. And it's a trial and error. But you know,

936
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.890
you took me six months give or take or just just going out there and scout hard

937
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.680
and, and I've seen where this road goes and how does that Canyon look?

938
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.330
What type of water do I have down there?

939
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:22.180
What am I seeing at low light in the evening when animals are coming to water?

940
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.150
Ooh, I got a whole herd of elk here. I've got a whole herd of deer.

941
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.400
I got some bucks, you know, I'm seeing other animals run around.

942
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:31.010
This is going to be a hotspot because guys can get to it.

943
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.370
And if you just put the time in, you just kind of lie and wait, you know,

944
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:38.300
kind of put your little hide together. Um, just like hunting a big game.

945
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.100
Eventually it starts happening.

946
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.310
And by 1994 and I've been in district a year down here,

947
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.350
I pretty much had my spots figured out.

948
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.420
My partners and other parts of Riverside did too.

949
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:51.710
So we'd all be out alone so we could cover more area and talking back and forth.

950
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:54.350
I mean, and I'm gonna date myself here, but cell phones are brand new,

951
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.750
so we all had those flip cell phones and we Holy you. Uh,

952
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.210
I'm going to be 51 in November. I'm 52 so we are about it. Yeah.

953
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.060
So we're right there, you know, all that era. So when I started,

954
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.910
I mean it was the flip phone. Yeah, let's start drawing,

955
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:09.560
communicate or call my partner Jerry. Love those. Where are you at?

956
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.210
They're great. And I'm like, where are you at? He goes,

957
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:13.460
I'm over here in Thomas mountain. Like I'm over here. You see anything yet?

958
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:17.090
I go, I got one light working our, I got to go and then I'll go home.

959
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.540
But that's crazy. Like you're talking about enormous pieces of land. Oh,

960
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:23.120
it's you guys responsible for, yeah. I mean for,

961
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:26.150
it's hard for people to put into perspective that don't spend any time in the

962
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:26.984
woods, right.

963
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:31.880
That you would be able to even find these folks in this enormous area. Yeah,

964
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.260
yeah. It's starts off as a needle in haystack type thing, you know?

965
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.050
But once you get into it, you get fairly good at it.

966
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:41.180
But it always is difficult because again,

967
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.870
just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's going to be

968
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:45.704
out there.

969
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:49.910
And then you got the guys to kind of get savvy to known with game worn lives,

970
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.320
driving by his house,

971
00:51:51.321 --> 00:51:53.750
looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night,

972
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:56.090
where's the truck parked? We start getting into that problem.

973
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.860
So we always kinda, you know, kind of maintain as covert as we can. You know,

974
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:03.500
we're known in the neighborhood and the thing is we live at home,

975
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.210
we work out of our homes, home office.

976
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.600
We're close to our community because if we kept our truck at a field office,

977
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:13.490
we have no response time all spread out. So we get very community oriented in,

978
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:17.270
in community functions, in conservation groups and everybody knows us,

979
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.820
whether it's a big city or a small little town in the mountains.

980
00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:23.600
So you got guys doing the cat and mouse thing looking for us and you know,

981
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:26.150
making sure, Hey, is this truck there or is he out patrolling? Well,

982
00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:30.800
maybe I won't go out tonight. Um, but, but that, that era Joe in, in 1994 was,

983
00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:33.350
was off the hook. I, I didn't get a spotlight or every night that week,

984
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:37.170
but I got six out of seven and one night I had a double. So it was crazy. Wow.

985
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.400
And seasoned a ton of guns and you know, some guys were going to jail,

986
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:41.690
some weren't. Um,

987
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.450
but a lot of wildlife was say that night because they would've, they would've,

988
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.370
would've done a lot of harm. You know, most of these guys,

989
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:49.580
are they doing this recreationally for fun or they're doing it for food?

990
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:52.880
Like what are they, the, the group I was getting into down here, it was,

991
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.190
it was recreational. It might've been to sell the meat.

992
00:52:55.191 --> 00:52:58.520
I couldn't prove that or it was just to go kill stuff. Um,

993
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.950
you do get people that need me, you know,

994
00:53:00.951 --> 00:53:04.760
that do spotlight after dark because they need the meat and stuff like that.

995
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:07.910
And it's still a violation. We still deal with it as such.

996
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:11.720
But if we ascertain that we're going to be fair about it, you know, we said,

997
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:14.780
okay, look, you're poaching. I know you're starving. It's out of season.

998
00:53:14.781 --> 00:53:18.050
It's in season. You have a tag, but you just really gotta get that meat. I mean,

999
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:20.650
there are certain cases where you just kind of feel for that person and go, Oh,

1000
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:23.330
I see where the motivation was. You know,

1001
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.480
and a very small percentage of poachers are that way, but some of them are just,

1002
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.410
you know, they're just trying to feed their family and their,

1003
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.220
it's a whole different game and we're going,

1004
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:34.050
we're going to be fair about it or we should be fair.

1005
00:53:34.051 --> 00:53:37.870
But most of them gang bangers or most of them criminals. Like what is it?

1006
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:42.840
Was there a down here, Ridge down here, 70, 80%. Yeah.

1007
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:46.290
Had criminal histories, had illegal weapons associated with gangs.

1008
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.030
So it was almost like recreation for that. It almost was what practice. Yeah.

1009
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.500
Yeah. And I remember one case down here that was a pretty crazy one. It was,

1010
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:59.240
it was three guys pretty inebriated, pretty liquored up. And um,

1011
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.230
it was a head on stop and one of them had a, uh,

1012
00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:06.150
like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking out of Mexico.

1013
00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.640
And that was in that week that we had, you know,

1014
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:10.260
crazy spotlight and things going on.

1015
00:54:10.261 --> 00:54:14.900
So it was just the demographic of down here where up North that it wouldn't,

1016
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.440
it wouldn't be necessarily a felon,

1017
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:19.290
but that guy that just wanted that trophy buck and to get it cheat to get it,

1018
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:23.340
you know, if I could give you a magic wand, okay. And you could like,

1019
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:26.970
I could say, John, it's up to you fix all this. How do you do it?

1020
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.680
You have unlimited resources, man. That's a great question. And all I'll do,

1021
00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:34.170
go into the bottle. The genie right here, one,

1022
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:37.830
we put more game in the field because we do need more and we pay them better.

1023
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.330
And here's the rub,

1024
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.680
because there's this perception that game wardens just check fishing licenses or

1025
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:45.210
they might not be real cops.

1026
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:51.020
We're paid about 40% less than a County sheriff than a highway patrolman rather

1027
00:54:51.211 --> 00:54:52.530
than a city police guy. Right.

1028
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.590
And because of you think it's because of perception,

1029
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.830
a perception of public lack of knowledge perhaps.

1030
00:54:58.831 --> 00:55:01.750
Now that has started as far as funds get allocated, they say, well gee,

1031
00:55:01.751 --> 00:55:04.290
I can't Morton's right. This is the going rate. You know,

1032
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:07.890
this is what we've always paid. You know, the raises are 80%. Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:12.100
That's, we're in a car. We're in a constant constant salary equity fi. Um,

1034
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.210
we've been, we've been, you know, really pushing that for, you know,

1035
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:17.880
15 years plus or minus. Um,

1036
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.630
something that really started to legitimize us. And um,

1037
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.420
in 2010 when my first book came out, war in the woods,

1038
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.140
that's when the wild justice game worn reality show.

1039
00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:32.070
National geographic channel aired for the first time and that was our agency and

1040
00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:35.130
that was the first of what are now a lot of game warden shows.

1041
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:38.630
And the more the merrier because it's Christine, that one. Yeah. Yeah, it was,

1042
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:41.310
it's good. Yeah, it was a, it was, it was us, you know,

1043
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:46.311
so I'm partially mostly busting people for wildlife or is it gets to the

1044
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:49.830
marijuana stuff too. Do you actually get in the marijuana stuff? Something,

1045
00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.560
the wild justice film crews really resonated with.

1046
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:55.410
And a lot of the guys that are on the team now, myself included,

1047
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:59.160
ended up being featured like their main people for the better part of like three

1048
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:02.460
seasons because we weren't just bringing them the poaching cases,

1049
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:05.220
the traditional stuff which needed to get shown even.

1050
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:06.720
And we didn't have our formalized team yet,

1051
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:08.400
but I was in bed with Santa Clara County.

1052
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.500
Brian and canine Phoebe were up in Shasta,

1053
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:13.080
but we were getting brought together for the show and he was starting to work

1054
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:17.010
down with me in the Bay area and bring in that wonder dog Phoebe into the mix

1055
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:20.820
that he had honed, you know, for years. Um,

1056
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.040
and we started to show this cartel marijuana stuff through the show and

1057
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.020
<v 0>that's what got the ratings. That's what, you know,</v>

1058
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:29.290
that was worldwide broadcast and number one hit on Nat geo for three years.

1059
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.290
And that opened the door. You know, we needed that exposure.

1060
00:56:32.291 --> 00:56:36.880
And it's the same thing with like writing these books and doing the TV I do.

1061
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:41.710
It's a fine line between risk and some exposure or getting the message out.

1062
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.290
And like I said, we're so thin on the thin green line.

1063
00:56:44.291 --> 00:56:46.720
We need all the exposure we can get. We're a little agency,

1064
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.920
our funding's limited,

1065
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:50.770
but we're doing a multitude of jobs even outside of the marijuana stuff.

1066
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:55.210
So that started to help and now we're starting to get the recognition of the

1067
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:57.250
professionalism and the capabilities we have,

1068
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:59.460
especially with this tactical unit, um,

1069
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.870
to hopefully help with things like salary and numbers.

1070
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.600
And the magic wand brother is numbers, numbers,

1071
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.530
numbers that are officers and they're paid well enough to live in the Silicon

1072
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.470
Valley to live here in LA. That's hilarious. Right?

1073
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.310
No one's paid well enough to live in. I mean, millions are moving out. Yeah.

1074
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:13.991
And that's where,

1075
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:16.660
that's where I grew up and if I wasn't embedded there is family member I

1076
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:19.150
couldn't have afforded to stay. And I had great,

1077
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:23.410
great wardens come in and do fantastic work that didn't want to leave Silicon

1078
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.760
Valley, but they're like, I can't buy a house here.

1079
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.180
I got to go to Butte County or I've got to go Shasta County, I gotta get my,

1080
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.820
I gotta get in the woods a little bit, drive an hour to work, you know.

1081
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.870
So if it,

1082
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.180
has there been discussion like has anybody brought this out?

1083
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.510
A Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when there was

1084
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:44.950
talking about federally legalizing marijuana that it's not just about saying

1085
00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:46.610
it's okay for kids, right?

1086
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.290
It's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartels.

1087
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.900
Cause when there is uh,

1088
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:56.170
an illegal opportunity to sell something that there's a demand for,

1089
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.870
then the criminals are going to sell it. Exactly. That's what you have now.

1090
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:02.650
Exactly. And has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up?

1091
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:06.880
Like this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal

1092
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:12.070
with California having it state legal that there is this massive confusion then

1093
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.000
this, you know,

1094
00:58:13.001 --> 00:58:17.440
diminishing of penalties in California with growing illegally.

1095
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.420
There totally is. And you know,

1096
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.300
you've got the opposite ends of the spectrum and here's what we're learning with

1097
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:24.400
regulation. And I've always said this, I said, look,

1098
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.720
if we're going to regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market,

1099
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:33.980
let's do it smart. You know, let's for one, everything we,

1100
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
we really tried to push here in California was regulate legitimate cannabis the

1101
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:43.990
correct way. Keep people safe, test it, test it, make sure those pesticides,

1102
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.540
the cartel pesticides are absolutely man in.

1103
00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:49.090
As long as people aren't hurting themselves or other people,

1104
00:58:49.091 --> 00:58:53.050
they're not destroying waterways. We're not getting in gunfights over it. Great.

1105
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.690
You know, no problem. But for like the, you know,

1106
00:58:55.691 --> 00:58:57.670
the outdoor trespassing with these cartels,

1107
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.600
let's take that funding and put more effort into stopping that, you know,

1108
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:04.750
let's not water it down to misdemeanors and infractions and do things like that.

1109
00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:09.190
And, and you know, it's, and even we can even take cannabis out of the equation.

1110
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:10.510
Joe from the standpoint of,

1111
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.440
I remember a few years ago I was quoted by the associated press of saying if

1112
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:19.441
cherry tomatoes were so desired on the black market and were illegal and people

1113
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:22.130
were paying $4,000 a pound for cherry tomatoes,

1114
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 1>we'd be having gun fights over cherry tomatoes and having banned poisons on</v>

1115
00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:28.190
cherry tomatoes that are kids would be eating in their salads. You know,

1116
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:31.070
because of the black market. So you can take, you know,

1117
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.850
cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental impacts and look

1118
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:35.661
at the public safety.

1119
00:59:35.661 --> 00:59:39.020
But we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the bar,

1120
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:43.490
across the board. And we have to break the black market. But what I've seen,

1121
00:59:43.491 --> 00:59:45.260
and I go into the last chapter of my new book,

1122
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:48.650
hidden works sensibly on this is what are the challenges moving forward after

1123
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:52.670
seeing regulation in play for two years, boots on the ground,

1124
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:55.970
watching it and having a great relationship with legit will live legitimate

1125
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:56.840
cannabis growers.

1126
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:01.580
And I'll tell you a few stories that really opened my eyes and got us unified,

1127
01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:04.790
right? Cause the whole thing is we need to be unified on this, on this concept,

1128
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.820
not polarize, left or right, anti cannabis, pro cannabis,

1129
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:12.740
let's get unified environmental safety, public safety, all of it. Um,

1130
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:18.430
but because of how we regulated and the licensing fees and the protocol and

1131
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.560
everything else, we've had all of these, you know,

1132
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:26.450
black market growers in the two 15 days that wanted to get legal and saw

1133
01:00:26.451 --> 01:00:29.990
everything coming in the cost to do it and being on big brother's radar or law

1134
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:33.290
enforcement's radar. And they backed out. Like in Humboldt County,

1135
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:34.124
we had it like,

1136
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.600
I want to stay in the better part of 10 to 50,000 growers ready to regulate.

1137
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.750
And we barely got a thousand, you know, and they went, you know,

1138
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.420
I can't afford to go through this permitting process. I can't afford the delays,

1139
01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:47.270
so I'm just going to go back on the black market.

1140
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.890
I'm not going to be on the radar. Wow.

1141
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.330
And that has to stop if we're gonna regulate right now. Um, the thing that was,

1142
01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:56.720
was really interesting and, uh, I, I never saw this common, but when,

1143
01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.890
when we were about to roll out prop 64 and you know, it had been voted, uh,

1144
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.560
for recreational and the medical laws were tightening up.

1145
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.640
I was the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to,

1146
01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.020
uh, to go into these a California grower association hosted grower meetings.

1147
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.500
And my first one was in Santa Cruz, right over the Hill from my place. Right.

1148
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.640
And I mean, I'm in the, you know, I'm in the BD use the cammo bottoms, the polo.

1149
01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:21.830
I'm going into my yard, my training attire for met,

1150
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.630
and the look on 500 growers' faces when I walked in to that meeting, just like,

1151
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:30.140
what's he doing here? Conflict of interest. He's working us,

1152
01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.570
he's a guy's watching our license plates. And I'm just like, guys,

1153
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:35.150
everybody brief. I'm going to tell you a story.

1154
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.030
I'm going to show you a PowerPoint. It's going to be graphic.

1155
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.230
I'm not here to work anybody. You know, I'm here to unify.

1156
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.540
Just hear what I have to say, no judgment.

1157
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.830
And so I was all these guys aware of how big the situation was before you show

1158
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:51.350
them. I would have thought so because they're in the industry,

1159
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:54.830
they know we'd better than just about anybody. I would cry all the time.

1160
01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:56.750
They're not seeing the cartel.

1161
01:01:56.751 --> 01:02:00.230
It's just a little [inaudible] that I paid attention. They just grown pot. Yeah.

1162
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:02.690
That's all. I didn't see that guy. Was that kind of true camera.

1163
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:06.160
What's it got a backpack leg through the panels. A pipe. Yeah. But anyway,

1164
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.220
I did explain that.

1165
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:12.310
I mean these guys literally would VAK in hundreds and hundreds of yards of pipe

1166
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:17.510
and have two being like for hoses on their back. Other tough. Yeah,

1167
01:02:17.511 --> 01:02:20.190
I've got, I've got photos in the new book on trail cam

1168
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:24.420
<v 0>with Phil on their feet covering their tracks with these seabags a a hundred</v>

1169
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.260
plus pounds and a spool of pipe going up, man.

1170
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.090
Like don't know how hard that is to do. I mean these guys just took a legit job.

1171
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.600
Yeah. They'd be like the best employees you'd ever had. They would. They would,

1172
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:35.790
man. They're a, they're tough. And they're, I mean,

1173
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.340
to look at the environment they live in for six months, man. Yeah,

1174
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.600
they're all outdoors. But I was at this meeting and, uh,

1175
01:02:41.601 --> 01:02:43.770
I gave the presentation, I talked about it,

1176
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.450
and it was crazy to see the look of shock on these, um,

1177
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.270
these grower groups faces. I mean, some women were in tears. Um,

1178
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:54.150
some of the guys were just like pissed off and pumping their fists and they're

1179
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:57.360
like, that's bullshit. We are not about that.

1180
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:00.660
We're not about doing anything bad with our water. We like our wildlife.

1181
01:03:00.661 --> 01:03:04.170
We just want to grow cannabis. We want to be regulated, you know,

1182
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.550
and it was such a turnaround, you know,

1183
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.700
from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and the cannabis

1184
01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:13.040
world. Um, and to see,

1185
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:18.140
to be the one guy there with all of the growing community there and then go from

1186
01:03:18.991 --> 01:03:22.260
complete horror that I was there as an adversary or judgement or anything of

1187
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.310
that or you know, to,

1188
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:27.390
to do anything negative from an enforcement standpoint to suddenly have real

1189
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:31.740
talks of what was going out. And, and I could kind of see the authenticity,

1190
01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:36.210
the genuineness on some of their faces, the way they reacted to my slides,

1191
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:39.840
to the videos. And so, um, when I left that first meeting,

1192
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:43.320
I remember I just got flooded and my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me,

1193
01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:45.870
my little lab, and she's an icebreaker. I thought, well,

1194
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.510
it could be an interesting meeting. I should have the dog for pets, you know,

1195
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.070
and she jumped in and I,

1196
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.220
all these growers are coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and one,

1197
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.030
wow, this is weird. And it was all these, you know, farmer supervisors, um,

1198
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.420
from all over the state, you know, Mendocino County up in the Emerald triangle,

1199
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:02.550
Santa Cruz. And they're just giving me their cards and go, Hey Lieutenant,

1200
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.100
I have workers, I have resources, we will hike in and clean up a grow with you,

1201
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.310
let us help the met team, let us help the cannabis program,

1202
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:15.750
whatever we can do and no charge. And, and that was genuine man.

1203
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.510
I was really, really taken back by that in a positive way.

1204
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:23.010
And I realized if we get the legitimate farmers on our side and they're aware of

1205
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:26.970
this, they will help market that message. They have money and they have money.

1206
01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.520
Yeah. The legitimate farmers are making a lot of money.

1207
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:33.000
That would be a great way for, you know, we, we, I mean tax wise,

1208
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.300
I mean there's extremely high taxes on cannabis as it is. Right.

1209
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:40.690
But if we could allocate that taxes absolutely to you guys. Yeah.

1210
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.710
That would be incredible. Yeah. Where's the money going?

1211
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.820
Let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens.

1212
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.260
That's starting to happen too because what's now that we've had a couple of

1213
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.860
years and we're seeing some of the regulatory funding and the tax trickle back.

1214
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.710
Um, I'm in contact with my team all the time.

1215
01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:02.400
I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really

1216
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.740
give him a shout out for all the amazing, you know,

1217
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.070
risks they're taken in the work they're doing and,

1218
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.900
and promote their message with throughout their doing. But, um,

1219
01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:12.990
the money's starting to come back to us now. So we're starting to get equipment.

1220
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:15.780
We're starting to get more bodies. We're starting to get like over time funding.

1221
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:18.040
So the ridiculous long are small

1222
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.910
<v 2>team works. They're compensated for that just just happened literally, you know,</v>

1223
01:05:21.911 --> 01:05:24.160
within a month or two of, of being on the show with you.

1224
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:28.360
So we're seeing some positives from that. Those rates raised. We're trying.

1225
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:32.500
Yeah, I mean we're trying alert the press. 40% is discussed this up.

1226
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.830
This coffee's awesome. Bam. Good. We'll shout out Laird Hamilton, Hamilton man,

1227
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.800
I'm not even a coffee drinker and I'm loving this. It's great stuff.

1228
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.320
And convert now makes your mouth smack though. Gives you a little,

1229
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:45.100
it does a little. Yeah, you gotta like clear your throat a lot.

1230
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.190
Coconut oil and turmeric and all that jazz. I'm healthy.

1231
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:53.920
Colorado was the first state to legalize it and Washington state did.

1232
01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:58.570
They have similar problems. They still have a black market, you know,

1233
01:05:58.571 --> 01:05:59.620
and the thing right now,

1234
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:02.500
because we're not regulating federally and so every state,

1235
01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:06.700
anything that's grown stays in that state per LA. Right. But every,

1236
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.150
all the demand is back East in these non-regulated States where they don't grow

1237
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:12.460
it. So Colorado has a, you know,

1238
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:15.650
an interstate black market that's done by the, you know,

1239
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:18.680
quasi legitimate growers as well as the cartel element.

1240
01:06:18.681 --> 01:06:22.720
So there's still that black market thriving within, you know,

1241
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.920
the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands. We've,

1242
01:06:25.921 --> 01:06:27.550
we've got different mixes and we'd be okay.

1243
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.340
It's a different kind of a problem in Colorado.

1244
01:06:30.341 --> 01:06:33.610
So they don't have as many Carto grows. Not as many. They have some,

1245
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:34.870
they have some, I've, I've,

1246
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.200
I've talked to those guys and worked with them a little bit and they do have

1247
01:06:38.201 --> 01:06:41.050
some, but again, they're kinda like more, I'm at Montana now,

1248
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.030
tight little growing window, you know, early winters, late thaws.

1249
01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.040
So they don't have a very big growing season outdoors.

1250
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.550
The conditions aren't prime like they are here in Kelly. This is a,

1251
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:56.080
this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed and it's one of the reasons

1252
01:06:56.081 --> 01:07:00.550
why I was so fascinated by that podcast is that, and this is a one more,

1253
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.350
one more piece of the puzzle when you're talking about border control, right?

1254
01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.630
That somehow or another, we've gotten into this,

1255
01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.330
this state and our country, this,

1256
01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:13.840
this place in our country where some people want to control the border and some

1257
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:15.490
people don't want any borders, right?

1258
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:20.590
And you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border.

1259
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.070
The number one problem with the borders, cartel violence, cartel violence,

1260
01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:26.230
cartel crime. That's the number one problem.

1261
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:31.120
And the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal

1262
01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:33.760
activity or doing it because it's profitable, right?

1263
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:36.550
The reason why it's profitable is because it's illegal.

1264
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.590
And so they can do these things and sell marijuana all over this country

1265
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:45.730
illegally because it's illegal. And if it was legal,

1266
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:47.980
we could regulate it. We could tax it,

1267
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.670
the money could go into schools and pay for guys like you and,

1268
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:53.860
and go to fixing this problem.

1269
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.310
And instead we're playing this little stupid game where, you know,

1270
01:07:57.311 --> 01:08:00.880
some States are legal and some States aren't. And you know, let's, let's,

1271
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.920
you know, and it's federally,

1272
01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:07.921
it's still a schedule one crime when there's millions of legitimate law abiding

1273
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:12.810
tax paying citizens that enjoy it. And it's crazy. It is. And,

1274
01:08:12.811 --> 01:08:16.070
and to that point, you know, you, you look at, um, you know,

1275
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.640
<v 0>the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulations. Some States,</v>

1276
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:23.540
some not federally, not. Um, but when you get to the border issue,

1277
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:27.680
you brought up that good point of it's not just that cartel element for this

1278
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:27.890
camp,

1279
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:31.310
this poison cannabis stuff or this toxically tainted cannabis is a better way to

1280
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:35.030
phrase it. Um, it's the smuggling, you know, the human trafficking,

1281
01:08:35.031 --> 01:08:38.660
it's all those other crimes, that methamphetamine production. So I'm not, uh,

1282
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:41.000
you know, I get asked a lot like, after, you know,

1283
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.780
you had a great conversation with, uh, with, with Mike Baker on this was,

1284
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.250
you know, our open borders going to work and no,

1285
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.310
we've got to have some regulation.

1286
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:52.160
It's just not gonna work because the world's not even,

1287
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.580
so that's why open borders aren't gonna work. Right. If the world was even,

1288
01:08:55.581 --> 01:08:56.460
and there was, you know, I mean,

1289
01:08:56.470 --> 01:09:01.470
there's like extreme crime rates at costs and you know,

1290
01:09:01.911 --> 01:09:04.940
I had ed called her on, on who works for Mexico.

1291
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:08.200
We just started dialogue and last week I liked that guy. Good guy. Yeah.

1292
01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:10.160
Boy does he scared the shit out of you though?

1293
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:14.360
When he tells me the stories about Mexico, about how bad it is down there. Yeah.

1294
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.220
And uh, there's,

1295
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.010
there's just an insane amount of violence that's going on down there and an

1296
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.190
insane amount of crime.

1297
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:26.510
And so much of it is connected to the illegal drug trade. Yeah.

1298
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:30.440
And look, you're not going to kill it all if you make marijuana illegal,

1299
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:33.860
but you would kill a percentage. At least it would make it a little bit better.

1300
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.850
And you would stop that. Yeah. And one of the things we do, we get from,

1301
01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:42.200
from getting that regulation, if we can stop that black market for,

1302
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.800
you know, cartel weed, we're gonna save a lot of wildlife. Yes.

1303
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.750
We're going to preserve a lot of waterways, right.

1304
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.330
Because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive.

1305
01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:53.930
And I hate to see the human trafficking and all the math problems and anything

1306
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:57.800
that relates to violence or a deterioration of a soul. But you know,

1307
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:01.070
I love the wild man. Woods are matured. Yours too. I mean,

1308
01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.420
what you do for conservation,

1309
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:04.580
the elk hunting that you're doing and all those different things. I mean,

1310
01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:06.740
it's just, it's magical out there and it's just,

1311
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.320
most people just don't even know, I don't think. No, but I mean,

1312
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:13.490
don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually be real woods in the

1313
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:14.440
real woods, which are,

1314
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.260
which are getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller, even here in Cali,

1315
01:10:18.261 --> 01:10:21.410
that has so much beauty. Um, but I look at it this way, I said, look,

1316
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:24.440
if we lose all of our open space to a problem like this,

1317
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.530
and it compounds the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water,

1318
01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.090
you may not be into the outdoors right now. You might be a preservationist.

1319
01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:32.930
You might be, you know,

1320
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.130
on your fricking digital device all the time and looking at wildlife through a,

1321
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:38.000
through a screen.

1322
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.930
But if you ever do go out and you get that peace and tranquility and you get

1323
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:46.820
centered, like we do run a trail hiker, you know, LA County, mountain trail,

1324
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.250
open space, don't even get that far in the woods. It's just soothing, you know,

1325
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.370
brings us back to our center. And you know,

1326
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:56.690
if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or

1327
01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:59.330
they can get their kids doing it or their grandkids are here about it,

1328
01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:03.500
but it's not there to go to, um, that to me, man, we're just,

1329
01:11:03.501 --> 01:11:05.780
we're just not paying forward enough. So this is,

1330
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:09.350
this is something I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you

1331
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:13.440
stand for. Um, because of the message. I think just so many people don't know.

1332
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.350
Yeah. I just think that's a big new is they don't know.

1333
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.660
What's interesting to me too is that the allocation of resources that it's,

1334
01:11:20.661 --> 01:11:23.760
it's so when you have something that's illegal,

1335
01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:27.810
you're not getting any of that money. No. And if it was legal,

1336
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.920
there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads

1337
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.200
and we can allocate it to a bunch of different big time,

1338
01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:39.210
really positive ways to spend it. Yeah. And we're not doing that.

1339
01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:39.641
And it's,

1340
01:11:39.641 --> 01:11:44.641
it's the reason why is because it's illegal and this is crime problem is very

1341
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:48.870
similar to what they faced during prohibition with alcohol and [inaudible] the

1342
01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.720
rise of organized crime. I mean, right.

1343
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:53.970
That's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand.

1344
01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.860
It's really a disgusting,

1345
01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.520
dumb way to approach a problem that is in many people's ideas of social problem.

1346
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:06.720
That money could go to so many different positive things. Yeah.

1347
01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:09.690
And when we're perpetuating it through that reason and many others,

1348
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.290
we're basically, you know, we're basically embedding the problem in our country.

1349
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.040
And ed said this called her own,

1350
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.180
we were dialoguing earlier this week and he said, you know, um,

1351
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.510
he's kinda looked at things from the border and South and the issues coming in

1352
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:24.390
from the border, from the cartel front. He said, you know,

1353
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.850
now I'm getting wind of your book and I'm starting to analyze what you're,

1354
01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:29.580
you guys are fighting on the ground inside the borders in California,

1355
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:32.340
in the rest of the country. He goes, it's embedded now. I mean,

1356
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:33.660
it's not like it's just coming across.

1357
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:37.500
I mean the enterprise is embedded here in the nation because they have the

1358
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:39.300
pipeline, they have the distribution,

1359
01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.120
they have a market and they don't have to deal with the border issue.

1360
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.540
And they're comfortable because of exactly where we're at and what people are

1361
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:48.840
aware of. So in California that it's just a misdemeanor,

1362
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:51.910
which is even more insane. That's got to change. It's got to change.

1363
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:55.050
And I don't mean it should be something horrendous if you're,

1364
01:12:55.051 --> 01:12:57.300
if you actually have a background in crime,

1365
01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:00.750
especially particularly violent crime when you get caught doing something like

1366
01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.360
that. I mean it should be severe, severe penalty.

1367
01:13:03.361 --> 01:13:04.590
It should absolutely be severe.

1368
01:13:04.591 --> 01:13:09.591
Now that the saving grace of that is when we get the environmental crimes that

1369
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:14.340
we bring from the fish and wildlife standpoint to those charges for these guys,

1370
01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:18.810
we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happen. Um,

1371
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.980
as soon as all that regulation started two years ago and the wa, you know,

1372
01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:25.680
those trespass grow cramps were watered down to what we're talking about.

1373
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.920
District attorneys all throughout the state said, Oh man,

1374
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:31.710
we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes. I mean,

1375
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.240
we're not gonna have a, you know,

1376
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:37.020
we're not gonna have a jury that's sympathetic to these issues. Um,

1377
01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:40.170
it's not worth it. Some Sheriff's departments were saying, Hey,

1378
01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:41.520
we know how violent these guys are.

1379
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.030
We know your team's been in like six gunfights man,

1380
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.590
your partner was almost killed in Oh five in the first one.

1381
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.860
You guys take these guys head on, you know, you want to protect your wildlife,

1382
01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:50.221
whatever,

1383
01:13:50.221 --> 01:13:54.270
but they're not stopping and it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict them so

1384
01:13:54.271 --> 01:13:58.740
we're not going to play. So the backlash of those crimes being watered down,

1385
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:03.030
Joe was team stopped working at except us and like the feds, you know,

1386
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.570
and not only that DA's couldn't prosecute. So, um,

1387
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.680
I remember speaking for the California district attorney association on this and

1388
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.270
say, and there's a solution. Everybody,

1389
01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.540
no matter where they sit on the cannabis spectrum,

1390
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.590
everybody hates to see Bambi dead, water poisoned.

1391
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:22.770
Everyone has a little bit of environmental passion.

1392
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.180
And I'm on both sides of the fence. And that's where I say, here,

1393
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:25.780
we get to the [inaudible],

1394
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.400
we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the periphery or against. Um,

1395
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:32.500
and if you take these water code enhancements,

1396
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:36.100
if you take the felony and the penal code from the band, toxics like Carbofuran,

1397
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.620
um, if you take a stream bed alteration,

1398
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:41.890
diversion or dead wildlife are littering close to a state waterway,

1399
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:45.700
you stack all those up, you get all these penalties and you can convict on that.

1400
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.070
You know, even in a sympathetic jury on see a cannabis issue.

1401
01:14:49.071 --> 01:14:53.950
So we started to prosecute these cases and it started to come back and it's an

1402
01:14:53.951 --> 01:14:57.000
arduous end around, it's more work than we should have to do. But,

1403
01:14:57.001 --> 01:15:00.100
but we're doing it now when they find these cartel members and they bust them

1404
01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:04.870
and they do prosecute them for these, um, felonies, what happens?

1405
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:06.490
Do they, they don't get deported, right?

1406
01:15:06.491 --> 01:15:10.210
They stay in this country and they go to jail here. It depends. Um, they,

1407
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:11.590
they'll go to jail here.

1408
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:14.950
If it's a sanctuary type state scenario and they're gonna, you know,

1409
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:19.120
stay in our justice system and they will do jail time here. Um,

1410
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:21.610
if we're working with ice in feds and Homeland security,

1411
01:15:21.611 --> 01:15:24.820
especially ice agents and they are classified as deportable felon,

1412
01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:27.100
they will get deported. They'll get on a watch list.

1413
01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:31.820
Did they get deported to jail or did they just get freed? Well they,

1414
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.390
they're supposed to go back and be in custody over on that side.

1415
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:38.290
Does that always happen? Air quotes supposed to, supposed to operative word,

1416
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.220
supposed to slip.

1417
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.310
If there's someone who's high up in the cartel or is making a good amount of

1418
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:43.410
money for the cartel, right.

1419
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.710
It's highly likely that with a lot of corruption they might go free. Very,

1420
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.550
very true. And the case has happened where we've, you know,

1421
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.600
got some of these cartel growers deported and a week later they're in a

1422
01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:57.340
different growing kit in Northern California.

1423
01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.410
We've had some situations where we've,

1424
01:15:59.411 --> 01:16:03.960
we've seen the same guy for 20 times wax,

1425
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.863
no joke.

1426
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.260
So you've busted them how many times we did or another team did or sort of

1427
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:13.120
service does. Did 20 times. Yeah, they'd been, they'd been,

1428
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.790
and they're still here and they're still here. Holy shit.

1429
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:19.180
Because of what you just broken system as the jacked. Right.

1430
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.140
And what you just said,

1431
01:16:20.141 --> 01:16:23.410
it's like cause of the cause of the money involved and we know and I go into

1432
01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:25.990
this and hidden wore a little bit what I can talk about under,

1433
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.620
you know just what we learned without putting names out there is it's four to

1434
01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:34.621
$7,000 for these grow organizations in these cartel cells to bring their best

1435
01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:38.200
growers back across and it's a drop in the bucket and they don't even consider

1436
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:39.100
the border a border.

1437
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.320
They consider it like a speed bump on the four Oh five freeway.

1438
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.700
So how do they get guys in? Do they use boats? Do they use tunnels? All of it.

1439
01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:47.050
All of it.

1440
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.840
I was always thinking like how the fuck are you going to protect the border when

1441
01:16:49.841 --> 01:16:53.860
you just get a boat and discount like well pass in Poland somewhere in

1442
01:16:53.861 --> 01:16:56.080
California and hop out. Yeah, we'll something,

1443
01:16:56.081 --> 01:17:00.070
something we learned recently and it's been about the last five years and it was

1444
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:03.610
really starting to hit the California coastline in the Oregon coastline heavy

1445
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:07.900
when we started our unit in 2013 was these panga boats and you know,

1446
01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:10.130
they start where panga it's called panga, P

1447
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.790
<v 2>a N G a called a panga boat. And they're, they're uh, you know, the,</v>

1448
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:18.610
the inside the mazal on peninsula and they're loaded up with 6,000 pounds of

1449
01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:20.120
tainted weed but grown in Mexico,

1450
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:25.121
same stuff they're doing here with the same toxics or meth or people or both in

1451
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:28.070
a couple of growers or you know, transporters and they'll run this boat.

1452
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:31.490
It's a one way boat and it's, there's a lot of money in it. You know,

1453
01:17:31.491 --> 01:17:35.330
there's big four stroke motors. It's painted kind of the color of the ocean,

1454
01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:37.790
so it's hard to pick up from. The air goes kind of fast.

1455
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.170
It's made to carry big loads and they'll take that thing around the peninsula.

1456
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.620
They'll fuel up off shore somewhere off the San Diego coastline,

1457
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:48.410
maybe a hundred miles out and he's got one up there. It is nice Jamie.

1458
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.900
Well that's a lot of weed. That's a lot. Yeah.

1459
01:17:50.901 --> 01:17:52.430
I got some pretty cool pictures in the book.

1460
01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:56.360
So these guys just pulled the boat in and then this is obviously one that got

1461
01:17:56.361 --> 01:17:59.720
busted and then they just have someone waiting for them.

1462
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:02.780
An example of that stuff in the trucks and they've got a distribution network,

1463
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.640
a ready to go, and then that boat's just disposed of. And again,

1464
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.351
ladies and gentlemen,

1465
01:18:06.351 --> 01:18:10.340
this is all because of an illegal demand because it's illegal.

1466
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:14.780
This stuff wouldn't be profitable if we are growing in here in the United

1467
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:14.781
States.

1468
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:18.590
And if the only way you would sell it at a store was if it was regulated and

1469
01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:21.920
licensed and you knew that it was tested and it was all grown here.

1470
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.420
He had a certificate of where the farmer was that element out of it. Yeah.

1471
01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:29.570
So you take that element completely out of it and they would let you know.

1472
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.660
Obviously they're still selling fentanyl and all sorts of other shit that we

1473
01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:36.110
don't want legal. Yeah, but it's so dark.

1474
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.190
It's such a confusing, confused.

1475
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:43.160
It was this bang of boat found with $18 million worth of weed.

1476
01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:46.040
That is a lot of weeds. Weed is not expensive.

1477
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:49.460
How has a boat got $18 million worth of weed? That's a heavy load.

1478
01:18:49.461 --> 01:18:51.320
That's a typical load to Joe and a,

1479
01:18:51.321 --> 01:18:53.620
that was probably one of the Monterey boats we helped on cause we,

1480
01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:57.320
we interdicted a lot there. But um, yeah,

1481
01:18:57.321 --> 01:19:00.620
it's a daunting task when you look at that dude on the right.

1482
01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.390
I said just shoot him in his face. Guy looks super dainty. Angry.

1483
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.820
Yeah. Very mad. Very angry. Not try it up here. Yeah.

1484
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.220
I mean obviously I'm not, I'm kidding about shoot him. But yes, their,

1485
01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.810
their situation is just as great. I mean you live in,

1486
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:19.940
in Mexico and you're fucked and there's no way for you to get by legally.

1487
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:21.560
And you're a young man,

1488
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.990
you get recruited into one of these cartels and next thing you know,

1489
01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:26.540
you've been in for 10 years and you committed a few murderers and you're

1490
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:29.570
involved in drug trafficking and you're down the slower. Yeah.

1491
01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:32.720
You're down that slope. It's done. How do you get out of that? You really don't.

1492
01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:37.310
And there's no, there's no avenues for them. There's no established, you know,

1493
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.430
community outreach centers like Hey cartel members,

1494
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:43.580
like why don't you just grow cherry tomatoes instead? Right. Or you know,

1495
01:19:43.581 --> 01:19:46.400
there's no positive reinforcement and people that give a shit, you know,

1496
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:47.900
it's horrible. Yeah. I mean,

1497
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.790
and a lot of that again is backed by illegal drug sales.

1498
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.620
If you don't have illegal drug sales,

1499
01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:57.770
you don't have nearly as much profit or incentive and you have less of that.

1500
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.300
Yeah.

1501
01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.750
It sounds counterintuitive for people to make things illegal that are legal,

1502
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.800
are make things legal that are illegal and you would, you would stop the crime.

1503
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:08.010
But that is really how it

1504
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.550
<v 1>works. It is. And I always look at it this way, I said, look it,</v>

1505
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.970
regardless of where you sit on the emotional spectrum on this,

1506
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.100
against cannabis for cannabis,

1507
01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.970
let's all look at the issue of environmental purity,

1508
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:25.410
safety in America, and really be realists of what's going to help the problem.

1509
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.780
And you hit it on the head when you said, well, yeah,

1510
01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.030
there's all that mess stuff going on and this, that and there is,

1511
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:32.490
but I'm a realist and we got to do something right now.

1512
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.110
And I think if we're going to federally,

1513
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.810
federally regulate to any type of consistency,

1514
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.970
we're still many years off from that, you know,

1515
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.790
so what are we going to do in the meantime if that's going to happen?

1516
01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:44.870
We still gotta deal with this, this mess going on in pride,

1517
01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:47.010
predominantly California and all this stuff.

1518
01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:49.980
Getting out to our public and being tainted. Um,

1519
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:52.620
we still have to deal with the meth issue and the gun running and all of that.

1520
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:55.140
And, and knowing that it's embedded in our country,

1521
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:58.620
we need to have people aware of it and with not only law enforcement, but bring,

1522
01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.680
bring that thin green line a little bigger with conservationists like yourself

1523
01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:05.250
and people that are in the know, people that are in the outdoors. Um,

1524
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.810
and just putting the word out. I mean it's,

1525
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:10.290
it's crazy that 10 years have passed since the first book in 10 years have

1526
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:13.500
passed since we did those, you know, those three good years of while justice TV.

1527
01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:18.150
But in that interim, it's been a specialty of ours. We built a team that's,

1528
01:21:18.210 --> 01:21:21.600
you know, notice now for being pretty, you know, pretty uh,

1529
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:24.540
innovative and progressive and non traditional,

1530
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.740
but putting up some pretty good numbers when it comes to the environmental

1531
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:32.040
damage and the public safety issue and how much we took out and bad guys we

1532
01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:35.160
caught and what our, what our kit with canines did, especially canine Phoebe.

1533
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.680
Um, but we're, we're only dropping the bucket. Yeah.

1534
01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.180
It's one team out of part of the state and other teams are doing some stuff too

1535
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:43.560
at the federal level and state level.

1536
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:46.260
And we're only getting maybe 50% of this stuff if we're lucky.

1537
01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:50.420
Is it really that much? It's at 2% is high. That's, that's optimistic. Yeah.

1538
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:54.240
That's against the magic wand. Yup. If I gave you the magic wand, John,

1539
01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:57.370
do whatever you want, how would you, how much,

1540
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.790
how many more officers would you hire? How big would you make the task force?

1541
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.170
How much would you branch out your operation? I'd make the tactical unit,

1542
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.393
the met team,

1543
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.090
have the tacticians going just after the cartel front that we formed. I'd,

1544
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.670
you know, triple or quadruple it, you know,

1545
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.180
have a team like maybe four teams in the state, you know,

1546
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:16.590
have them all trained together,

1547
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:20.700
have them all uniformly committed to tactics and training. Because it is,

1548
01:22:20.701 --> 01:22:24.510
it is quite advanced with some of our guys of doing from a sniper team to

1549
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.990
tracking to, you know, all the stuff we get into. Um,

1550
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.920
not only for this job but for anything else we come up with right from, uh,

1551
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:32.400
from, uh,

1552
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.930
from an American public safety threat after nine 11 stuff changed and we hadn't

1553
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:39.510
gotten into this grow mess yet. Joe, you know, with, uh,

1554
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.440
to the level of the cartel front. But I knew back then, you know,

1555
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.500
game wardens are gonna have to be tactically trained as well as any other law

1556
01:22:46.501 --> 01:22:47.191
enforcement officer.

1557
01:22:47.191 --> 01:22:49.290
And we're going to have to have our own tactical unit cause we're doing some

1558
01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:52.050
pretty crazy stuff for wildlife crimes, you know.

1559
01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:54.930
And then Homeland security on a potential terrorist threat.

1560
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:58.650
You need to have tactical units that are there with every other agency and

1561
01:22:58.651 --> 01:23:01.380
military teams because we're all thin in numbers.

1562
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.820
And if something big goes down,

1563
01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.550
I need to know that the sniper team we built with Mitt and these tacticians

1564
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:09.610
<v 0>can go in and integrate with San Jose PD SWAT.</v>

1565
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.910
They can integrate with military personnel, you know, wherever,

1566
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:14.650
same type of deal. And we've used,

1567
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.740
we've gone the same direction with some of that good training and found the

1568
01:23:17.741 --> 01:23:21.760
right people to do that just under a game warden umbrella because it's gotten

1569
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:25.330
that crazy. So it is crazy that you guys were required to do that.

1570
01:23:25.331 --> 01:23:30.040
I mean it's sort of like asking a teacher to also be a Kickbox or something.

1571
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.060
The idea that you guys were supposed to be doing one thing,

1572
01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:38.110
which is the a game warden and then all of a sudden you're involved in narcotics

1573
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:43.111
trafficking and cartel operations and getting shot at and you bring in dogs and

1574
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:47.890
yeah, these dogs that you're training, you know, Phoebe was,

1575
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:52.540
I there was very interesting listening to how effective and using Belgium Malmo

1576
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:56.830
was that we using primarily our main dogs have Belgian Mel and you are powerful

1577
01:23:56.831 --> 01:24:01.630
dogs. They are amazing. So smart. Yes. Look in their eyes you can see it.

1578
01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:03.070
Right? And like, Hey man, how are you doing?

1579
01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.970
They're not like looking at a poodle. No, they're not like looking at our labs,

1580
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:10.440
not Marshall Apollo. You looking at me with that sweet little phase. No,

1581
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:15.400
those times out. Yeah. The thing that's cool about these dogs and um,

1582
01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:18.430
and I can't talk enough about it man. Cause no matter where you sit,

1583
01:24:18.431 --> 01:24:21.490
everybody loves a good dog story. And you know, some people say, well,

1584
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:24.490
dual purpose, you got to bite guys. What's with with that is, you know,

1585
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:28.030
really aggressive and um, when you look at, it's a lifesaver for everybody.

1586
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:31.050
It's a lifesaver for us. It's a lifesaver for the suspect to for,

1587
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:35.080
because it usually involves a potential gunfight that the dog basically,

1588
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:38.950
you know, alleviated because she or he was there. Um,

1589
01:24:38.951 --> 01:24:43.951
so we got our canine program in agency going kind of full speed around 2008 ish.

1590
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:46.810
And we have three, we have three levels of canine.

1591
01:24:46.811 --> 01:24:49.630
We have like the companion right along canine that kinda does everything with

1592
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:53.080
ya. She's never going to bite anybody. And that's Apollo. That's like my lab.

1593
01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:56.380
Right. And then we have the detection level dog.

1594
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.780
And most of those are Labradors. Like Marshall, like Apollo,

1595
01:24:58.781 --> 01:25:03.520
because labs have such amazing noses, they really can hold on sent, you know,

1596
01:25:03.521 --> 01:25:03.750
they,

1597
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:07.450
they can train to D to tech mini sense and we certify them in different things.

1598
01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:12.040
And then there's the Phoebe's, you know, the Belgian males or the shepherds.

1599
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:16.330
And really it's become mostly males now in our agency and Y mows or shoppers.

1600
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.940
Um, they just do better in the heat. You know,

1601
01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.090
the shepherds are longer haired and we're in a hundred degree weather.

1602
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:24.010
We're on long hikes, you know,

1603
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.700
we're unsupported in those dogs might have to sit quietly after hiking eight

1604
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:32.110
miles and sit in a prone quietly while we're watching and observing and stocking

1605
01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:35.800
it on suspects to make an apprehension and arrest safely and hopefully avoid a

1606
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.970
gunfight. So, and we've also found with the, with the males that like I said,

1607
01:25:39.971 --> 01:25:44.971
they just hold up better on average and there's certainly exceptions to that.

1608
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.820
Um, but when we got our dual purpose program back on track,

1609
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:52.270
these are dogs that will bite when they need to on command,

1610
01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.600
but they have great noses. Solas still detect wonderfully, you know,

1611
01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:58.930
finding evidence, finding tainted weed, whatever the case may be,

1612
01:25:58.931 --> 01:26:03.260
a firearm of a bear, gallbladder, all of that. But they'll also, you know,

1613
01:26:03.261 --> 01:26:04.100
like Phoebe was

1614
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.250
<v 1>nicknamed the from missile because when it was time for her to go to work and</v>

1615
01:26:07.251 --> 01:26:10.880
some guy was going to pull a weapon on us, she was all business.

1616
01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.360
And a cool thing about a dog like her and [inaudible] and Mike [inaudible] and I

1617
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:17.390
got into this on his show, especially in, he was blown away. He said,

1618
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:22.630
I've never heard of a dog in a domestic law enforcement team that's had like,

1619
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.760
she had 116 apprehension bites in her career and she had hundred and 16 no joke

1620
01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:31.760
jokes. She has 116 cartel guys out there telling stories about this dog.

1621
01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:35.840
They're saying no more para. I've been bit too many times. No.

1622
01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:40.970
But the cool thing about that was a standpoint of life she saved and she also

1623
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:44.270
arrest another eight to 900 that she didn't have to bite in her career.

1624
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.480
That's a lot. How many of you guys arrested?

1625
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:53.090
When I retired we were over a thousand. Wow. In five and a half years. Yeah.

1626
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:57.920
And we and against all these, the all grow ups, all grow ups. Yeah.

1627
01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.780
These are all grow ups are related to grow up.

1628
01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:01.640
So that then these are all guys that are armed.

1629
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:03.310
All guys that have knives or guns, you know,

1630
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.890
you're not getting bit unless you know you're a deadly force threat on some

1631
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:11.270
level or a significant threat. So, uh, yeah, it's been a lot of guys.

1632
01:27:11.271 --> 01:27:14.540
So that number that you're talking about, 10,000, that really is conservative.

1633
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.340
Very, I think very much so. Yeah.

1634
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:21.230
That is so insane because if you fly over like Humboldt or any,

1635
01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:22.150
any of these areas,

1636
01:27:22.151 --> 01:27:27.110
I can particularly met Asino Northern California that the density of the forest

1637
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:30.530
and the, the, the public land out there. Yeah, there's a lot of land.

1638
01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:33.830
There's a lot of land and a lot of opera, you know, potential we're not seeing.

1639
01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.930
So, and that's still still thriving. So when you, um, you know, when you,

1640
01:27:38.931 --> 01:27:41.600
when you look at Phoebe as a canine and you go, well, let's see,

1641
01:27:41.601 --> 01:27:45.170
she was in the field doing these type operations for about seven or eight years.

1642
01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:46.071
And yeah,

1643
01:27:46.071 --> 01:27:49.040
that's great from a record standpoint in numbers and the life she saved.

1644
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:52.550
But it gives you a, like a, like a snapshot of the issue.

1645
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:56.210
How many guys did we not catch that were out their arms in a way that we weren't

1646
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:59.150
involved in? You know, we weren't involved. So, um,

1647
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:02.630
and the dogs have just saved lives, man, they have saved Phoebe.

1648
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:03.620
I go into this and the new book,

1649
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:08.600
especially in 2012 but right before our team started, Phoebe saved my life.

1650
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:12.770
Brian's life and all these other operators in Santa Clara County in Silicon

1651
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.860
Valley,

1652
01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.880
right where I grew up because she engaged a guy that was pulling a Russian

1653
01:28:16.881 --> 01:28:20.150
automatic pistol on me and I was the support for the, for Brian.

1654
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:24.800
I was basically as canine handler or support guy and Brian had to deal with this

1655
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:25.700
other growers,

1656
01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:29.210
partner that had a big Tarus judge revolver on his hip and he was pulling it.

1657
01:28:29.211 --> 01:28:31.910
So he goes for that guy and says, John,

1658
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:35.360
just take my dog and Phoebe's long bite and he's biting this guy in the calf and

1659
01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:38.450
you know this guy's nose down and we don't know he's got this weapon.

1660
01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.010
And I start to see it coming out and I get on him and I do what I need to do

1661
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.050
with some physical control and some strikes and whatnot to get the gun out of

1662
01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:45.441
his hand.

1663
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:50.441
But had she not been on that guy on a bike show that guns turned on me at five

1664
01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:53.390
feet. I'm engaged all the Rathman behind me. I'm, you know,

1665
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:56.060
I'm in a gunfight again. We've been in too many of those already.

1666
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.290
How many gun fights you've been in?

1667
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.050
Our team's been in six [inaudible] and I've been on the ground for four out of

1668
01:29:01.051 --> 01:29:04.290
the six that our guys have been involved in and they've all been around this

1669
01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:06.060
particular problem. Um,

1670
01:29:06.061 --> 01:29:09.780
we had a lot less once the team got formalized and so we started using dogs,

1671
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:13.440
but we still had to during the window of the team being operational that we

1672
01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.460
couldn't avoid. And dogs played a big part in that as I go into the new stories,

1673
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:18.690
so crate, I mean,

1674
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.650
when I was listening to that podcast with Steve or now the media podcast with

1675
01:29:22.651 --> 01:29:23.311
you, and I was like,

1676
01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:27.540
I can't believe that there's not some sort of another division of law

1677
01:29:27.541 --> 01:29:32.541
enforcement that gets involved in this and that we were requiring game wardens

1678
01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:36.970
to essentially become something completely different. Yeah, well,

1679
01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.240
well we still have other law enforcement agencies involved.

1680
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:42.540
Forest service dedicates a lot of people to it because a lot of this is on

1681
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:44.400
federal lands. So we worked hand in hand.

1682
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:48.240
Some Sheriff's departments still work at um, BLM works at,

1683
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:53.730
but very few agencies have a dedicated team within their unit just for this

1684
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:56.070
problem. And it was a big step for us. And,

1685
01:29:56.071 --> 01:29:58.140
and even though it's not a traditional thing like we,

1686
01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:00.370
like we kind of talked about when we started, um,

1687
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:04.860
all of us that are doing it want to do it. I mean we really, everything we do,

1688
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:05.850
like I said is important.

1689
01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:09.090
We'll never negate anything [inaudible] a wildlife officer game warn has to do.

1690
01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.670
But for us that see this problem is the most severe,

1691
01:30:11.671 --> 01:30:13.770
which we all acknowledge and you know,

1692
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:17.490
we're those kind of team members that have the military, the law enforcement,

1693
01:30:17.491 --> 01:30:20.550
tactical experience. We're just wired for this type of stuff. And we know,

1694
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.740
I feel like, you know,

1695
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:25.530
in 28 years of being a game warden it felt like a 10 year career.

1696
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.380
And even though we are, we are certainly underpay. Like I mentioned,

1697
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.490
I had a dream job, you know it was really awesome to, you know,

1698
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:34.620
cause you're really doing a difference. I think we're making a difference.

1699
01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:35.101
Exactly.

1700
01:30:35.101 --> 01:30:40.101
I think every case we make matters and even though it's an uphill battle and

1701
01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:42.060
with the whole regulation debate and stuff,

1702
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.390
every grow site we interdict and stop and take that, you know,

1703
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:49.140
tainted cannabis out of the market or restore that waterway and clean up that

1704
01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:52.410
gross site and we cleaned them all up now that we go into and the other agencies

1705
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:56.520
now support us and clean up with their own resources because game wardens have

1706
01:30:56.521 --> 01:31:00.270
got so legitimate in working with other agencies that are non conservation

1707
01:31:00.271 --> 01:31:01.890
groups, Sheriff's departments, right.

1708
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:06.540
A DEA task force type units and they're like, okay, we agree, we see,

1709
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.680
we see the value in reclamation and clean up.

1710
01:31:10.681 --> 01:31:14.700
These grows to the point where Obama's drugs are addressed.

1711
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:19.701
A lot of us when my team was starting up and our group was working heavy and it

1712
01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:22.500
was a real compliment. But it finally, more importantly,

1713
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:23.910
it got the news out where he said,

1714
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:28.020
I want this model rewarded what fish and wildlife is doing with this cleanup.

1715
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.560
I mean, you guys are arresting guys. That's great. You're taking guns away.

1716
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.341
Your key, you know,

1717
01:31:32.341 --> 01:31:34.560
obviously somebody is going to be saved because these guys are violent,

1718
01:31:34.561 --> 01:31:37.500
deadly and you're radicating the plants. It's fantastic.

1719
01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:38.880
Keep it out of the market. They're poisoned.

1720
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:41.400
But unless you're doing that reclamation component,

1721
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:46.080
I know it's dirty and arduous and tiring and it takes resources. Um,

1722
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.960
you know, we're not doing, we're not making the biggest dent.

1723
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.400
So then funding started to reflect from the federal level through da funding

1724
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:57.520
rewards for reclamation. And that was like one of these men. It took,

1725
01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.460
it literally took 30 12, 13 years to get there.

1726
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:03.820
So when you guys have a situation like the first one that you found in 2004 and

1727
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:07.900
you stumble upon this dry Creek and there's all this debris and as toxic

1728
01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:08.501
chemicals,

1729
01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:11.800
like what kind of a cleanup is involved here and how long does something like

1730
01:32:11.801 --> 01:32:16.801
that take before you can bring that Creek back to where those steel head can run

1731
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:19.750
and to the way it's supposed to be.

1732
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:23.770
We're looking on an average one full day and we're looking at having to have a

1733
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:28.330
helicopter for a whole day and having to have anywhere between, you know,

1734
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.850
ideally 12 to maybe more officers in there.

1735
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:33.640
And a lot of it will have some volunteer groups coming in.

1736
01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:37.260
We have a program in California, fish and wildlife called the interview program,

1737
01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.280
the nature, the natural resource volunteer program.

1738
01:32:39.281 --> 01:32:43.450
And when we started our pilot program in 2013 we did an operation called

1739
01:32:43.451 --> 01:32:45.250
pristine to test this theory.

1740
01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:47.260
If we could have this full time team being effective.

1741
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.670
And if it wasn't for like 40 of these volunteers that are helicopter trained to

1742
01:32:51.671 --> 01:32:55.120
go in with us and do a cleanup, we would have re-acclimated you know,

1743
01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:58.540
less than half of what we were able to do. But when we do a reclamation,

1744
01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:01.930
it's probably more expensive than doing the tactical operation planning and the

1745
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.890
take down for the first part of the phase because you know,

1746
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:09.790
helicopters are thousands of dollars an hour in blade time and you're bagging up

1747
01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:11.480
trash, you're getting dirty. Um,

1748
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.060
some of these water lines like you saw in the spools and I told Steven on his

1749
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:20.470
show and Mike on his show as well, um, with mediator and Mike Trump that,

1750
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:24.400
you know, we tracked a waterline almost three miles once that was a lot of,

1751
01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:25.390
and pipe. It went,

1752
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:29.020
I mean water sources and Merseyside County on the Pacheco pass highway in my old

1753
01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:31.090
home district. And it went all the way down.

1754
01:33:31.091 --> 01:33:34.930
Pacheco pass onto this private ranch where the growth started. And it was,

1755
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:39.430
I think it was like 2.85 miles handmade, hand laid and buried under like,

1756
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:43.150
you know, forest roads or fire roads you'd see on like a, like a tone ranch.

1757
01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.150
Yeah. 18 inches underground buried across the road.

1758
01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:48.370
So we'd been embedded ditch for three miles.

1759
01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:51.490
That's a lot of work and it's a lot of work. Those guys are fucking up.

1760
01:33:51.491 --> 01:33:55.090
They should do a real job. They would make a lot of money, change it, fix it,

1761
01:33:55.091 --> 01:33:58.060
do something different. Yeah. All right. But the, the,

1762
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:01.270
the point of it was we have to, we have to pick up all that pipe. Yes. You know,

1763
01:34:01.271 --> 01:34:06.250
so how long is it going to take? You know, two of my guys and miles of pipe,

1764
01:34:06.251 --> 01:34:10.270
18 inches of ground. That was a couple days. You know, on an average one,

1765
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:13.330
we're going to go a quarter to half a mile at least. And you know,

1766
01:34:13.331 --> 01:34:16.270
even though that black pipe isn't poisoning the water directly,

1767
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:20.650
once all the poisons are taken out, that waterline is an infrastructure piece,

1768
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:21.930
that it's there, black gold. I,

1769
01:34:21.931 --> 01:34:24.430
I kind of use the term black gold when I start teaching to this,

1770
01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:27.940
that if you leave that water diversion in place and you take out their whole

1771
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.520
gross site, you know, you take out their camp and all that,

1772
01:34:30.521 --> 01:34:33.370
but all they gotta do is reconnect a waterline and put a 10 up and bring in

1773
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:35.530
seeds and get their little camouflage system going.

1774
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:40.180
Very small investment to put a grow back there.

1775
01:34:40.630 --> 01:34:44.230
And one of the things that really got other agencies convinced that we need to

1776
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.590
replicate to the way we sold it is not only on an environmental protection

1777
01:34:47.591 --> 01:34:50.290
standpoint because other agencies care about the environment,

1778
01:34:50.291 --> 01:34:52.960
but it's not a mandate that for not funded for it, but it would,

1779
01:34:52.961 --> 01:34:54.060
it was something like, um,

1780
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:57.410
it's also deterrence because when we debriefed some of guys,

1781
01:34:57.411 --> 01:35:01.580
we caught these upper levels and I dive into this in the new book especially,

1782
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:06.500
I finally got to ask the questions, um, to these upper level, you know,

1783
01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:10.100
cartel guys run and grows, run in math, run it all. And I said, you know,

1784
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.180
it's interesting. Um, we notice that when you got,

1785
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:15.470
when we eradicated gross site,

1786
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:20.990
traditionally back before we change this process and we just take out the plants

1787
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:23.570
and we leave, we noticed there's a grill,

1788
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:28.400
like they're back there next year or maybe two seasons again and it's the same

1789
01:35:28.401 --> 01:35:31.250
group. And the answer I got was, well,

1790
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:35.270
we know how taxed you guys are and how much resources you expand and you can't

1791
01:35:35.271 --> 01:35:39.890
possibly get all of our grows. So we'll try it, you know, in 50% of the time,

1792
01:35:39.891 --> 01:35:42.920
even though it was rated like two years before and it's on your radar,

1793
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:46.340
we'll actually get away with a harvest. And I asked, well,

1794
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.820
if we start doing this reclamation and we take all your stuff out and restore

1795
01:35:49.821 --> 01:35:53.480
the waterway and move the tents and just completely sanitize the site,

1796
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:56.600
let all the natural growth come back, preserve the Creek, he said,

1797
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:59.420
we're not going to come back to that too much effort.

1798
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.120
We're going to bring tens of thousands of dollars in new infrastructure.

1799
01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:04.490
We're gonna have to run a whole nother water line. Um,

1800
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:06.260
it's already on your radar, you know,

1801
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.090
from a couple of years ago when you guys rated it.

1802
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.140
That's not a good business investment in a business model for us to take that

1803
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:17.090
chance. And we kind of knew that because we were seeing the trend on the ground,

1804
01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:21.410
but to hear it from this guy's mouth and validate what we suspected and have it

1805
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:24.620
come back as true and all the other things I got to learn. I mean just,

1806
01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:27.050
it changed the game for us. And that happened,

1807
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:30.530
I'm going to say about a year to a year and a half right before we started our

1808
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:35.360
unit. So we went in building the met team in 2013 with this mindset in place.

1809
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:40.310
And uh, um, Nate Arnold who was a district, um, a captain at the time,

1810
01:36:40.311 --> 01:36:41.720
my partner in, in building this,

1811
01:36:41.721 --> 01:36:44.390
and I'm going to give a shout out right now to Mike Kerry on who is our chief of

1812
01:36:44.391 --> 01:36:44.690
the,

1813
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:48.170
the law enforcement division and one of my mentors and friends way back in the

1814
01:36:48.171 --> 01:36:49.400
Academy in 92.

1815
01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:55.150
He green-lit us to test this program and take all of us out of patrol in an

1816
01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:59.060
already depleted force. So you can imagine there was some resistance,

1817
01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:02.180
there was some middle management and executive staffers like,

1818
01:37:02.181 --> 01:37:05.270
why are we doing this? We're not supposed to be doing marijuana work.

1819
01:37:05.271 --> 01:37:10.190
It's drugs. Wah, you cleaning up grow sites chasing bad guys. Um, and Mike said,

1820
01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.900
no, I believe in you guys, test it,

1821
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:13.610
document it and see what we got to do with this.

1822
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:18.020
And we were six weeks into a three month test program and he is the chief and

1823
01:37:18.021 --> 01:37:21.260
all the deputy chiefs had talked about what we were doing out there and we were

1824
01:37:21.261 --> 01:37:25.790
now documenting these insane numbers of what was happening. And he said,

1825
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:29.480
we're done. I want it full time by January 1st, 2014 get your testing,

1826
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:33.740
do your interviews, get the protocol. You guys are leaving patrol, you know,

1827
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:36.740
we're gonna have this many spots and you're going to work straight for

1828
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:37.730
headquarters. Straight line.

1829
01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:41.930
Kind of like a military special special ops team that just works for the top.

1830
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:44.420
They don't really have boundaries of where they go, you know.

1831
01:37:44.421 --> 01:37:47.330
And that's kind of the approach we need and we needed to do a global statewide

1832
01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:49.460
approach with no, you know,

1833
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:53.390
hangups to work with whoever we needed to within without of our agencies and

1834
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:57.120
educate and it was really successful and we, but we had to break tradition.

1835
01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.200
So to your point, we liked what we do because you said it best.

1836
01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:02.790
We're making a difference.

1837
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.180
Every little grow we get out of circulation makes a difference. But it is,

1838
01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:08.250
it's an uphill battle because we know we're not getting them all and we know

1839
01:38:08.251 --> 01:38:09.420
it's not going away anytime soon.

1840
01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:13.230
<v 2>It must've been very interesting to talk to the cartel members and have them say</v>

1841
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:18.150
to you that they know that you guys are taxed. Oh yeah, yeah. Like shit. Yeah.

1842
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:22.260
Like they know, they know your operation then like how do they know?

1843
01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.490
<v 1>They just, they look at the number and end,</v>

1844
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.440
I mean we get so little information because they're so quiet. When you look,

1845
01:38:30.441 --> 01:38:32.360
you're talking to them. How many days do you get with them?

1846
01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.410
We got an interview [inaudible] this was one with DEA and a bunch of other

1847
01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:39.410
officials and multiple interpreters and I get to sit in on it.

1848
01:38:39.411 --> 01:38:42.620
And it was something that rang Phoebe. Feb wasn't there on that one.

1849
01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:47.810
But I do have a, a good Phoebe story for it. Um, many of them actually, but,

1850
01:38:47.811 --> 01:38:49.980
but a good one. And it was from that one where a,

1851
01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:52.760
she saved that another gun fight from happening. But,

1852
01:38:52.761 --> 01:38:55.850
but the thing about it was we don't get to talk to them very often when we do.

1853
01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.810
Um, it's, it's very rare that they'll talk, um,

1854
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.730
they're put together in an organization where they,

1855
01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.030
we don't really know last names. They only report to one person.

1856
01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:07.100
A lot of times they don't know who they're working next to.

1857
01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.440
So it's compartmentalize, very compartmentalized.

1858
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.670
And they do this to make sure that people cannot go back. Exactly. Cannot talk,

1859
01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.560
cannot reveal very much information.

1860
01:39:15.561 --> 01:39:18.840
I know a first name of my boss who's my supplier. So, um,

1861
01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:22.340
this was someone that was taken on other cartel crimes at high level,

1862
01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.290
but not a violent guy. You know,

1863
01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:27.920
he was very candid and straight forward and he's responsible for a lot of stuff

1864
01:39:27.921 --> 01:39:32.690
in California. And I can say that much, um, and other parts, um, of the country.

1865
01:39:32.691 --> 01:39:36.770
But what he revealed was just validating what we knew. But it gave,

1866
01:39:36.771 --> 01:39:38.780
it gave us tools to progress and, and learn from.

1867
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.230
<v 2>Yeah, that's what I was going to say. When they,</v>

1868
01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:43.600
when you do get that information from him, um, did that, uh,

1869
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:48.360
allow you to get more resources or to like confirm like, Hey, look,

1870
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:51.240
this is what we know. We need to pull out all this infrastructure.

1871
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:54.150
We need to pull out these pipes. If we don't, they're going to come back.

1872
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:56.070
If this is, this is gonna make a difference.

1873
01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:59.190
<v 1>It did. And when we, uh, when we formed it, the new team, we said,</v>

1874
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:01.090
here's how we're gonna approach this. We're going to,

1875
01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:03.420
we're going to help agencies. We're going to do our own missions.

1876
01:40:03.421 --> 01:40:05.250
We're going to help other agencies that are doing the work,

1877
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.190
but we're going to do an under the caveat that we're going to do a three prong

1878
01:40:08.191 --> 01:40:09.024
approach.

1879
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:13.770
We're going to apprehend as diligently as we can and catch these guys through

1880
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:15.900
our dogs, through our tactics. Because you know,

1881
01:40:15.901 --> 01:40:17.820
just chasing them around and knowing they're going to get away.

1882
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:21.780
There's no deterrence in that. And yeah, it's risky and yeah, it's dangerous.

1883
01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.900
But at least I know if I take him into custody, even for a day of five days,

1884
01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:26.910
whatever, maybe they're deported, maybe they're not.

1885
01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:30.090
That's one really skilled guy doing a lot of environmental damage that's at

1886
01:40:30.091 --> 01:40:33.750
least out of circulation for a while, right? So that had to happen.

1887
01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:37.620
We're going to eradicate every tainted plant and 90% of these grows.

1888
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.220
They're all tainted with this Carbofuran. So they have 90% 90%.

1889
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.310
It started 10 years ago. It was about one out of two.

1890
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.450
And by the time those stats are trickling in at the end of 2018 and is compiling

1891
01:40:48.451 --> 01:40:50.280
for the team, I'm like, Oh my gosh, man,

1892
01:40:50.281 --> 01:40:53.980
we had Carbofuran in like 89 or 90% of

1893
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.700
<v 0>every gross site we went into wow. On, on these trespass grows.</v>

1894
01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:00.880
But then the third thing we had to do, um,

1895
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:05.830
and we would only want to work with agencies that agreed is reclamation.

1896
01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:09.400
It's going to be dirty guys. We might have to come back a different day,

1897
01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:12.280
but give us your helicopter team. Give us some bodies. Yeah.

1898
01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.690
And it's specific reclamation like group.

1899
01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:20.080
Like it's like, it seems like you should have an agency that does this.

1900
01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360
We don't have that in place yet. And this a,

1901
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:27.190
an original Creek that you guys had in 2004 did you guys read divert the water?

1902
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:30.880
We did. And so he gets all the, we actually can't or flowing again. Yeah.

1903
01:41:30.881 --> 01:41:33.520
I took two years to get the fish back on that one.

1904
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.790
And that was literally what a numbers of fish do you guys think you lost in

1905
01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:38.190
that? Oh man. I mean the, the,

1906
01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:41.800
the steel header federally listed right now and they're valued at like 20 to

1907
01:41:41.801 --> 01:41:45.900
$30,000 a fish. Yeah, they're so threatened. So catch and release of that.

1908
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.750
I wanted to ask you as a game warden, you know, not a fan of catching early.

1909
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.840
Don't like the catch and release. Well it's weird.

1910
01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.040
Like I like fishing for food, right? I mean it's like a,

1911
01:41:57.041 --> 01:42:00.970
I don't want to shoot a deer with a blow dart either and just go look,

1912
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:05.290
I got one high and then let them like wake up Jesus and get outta there. No,

1913
01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:09.220
I'm getting it for food. Yeah. I mean look, I know steelhead fishing is fun.

1914
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.310
I know it is. It looks, it looks awesome. I've never caught steelhead,

1915
01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:15.150
but I've got salmon, I've caught trout and they're amazing. Sure.

1916
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.240
The gorgeous fish.

1917
01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:20.980
But the catching them and shoving a hook in their head and then letting them go

1918
01:42:20.981 --> 01:42:23.290
just seems stupid. It's not, yeah,

1919
01:42:23.291 --> 01:42:25.990
it's counterintuitive to you don't eat them in all patient groups.

1920
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.960
Steelhead at all. Well, if they're listed and they're so threatened,

1921
01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:31.410
the way to keep steelhead fishing going, you know,

1922
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.230
like in California is okay guys, you can catch him, but you got to release it.

1923
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.310
That's so stupid. You know? So now what about Oregon and Pacific Northwest?

1924
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:42.640
Are they, do they keep them there? In some places they do.

1925
01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.390
It's just good eating fish. Yeah. Yeah. It's a rainbow trout, right? Yeah.

1926
01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.600
Derivative or, but it's, but it's spawning is coming from the ocean.

1927
01:42:49.601 --> 01:42:52.330
It's going up river. It's spawning going back to the ocean.

1928
01:42:52.331 --> 01:42:54.810
So that's what makes it a steel head know. And uh,

1929
01:42:54.811 --> 01:42:58.450
it's an awesome fish and this parents didn't fight like crazy and it's just,

1930
01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.610
they do really natural. They're tough. Um, yeah. And,

1931
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:03.730
and you just look at the,

1932
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.510
you look at how sensitive they are and in that one Creek, in the 2004 grow,

1933
01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:10.370
that was the worst scenario that could have happened, right?

1934
01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:15.010
That they hit the headwaters of the start of this spawning channel that went to

1935
01:43:15.011 --> 01:43:18.760
a Creek called coyote Creek that actually went all the way into San Jose to the

1936
01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.593
South Bay of the ocean.

1937
01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:24.640
So that pollution situation from those band poisons was just decimating,

1938
01:43:24.641 --> 01:43:27.880
you know, three to five miles a Creek. So we had to take that water away,

1939
01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:32.470
diversion out. We had to clean it all up. How do you clean it up? Net it up,

1940
01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.110
bag all the trash, pull all the water lines, you know,

1941
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.680
what about the pesticides? How do you clean that up? If it's, if it's banned,

1942
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.770
we gotta basically get a hazmat team to pull it out. You know,

1943
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:45.550
we got to put it in hazardous material buckets, cap it real carefully, you know,

1944
01:43:45.650 --> 01:43:46.960
and then, and then just get it out safely.

1945
01:43:46.961 --> 01:43:49.420
And what about the stuff that gets into the ground? You've got to move,

1946
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:52.100
remove the soil. You've got to go through. And we can always do

1947
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.650
<v 1>that. And something that's interesting and um,</v>

1948
01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.530
we get into this especially in book two, is there's a group called IARC, um,

1949
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:02.720
at a UC Davis, dr maraud, Gabriel and his colleagues,

1950
01:44:03.110 --> 01:44:07.160
and they're going in as an NGO and they're the scientists that really validated

1951
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.980
the devastation these, these band poisons do. When, uh,

1952
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:13.700
the Pacific Fisher that was almost completely wiped out as a threatened species

1953
01:44:13.701 --> 01:44:16.070
in California was linked to DTO grow poisons.

1954
01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.730
And that kind of came to surface about five or six years ago.

1955
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.920
And then the kind of the light bulb went off that, Hey,

1956
01:44:21.921 --> 01:44:24.500
this is an outside scientific group of an NGO,

1957
01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.950
a nongovernmental organization that's working hand in hand with California

1958
01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:30.620
department of fish and wildlife and us forest service.

1959
01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:35.660
But they're showing the devastation of this stuff in the soil and in the water.

1960
01:44:35.661 --> 01:44:37.850
We'll after the grows eradicated, it's not just, you know,

1961
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.510
in and around the plants what's going on. So some of these sites,

1962
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:45.830
if you don't do a com a complete, you know, soil over haul and you know,

1963
01:44:45.831 --> 01:44:47.810
get all that lining out of the creeks,

1964
01:44:47.811 --> 01:44:50.150
it's not going to be completely a completely restored.

1965
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.580
And sometimes that can take, you know,

1966
01:44:52.581 --> 01:44:55.610
we might have the resources to get back in there for a year or half a year.

1967
01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.040
We always try to get it before the end of the year when the rains come.

1968
01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:01.750
But it's not always possible. It just can't, it can't happen.

1969
01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:05.450
And you were saying that these pesticides dissipate off the plant somewhat.

1970
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:06.650
Some ways of time.

1971
01:45:06.651 --> 01:45:10.340
Does that the case with groundwater and in the ground as well?

1972
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:13.790
They dissipate toxicity somewhat everywhere,

1973
01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:17.530
but they don't dissipate to the point where they're not harmful on some levels.

1974
01:45:17.531 --> 01:45:20.840
So is a case in point. Um, I have a slide,

1975
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:24.350
I show my PowerPoint that actually came from IARC and we've seen this multiple

1976
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:25.520
times of, you know,

1977
01:45:25.521 --> 01:45:29.510
you have a scientist and he's in the big rubber nitrile gloves, the long sleeve,

1978
01:45:29.511 --> 01:45:31.700
the face protection, the hat,

1979
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:37.040
and he's got a gray Fox carcass that right next to a plant in the soil that he

1980
01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:39.710
ingested this stuff right on, on a, on a tainted plant.

1981
01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.750
And the Fox died within minutes.

1982
01:45:42.110 --> 01:45:45.770
And then there's a golden Eagle that comes in after and it could have been days

1983
01:45:45.771 --> 01:45:48.410
after, we don't know, you know, and their, their carry on feeders, right?

1984
01:45:48.411 --> 01:45:51.860
So the golden Eagle lands starts just picking just on the surface,

1985
01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:54.890
on the body of this doesn't even get into the carcass.

1986
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:59.420
And here's a dead golden Eagle in the photo right next to the, it's like, man,

1987
01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:03.110
just put a radioactive time bomb in that animal. I mean, that's a lot carcass.

1988
01:46:03.111 --> 01:46:06.680
And that was days after, you know, when the scientists are coming back in. So,

1989
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:10.760
um, dissipated or not, it has its effects. We see that, uh,

1990
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:15.410
in California with a rat poison and yes, an Eagle or an eat,

1991
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:18.320
not Eagles, owls as well. Very much so. Yeah.

1992
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:20.570
That's why getting all those toxics,

1993
01:46:20.571 --> 01:46:24.640
even the ones that are illegal out of areas where owls or any type of Raptors

1994
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:28.610
or, you know, carry on feeders compete too. Don't like coyotes. But boy,

1995
01:46:28.611 --> 01:46:32.630
that's the best way to keep those Roden things under control as coyotes.

1996
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:35.690
It's a balance. Yeah, it really is part of the cycle. I mean,

1997
01:46:35.691 --> 01:46:39.260
I know people love their little dogs and cats and stuff, but you know,

1998
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:42.520
I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about it and I was like,

1999
01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.940
you need those things, man.

2000
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:48.510
Those coyotes are important as gross as they are little criminals and little

2001
01:46:48.511 --> 01:46:51.270
criminals, the neighborhoods, little criminals in the neighborhood. But man,

2002
01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:54.230
you hit it that you got to have that balance, you know, and, and,

2003
01:46:54.250 --> 01:46:56.520
and like we all say on the conservation model,

2004
01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.300
everything needs a little bit of hunting control. Yeah. You know, it does.

2005
01:47:00.301 --> 01:47:03.480
The coyotes need it when they're overpopulated, you know, um, you know,

2006
01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:06.750
you say it many times, uh, in the message with your guests. Um,

2007
01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.500
people need to understand that we're helping wildlife as hunters,

2008
01:47:10.501 --> 01:47:11.490
as conservationists.

2009
01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:14.370
We're helping keep what we have and there's no way we can not manage them

2010
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:17.920
because we've already developed so much and taken so much wild space. Right.

2011
01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.380
And we've encroached and we've had, you know, a population of mountain lions.

2012
01:47:22.381 --> 01:47:25.350
It's ebbed and flowed and climbed. And we've had this and we've had that.

2013
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:28.260
So yeah, we have to be involved. Um,

2014
01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:32.280
but this particular problem that we're facing has so many far reaching effects

2015
01:47:32.281 --> 01:47:36.090
that we don't even see. Um, you know, as a Hunter, it's just disgusting

2016
01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.290
<v 2>counter intuitive to people that may be animal rights activists or vegans that</v>

2017
01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:43.820
hunters are responsible for.

2018
01:47:43.821 --> 01:47:47.390
The reason why we have such large populations to these animals and wildlife

2019
01:47:47.391 --> 01:47:52.391
protection and how much money comes from hunting tags and then recreational

2020
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:54.470
firearm sales. I mean,

2021
01:47:54.471 --> 01:47:59.471
that's really the majority of the money that goes to preserve these wild lands

2022
01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.830
and keep these animals alive. And when you tell that to animal rights,

2023
01:48:03.831 --> 01:48:06.530
people are vegans, they panic, right? He's like, listen,

2024
01:48:06.531 --> 01:48:08.450
the reason why these animals exist,

2025
01:48:08.630 --> 01:48:11.390
the reason why they're protected is because people hunt them.

2026
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:15.300
Exact sounds so counterintuitive. But w you know,

2027
01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:18.950
you were talking about Rocky mountain elk and the Rocky mountain elk Federation

2028
01:48:18.951 --> 01:48:23.840
has done an amazing job. Amazing, really repopulating areas.

2029
01:48:23.841 --> 01:48:28.010
Like now they have successful populations in places like Kentucky where they

2030
01:48:28.011 --> 01:48:30.470
were eradicated at one point in time they had been extra painted.

2031
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:33.020
And because of it, not because of us,

2032
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:36.100
because of market hunting back in the turn of the century, right.

2033
01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:39.380
The 18 hundreds when people you know,

2034
01:48:39.381 --> 01:48:41.690
needed food and they didn't have refrigerators.

2035
01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.290
So you would shoot something and it was only good for a few days and they would

2036
01:48:45.291 --> 01:48:48.950
go out and shoot some more and they would sell that food and that food was these

2037
01:48:48.951 --> 01:48:52.100
wild animals and there was completely unregulated hunting. Yeah,

2038
01:48:52.101 --> 01:48:54.770
just hammered them. Yeah, it's hard. It's horrific.

2039
01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:57.620
I mean we know about it with the Buffalo cause we've all seen those horrific

2040
01:48:57.830 --> 01:49:01.940
photographs of mountains of skulls and yeah. But I mean,

2041
01:49:01.941 --> 01:49:06.890
that was the case with antelope and deer and they've done such an amazing job

2042
01:49:06.891 --> 01:49:09.920
that now there's more deer in this country than there were when Columbus was

2043
01:49:09.921 --> 01:49:11.780
here. Yeah. He didn't know he was never here.

2044
01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.170
<v 1>It's interesting when you bring up elk because of a, you know, being a,</v>

2045
01:49:15.171 --> 01:49:18.560
a worldwide Hunter myself and doing it for so long. Um,

2046
01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:21.170
I've never taken an elk myself,

2047
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:24.380
but I've been on these amazing elk hunts where I've guided, you know,

2048
01:49:24.381 --> 01:49:27.920
people really deserving of getting their first elk as an example.

2049
01:49:27.921 --> 01:49:31.040
And you'll like this story being a fellow, a, you know, an elk guy. Um,

2050
01:49:31.041 --> 01:49:35.090
we had a tag in Santa Clara County that was for one bowl for a Tulio elk.

2051
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:36.560
And one thing we have in this,

2052
01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.350
this state of specialty is we have some of the best Tulia elk on the planet.

2053
01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.070
You know, there are beautiful, you know, smaller species and, you know, great.

2054
01:49:43.071 --> 01:49:48.040
Just, just a beautiful animal. And, um, I saw this tag up, you know,

2055
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.770
for, for residents or non-residents,

2056
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:54.670
it was only one tag but nobody would put in for it because all our Tulio elk are

2057
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:57.640
on private land and no one has access. So this uh,

2058
01:49:57.641 --> 01:50:02.080
this gentleman true this tool ya'll tag, um, Mike [inaudible] is only one tag.

2059
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:06.430
We give one tack. Why just cause limited numbers.

2060
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:08.590
We know it's going to be a private land, small herd.

2061
01:50:08.591 --> 01:50:10.200
We don't want to take too many bowls and,

2062
01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:13.230
and we also know that it access is going to be hard. So they,

2063
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.810
they experiment with one tag. And uh,

2064
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:19.780
this gentleman that drew the tag was a 70 year old master Hunter education

2065
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:22.510
instructor, one of our top instructors for like four years.

2066
01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:25.180
So he's teaching Hunter ed like we do in the Lord in front.

2067
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:27.670
He's paying it forward, draws this tag.

2068
01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.680
He had drawn it in a similar County in Alameda County the year before and could

2069
01:50:32.681 --> 01:50:35.110
never get to any access to harvest as elk.

2070
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:38.530
So I get a call through the Hunter education program, like, Hey man,

2071
01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:41.050
I know you know all your ranchers and friends there in Santa Clara County.

2072
01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:43.900
Do you have a ranch that we could set them up on? I said,

2073
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:45.880
I'll work something out. This guy's awesome. I mean,

2074
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:50.710
how many future conservationists is he raised up? Um, so I found him a spot,

2075
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:51.690
you know, a rancher, uh,

2076
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:55.000
me and my sister and family grew up with and he had a little,

2077
01:50:55.001 --> 01:50:57.670
little cattle ranch, but he had a beautiful herd, you know, he did good,

2078
01:50:57.671 --> 01:51:02.410
have heard like four 40 animals and some nice bowls, couple monsters. Um,

2079
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.770
so we got him set up to harvest one of those bowls, you know,

2080
01:51:05.771 --> 01:51:09.730
before he was too old to do it with this tag. And we had four generations there.

2081
01:51:09.731 --> 01:51:14.200
Joe was great. We had Mike, his son, his grandson, and his great grandson.

2082
01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:17.950
Oh wow. And I just have never seen that. And then I'm helping, you know,

2083
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:21.580
guide him with the ranch owner and what we thought was the bull.

2084
01:51:21.730 --> 01:51:23.080
We've been watching for months, you know,

2085
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.590
in all our scouting was gonna be a fairly, you know, not a super difficult hunt.

2086
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:29.890
It turned out to be an all day affair. Of course, typical hunt, right?

2087
01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:32.560
Murphy's law kicked in, he was high and on another part of the ranch,

2088
01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.490
end of the day he gets this bull and it's just this magnificent feeling.

2089
01:51:36.491 --> 01:51:37.540
You know, he had worked hard,

2090
01:51:37.541 --> 01:51:40.750
he had paid it forward and in the whole hunting world through Hunter education

2091
01:51:40.751 --> 01:51:45.070
and we did an article and photos where we saw four generations with this

2092
01:51:45.071 --> 01:51:48.340
beautiful Tulio elk in our, in our a Hunter education magazine.

2093
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.280
And I have that picture, you know, to this day I just look at it and go, man,

2094
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:53.350
this is what it's about. This is awesome.

2095
01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:58.760
Then the following year we got a that same tag and the 17 year old daughter of a

2096
01:51:59.091 --> 01:52:02.770
San Jose police detective friend of mine drew it and she had been hunting with

2097
01:52:02.771 --> 01:52:06.670
her dad, deer antelope doing her thing. You learn in a hand load like,

2098
01:52:06.671 --> 01:52:09.430
like dad taught her doing it all and she had never shot an elk yet.

2099
01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:13.000
And so we did the same thing. I took her and her dad and you know,

2100
01:52:13.001 --> 01:52:16.630
we had a impact on one of my buddies from the Santa Clara met team Hunter.

2101
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:20.050
You'll read about him in book two. He's a big Hunter as well in an elk guy.

2102
01:52:20.051 --> 01:52:21.490
So you know, he was in that circle.

2103
01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:25.210
So we all did it as a big kind of family affair. Same things year before,

2104
01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.160
what should have been a fairly, you know,

2105
01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:30.010
a couple hour hunt turned out to be an all day affair. And uh,

2106
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:33.010
we ended up getting her a nice, nice five by six bull at the end of the evening.

2107
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:37.340
And he was excellent, you know. Oh, it's the best ever. People don't know.

2108
01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:43.480
We're lucky. It's not commercially available folks. Lean healthy best.

2109
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:46.070
Yeah. Delicious. Yeah. But, but seeing people like

2110
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.450
<v 0>that, you know, harvest an animal they never had access to, it's just amazing.</v>

2111
01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.640
Um, and then unfortunately that tag got,

2112
01:52:52.730 --> 01:52:56.270
got eliminated in our department and I've been pushing with our wildlife

2113
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:58.470
management side to bring that tag back, man. Get,

2114
01:52:58.471 --> 01:53:01.610
give people a chance show that we can still do some cool hunting of a

2115
01:53:01.611 --> 01:53:05.870
magnificent, you know, elk species here in California cause it's here.

2116
01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:08.540
They're just cool. Yeah. Um, I mean,

2117
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:12.950
hunting in California is so unusual to begin with, right?

2118
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:17.000
Because we have these big population centers like San Francisco and Los Angeles

2119
01:53:17.001 --> 01:53:18.770
and most people don't hunt. There's less than,

2120
01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:21.930
I think it's below 1% now for the entire state.

2121
01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.140
We're becoming a nonconsumptive state when it comes to conservation.

2122
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:28.250
Um,

2123
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:33.250
to the point where our agency is having to deal with more input and impacts from

2124
01:53:34.191 --> 01:53:38.570
non consumptive users of the outdoors. And that's sad to see. You know,

2125
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.870
it's one of the reasons why I love California and I'm here all the time doing

2126
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:45.470
business, but I'm a Montana resident now, you know, the, the wide open spaces,

2127
01:53:45.471 --> 01:53:48.230
the mindset, gorgeous up there, the conservation, you know,

2128
01:53:48.231 --> 01:53:50.680
kind of mindset and no ding here. It's just, it's a different,

2129
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:54.350
it's a different vibe, you know? And that's, well, it's a Hunter friendly.

2130
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.440
Exactly.

2131
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.220
Very much Hunter encouraged because you're kind of the oddball if you're,

2132
01:53:58.221 --> 01:54:01.110
if you're right, well it's people, it's part of the tradition.

2133
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.660
It's people's way of life up there for so long that it's not unusual.

2134
01:54:05.661 --> 01:54:08.690
And then the population numbers are low and there's so much rural area,

2135
01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:11.000
it just becomes, and you know, you could,

2136
01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:15.710
I mean I was there just two summers ago with my family and we spotted a hundred

2137
01:54:15.711 --> 01:54:19.460
herd, a hundred strong herd of elk. That's magnificent. Hold over.

2138
01:54:19.461 --> 01:54:21.020
Luckily I had vine, I was in the car,

2139
01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:23.870
I had the kids looking out the window there was screaming and freaking out.

2140
01:54:23.871 --> 01:54:26.330
They couldn't believe it. Cause if you never seen, you know,

2141
01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:30.170
we see a deer occasionally in California, our neighborhood, we'll see deer,

2142
01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:34.010
but see a hundred [inaudible] see a hundred in that country and just gorgeous

2143
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:37.790
green grass and these animals just hanging out there and you know,

2144
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:40.760
it was in the summer. So none of them even have their antlers are just chilling.

2145
01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.620
It's incredible. Pretty wild. It's incredible.

2146
01:54:42.621 --> 01:54:44.510
And it's funny you mentioned your kids, cause I,

2147
01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.820
I see it with the nieces and nephews, you know, and all the,

2148
01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.590
all the youth I educate in Hunter ed and just to see that go to grizzly Island

2149
01:54:51.591 --> 01:54:54.380
and see a Tulio elk for the first time or anything, they're just like,

2150
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:58.470
what is that? Yeah. I don't know what that animal is. Giant deer deer.

2151
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:01.970
Did I see that in a, some animation Pixar movie? Is that real? Well,

2152
01:55:01.971 --> 01:55:05.020
when you see when in real life, when you see when scream. That's, that's,

2153
01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.120
that was to me, I was on man the first time I went elk hunting,

2154
01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:11.510
my friend cam Hanes took me to Colorado and that thing was screaming.

2155
01:55:11.511 --> 01:55:15.870
It was just, we were pretty close. I mean it was like within 15, 20 yards.

2156
01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.310
Like that is insane that that animal can make that noise.

2157
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:23.330
I just got a bugle at for contact us and it's felt as breath. That's, yeah.

2158
01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:26.630
It doesn't get any better than that, but it's just such a magnificent creature.

2159
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.553
Yeah. Um,

2160
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:32.460
what kind of an impact has your book and your books, uh,

2161
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:34.550
have the, has it had, um,

2162
01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:39.580
on policy and people recognize it that this is a big issue and of,

2163
01:55:40.011 --> 01:55:44.190
of hopefully change, you know, it's, it's been, um,

2164
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.270
<v 1>we were, we were, you know, hopeful that we'd hit get a big reach,</v>

2165
01:55:48.271 --> 01:55:50.190
especially with book two and being retired.

2166
01:55:50.191 --> 01:55:52.890
I can speak a little more freely and, you know, go more national. I mean,

2167
01:55:52.891 --> 01:55:54.300
obviously when I was working agency,

2168
01:55:54.301 --> 01:55:56.760
you gotta be careful what you say and everything's are very,

2169
01:55:56.790 --> 01:56:01.530
very stringently looked at. Um, but it, but it's been really good,

2170
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:05.490
um, because it hasn't just played to, you know,

2171
01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:08.940
the audience I normally work with conservation and tactics and law enforcement

2172
01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.610
and hunters and outdoors men and women. It's,

2173
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:14.940
the cannabis community is really behind this book. I mean, they're promoting it,

2174
01:56:14.941 --> 01:56:18.600
you know, they're, uh, you know, should flash it on their Instagram page.

2175
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:22.260
I mean, the Northern California growers actually look at the met team.

2176
01:56:22.261 --> 01:56:25.010
They had a term that, that a couple of grower, um,

2177
01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:28.590
colleagues kind of coined about two years ago and they said,

2178
01:56:28.591 --> 01:56:33.200
you guys are earth warriors. This is amazing. I like it. And I went, Oh man.

2179
01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:33.541
And you know,

2180
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:36.630
a special ops law enforcement team called earth warriors in California.

2181
01:56:36.631 --> 01:56:41.040
And I went, it's accurate. That's bad ass. It's very accurate. And, and it,

2182
01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:44.970
it just shows you that, you know, you're, you're not this rigid,

2183
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.130
tactically oriented stereotypical cop. Right. You know,

2184
01:56:50.131 --> 01:56:50.890
we're out here for,

2185
01:56:50.890 --> 01:56:54.150
while I've waterways and in something that I'm doing with hidden war,

2186
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:57.270
especially in book two is I look at it as three-prong, you know,

2187
01:56:57.271 --> 01:57:00.330
first thing I got to do is protect everybody. I can, you know, um,

2188
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:04.470
and I can do a lot more by talking and being on venues with you on stuff like

2189
01:57:04.471 --> 01:57:08.070
this. Then I can push in a rifle anymore or, or pushing the team,

2190
01:57:08.071 --> 01:57:12.150
I can do more for the team or for the agency by outreach that they can't

2191
01:57:12.151 --> 01:57:14.910
necessarily do. So that's, that's a blessing and that's awesome.

2192
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.630
And then the first, besides protecting, I wanna inform, you know,

2193
01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:20.370
I want to be able to tell this story. I mean,

2194
01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:23.190
I've been doing this for 10 plus years. I never get tired of it.

2195
01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:25.830
I do a presentation where you and I talk about it. I get the chills,

2196
01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:26.581
I get fired up.

2197
01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:30.040
I feel it doesn't matter who I'm talking to you I could talk to 10 people or you

2198
01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:34.020
know, have been in groups of thousands. It's the same. I get fired up. I can't,

2199
01:57:34.021 --> 01:57:37.260
I'm unlucky to be able to tell the message. Um, given what we've learned,

2200
01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.850
I feel like it has, it has an impact. Uh, so, so yeah, we are,

2201
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:45.930
we are getting the reach out there much further quicker right now.

2202
01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:50.820
Has it changed policy? Maybe? You know, it's a little too early to tell.

2203
01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.480
I think it's going to have some effect from the standpoint of when we start to

2204
01:57:54.481 --> 01:57:59.481
see the nonconsumptive users as enraged from on the issue as well,

2205
01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:03.990
you know, equal to or you know,

2206
01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:07.140
mimicking what you and I as conservationists or you know,

2207
01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:09.030
people that that are consumptive users.

2208
01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:12.780
That's the third part of my approach is protect, form and then unify.

2209
01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:16.500
I think we need a documentary. We got something like that coming up.

2210
01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:19.200
Do you really? We got something like that coming up and I, and I can,

2211
01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.440
that's like that. That changes things for people. Positive or negative,

2212
01:58:22.441 --> 01:58:23.640
even when they're an inaccurate,

2213
01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:28.920
you hear all sorts of rumblings about things after a good influential

2214
01:58:28.921 --> 01:58:31.430
documentary comes out. We're actually, um,

2215
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:36.470
it's cool you brought that up because I'm co-producing with a very good

2216
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:39.720
independent filmmaker named Lou Doris, a film called altered state.

2217
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:44.650
And this one's been in the works for about a year and it's, uh,

2218
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:47.740
it's actually gonna be going to be network and distributed through a new,

2219
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:50.270
it's called planet cannabis entertainment network. And they're a,

2220
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.380
they're a new channel planet cannabis entertainment network.

2221
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:56.770
They got 40 million viewers. They're doing main content like other channels are,

2222
01:58:56.771 --> 01:58:58.690
but they're also doing some, you know,

2223
01:58:58.691 --> 01:59:02.470
some funded independent projects and this is one of them. And the nice thing is,

2224
01:59:02.471 --> 01:59:06.220
the reason we're agreeing to do it with them is there's no content control,

2225
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:10.030
you know, issues. We're going to get to tell an objective story, not biased.

2226
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:11.230
We're going to tell, you know,

2227
01:59:11.231 --> 01:59:14.200
we're going to be embedded with legitimate growers that we've worked effectively

2228
01:59:14.201 --> 01:59:17.920
with all on the environmental issue. What are the environmental impacts?

2229
01:59:17.921 --> 01:59:19.990
What's working, what's not working with regulation?

2230
01:59:19.991 --> 01:59:22.030
Now what do we need to do to regulation to fix it?

2231
01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:25.270
We're embedded with law enforcement teams again doing the work, you know,

2232
01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:27.830
I've done with the team and telling their story and um,

2233
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:30.460
we're in production currently, so this is,

2234
01:59:30.490 --> 01:59:33.280
this is going to be a cool process and I'm going to be involved and on the

2235
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:34.210
ground and you know,

2236
01:59:34.211 --> 01:59:37.540
working with Lou to narrate it and interview folks and I'll be back in the

2237
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:38.231
field, you know,

2238
01:59:38.231 --> 01:59:40.420
all throughout the state for the next couple of months and beyond.

2239
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:44.480
That's awesome. Well, John, let me know when that comes out and sure.

2240
01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:45.730
Willing to let people know,

2241
01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.460
please do on my Instagram and Twitter and all that jazz. That'd be awesome.

2242
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:51.400
Thanks Joe. And thank you. Thank you for everything that you've done, man.

2243
01:59:51.401 --> 01:59:52.840
I mean it's, it's, it's amazing.

2244
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:57.610
And thank you for sharing this story too because if I had not listened to that

2245
01:59:57.611 --> 01:59:59.980
Steve Rinella show, I would have no idea. Yes.

2246
02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:03.400
I had to only heard my friend talk about that one grow up that they found,

2247
02:00:03.401 --> 02:00:06.850
but there was no one there and I would never have known there's gunfights and

2248
02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:09.340
all this crazy shit that you guys are dealing with. Yeah,

2249
02:00:09.730 --> 02:00:13.010
Stephen was great because he, he thought you'd like, like the story too. And,

2250
02:00:13.011 --> 02:00:16.930
and I, I love your show and I got to give a, I like how a killer,

2251
02:00:16.931 --> 02:00:20.380
Mike gave a couple shout outs on a previous show. So if you'll indulge me,

2252
02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:21.760
I'll give a couple shout outs here in a minute.

2253
02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:25.930
But one of the things that I always liked was how you approached this whole

2254
02:00:25.931 --> 02:00:27.880
issue, you know, and how you came into it.

2255
02:00:27.881 --> 02:00:29.710
Not being a Hunter early on in your life,

2256
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:33.760
all life and you come into it fairly later in life, but just connected,

2257
02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:34.810
you know, and,

2258
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:39.040
and coming from such a broad demographic of listeners that are sometimes out of

2259
02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:40.660
out of my world previously.

2260
02:00:40.661 --> 02:00:44.530
So thank you for your doing and this will be really cool because the guys

2261
02:00:44.531 --> 02:00:47.710
immediate or saw it too and, and they, and they, uh, you know, to,

2262
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:50.410
to be able to connect here with you is really cool. And Hey,

2263
02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:53.950
the more we can do the message of better, right? Yes, for sure. My pleasure. So,

2264
02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:57.250
um, please one more time. List the books, tell people where they can get 'em.

2265
02:00:58.630 --> 02:00:58.631
Um,

2266
02:00:58.631 --> 02:01:02.440
you can get both books had more as a new one or in the woods as the first one on

2273

If people want to email me directly and they want a signed copy of the book or

2274
02:01:25.121 --> 02:01:28.170
they have questions and since mediate or another podcast,

2275
02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.690
I get so many people wanting to be game wardens now coming out of the military,

2276
02:01:31.691 --> 02:01:35.410
little kids growing up. And I've been nonstop on that since, since Steve show.

2277
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:38.650
That's amazing. So we're, we're, we're getting more people out there, but um,

2278
02:01:38.651 --> 02:01:40.010
for a quick, you guys more money.

2279
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.340
<v 0>We're working on it, man. Yeah. Hopefully someone's listening to this. Yeah.</v>

2280
02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:46.640
Thanks for the sentiment. But, uh, I gotta give a shout out to, uh,

2281
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.150
Blake B and Brian and Blake's here in the green room with me now and I got to

2282
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:53.990
give them credit for, uh, tuning me into your podcast. They're big friends,

2283
02:01:53.991 --> 02:01:57.040
so thank you guys. And I'm also doing a, a,

2284
02:01:57.041 --> 02:02:01.010
I'm doing a cool custom knife with a Mike Bella camp at a V knives and we're

2285
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:04.160
making the trailblazer custom folder. It's like the dream knife Joe,

2286
02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:08.360
that I never had 30 years on ops, but it's an everyday carry. So, um,

2287
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:13.010
some stuff there. And, uh, being an elk Hunter, you'll appreciate this. Um,

2288
02:02:13.011 --> 02:02:15.560
I'm doing some pretty cool stuff with axial precision rifles.

2289
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.170
There are long range rifle company in Idaho. They're just amazing.

2290
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.393
And my partner,

2291
02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:22.820
Terry Hewitt and I are running that new 300 PRC for everything from long

2292
02:02:22.821 --> 02:02:27.050
distance from our tactical experience target shooting, but also a good hilt gun.

2293
02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:30.770
And that's, that's gonna kind of become my, uh, my new elk platform. So cool.

2294
02:02:30.771 --> 02:02:33.190
So this is all connected to, you know,

2295
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:35.870
because of this your effort that you put out all this,

2296
02:02:35.871 --> 02:02:39.290
all these pieces are falling into place. Yeah. And these and these groups are,

2297
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:41.270
um, it's not only about good product, you know,

2298
02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:44.960
but it's about them sending the same message and they are endorsing the book.

2299
02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:47.900
They're getting that message out. And a lot of these groups that are,

2300
02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:50.690
that are product sponsor or anything didn't know it. Most people didn't.

2301
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:52.790
So that's, that's one of the really, really cool things.

2302
02:02:52.791 --> 02:02:55.880
And my publisher caribou publishing, and this is interesting, you'll,

2303
02:02:55.881 --> 02:02:57.770
I think you'll appreciate how this kind of comes together,

2304
02:02:57.771 --> 02:03:02.510
but Henry Wu and my friends over at a recoil magazine and gun digest and caribou

2305
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:03.860
and blade showing blade magazine,

2306
02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:08.600
they're all the same entity and this book with caribou publishing was a step

2307
02:03:08.601 --> 02:03:09.434
out,

2308
02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.000
an expansion book of national issues related to things they hold dear coming

2309
02:03:14.001 --> 02:03:18.440
from a gun publication, you know, and written objectively not against cannabis.

2310
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:22.040
So it was really a, you know, it didn't seem like the right fit,

2311
02:03:22.570 --> 02:03:25.280
you know when you look at it from the outside, but it was perfect. You know,

2312
02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.590
everybody wants the same objective, right?

2313
02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:32.210
They want safety and for sure anybody who cares and loves about loves wildlife

2314
02:03:32.211 --> 02:03:35.840
and these wild lands, they don't want this to continue.

2315
02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:38.840
They want this to be cleaned up and we've got to find a solution.

2316
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:42.020
We do without you guys, without boots on the ground,

2317
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:46.400
there is no solution. None at all, none at all. And like I said,

2318
02:03:46.401 --> 02:03:49.400
we keep unifying and we hope to just get more message out there and we'll get

2319
02:03:49.401 --> 02:03:53.960
some changes all day. At a time, buddy. Thank you, brother. Thank you so much.

2320
02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:55.660
Really appreciate it, buddy.
