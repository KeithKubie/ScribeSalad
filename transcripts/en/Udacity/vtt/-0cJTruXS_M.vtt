The challenges with big data are not

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.080
just about its size. What additional problems can

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.050
you see with data? Could it be that most data is inherently worthless and it's

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.900
hard to find the useful bits? Could the fact that data is created fast be

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.420
a challenge? Could there be difficulty because

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.690
data's coming from different sources in various formats?
