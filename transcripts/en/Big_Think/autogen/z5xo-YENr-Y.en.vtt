mean it's true in the sense that the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700
mean it's true in the sense that the
 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.060
mean it's true in the sense that the
hippocampus is necessary to have a

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070
hippocampus is necessary to have a
 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.220
hippocampus is necessary to have a
conscious recollection of some past

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230
conscious recollection of some past
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.890

event and the amygdala participates in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900
event and the amygdala participates in
 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.359
event and the amygdala participates in
unconscious memory but we shouldn't

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369
unconscious memory but we shouldn't
 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.310
unconscious memory but we shouldn't
really taint it with the Freudian

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320
really taint it with the Freudian
 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.530
really taint it with the Freudian
concepts because that adds a lot of

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540
concepts because that adds a lot of
 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.430
concepts because that adds a lot of
baggage the amygdala is is an

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440
baggage the amygdala is is an
 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.110
baggage the amygdala is is an
unconscious processor because it's just

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120
unconscious processor because it's just
 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.760
unconscious processor because it's just
not connected with the conscious system

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770
not connected with the conscious system
 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.350
not connected with the conscious system
it's kind of like you know by default

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360
it's kind of like you know by default
 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.229
it's kind of like you know by default
unconscious as opposed to being in the

unconscious as opposed to being in the
 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.169
unconscious as opposed to being in the
14 sense of unconscious something that

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179
14 sense of unconscious something that
 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.489
14 sense of unconscious something that
was conscious but was to

the unconscious the amygdala gets direct
 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.090
the unconscious the amygdala gets direct
sensory information and it learns and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100
sensory information and it learns and
 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.509
sensory information and it learns and
stores information on its own and that

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519
stores information on its own and that
 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.489
stores information on its own and that
information that's stored then controls

emotional responses the connectivity is
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.689
emotional responses the connectivity is
hardwired so one way to think about it

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699
hardwired so one way to think about it

is that a rat will respond to a cat

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429
is that a rat will respond to a cat
 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.990
is that a rat will respond to a cat
without any learning by freezing raising

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000
without any learning by freezing raising
 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.310

hormones but it was also it will also
 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.510
hormones but it was also it will also
respond to a stimulus associated with

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520
respond to a stimulus associated with
 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.749
respond to a stimulus associated with
the cat and have the same responses so

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759
the cat and have the same responses so
 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.279
the cat and have the same responses so
you don't learn how to be afraid you

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289
you don't learn how to be afraid you
 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.139
you don't learn how to be afraid you
don't your mig doula doesn't have to

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
don't your mig doula doesn't have to
 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.350
don't your mig doula doesn't have to
learn what to do it learns what to do it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360
learn what to do it learns what to do it
 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.630
learn what to do it learns what to do it
in response to so it learns what stimuli

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
in response to so it learns what stimuli
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.850
in response to so it learns what stimuli
it should respond to so it's learning

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860
it should respond to so it's learning
 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.580
it should respond to so it's learning
and memory in that sense that we call an

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590
and memory in that sense that we call an
 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.950
and memory in that sense that we call an
implicit kind of memory where you don't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960
implicit kind of memory where you don't
 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.569
implicit kind of memory where you don't
have to have any conscious involvement

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579
have to have any conscious involvement
 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.170
have to have any conscious involvement
whereas the hippocampus is necessary to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180
whereas the hippocampus is necessary to
 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.139
whereas the hippocampus is necessary to
have a conscious memory so yes there

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
have a conscious memory so yes there
 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.209
have a conscious memory so yes there
they do participate in conscious and

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219
they do participate in conscious and
 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.800
they do participate in conscious and
unconscious memories but not in the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810
unconscious memories but not in the
 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.870
unconscious memories but not in the
Freudian sense but there's a whole other

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880
Freudian sense but there's a whole other
 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.669
Freudian sense but there's a whole other
side of the amygdalas role in memory

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679
side of the amygdalas role in memory
 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.550
side of the amygdalas role in memory
which is that when the amygdala is

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
which is that when the amygdala is
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.800
which is that when the amygdala is
activated and all those hormones and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
activated and all those hormones and
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.209
activated and all those hormones and
other things happen they get released

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219
other things happen they get released
 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.340
other things happen they get released
that provides information that feeds

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350
that provides information that feeds
 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.810
that provides information that feeds
back to parts of the brain like the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820
back to parts of the brain like the
 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.899
back to parts of the brain like the
hippocampus and allows them to store

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909
hippocampus and allows them to store
 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.529
hippocampus and allows them to store
their their memories in a much more

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539
their their memories in a much more
 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.729
their their memories in a much more
efficient and strong way so we know that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
efficient and strong way so we know that
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830
efficient and strong way so we know that
emotional memories are stored more

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
emotional memories are stored more
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690
emotional memories are stored more
vividly

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
vividly
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.510
vividly
than other kinds of memories it used to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
than other kinds of memories it used to
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.009
than other kinds of memories it used to
be thought that they were they're more

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019
be thought that they were they're more
 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.680
be thought that they were they're more
accurate but in fact now we know they're

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
accurate but in fact now we know they're
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.449
accurate but in fact now we know they're
not more accurate that this sort of more

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
not more accurate that this sort of more
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.580
not more accurate that this sort of more
vivid and strong in the personal sense

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
vivid and strong in the personal sense
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.790
vivid and strong in the personal sense
but they can be highly inaccurate this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800
but they can be highly inaccurate this
 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.880
but they can be highly inaccurate this
is this is shown by studies of natural

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
is this is shown by studies of natural
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.830
is this is shown by studies of natural
disasters and so forth well not always

disasters and so forth well not always
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900
disasters and so forth well not always
so natural but like the space challenge

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
so natural but like the space challenge
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.000

space shuttle Challenger explosion a lot
of people witnessed that and the they

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
of people witnessed that and the they
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.960
of people witnessed that and the they
were studied and almost immediately by

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
were studied and almost immediately by
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.870
were studied and almost immediately by
psychologists who made notes of exactly

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
psychologists who made notes of exactly
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.819
psychologists who made notes of exactly
what their response is you know what

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829
what their response is you know what
 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.220
what their response is you know what
they were what what they were

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
they were what what they were
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.900
they were what what they were
experiencing at the time and then a year

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
experiencing at the time and then a year
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.059
experiencing at the time and then a year
later they were surveyed again and the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069
later they were surveyed again and the
 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.680
later they were surveyed again and the
responses were completely different from

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
responses were completely different from
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.420
responses were completely different from
what they remembered originally and then

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430
what they remembered originally and then
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.530
what they remembered originally and then
several years later it completely

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
several years later it completely
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.550
several years later it completely
changed again so what we remember is not

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
changed again so what we remember is not
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.589
changed again so what we remember is not
necessarily what we experienced

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599
necessarily what we experienced
 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.589
necessarily what we experienced
originally so that the accuracy of those

originally so that the accuracy of those
 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.530
originally so that the accuracy of those
memories changes over time but their
