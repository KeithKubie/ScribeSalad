KARISHMA SHAH:
Hello, hello, hello.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.840
Welcome.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.890
Truly, welcome.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.590
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.570
You just saw the video
from last year's summit.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.540
And I can feel the energy
in this room already.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.230
It's going to be
equally amazing.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.830
Let's connect,
create, collaborate,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.740
and celebrate today.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.750
If you can't already tell, I'm
excited to be here with you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
and honored to support Women
Techmakers, a group that I hold

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.480
very near and dear to my heart.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.730
And I'll tell you
why in just a bit.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.810
Women Techmakers'
global vision is

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.950
to provide visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.670
for women in technology.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.870
This is our third year hosting
our global event series

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.170
in celebration of
International Women's Day.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.280
And this year I'm
personally looking forward

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.910
to the women in this
room exchanging stories

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.850
and inspiring each other.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.900
I was the first female
on Project Wing,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.100
X's drone delivery project.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.300
One book that's
inspired me to embrace

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.860
such roles as a woman on teams
was written by Elle Luna.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.879
And it's called "The
Crossroads of Should and Must."

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.960
What really resonated with me
was her stance that changing

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.590
our internal dialogue to
instill that we must be here,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.870
rather than saying or
questioning whether we should

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.190
be here, has profound effects.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.760
So today I'd like to say not
only should you all be here,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.690
but the technology
industry needs

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.700
the insights, perspectives,
and ideas of females.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.120
And you all must be here.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.720
To quote Elle,
"must is who we are.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.920
It's our super powers--
our truest, deepest,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.770
most unique gifts deep
within us that we're allowing

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.770
to come forth and shine."

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.580
Must versus should
fosters the kind of work

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.400
that will put ripples
through the universe.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.160
And I know the women inside
and outside of this room

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.210
are going to make waves in
the technology industry.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.340
I truly believe that
diversity of thought

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.572
is the number-one
driver of innovation.

00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:58.030
If we're going to solve the
challenges that face our world,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.300
we need the cross
pollination of everyone's

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.340
curiosity, creativity,
and energy in the mix.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.030
So today, let's honor who we
are and why we must be here.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.400
I hope you'll be inspired
by the lineup of speakers,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.140
organizations,
instructors, and workshops

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.970
put together by the fabulous
Women Techmakers team.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.960
And before we kick off,
let's take a moment

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.220
to give it up for Women
Techmakers and women

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.860
in technology.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.430
So Google is a place
where differences

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.880
are valued and encouraged.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.780
I've experienced
this first hand.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.740
A diversity of
perspectives and ideas

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.510
whether by gender, race, sexual
orientation, neurodiversity

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.700
or a combination of them all
lead to better decision making,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.220
more creativity, better
products, and a greater value

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.080
to the workplace
and our culture.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.250
We want to help the entire
tech industry become

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.320
more inclusive from
inspiring young students

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.440
to pursue computer
science degrees

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.910
to getting more minority-owned
small businesses online.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.650
We want to create
an industry where

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.150
people can pursue their dreams,
build impactful technology,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.550
and become leaders.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.180
Woman Techmakers is
Google's global program

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.580
for women in technology.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630
It was kicked off in 2012 by the
current CTO of the White House

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.800
and then VP of X Megan Smith.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.500
I'm going to take a
bit of time to talk

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.380
about Megan because it's
rare that I get this chance.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.010
You know, I started out
as an intern in 2011

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.210
working for Megan.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.260
And she's been my personal
sponsor, role model, and friend

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.280
since.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.120
Without having crossed
paths with her,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.270
I probably would
not be here today.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.110
What I respect and
admire most about her

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.120
is she's a true believer that
no one is inferior or superior

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.140
to anyone.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.080
She's instilled the
belief in me that ideas

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.360
can come from anywhere.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.820
And when you find your
passion, you're unstoppable.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.480
You can make amazing
things happen.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.890
She believed in me, and
I'm eternally thankful.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.950
And she believed in my very
dear friend, Natalie Villalobos.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.080
Megan and I were interviewing
Natalie, actually,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.480
about two and 1/2 years ago for
another role here at Google.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.010
And, of course, Natalie
was my top choice.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.130
And to my surprise and
disappointment at the time,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.070
Megan came to me one day and
said, we're not hiring Natalie.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.240
I have another plan for her.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.450
And I said, come again?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.550
Natalie and I led the 10x
Thinking team here at Google.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.730
And fast forward,
here we are today.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.960
Woman Techmakers is now led
globally by Natalie Villalobos.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.310
She's my go-to person when
I need someone to "yes,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.320
and" my ridiculous ideas.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.040
And it's been amazing seeing
the evolution of her vision

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.360
from a concept we were
sketching on napkins

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.881
to the global scale
it's at today.

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:38.630
If you haven't met
her, I know she's going

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.797
to kill me for saying this.

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:41.630
But she's around, and
you ought to meet her.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.790
She's a gem.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.530
She and her global
team of Googlers

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.550
are passionate about
empowering women in technology

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.930
through increased visibility,
community, and resources.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.560
At all of our events
this year, we're

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.470
celebrating the
theme of Our Time

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.970
to Lead, which was
created by the Anita Borg

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.630
Institute for last year's
Grace Hopper Conference.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.170
By a show of hands, who was
at Grace Hopper last year?

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.950
OK, a good amount.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.720
We've got to get
more of you there.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.590
Together with the
Anita Borg Institute,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.270
we're able to
increase the momentum

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.080
of this incredible movement.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.070
Today, our goal is
to showcase women

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.020
at all phases of their
career as well as

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.610
organizations that are making
positive change in the tech

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.200
industry.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.250
It's not just about Google.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.080
A lot of times when we think
about diversity in technology,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.060
we only think about
the United States.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.710
But look at this map.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.340
Women across the world
are coming together

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.670
to increase the visibility,
community, and resources

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.160
to enable more women
in the industry.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.170
That's why across
March and April,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.420
Women Techmakers will be
hosting 14 global summits

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.850
and over 100 community meet ups.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.400
We believe in
supporting communities

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.940
wherever they are globally.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.840
Our first summit
in Lagos, Nigeria

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.070
is actually happening
on March 19.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.490
And today there are three
summits taking place

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.490
as we speak in Seattle, New
York, and, of course, here.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.980
It's encouraging and empowering
to see so many women here

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.480
today.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.220
Now, there are
hundreds of Googlers

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.830
helping out across all of our
summits and meet ups this year.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.090
And a lot of times these folks
rarely receive a thank you.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.910
And it's held till the
end, if it ever is done.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.800
This year, let's
thank them first.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.710
Their countless
hours and late nights

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.644
are what make days
like this possible.

00:06:20.644 --> 00:06:22.060
Can the volunteers
please stand up

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.601
so we can give you
round of applause?

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.926
If you ever need something
throughout today,

00:06:37.926 --> 00:06:39.800
find one of them in a
Woman Techmakers shirt,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.870
and they'll be sure to help you.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.210
Today, we have an exciting
agenda in store for you.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.530
I'm confident that, by
hearing the amazing talks

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.170
from our speakers today and
by informally networking

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.270
with each other, you will
end the day even more

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.960
ready to face challenges
and celebrate your triumphs.
