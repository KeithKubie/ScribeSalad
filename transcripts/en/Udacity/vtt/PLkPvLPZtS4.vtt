Hi there.
My name's Layla and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.450
I'm a course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.410
Today, I'm going to be taking you
through how to install Android studio.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.380
If you want to know
what Android studio is,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.374
it's our development environment of
choice for creating Android apps.

00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:16.760
And we pick Android studio because
once you've got everything set up and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.390
your phone or

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.360
emulators connected, you can make a
hello world app in a matter of minutes.
