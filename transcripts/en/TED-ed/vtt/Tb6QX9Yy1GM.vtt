00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:10.090
If you ask people whether 
they think stealing is wrong,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.333
most of them would answer, "Yes."

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.638
And yet, in 2013, organizations
all over the world

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:22.158
lost an estimated total
of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud,

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:24.128
which includes crimes like embezzlement,

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:26.310
pyramid schemes,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.623
and false insurance claims.

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:31.348
This wasn't just the work
of a few bad apples.

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:33.601
The truth is that many people
are susceptible

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.388
not only to the temptation 
to commit fraud

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:40.826
but to convincing themselves
that they've done nothing wrong.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:42.853
So why does fraud happen?

00:00:42.853 --> 00:00:46.000
While individual motivations 
may differ from case to case,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.832
the fraud triangle,

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.071
a model developed
by criminologist Donald Cressey,

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.091
shows three conditions 
that make fraud likely:

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:58.236
pressure, opportunity,
and rationalization.

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:02.603
Pressure is often what motivates someone
to engage in fraud to begin with.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:04.017
It could be a personal debt,

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:05.389
an addiction,

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:06.643
an earnings quota,

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:08.119
a sudden job loss,

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.087
or an illness in the family.

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:14.256
As for opportunity, many people
in both public and private sectors

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:19.205
have access to tools that enable them
to commit and conceal fraud:

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:20.745
corporate credit cards,

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:22.580
internal company data,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.753
or control over the budget.

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:26.140
The combination of pressure

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.697
and being exposed to such opportunities
on a daily basis

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:32.399
can create a strong temptation.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.386
But even with these two elements,

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:38.238
most fraud still requires rationalization.

00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:40.868
Many fraudsters are first time offenders,

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.108
so in order to commit an act
most would regard as wrong,

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:46.524
they need to justify it to themselves.

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:51.432
Some feel entitled to the money
because they are underpaid and overworked

00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:54.098
and others believe 
their fraud is victimless,

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:58.491
perhaps even planning to return
the money once their crisis is resolved.

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:00.670
Some of the most common types of fraud

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.840
don't even register as such
to the perpetrator.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.112
Examples include employees
fudging time sheets or expense reports,

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:11.197
taxpayers failing to report cash earnings,

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:15.054
or service providers overbilling
insurance companies.

00:02:15.054 --> 00:02:17.073
Though these may seem small,

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:19.712
and can sometimes
only involve hundreds of dollars,

00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:22.628
they all contribute to the big picture.

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:25.748
And then there's fraud on a massive scale.

00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:31.461
In 2003, Italian dairy food giant 
Parmalat went bankrupt

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:37.140
after it was found to have fabricated
a 4 billion dollar bank account

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.031
and falsified financial statements

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.988
to hide the fact that its subsidiaries
had been losing money.

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:44.621
Because it was family controlled,

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:47.830
corporate governance 
and regulator supervision were difficult,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.392
and the company likely hoped 
that the losses could be recouped

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:53.933
before anyone found out.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:56.152
And it's not just corporate greed.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:03:00.002
Governments and non-profits
are also susceptible to fraud.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:03.576
During her time as City Comptroller
for Dixon, Illinois,

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:08.570
Rita Crundwell embezzled 
over 53 million dollars.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.075
Rita was one of the country's leading 
quarter horse breeders

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:15.450
and winner of 52 world championships.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.814
But the cost of maintaining the herd
ran to 200,000 dollars per month.

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:24.885
Because her position gave her complete
control over city finances,

00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:27.549
she was easily able to divert money

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.312
to an account she used 
for private expenses,

00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:33.910
and the scheme went 
unnoticed for 20 years.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.275
It is believed that Crundwell
felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:38.919
based on her position,

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.665
and the notoriety 
her winnings brought to the city.

00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.336
It's tempting to think of fraud
as a victimless crime

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:49.584
because corporations 
and civic institutions aren't people.

00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:53.114
But fraud harms real people
in virtually every case:

00:03:53.114 --> 00:03:56.025
the employees of Parmalat 
who lost their jobs,

00:03:56.025 --> 00:04:00.241
the citizens of Dixon whose taxes
subsidized horse breeding,

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:04.276
the customers of companies
which raise their prices to offset losses.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:07.166
Sometimes the effects are obvious
and devestating,

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:11.629
like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands
of people to lose their life savings.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.479
But often they're subtle
and not easy to untangle.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.333
Yet someone, 
somewhere is left holding the bill.
