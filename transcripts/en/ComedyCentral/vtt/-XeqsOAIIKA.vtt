00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.048
Hello.

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:07.841
My name is Hannah Dickinson
and this is “Cheers to you”.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.010
Where I'm kicking off my first
round of the weekend

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.511
by cheersing
to all the people

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.472
and stories
that encourage me to drink.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.057
Cheers to you Japanese Princess

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.893
for renouncing your royal status
to marry a commoner

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:21.355
but upholding the world
tradition of women dating down.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.568
Cheers to you 50 Cent
for buying 200 tickets

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.613
to Ja Rule's concert
so the front row will be empty.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:33.367
Or cheers to you Ja Rule
for finally selling 200 tickets.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:34.785
Really.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.245
Finally.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:37.704
Cheers to you Jenna Jameson

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.915
for breastfeeding your daughter
for 18 months.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.584
That's honestly nothing
compared to the 18 years

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.544
you breastfed your co-stars.

00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:48.465
Cheers to you Don McLean

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.801
for dating a woman
49 years younger than you.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.387
I can't imagine anything worse
than having sex

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.138
with a 74-year-old except ...

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.641
paying my own rent.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:59.643
Does anyone old watch
Comedy Central?

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.353
Speaking of old men,
cheers to you

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.939
Ben &amp; Jerry's for putting out
a flavor protesting

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.066
Trump called
Pecan Resist.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.026
Now that two more old white guys

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.154
are throwing their nuts around,
everything's fixed.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.741
Cheers to you Tomi Lahren
for defending

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.786
Meghan Kelly's heinous
blackface comments.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:20.122
But who will defend
your heinous bangs?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.250
It's not political,
it's aesthetic.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.376
They're terrible.

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.545
You went from a ten
to like a six.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.047
And you don't believe in
feminism, so I can say that.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.842
Cheers to you Lime for recalling
your electric scooters

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.510
in fear they'll catch fire.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.431
Makes sense because every time
I ride one, it's (bleep) lit.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.516
Be sure to check out
the rest of our show

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.477
Monday through Thursday,
Every Damn Day.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:43.478
Cheers.
