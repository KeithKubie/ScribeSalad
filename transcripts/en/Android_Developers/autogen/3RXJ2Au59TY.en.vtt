that particular developer scenario was

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110
that particular developer scenario was
 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.070
that particular developer scenario was
where a user uninstalled the application

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080
where a user uninstalled the application
 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.800
where a user uninstalled the application
and then reinstalled it so effectively

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810

kind of had to registration IDs and they

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320
kind of had to registration IDs and they
 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.170
kind of had to registration IDs and they
reported that they were actually getting

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180

messages twice one for each registration
 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.240
messages twice one for each registration
ID so it's important that when you

believe what should happen is that it
should send it to the server and then

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.210
should send it to the server and then
 

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.740
should send it to the server and then
when your server tries to then notify

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:27.750
when your server tries to then notify
 

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.890
when your server tries to then notify
the c2dm server i tries to pass the next

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:30.900

understanding with an async task you
shouldn't make any assumptions around

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:51.649
shouldn't make any assumptions around
 

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:54.730
shouldn't make any assumptions around
which thread the actual work of the

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:54.740
which thread the actual work of the
 

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.009
which thread the actual work of the
async task is running but there are a

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:57.019
async task is running but there are a
 

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.920
async task is running but there are a
few callbacks that are guaranteed or are

00:13:59.920 --> 00:13:59.930
few callbacks that are guaranteed or are
 

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.360
few callbacks that are guaranteed or are
supposed to be running in the UI thread

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.370
supposed to be running in the UI thread
 

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.629
supposed to be running in the UI thread
so things like on pre execute yeah on

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639
so things like on pre execute yeah on
 

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.999
so things like on pre execute yeah on
progress update on post execute an done

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:07.009
progress update on post execute an done
 

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:09.100
progress update on post execute an done
canceled I think that's only true though

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:09.110
canceled I think that's only true though
 

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.790
canceled I think that's only true though
if the async task itself is created on

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800
if the async task itself is created on
 

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.030
if the async task itself is created on
the main threat if you don't create the

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040
the main threat if you don't create the
 

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.999
the main threat if you don't create the
async task on the main thread those on

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:19.009
async task on the main thread those on
 

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:21.929
async task on the main thread those on
pre executing on post execute seem to be

00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:21.939
pre executing on post execute seem to be
 

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:24.790
pre executing on post execute seem to be
executed not on the UI thread but on the

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800
executed not on the UI thread but on the
 

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.829
executed not on the UI thread but on the
same thread that created it which is why

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839
same thread that created it which is why
 

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:28.929
same thread that created it which is why
I'm seeing this kind of strange behavior

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:28.939
I'm seeing this kind of strange behavior
 

00:14:28.939 --> 00:14:32.319
I'm seeing this kind of strange behavior
that if I launch the async task from a

00:14:32.319 --> 00:14:32.329
that if I launch the async task from a
 

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:34.929
that if I launch the async task from a
web view it doesn't run on the UI task

00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:34.939
web view it doesn't run on the UI task
 

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:36.699
web view it doesn't run on the UI task
it runs on the sort of web view task so

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:36.709
it runs on the sort of web view task so
 

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.220
it runs on the sort of web view task so
then in my post execute something that I

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.230
then in my post execute something that I
 

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.139
then in my post execute something that I
have to fill out lots of run on UI

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:41.149
have to fill out lots of run on UI
 

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:43.600
have to fill out lots of run on UI
thread things inside where normally I

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:43.610
thread things inside where normally I
 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.790
thread things inside where normally I
wouldn't have normally have to so that's

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800
wouldn't have normally have to so that's
 

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.410
wouldn't have normally have to so that's
interesting so you saying then when you

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:47.420
interesting so you saying then when you
 

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.730
interesting so you saying then when you
do the run on UI thread and it does

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:51.740
do the run on UI thread and it does
 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.470
do the run on UI thread and it does
actually execute on the run on you I

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480
actually execute on the run on you I
 

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.199
actually execute on the run on you I
yeah it works fine but if I don't put in

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:56.209
yeah it works fine but if I don't put in
 

00:14:56.209 --> 00:14:57.970
yeah it works fine but if I don't put in
my post execute if I don't wrap it in a

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:57.980
my post execute if I don't wrap it in a
 

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.600
my post execute if I don't wrap it in a
run on UI thread and then i get the

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.610
run on UI thread and then i get the
 

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.400
run on UI thread and then i get the

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:15.019
run on the UI thread it does mention it
 

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.329
run on the UI thread it does mention it
in the documentation that it should be

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:16.339
in the documentation that it should be
 

00:15:16.339 --> 00:15:18.790
in the documentation that it should be

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800
created on the UI thread all the time
 

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.280
created on the UI thread all the time
but I was just trying to work out which

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.290
but I was just trying to work out which
 

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.559
but I was just trying to work out which
thread was being used when it gets

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:23.569

called from the JavaScript interface yes

00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:25.939
called from the JavaScript interface yes
 

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:27.999
called from the JavaScript interface yes
according according to the documentation

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:28.009
according according to the documentation
 

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:29.319
according according to the documentation
there's a section called threading rules

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:29.329
there's a section called threading rules
 

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.920
there's a section called threading rules
yeah basically it does say that one

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:31.930
yeah basically it does say that one
 

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.810
yeah basically it does say that one
to create the task instance for your

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:33.820
to create the task instance for your
 

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.639
to create the task instance for your
async task in the UI on the UI thread

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:35.649
async task in the UI on the UI thread
 

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:38.430
async task in the UI on the UI thread
yeah and when you call execute on the

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440
yeah and when you call execute on the
 

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.350
yeah and when you call execute on the
async task you also need to do that on

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360
async task you also need to do that on
 

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:46.100
async task you also need to do that on
the UI thread so I again I wouldn't rely

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.110
the UI thread so I again I wouldn't rely
 

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.800
the UI thread so I again I wouldn't rely
necessarily on trying to make

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:49.810
necessarily on trying to make
 

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.079
necessarily on trying to make
assumptions around which thread that

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:52.089
assumptions around which thread that
 

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:54.630
assumptions around which thread that
async task will run on other than the

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:54.640
async task will run on other than the
 

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.280
async task will run on other than the
fact that in order to get it on the UI

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.290
fact that in order to get it on the UI
 

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.680
fact that in order to get it on the UI
thread you need to create the

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:58.690
thread you need to create the
 

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.440
thread you need to create the
instantiated and executed on the UI

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:01.450
instantiated and executed on the UI
 

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.530
instantiated and executed on the UI
thread other than that I i would say

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:04.540
thread other than that I i would say
 

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.030
thread other than that I i would say
because we haven't documented the

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040
because we haven't documented the
 

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.699
because we haven't documented the
behavior i I wouldn't rely on what

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:08.709
behavior i I wouldn't rely on what
 

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:09.870
behavior i I wouldn't rely on what
you're seeing now because that could

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880
you're seeing now because that could
 

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.000
you're seeing now because that could
change yeah I just wasn't too sure if it

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.010
change yeah I just wasn't too sure if it
 

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.150
change yeah I just wasn't too sure if it
was a bug in the version of Android I'm

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160
was a bug in the version of Android I'm
 

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.440
was a bug in the version of Android I'm
running against or whether it was

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:16.450

the JavaScript interface layer runs in

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:21.730
the JavaScript interface layer runs in
 

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.500
the JavaScript interface layer runs in
the context of the webview for example

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:24.510
the context of the webview for example
 

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.060
the context of the webview for example
no I like I said because it's an

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.070
no I like I said because it's an
 

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.519
no I like I said because it's an
undocumented behavior if you could

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:29.529
undocumented behavior if you could
 

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:31.530
undocumented behavior if you could
change I wouldn't want to harbor any

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:31.540
change I wouldn't want to harbor any
 

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.139
change I wouldn't want to harbor any
guesses about that we hope the contract

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:34.149
guesses about that we hope the contract
 

00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:36.780
guesses about that we hope the contract
is basically instantiation and execution

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:36.790
is basically instantiation and execution
 

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.940
is basically instantiation and execution
on the UI thread and then you get you

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:38.950
on the UI thread and then you get you
 

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.650
on the UI thread and then you get you
mean work done in the context of the UI

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:40.660
mean work done in the context of the UI
 

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.360
mean work done in the context of the UI
thread yes is that a lacing task

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.370
thread yes is that a lacing task
 

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:50.300
thread yes is that a lacing task
basically it eases the use of UI thread

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
basically it eases the use of UI thread
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.390
basically it eases the use of UI thread
but in your case what is happening is

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:54.400
but in your case what is happening is
 

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.400
but in your case what is happening is
might not be an expected behavior maybe

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:56.410
might not be an expected behavior maybe
 

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.170
might not be an expected behavior maybe
we can dig a little more two more

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:58.180
we can dig a little more two more
 

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.449
we can dig a little more two more
research and figure out if this is a bug

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:00.459
research and figure out if this is a bug
 

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:03.030
research and figure out if this is a bug
or is this an expected behavior which is

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040
or is this an expected behavior which is
 

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.160
or is this an expected behavior which is
undocumented yeah let's say whenever I

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.170
undocumented yeah let's say whenever I
 

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.230
undocumented yeah let's say whenever I
start an async task on the UI thread it

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240
start an async task on the UI thread it
 

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.520
start an async task on the UI thread it
works fine it's just that these ones

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:08.530
works fine it's just that these ones
 

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.189
works fine it's just that these ones

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840
 

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.290
I think it's basically wrapping justice

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:13.300
I think it's basically wrapping justice
 

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.620
I think it's basically wrapping justice
a certificate class yeah but I don't

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:16.630
a certificate class yeah but I don't
 

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.030
a certificate class yeah but I don't
think you can actually get the

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.040
think you can actually get the
 

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.390
think you can actually get the
certificated signature from the class

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400
certificated signature from the class
 

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.640
certificated signature from the class
all right he's not using the published

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.650
all right he's not using the published
 

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:29.880
all right he's not using the published
methods okay so will it be possible to

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:29.890
methods okay so will it be possible to
 

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.770
methods okay so will it be possible to
share on which devices you're getting

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:31.780
share on which devices you're getting
 

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.600
share on which devices you're getting

more i sleep i know that's it i think i

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:58.630
more i sleep i know that's it i think i
 

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.590
more i sleep i know that's it i think i
will have to check but as i said this is

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600
will have to check but as i said this is
 

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.260
will have to check but as i said this is
a the expected behavior is that just

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:04.270
a the expected behavior is that just
 

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.690
a the expected behavior is that just
like a state or in this case where is a

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:06.700
like a state or in this case where is a
 

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.330
like a state or in this case where is a
certificate should return yeah ok thank

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:17.680
I'll grab this one how do you go about
 

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.310
I'll grab this one how do you go about
implementing an arrow pointing to a list

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320
implementing an arrow pointing to a list
 

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.820
implementing an arrow pointing to a list
item similar to how the Google Mail has

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:23.830
item similar to how the Google Mail has
 

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.490
item similar to how the Google Mail has
an arrow from the viewed mail item item

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:26.500
an arrow from the viewed mail item item
 

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.600
an arrow from the viewed mail item item
to the item on the list now I was not a

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:30.610
to the item on the list now I was not a
 

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.150
to the item on the list now I was not a
hundred percent sure of what Archie was

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:33.160
hundred percent sure of what Archie was
 

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.430
hundred percent sure of what Archie was
actually asking here so I played around

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440
actually asking here so I played around
 

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.760
actually asking here so I played around
with the app and my assumption is that

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:38.770
with the app and my assumption is that
 

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.560
with the app and my assumption is that
he's actually talking about the gmail

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:40.570
he's actually talking about the gmail
 

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.950
he's actually talking about the gmail
app on a tablet and basically if you

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960
app on a tablet and basically if you
 

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.040
app on a tablet and basically if you
look at gmail on Android tablets when

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.050
look at gmail on Android tablets when
 

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.950
look at gmail on Android tablets when
you're looking at a specific

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960
you're looking at a specific
 

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.480
you're looking at a specific
conversation you get your list of

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:51.490
conversation you get your list of
 

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.910
conversation you get your list of
conversations on on the let me put it on

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:53.920
conversations on on the let me put it on
 

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.050
conversations on on the let me put it on
the left hand side and on on the right

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.060
the left hand side and on on the right
 

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.700
the left hand side and on on the right
hand side you have the current active

00:23:59.700 --> 00:23:59.710
hand side you have the current active
 

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.280
hand side you have the current active
conversation now in that list on the

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.290
conversation now in that list on the
 

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.250
conversation now in that list on the
left hand side the current active

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:05.260
left hand side the current active
 

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.660
left hand side the current active
conversation is highlighted with a

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:06.670
conversation is highlighted with a
 

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.120
conversation is highlighted with a
background color of blue but on the

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.130
background color of blue but on the
 

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.620
background color of blue but on the
right hand side you'll see there's like

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:10.630
right hand side you'll see there's like
 

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.680
right hand side you'll see there's like
a little indent it kind of looks like an

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:13.690
a little indent it kind of looks like an
 

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.200
a little indent it kind of looks like an
arrow so what it sort of looks like is

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.210
arrow so what it sort of looks like is
 

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.910
arrow so what it sort of looks like is
that there's an arrow coming out of that

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:17.920
that there's an arrow coming out of that
 

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.520
that there's an arrow coming out of that
list item and opening up to the

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:20.530
list item and opening up to the
 

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.100
list item and opening up to the
conversation on the right hand side

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.110
conversation on the right hand side
 

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.169
conversation on the right hand side
so there's basically a number of

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:26.179
so there's basically a number of
 

00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:28.930
so there's basically a number of
alternatives that you can use to get

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:28.940
alternatives that you can use to get
 

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.260
alternatives that you can use to get
that sort of effect so three that I

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.270
that sort of effect so three that I
 

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.780
that sort of effect so three that I
guess I could suggest and you should try

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:34.790
guess I could suggest and you should try
 

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.510
guess I could suggest and you should try
these out see which one you find easier

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520
these out see which one you find easier
 

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.310
these out see which one you find easier
to implement and which one gives you the

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320
to implement and which one gives you the
 

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.830
to implement and which one gives you the
best look but a couple that we came up

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840
best look but a couple that we came up
 

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.090
best look but a couple that we came up
with in the actual list item itself you

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:46.100
with in the actual list item itself you
 

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.669
with in the actual list item itself you
are you're you know we already highlight

00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679
are you're you know we already highlight
 

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:51.250
are you're you know we already highlight
which one is a current active item so at

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:51.260
which one is a current active item so at
 

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.180
which one is a current active item so at
that point you can just add a little

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.190
that point you can just add a little
 

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.610
that point you can just add a little
arrow or a triangle effectively on the

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:57.620
arrow or a triangle effectively on the
 

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.080
arrow or a triangle effectively on the
right hand side just put a paint in

00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.090
right hand side just put a paint in
 

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.669
right hand side just put a paint in
there or something along those lines and

00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679
there or something along those lines and
 

00:25:00.679 --> 00:25:03.460
there or something along those lines and
and and put it on top of your list item

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:03.470
and and put it on top of your list item
 

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.409
and and put it on top of your list item
and it will simulate the look and feel

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:05.419
and it will simulate the look and feel
 

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:08.549
and it will simulate the look and feel
of it it's a little bit of a trick there

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559
of it it's a little bit of a trick there
 

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:11.020
of it it's a little bit of a trick there
the other trick you can employ is that

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.030
the other trick you can employ is that
 

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.880
the other trick you can employ is that
between that left-hand column of

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:12.890
between that left-hand column of
 

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.710
between that left-hand column of
conversation and the right hand side of

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720
conversation and the right hand side of
 

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.270
conversation and the right hand side of
the actual conversation you could put a

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.280
the actual conversation you could put a
 

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.650
the actual conversation you could put a
transparent view in between them and

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:20.660
transparent view in between them and
 

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.440
transparent view in between them and
that you can have an opaque part of it

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:23.450
that you can have an opaque part of it
 

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.270
that you can have an opaque part of it
so depending on which is the current

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:25.280
so depending on which is the current
 

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.159
so depending on which is the current
list item you can move that opaque part

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:27.169
list item you can move that opaque part
 

00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:31.870
list item you can move that opaque part
up and down to match and the third way

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880
up and down to match and the third way
 

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.549
up and down to match and the third way
that you could do it is basically on

00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559
that you could do it is basically on
 

00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:35.680
that you could do it is basically on
that right hand side which is that

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.690
that right hand side which is that
 

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.870
that right hand side which is that
conversation so if you implemented it as

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880
conversation so if you implemented it as
 

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.960
conversation so if you implemented it as
let's say a fragment or even a view you

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:40.970
let's say a fragment or even a view you
 

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.320
let's say a fragment or even a view you
could anchor that view to the right hand

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.330
could anchor that view to the right hand
 

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.970
could anchor that view to the right hand
side and basically add a bit like an

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:48.980
side and basically add a bit like an
 

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.710
side and basically add a bit like an
arrow on the left hand side and again

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720
arrow on the left hand side and again
 

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.340
arrow on the left hand side and again
move it up and down based on whether on

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:54.350
move it up and down based on whether on
 

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.890
move it up and down based on whether on
what is the current active conversation

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:56.900
what is the current active conversation
 

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.960
what is the current active conversation
if you ask me personally it's probably

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:58.970
if you ask me personally it's probably
 

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.400
if you ask me personally it's probably
easiest to do the first of the three

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:00.410
easiest to do the first of the three
 

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.409
easiest to do the first of the three
which is the current list item and just

00:26:04.409 --> 00:26:04.419
which is the current list item and just
 

00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:06.669
which is the current list item and just
because it'll be less effort you you

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679
because it'll be less effort you you
 

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:09.820
because it'll be less effort you you
have less sort of information kind of

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:09.830
have less sort of information kind of
 

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.010
have less sort of information kind of
going back and forth between the the

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.020
going back and forth between the the
 

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.799
going back and forth between the the
different fragments but you know pick

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:14.809
different fragments but you know pick
 

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:16.419
different fragments but you know pick
and choose what works best for you and

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:16.429
and choose what works best for you and
 

00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:21.940
and choose what works best for you and
go with that all right if well we have

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.950
go with that all right if well we have
 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.560
go with that all right if well we have
another question from Andrew here which

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:23.570
another question from Andrew here which

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.309
in cpu graphics the whole lot right and
off that time that's spent in that that

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:42.319
off that time that's spent in that that
 

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:45.099
off that time that's spent in that that
that emulator spends a lot of time is

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:45.109
that emulator spends a lot of time is
 

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:47.260
that emulator spends a lot of time is
actually being spent rendering the

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:47.270
actually being spent rendering the
 

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.639
actually being spent rendering the
graphics and so as a result that's why

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:51.649
graphics and so as a result that's why
 

00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:53.050
graphics and so as a result that's why
you get slowed down especially when you

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.060
you get slowed down especially when you
 

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.520
you get slowed down especially when you
talk about large screens because those

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:54.530
talk about large screens because those
 

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.169
talk about large screens because those
resolutions are starting to get really

00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:56.179
resolutions are starting to get really
 

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.390
resolutions are starting to get really
really high now in that most recent

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400
really high now in that most recent
 

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.170
really high now in that most recent
version of the the Android tools what we

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:02.180
version of the the Android tools what we
 

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.120
version of the the Android tools what we
did is we enabled support for hardware

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.130
did is we enabled support for hardware
 

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.240
did is we enabled support for hardware
acceleration so the graphic rendering of

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:07.250
acceleration so the graphic rendering of
 

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.990
acceleration so the graphic rendering of
the emulator will actually be done by

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000
the emulator will actually be done by
 

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.329
the emulator will actually be done by
your local machines video card that's

00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:16.339
your local machines video card that's
 

00:35:16.339 --> 00:35:18.069
your local machines video card that's
something that we've just introduced and

something that we've just introduced and
 

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:20.050
something that we've just introduced and
I we

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.060

registered as a sort of a better future
 

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:25.000
registered as a sort of a better future
but it's something that as a result of

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.010
but it's something that as a result of
 

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.380
but it's something that as a result of
being a better future you need to enable

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.390
being a better future you need to enable
 

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.750
being a better future you need to enable
yourself so what you need to do is

GPU acceleration and actually turn it on

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:49.750
GPU acceleration and actually turn it on
 

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.150
GPU acceleration and actually turn it on
and then you know save it and start it

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160
and then you know save it and start it
 

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.760
and then you know save it and start it
up again so once you do that hardware

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:54.770
up again so once you do that hardware
 

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.560
up again so once you do that hardware
acceleration will kick in and I expect

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:56.570
acceleration will kick in and I expect
 

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.920
acceleration will kick in and I expect
that you'll see a much more improved

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:58.930
that you'll see a much more improved
 

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.350
that you'll see a much more improved
performance within your your emulator

just keep in mind that when you enable

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:13.610
just keep in mind that when you enable
 

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.560
just keep in mind that when you enable
hardware acceleration that at the moment

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:16.570
hardware acceleration that at the moment
 

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.700
hardware acceleration that at the moment
enabling hardware acceleration means

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:18.710
enabling hardware acceleration means
 

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.240
enabling hardware acceleration means
that you cannot enable snapshotting for

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:22.250
that you cannot enable snapshotting for
 

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.370
that you cannot enable snapshotting for
that particular image so that means that

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:24.380
that particular image so that means that
 

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.430
that particular image so that means that

when you shut down the the emulator when
 

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.260
when you shut down the the emulator when
you started back up it will start up

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:29.270
you started back up it will start up
 

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.300
you started back up it will start up
from scratch it won't do the you know

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.250
the feedback about the the emulator
 

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.040
the feedback about the the emulator
being slow for for tablet-sized

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.050
being slow for for tablet-sized

android sdk so i think they exist

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680
android sdk so i think they exist
 

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.310
android sdk so i think they exist
solution to this is the Android SDK

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320
solution to this is the Android SDK
 

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.440

administrator when he's trying to
 

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.840
administrator when he's trying to
install the driver I think most probably

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:43.850
install the driver I think most probably
 

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:48.340
install the driver I think most probably
that would solve the problem and if if

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:48.350
that would solve the problem and if if
 

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.260
that would solve the problem and if if
he is doing it from within eclipse then

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:50.270
he is doing it from within eclipse then
 

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.490
he is doing it from within eclipse then
it should draw an eclipse as an

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:51.500
it should draw an eclipse as an
 

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.630
it should draw an eclipse as an
administrator so that will solve this

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640
administrator so that will solve this
 

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.620
administrator so that will solve this

this question is particularly

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:47.740
this question is particularly
 

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.650
this question is particularly
interesting because i think what the

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.510
interesting because i think what the
person is saying here is that the the

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520
person is saying here is that the the
 

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.780
person is saying here is that the the
look and feel of the the apps kind of

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:54.790
look and feel of the the apps kind of
 

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.120
look and feel of the the apps kind of
outdated at the as far as i can tell the

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:57.130

any other specific problems that would

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760
any other specific problems that would
 

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:12.240
any other specific problems that would
be great too okay next question so since

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:12.250
be great too okay next question so since
 

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.109

the Galaxy Nexus is having a 720p screen

00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119
the Galaxy Nexus is having a 720p screen
 

00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:18.780
the Galaxy Nexus is having a 720p screen
resolution is it possible to add a

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:18.790
resolution is it possible to add a
 

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.349
resolution is it possible to add a
tablet mode into developer options and

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359
tablet mode into developer options and
 

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:24.839
tablet mode into developer options and
so it is more like developer devices

00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:24.849
so it is more like developer devices
 

00:40:24.849 --> 00:40:26.370
so it is more like developer devices
helping us to develop tablet

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:26.380
helping us to develop tablet
 

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.250
helping us to develop tablet
applications and generally what we found

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:29.260
applications and generally what we found
 

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.440
applications and generally what we found
is that tablet mode for a Galaxy Nexus

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.450
is that tablet mode for a Galaxy Nexus
 

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.810
is that tablet mode for a Galaxy Nexus
would not would not really be very

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:33.820
would not would not really be very
 

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.589
would not would not really be very
useful and when you look at the slides

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599
useful and when you look at the slides
 

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:39.720
useful and when you look at the slides
of a Galaxy Nexus compared to the size

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:39.730
of a Galaxy Nexus compared to the size
 

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:42.300
of a Galaxy Nexus compared to the size
of a tablet it's obviously a vast

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:42.310
of a tablet it's obviously a vast
 

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:47.069
of a tablet it's obviously a vast
difference so with the screen i believe

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079
difference so with the screen i believe
 

00:40:47.079 --> 00:40:49.980
difference so with the screen i believe
the Galaxy Nexus is like 4.6 4.7 inches

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:49.990
the Galaxy Nexus is like 4.6 4.7 inches
 

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.780
the Galaxy Nexus is like 4.6 4.7 inches

you wouldn't really be able to interact
 

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.670
you wouldn't really be able to interact
with the screen the way you do with a

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680
with the screen the way you do with a
 

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.050
with the screen the way you do with a
tablet so rather than try and pursue an

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.060
tablet so rather than try and pursue an
 

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.230
tablet so rather than try and pursue an
option where you force a phone to

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240
option where you force a phone to
 

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.970
option where you force a phone to
pretend it's a tablet a better option

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:02.980
pretend it's a tablet a better option
 

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.329

so yeah I really don't think that that a

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480
so yeah I really don't think that that a
 

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.480
so yeah I really don't think that that a
tablet mode would be would be something

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:30.490
tablet mode would be would be something
 

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:34.770
tablet mode would be would be something
that would be useful in this case what

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.710
can you just confirm that you can skip
this slide okay great I can see it okay

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720
this slide okay great I can see it okay
 

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.990
this slide okay great I can see it okay
so Andrew this these are some slides

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000
so Andrew this these are some slides
 

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.510
so Andrew this these are some slides
that we presented in the past about

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520
that we presented in the past about
 

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.430
that we presented in the past about
in-app billing and I think that you'll

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440
in-app billing and I think that you'll
 

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.400
in-app billing and I think that you'll
be able to see some of those the

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:47.410
be able to see some of those the
 

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:51.410
be able to see some of those the
sequence diagrams that you were after so

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420
sequence diagrams that you were after so
 

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.420
sequence diagrams that you were after so
basically if we if we look at a client

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:54.430
basically if we if we look at a client
 

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.530
basically if we if we look at a client
version of in-app billing because

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:55.540
version of in-app billing because
 

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.540
version of in-app billing because
there's a there's an implementation that

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:57.550
there's a there's an implementation that
 

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.670
there's a there's an implementation that
you can do where everything is sort of

00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680
you can do where everything is sort of
 

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.290
you can do where everything is sort of
done in your your app itself on the

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:01.300
done in your your app itself on the
 

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.970
done in your your app itself on the
device and that's what I have at the

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:02.980
device and that's what I have at the
 

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.400
device and that's what I have at the
moment so I'm trying to get my public

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:05.410
moment so I'm trying to get my public
 

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:08.440
moment so I'm trying to get my public
certificate off the device and enter

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:08.450
certificate off the device and enter
 

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:11.920
certificate off the device and enter
my surface my is my goal okay great so

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:11.930
my surface my is my goal okay great so
 

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.420
my surface my is my goal okay great so
we'll start with the client version and

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:13.430
we'll start with the client version and
 

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.160
we'll start with the client version and
then we'll just migrate to the server

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:15.170
then we'll just migrate to the server
 

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.230
then we'll just migrate to the server
version and then see if you have any

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240
version and then see if you have any
 

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.380
version and then see if you have any
questions around that so okay so

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:20.390
questions around that so okay so
 

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.720
questions around that so okay so
basically what we have here is we have a

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:22.730
basically what we have here is we have a
 

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.540
basically what we have here is we have a
dotted line you'll see so everything

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:25.550
dotted line you'll see so everything
 

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.460
dotted line you'll see so everything
above the dotted line is is the the

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:27.470
above the dotted line is is the the
 

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.560
above the dotted line is is the the
Google Play server or the back end there

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:29.570
Google Play server or the back end there
 

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.300
Google Play server or the back end there
and everything below the dotted line is

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:31.310
and everything below the dotted line is
 

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.940
and everything below the dotted line is
the Android device itself and you can

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:33.950
the Android device itself and you can
 

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.740
the Android device itself and you can
see we have the Google Play client which

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:35.750
see we have the Google Play client which
 

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.140
see we have the Google Play client which
and the Google Play billing service is a

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.150
and the Google Play billing service is a
 

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.990
and the Google Play billing service is a
part of that that play client and then

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000
part of that that play client and then
 

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.970
part of that that play client and then
you have your application down at the

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:42.980
you have your application down at the
 

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.579
you have your application down at the
bottom being you know since we're

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:45.589
bottom being you know since we're
 

00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:46.960
bottom being you know since we're
implementing in-app billing our

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:46.970
implementing in-app billing our
 

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.720
implementing in-app billing our
application has a billing service and a

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.730
application has a billing service and a
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:52.210
application has a billing service and a
billing receiver component as well so

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:52.220
billing receiver component as well so
 

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.730
billing receiver component as well so
the way it works is that with in-app

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:54.740
the way it works is that with in-app
 

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.960
the way it works is that with in-app
billing what you would do is register

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:55.970
billing what you would do is register
 

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.849
billing what you would do is register
your private key that the private key is

00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:57.859
your private key that the private key is
 

00:44:57.859 --> 00:44:59.260
your private key that the private key is
registered with the Google Play server

00:44:59.260 --> 00:44:59.270
registered with the Google Play server
 

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.620
registered with the Google Play server
and your application has the the public

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:02.630
and your application has the the public
 

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.540
and your application has the the public
key in it and Andrew as you said this is

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:04.550
key in it and Andrew as you said this is
 

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.760
key in it and Andrew as you said this is
your your current scenario the way it

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:06.770
your your current scenario the way it
 

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.460
your your current scenario the way it
works is that your billing service makes

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:09.470
works is that your billing service makes
 

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.500
works is that your billing service makes
a billing request and that building

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:11.510
a billing request and that building
 

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.300
a billing request and that building
request is actually serviced by the

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:13.310
request is actually serviced by the
 

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.599
request is actually serviced by the
billing service that lives inside the

00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:16.609
billing service that lives inside the
 

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:19.630
billing service that lives inside the
Google Play client on the device now

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640
Google Play client on the device now
 

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.819
Google Play client on the device now
what that client does is for words on

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:21.829
what that client does is for words on
 

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:24.900
what that client does is for words on
that billing request to the Play server

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:24.910
that billing request to the Play server
 

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.640
that billing request to the Play server
which then gets a response which is

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:27.650
which then gets a response which is
 

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.240
which then gets a response which is
signed with the private key that

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.250
signed with the private key that
 

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.920
signed with the private key that
response is sent from the place over to

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:32.930
response is sent from the place over to
 

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.960
response is sent from the place over to
the Play client and the Play client in

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:34.970
the Play client and the Play client in
 

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.510
the Play client and the Play client in
turn then sends that signed response

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520
turn then sends that signed response
 

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.359
turn then sends that signed response
back to your billing receiver through

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:40.369
back to your billing receiver through
 

00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:44.680
back to your billing receiver through
the on receive method now what you do is

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:44.690
the on receive method now what you do is
 

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.870
the on receive method now what you do is
basically use that public key and you

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880
basically use that public key and you
 

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.030
basically use that public key and you
can verify that the red under before but

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040
can verify that the red under before but
 

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.559
can verify that the red under before but
now you'll see that we have another

00:45:50.559 --> 00:45:50.569
now you'll see that we have another
 

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:52.660
now you'll see that we have another
dotted line towards the the bottom third

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:52.670
dotted line towards the the bottom third
 

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.510
dotted line towards the the bottom third
of the screen so the middle the top

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520
of the screen so the middle the top
 

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.309
of the screen so the middle the top
section is the Google Play server the

00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319
section is the Google Play server the
 

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:00.520
section is the Google Play server the
middle section is on the device and that

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:00.530
middle section is on the device and that
 

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.530
middle section is on the device and that
the session that the section at the very

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:02.540
the session that the section at the very
 

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.910
the session that the section at the very
bottom is your server and the way it

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920
bottom is your server and the way it
 

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.920
bottom is your server and the way it
looks like in this world is that the

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:08.930
looks like in this world is that the
 

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.690
looks like in this world is that the
private key still stays on the Google

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:10.700
private key still stays on the Google
 

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.120
private key still stays on the Google
Play server but the public key is on

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:13.130
Play server but the public key is on
 

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.220
Play server but the public key is on
your server now so it's not part of the

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:15.230
your server now so it's not part of the
 

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.250
your server now so it's not part of the
application now let's just go through

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:18.260
application now let's just go through
 

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.170
application now let's just go through
that flow again the billing service will

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:20.180
that flow again the billing service will
 

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.809
that flow again the billing service will
invoke the Play client

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:21.819
invoke the Play client
 

00:46:21.819 --> 00:46:23.749
invoke the Play client
through a bit making a billion request

00:46:23.749 --> 00:46:23.759
through a bit making a billion request
 

00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:26.400
through a bit making a billion request
again that building request is passed on

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:26.410
again that building request is passed on
 

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.430
again that building request is passed on
to the the play server in a response is

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440
to the the play server in a response is
 

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.309
to the the play server in a response is
passed back to the Play client and again

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319
passed back to the Play client and again
 

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:35.009
passed back to the Play client and again
signed by the private key at this point

00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:35.019
signed by the private key at this point
 

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:37.170
signed by the private key at this point
the Play client will still send that

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:37.180
the Play client will still send that
 

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.329
the Play client will still send that
signed response back to your building

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:39.339
signed response back to your building
 

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:43.199
signed response back to your building
receiver but what you will do is your

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:43.209
receiver but what you will do is your
 

00:46:43.209 --> 00:46:45.329
receiver but what you will do is your
app will then take that response and

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:45.339
app will then take that response and
 

00:46:45.339 --> 00:46:49.380
app will then take that response and
send it to your server now we're going

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:49.390
send it to your server now we're going
 

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.509
send it to your server now we're going
to split to the next slide which sort of

00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:51.519
to split to the next slide which sort of
 

00:46:51.519 --> 00:46:54.239
to split to the next slide which sort of
sorry will elaborate that on that in a

00:46:54.239 --> 00:46:54.249
sorry will elaborate that on that in a
 

00:46:54.249 --> 00:46:56.459
sorry will elaborate that on that in a
second so after you send it to your

00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:56.469
second so after you send it to your
 

00:46:56.469 --> 00:46:58.370
second so after you send it to your
server your server will then in turn

00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380
server your server will then in turn
 

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.109
server your server will then in turn
send back a session token and we're

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119
send back a session token and we're
 

00:47:01.119 --> 00:47:02.370
send back a session token and we're
going to look at that in a little bit

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:02.380
going to look at that in a little bit
 

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.849
going to look at that in a little bit
more detail now so basically your server

00:47:05.849 --> 00:47:05.859
more detail now so basically your server
 

00:47:05.859 --> 00:47:08.039
more detail now so basically your server
will have got that response those

00:47:08.039 --> 00:47:08.049
will have got that response those
 

00:47:08.049 --> 00:47:10.410
will have got that response those
credentials passed in a session token

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:10.420
credentials passed in a session token
 

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.609
credentials passed in a session token
back to your app and then your app can

00:47:14.609 --> 00:47:14.619
back to your app and then your app can
 

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:17.759
back to your app and then your app can
start basically communicating with your

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:17.769
start basically communicating with your
 

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:22.469
start basically communicating with your
server using that token as as it's sort

00:47:22.469 --> 00:47:22.479
server using that token as as it's sort
 

00:47:22.479 --> 00:47:24.449
server using that token as as it's sort
of identification just to say that it is

00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:24.459
of identification just to say that it is
 

00:47:24.459 --> 00:47:26.370
of identification just to say that it is
the right one so that's that session

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:26.380
the right one so that's that session
 

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.709
the right one so that's that session
token it's important that you you you

00:47:28.709 --> 00:47:28.719
token it's important that you you you
 

00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:30.479
token it's important that you you you
know that it expires over time and that

00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:30.489
know that it expires over time and that
 

00:47:30.489 --> 00:47:33.089
know that it expires over time and that
it's something that you you create a new

00:47:33.089 --> 00:47:33.099
it's something that you you create a new
 

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:35.939
it's something that you you create a new
one every every time you sort of start a

00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:35.949
one every every time you sort of start a
 

00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:38.699
one every every time you sort of start a
new session but you're using that token

00:47:38.699 --> 00:47:38.709
new session but you're using that token
 

00:47:38.709 --> 00:47:40.380
new session but you're using that token
to kind of go back and forth between

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:40.390
to kind of go back and forth between
 

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:44.939
to kind of go back and forth between
your server and your app so I think that

00:47:44.939 --> 00:47:44.949
your server and your app so I think that
 

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:48.620
your server and your app so I think that
pretty much sort of concludes that

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:48.630
pretty much sort of concludes that
 

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:51.209
pretty much sort of concludes that
that's how to fly this did that make

00:47:51.209 --> 00:47:51.219
that's how to fly this did that make
 

00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:54.089
that's how to fly this did that make
sense danger yeah I mean it's that was

00:47:54.089 --> 00:47:54.099
sense danger yeah I mean it's that was
 

00:47:54.099 --> 00:47:56.670
sense danger yeah I mean it's that was
kind of where I was up to kind of

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680
kind of where I was up to kind of
 

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.849
kind of where I was up to kind of

this kind of unique random number this
 

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:14.219
this kind of unique random number this
does nope no one's thing and then when

00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:14.229

you get the response back from google

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:15.670
you get the response back from google
 

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:18.029

play you check to see if that random

00:48:18.029 --> 00:48:18.039
play you check to see if that random
 

00:48:18.039 --> 00:48:20.069
play you check to see if that random
number is in your list of stored numbers

and if it is you go okay that's
 

00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:24.839

to the you know the the other node it's

to the you know the the other node it's
 

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.050
to the you know the the other node it's
not going to have that list around the

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:32.060
not going to have that list around the
 

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.400
not going to have that list around the

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:34.870
numbers the same as the other node and
that is it just seems fraught with

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880
that is it just seems fraught with
 

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.050
that is it just seems fraught with
danger and going backwards and forwards

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.060
danger and going backwards and forwards
 

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.250

oh just wondering how if there was a

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:39.260
oh just wondering how if there was a
 

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.660
oh just wondering how if there was a
best practice for that kind of stuff

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:40.670
best practice for that kind of stuff
 

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.930
best practice for that kind of stuff
well in that case if you kind of want

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:43.940
well in that case if you kind of want
 

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.300
well in that case if you kind of want
some sort of you know you want to

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:46.310
some sort of you know you want to
 

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.910
some sort of you know you want to
persist that that table of yours and you

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920
persist that that table of yours and you
 

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.490
persist that that table of yours and you
want to make sure it's replicated across

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:50.500
want to make sure it's replicated across
 

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.940
want to make sure it's replicated across
there however many servers you have so

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:54.950
there however many servers you have so
 

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:56.650
there however many servers you have so
from what you're saying it sounds like

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:56.660
from what you're saying it sounds like
 

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.960
from what you're saying it sounds like
you're doing the right thing other than

00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:58.970
you're doing the right thing other than
 

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.330
you're doing the right thing other than
the fact that it's an in-memory hash map

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:01.340
the fact that it's an in-memory hash map
 

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.359
the fact that it's an in-memory hash map
yeah so I mean that must be the place a

00:50:04.359 --> 00:50:04.369
yeah so I mean that must be the place a
 

00:50:04.369 --> 00:50:05.380
yeah so I mean that must be the place a
the solution is to make it into a

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:05.390
the solution is to make it into a
 

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.540
the solution is to make it into a
datastore and that can be shared across

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:07.550
datastore and that can be shared across
 

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.010

guess yeah absolutely yeah cool on a

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.010
guess yeah absolutely yeah cool on a
 

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.150
guess yeah absolutely yeah cool on a
good good question thanks for that and

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160
good good question thanks for that and
 

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.830
good good question thanks for that and
all right at this point I think we are

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:19.840
all right at this point I think we are
 

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.300
all right at this point I think we are
we run out of questions I'm just out

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:22.310
we run out of questions I'm just out

doing a refresh on the moderator link is

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920
doing a refresh on the moderator link is
 

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.980
doing a refresh on the moderator link is
is there anyone else on there on the

Hangout that has any questions that
doesn't look like it all right Andrew

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980
doesn't look like it all right Andrew

doesn't look like it all right Andrew
just going back to one of the questions

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240
just going back to one of the questions
 

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.210
just going back to one of the questions
that was mentioned earlier is there a

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220
that was mentioned earlier is there a
 

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.849
that was mentioned earlier is there a
way or something in the pipeline perhaps

00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859
way or something in the pipeline perhaps
 

00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:45.980
way or something in the pipeline perhaps

app and then need to kind of kind of

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300
app and then need to kind of kind of
 

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.920
app and then need to kind of kind of
give it away or sell it to Facebook for

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:51.930
give it away or sell it to Facebook for
 

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:53.630
give it away or sell it to Facebook for
example is there any way I can sort of

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640
example is there any way I can sort of
 

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.970
example is there any way I can sort of
transfer an app from my google play

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980
transfer an app from my google play
 

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.530
transfer an app from my google play
account to somebody else's Google Play

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540
account to somebody else's Google Play
 

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.530
account to somebody else's Google Play
account and look I guess we don't really

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540
account and look I guess we don't really
 

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.970
account and look I guess we don't really
talk about what may be coming with yeah

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:03.980
talk about what may be coming with yeah
 

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.470

he sounded like he was trying to
 

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:24.080
he sounded like he was trying to
validate the nonce on the server but you

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:24.090
validate the nonce on the server but you
 

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.990
validate the nonce on the server but you
need something that's done on the client

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000
need something that's done on the client
 

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.880
need something that's done on the client
is that right on cool golden two sugars

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:28.890
is that right on cool golden two sugars
 

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.370
is that right on cool golden two sugars
I thought yeah the server part when it

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380
I thought yeah the server part when it
 

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.940

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:34.950
does the verified purchase and sort of
 

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.670
does the verified purchase and sort of
decrypts the packet with my public key

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680
decrypts the packet with my public key
 

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.349
decrypts the packet with my public key
also then does a check for the nonce so

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359
also then does a check for the nonce so
 

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:41.450
also then does a check for the nonce so
I thought that must all have to live

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.410
that but it's not a necessity mostly
it's for making sure on the client that

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420
it's for making sure on the client that
 

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.700
it's for making sure on the client that
you've got a valid response there it's

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:49.710
you've got a valid response there it's
 

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.470
you've got a valid response there it's

that's the important side of it cool all

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:53.490
that's the important side of it cool all
 

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.859
that's the important side of it cool all

right then I'm not too worried then
 

00:51:54.869 --> 00:51:57.140
right then I'm not too worried then
