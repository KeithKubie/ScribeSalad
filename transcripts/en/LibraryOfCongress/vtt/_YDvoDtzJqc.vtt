00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:20.890
[ Silence ]

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.190
&gt;&gt; Well, good morning all.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.490
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt; It's a nice crowd here.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.910
Thank you for coming and, for this
session we're having with Dr. Platz

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.610
on Prostate Cancer Update.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.910
We've done several sessions
in our LCPAHSO brown bags

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.030
with the men's health month,
and I see several of the people

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.110
who participated in
that here today as well.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
And, so, this is bring us full
circle now that we're in the month

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
in which we observe prostate cancer
awareness and try to find answers.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.610
We have an expert with us from
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.740
of Public Health, and as we were
chatting here, she was telling me

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.690
about the many departments.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.170
And, so, she's deputy chair of
the department of epidemiology,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.080
and she'll share with you where
all the inspiration comes from even

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.290
as she shares some of the new
updates and things that are going

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.370 position:56%
on in the world of prostate cancers.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.530
Something that is important,
not just for the men in room,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.260
which I'm glad to see several, but,
also, the women who live with them,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.330
care for them, and are related
to them in one way or the other.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.060
So, it is my pleasure, as chief
of health services, to welcome all

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.900
of you here, and, particularly, to
welcome Dr. Platz and my colleague,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.330
that's Tomoko Steen from
Science and Technology

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.460
with whom we're partnering,
will introduce Dr. Platz to you.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.260
Thank you.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.350
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Dr. Charles.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.640
It is my pleasure to introduce
my dear friend, Elizabeth Platz.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.700
She's already introduced the
professor at epidemiology

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.360
at the Johns Hopkins University.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.240 position:56%
She studies association of genetics,
in epigenetics, factors as well

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.850
as saturating markers of under
[inaudible] city, information,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.860
and oxidation with prostate cancer.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.220
She has study is not
only doing science,

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.790
but she wants to educate
people as well as the,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.680
looking at the association
lifestyle.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.880
So, her team has sociologists,
not only epidemiologists,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.400
and this is a good example of
the transformation of medicine.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.690
We started about two years
ago, Dr. Jim Watson came

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.940
and we had a Pernell discussion
on transformation of medicine

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.800
and this is a continuation of the
discussion on the transformation

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.250
of medicine, and we also had got
micros talk earlier this year.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.510
Before further due, I'd
like to introduce Dr. Platz.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.390
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.580
&gt;&gt; So, thanks to all of
you for being here today,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.290
and I'm very excited
to speak with you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.490
about my favorite cancer,
prostate cancer.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.850
So, it might seem odd that a
woman studies this disease.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.280 position:56%
I study this disease because we know
very little about what causes it.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.530 position:56%
And, so, my whole goal in my career
has been to try to find risk factors

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.520
that men can do something
about to reduce their risk

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.720
of developing the disease
and for men

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.760
who already have prostate cancer,
things they might be able to do

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.070
in their lives to reduce
the risk of poor outcome,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.720
including dying of the disease.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.450
Okay. I do want to indicate to you

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.390
that I do not have any
financial conflicts of interest.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.690
All right.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.870
September is National Prostate
Cancer Awareness month.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.260
You all know that blue is the
color for prostate cancer.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.080
How many of you know where your
prostate is, if you're a man?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.440
Okay. You probably, as you
get older, you become more

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.330
and more aware of your prostate.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.100
Some men do experience
symptoms related

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.850
to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.380
It's an organ that is
involved in reproduction.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.360 position:56%
It's an important organ to have,
although, clearly, once it's removed

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.110
in the setting of prostate cancer,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.370
a man can live a perfectly
functional life.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.650
Okay? The lifetime risk of
developing this disease is one

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.380
in seven, and this
is the lifetime risk.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.330
This is not the risk at any moment.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.970
So, it is a common
cancer, and, right now,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.630
there are about 2.8 million men
who are living with this disease.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.510
Okay? So, they've survived,
they've had their treatment

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.290
or they've undergone
active surveillance,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.660
and they're living with it.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.650
Okay? So, today, I want
to cover four areas.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.150
The first is the national and
global burden of this disease.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.090
I want to tell you a little
bit about what we know

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.510
about what may cause this disease
and what we might be able to do

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.940
to prevent poor outcome, not
treatment, but modifiable factors,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.620
what men may be able to change to
change their risk of poor outcome.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.430
And I also want to show you a
little bit about ongoing research

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.200
on both the causes of this disease

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.050
and about prognostic
factors for poor outcome.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.160
And, then, we'll talk very
briefly about the controversies

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.820
in the early detection
of prostate cancer.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.080
Okay? So let's start with
the burden of this disease.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.100
So, I do want to tell you where
we get our national statistics.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.020
So, you'll hear statistics
in the news

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.000
about prostate cancer
being number one.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.420
So, where does that
information come from?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.840
Well, the American Cancer Society
produces summery statistics

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.990
for us every year, which is
very helpful for people like me.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.820
It's important for people
who do program development

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.970
for programs related to education
about screening and so on.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.420
Those data come from the
national cancer institutes,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.810
specifically the SEER
Program, the U.S. Surveillance,

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.150
Epidemiology, and Results Program.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.320
And, so, we do have in this
country a system of surveillance.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.080
SEER started in 1973.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.220
It doesn't cover the entire
country, but it does include

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.710
about 28 percent of the country.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.070
Places are sampled, cancer
registries are sampled

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.940
to have diversity, and, then,
through statistical means,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.020
national estimates are produced.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.260
And, then, how do the
data get to SEER?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.980
Well, we do have a U.S.
cancer surveillance system.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.900
In most states, diagnosing
physicians

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.750
and mythologists are
required to report

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.800
to their hospital cancer registry
as well as private mythology labs.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.480
These enter the state and regional
cancer registries, and, then,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.010
they enter the SEER Program
or The National Program

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.090
of Cancer Registries,
which is a CDC program.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.820
And, then, in addition,
information on death

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.350
from cancer comes from
vital statistics.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.530
Okay? So, let's look at where you
can look up details on the burden

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.340
of cancers, and so, again, one
place to look is the SEER Program.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.500
They have a lovely
website that's interactive.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.680
You can look at the CDC's
website, The National Program

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.820
of Cancer Registries, or you can
look at the annual cancer facts

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.740
and figures produced by the
American Cancer Society, and, so,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.040
we can make these slides.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.860
I guess they'll be available on the
web so you can go to these links

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.530
if you'd like to review
these statistics.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.960
Okay. So, new cases in the US.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.160
So, as I mentioned, prostate
cancer's the number one diagnosed

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.880
cancer in U.S. men.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.910
Okay? Aside from non-melanoma
skin cancer,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.570
which does not get recorded
in cancer registries.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.200
Okay. This amounts to about
more than 220 thousand men.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.580
This is an estimate for this year,
2015, and for those of you who care

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.510
about incidence rates, it's about a
138 per 100 thousand men per year.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.350
Okay? Let's look at the trends
in this cancer over time.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.160
So, this graph shows 1975 to 2011.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.880
Again, these are slides from
the American Cancer Society

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.420
from cancer facts and figures.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.570
Here's prostate cancer incidence.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.990
Okay? You can see in the
late 1980's, early 1990's,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.780
we had this tremendous peak.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.480
This is due to PSA-based
prostate cancer screening.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.300
Okay? And, then, you
may know that in 2012,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.640
the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force changed the recommendation.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.720
So, now, the recommendation is

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.230
against prostate cancer screening
using the PSA test, and at the end,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.570
I'll talk about why
they made that decision

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.750
and why it may be controversial.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.030
Okay. I also want to show you the
five-year cancer survival rates

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.670
[inaudible] prostate cancer
back in the mid to late 1970's.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.180
The rate was about 68 percent
five-year survival, and, then,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.960
by the late 1980's, it was up
to about 83 percent, and, then,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.690
today, it's at a 100 percent.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.550
And we'll talk about why it's
now a 100 percent, and, again,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:51.690
the 68 percent and the 83
percent were before the PSA era.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.860 position:56%
Okay? And for prostate cancer death,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.170
death in prostate cancer's
the number two cause

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.320
of cancer death in U.S. men.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.480
Just under 30 thousand men will
die of this disease this year,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.260
this is the estimate, and,
again, for those who like rates,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.990
the mortality rate is about 21
per 100 thousand men per year,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.890
and you can see it's two behind
lung and bronchial cancer.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.150
Okay? Which far exceeds
the proportion

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.740
of deaths from prostate cancer.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.080
Okay. Let's look at the
trends in death from cancer.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.880 position:56%
Let me point out first, lung cancer.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.830
Lung and bronchus, you can see this
tremendous rise and then decline.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.590
This is related, almost
fully, to smoking.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.240
Okay? And changes in
smoking status over time.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.860
This is one of the most impressive
cancer-related public health

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.360
benefits that we have had.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.050
Okay? It's very remarkable.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.590
Now, let's look at prostate cancer.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.390
We can see this bump
that's concurrent

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.800
in time with the peak incidents.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.570
You would think that screening
should reduce mortality,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.870
we did have that peak.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.980
That's probably due to better
attribution of cause of death

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.820
because it's probably
what's going on there.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.600
And, then, this decline is
probably due to two things.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.970
One, it could be due to PSA-based
prostate cancer screening,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.950
so detecting early, treating early,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.950
and it's also likely due the
better treatments for men

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.500
who have advance disease at
the time of diagnosis or who,

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.300
after the diagnosis,
develop advanced disease

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.200
and then need to be treated.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.280
Okay? So, let's talk
about the global burden

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.160
of prostate cancer
using statistics again

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.570
from the American Cancer Society.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.750
For these data, they receive
information from Globocan,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.350
which is part of the
International Agency

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.360
for Research on Cancer, so IARC.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.170
And IARC uses a variety of means to
obtain estimates of incidence rates

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.000
and mortality rates for
countries around the world,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.250
including excellent registries
in some places, and, then,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.090
in other places where there
aren't registries, registries are

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.800
of poor quality, IARC
uses information

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.280
from neighboring regions.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.260
Okay? And they impute.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.200
Okay. So, per the American
Cancer Society, this cancer,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.590
prostate cancer's the second
most common cancer globally.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.260
There are about 1.1
million cases in 2012.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.440
A big chunk of them, the
majority of these cases,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.210
are diagnosed in countries
like the U.S.,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.260 position:56%
so economically-developed countries.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.460
And the incidence of this
cancer varies tremendously

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.910
across the globe, and this is in
part due to differences in the use

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.750
of PSA-based prostate
cancer screening.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.030
Okay? Also per the
American Cancer Society,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.510
about 300 thousand deaths
likely occurred in 2012,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.050
again, these are estimates.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.820
It is the fifth leading cause
of cancer death in men globally

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.680
and the highest prostate
cancer death rates are found

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.090
in the Caribbean.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.390
Okay? And it's unclear why this is.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.700
All right.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.610
So, one of the most important
differences in the global burden

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.880
of cancer is based on
economic development.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.450
So, when we look at
economically developed countries,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.630
prostate cancer is, again,
number one, and, then,

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.460
for death, it's about number three.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.440
When we look at economically
developing countries,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.170
you can see prostate cancer
is much lower on the list.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.340
Now, number one, for
incidents and mortality

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.150
in economic developing
countries is lung cancer.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.010
Okay? So the global burden
of lung cancer related

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.430
to smoking is a disaster, actually.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.130
Okay? All right.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.150
So, now let's move on to known
and suspected risk factors

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.350
for prostate cancer and poor
outcomes in men with the disease.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.690
Okay? So, what causes
prostate cancer?

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.990
So, although we've been
studying this disease for decades

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:38.680
and decades, very little's known
conclusively about what causes it.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.840
What we do know is age, so
older age, the family history

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.390 position:56%
of prostate cancer, meaning a father
or brother who has the disease,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.950
and in the U.S., being
of African ancestry.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.720
So being an African American
man in the U.S. is associated

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.330
with a substantially higher risk

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.190
of developing the disease
and dying of it.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.920
Okay? None of these three
factors is modifiable.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.500
Okay? That's a problem, right?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.600
The goal of public health
is to prevent disease.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.340
If we don't know what the risk
factors are, we cannot come

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.700
up with strategies for primary
prevention, and, of course,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.220
we prefer primary prevention.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.180
We don't want people
to get disease, right?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.080
We don't want to just pick
it up early and treat it.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.840
We don't want men to
get this disease.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.470
Okay? And, then, to show
you some statistics.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:29.320
So, the blue line is prostate
cancer incidence over age.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.930
So the X access is age,
and so you can see the risk

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.130
of prostate cancer increases
dramatically over decades of age.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.840
This is not a disease of young men.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.360
Okay? The typical age of
diagnosis is about 66.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.140
You can also see that
the risk of death

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.540 position:56%
from prostate cancer increases
notably with age, and the median age

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.680 position:56%
at death from prostate cancer in men
with the disease is 80 years old.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.510
Okay? So you might ask
me what's going on here.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.960
Why is it as men continue to age,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.750
it looks like there's
a decline in the risk?

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.250
Well, you have to remember these
are not the same men ageing

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.550
through time.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.870
These are birth cohorts of men.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:13.480
Okay? And, so, the men out here,
the men who are currently 75

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.900
and older are from birth
cohorts some time ago.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.620
We've had changes in
exposure factors.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.080
So either exposure at all or the
prevalence of exposure over time,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.780
and so what we're probably seeing
here is not suddenly is susceptible

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.960
or a lack of susceptible
susceptibility in these men.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.780
It's probably that the
nature of the exposures

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.050
that they experience
produced a lower risk

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.350
of developing the disease.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.140
It's something very important to
know when we look at age effects.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.880
Okay? So, now let's look at
the second known-risk factor

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.040 position:56%
for prostate cancer, family history.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.330
So, this is work that we did a
little bit ago looking at a group

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.940
of men who are called
health professionals.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.240
It's a cohort.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.540
The Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.690
So, large cohort of men who
were other than doctors,

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.140
they were already enrolled
in a clinical trial, and, so,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.990
the men who were recruited
were dentists

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.030
and veterinarians,
optometrists, and so on.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.680
And, so, like all the other
studies that have been conducted

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.280
in this large cohort study,
what we observed was that men

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.700
who had a family history, again, a
father or brother with the disease,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.580
had twice the risk of dying
of this cancer, and, also,

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.140
had an increased risk of
developing the cancer.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.300
It turns out, we see this for most
cancers, not just prostate cancer.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.390
People who have a family history,
again, father, brother, mother,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.190
sister, have about twice the risk.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.450
We have no idea why that is, but
it's consistent across cancers.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.090
Okay? So, this type of
finding led to this search

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.490
for inherited genetic
differences among men

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.310
that might explain the family
history finding, and, so,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.740
I would call this a mad dash.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.890
It started very slowly, individual
changes in the genome were targeted

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.720
to evaluate associations with
prostate cancer, and, then,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.810
the field of genetics exploded.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.520
And as the field exploded, the ways
that we studied, the relationship

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.560 position:56%
between genetic variation, again,
this is inherited genetic variation,

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.610
in prostate cancer risk evolved.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.760
So we moved from these, looking at
single variants into these studies,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.610
looking across the entire genome.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.570
So these are called
genome-wide association studies.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.000
And the news exploded when,
suddenly, multiple places

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.980
across the genome were found to be
associated with prostate cancer.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.580 position:56%
It was one of our first
breakthroughs, but, as it turns out,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.250
the associations are tiny.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.490
They're minuscule for any
individual SNP, we call it,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.740
single nucleotide polymorphism,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.000
and most of these polymorphisms
weren't even in genes.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.500
They're in regions between genes,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.250
and so we don't actually
know why they're related,

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.550
even though they've been validated.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.620
They've been found over
and over in many studies.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.850
Okay? You can see this was 2008
that these types of studies,

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.250
these genome-wide association
studies, began to be published.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.770 position:56%
So, we're now up to about a 100
risk SNPs that have been found, and,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.680
again, most are not in genes

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.070
and we do not know what
they're function is.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.850
Okay? Most of those
100 SNPs are associated

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.860
with prostate cancer overall
but not with aggressive disease.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.740
So, now, the hunt is for
SNPs that'll will tell us

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.110
which men may be at risk
of developing disease

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.290 position:56%
that will cause premature mortality.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.120 position:56%
Okay? So one of our goals is to find
factors that influence the prognosis

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.240
of the disease and the development
of disease with a poor prognosis.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.090
Okay? Another area that's still
genetics, instead of looking

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.600
for common variation
across the genome,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.910
the field has moved toward
looking for rare variants.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.670
Now, one of the most exciting
findings recently was, I --

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:47.210
a series of variants in a gene
called HOXB13 were identified

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.770
in a small number of families to
be associated with prostate cancer.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.930
These are families that have
familial prostate cancer.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.120
And, so, the search
continued into groups of men

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.670
who don't have familial disease.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.360
They have sporadic disease, and
what was found is that these SNPs

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.530
in this gene tend to
be in men who were

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.720
from Northern European heritage.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.780
Okay? So it seems to be particular
subpopulation who are enriched

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.760
for this, for changes in this gene,

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.500
and then increased risk
of prostate cancer.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.210
Okay? And, so, other rare
variants are being sought.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.290
The third known-risk factor for
prostate cancer, as I mentioned,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.570
is being a man of African
heritage in the U.S. Okay?

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.090
So, when you look at
this, these are U.S. data,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.300
so we've got non-Hispanic White
men, non-Hispanic Black men,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.780
Asian Pacific Islander, American
Indian, Alaskan Native, and, then,

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.670
Hispanic and Latino, and
you can see, this is death.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.400 position:56%
You can see that U.S. Black men have
more than twice the risk of dying

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.660
of prostate cancer, and
we have no idea why.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.160
Okay? This is a major difference
in risk and we have no idea why.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.130
Okay? In the studies
that we've done, again,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.710
this is the health
professional's follow-up state,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.940
this is actually a Harvard cohort.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.350
The men are all over the
country, the cohort itself,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.550
the PI is up at Harvard, and
my colleague is Giovannucci,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.770
who's the first author this paper.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.460
And, so, what we did is we
looked at the men in this cohort,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.310
we looked by race, and we asked
the question: If we adjust it

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.380
for all the factors that may differ
between Black men and White men

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.420
with respect to diet and lifestyle,

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.010
could we explain away the
racial disparity in this cancer?

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.690
And the answer is we couldn't.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.410
In fact, the association
is the same.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.000
It's about twice the risk.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.530
Okay. So Black men, twice
the risk of White men.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.820
And this cohort is high
socio economic status cohort.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.720
They're all health professionals,
so there's not noise, let's say,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.050
due to differences in
socio economic status.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.380
Okay? So that's held constant here.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.680
All right.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.320
So, in general, we already know
what causes about 50 percent

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.150
of cancers in the U.S. Okay?

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.130
And I always like audience
participation.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.780
Do you know what those risk factors
are for most cancers in the U.S.?

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.080
&gt;&gt; Smoking.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.380
&gt;&gt; So, modifiable.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.680
Left's do modifiable.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.980
Smoking.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.280
&gt;&gt; Sun.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.170
&gt;&gt; So, sun for skin cancer,
and, so, we tend not to talk

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.620
about skin cancer basal,
squamous cell skin cancer

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.440
because cancer registries
don't collect it.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.640
So, yes, you're absolutely right.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.870
For skin cancer, sun exposure
is the key risk factor.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.470
So, can you think of one
other important risk factor

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.340
for cancer, modifiable?

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.030 position:56%
So diet, and what's related to diet?

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.330
&gt;&gt; Exercise.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.740
&gt;&gt; Exercise, and what else?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.040
&gt;&gt; Obesity.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.340
&gt;&gt; Obesity.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.640
Thank you.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.940
He said obesity.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.240
Yes, thank you.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.540
Thank you.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.840
So, obesity.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.140
So, these factors, smoking,
number one, and two,

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.880
the complex of obesity, inactivity,
and poor diet account for more

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.830
than 50 percent of all
cancers in the U.S. Okay?

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.990
And for some reason, as a public,
we cannot think, for some reason,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.230
we can't think about if we
removed this constellation,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.850
how much better off we'd all be.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.060
Okay? So, I just want
us all to know this.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.940
This was information
that we knew about.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.630
Okay? This is work from 1981.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.410
We knew this in 1981.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.140
Okay? We continue to know this.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.630
Okay? So, this is my
colleague, Graham Colditz.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.240
He's at Wash U in Saint Louis, and
he had a piece not too long ago

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.080
in science translational
medicine saying, we know this.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.830
We need to do something about it.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.610
Okay? Of course, smoking
we've done a lot about,

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.800
but I'm going to tell you in
a minute, about 20 percent

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.370
of Americans still smoke.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.720
Okay? It's not equal
across the country.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.020
There are pockets.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.030
Okay? And it's not equal
across socio economic status.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.390
Okay? So things we
need to think about.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.690
All right.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.300
So, these risk factors, smoking,
and the constellation of obesity,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.140
inactivity, and poor diet
are also risk factors,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.540
not just for other cancers, right,
but for most chronic diseases.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.920
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.440 position:56%
Okay? So these are excellent targets

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.820
for intervention and
also for prevention.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.250
So, preventing the risk factors.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.350
Okay? But are these risk
factors for prostate cancer

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.270
because it'd be great
if they would be.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.680
Well, oddly, no.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.310
At least not at face value.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.520
Okay? So, what we've realized,
when we look at these factors

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.190
and prostate cancer as an
outcome, we don't see association,

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.560
but once we start looking at
the fine details of the disease,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.370
for example, by whether the
disease resulted in death, then,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.130
we start seeing associations.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.500
Okay? So we have to
look very carefully.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.590
We can't just say in general.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.620
So, let me just take a moment
and tell you why we now focus

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.350
on lethal disease and by "lethal",
we mean death from the disease,

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.520
and we also mean the
development of metastasis.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.640
Okay. So, advanced stage disease.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.850
That disease is more likely
to reduce the life span.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.330
Okay? So those are the statuses
we care about in our studies.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.160
Okay? So, I need to
tell you that we now

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.030
over detect prostate cancer
because of the PSA test.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.390
Okay? It's very clear
we over detect it.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.660
Meaning, we pick up disease that
would have never caused harm.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.420
Okay? We also pick up
disease that would cause harm,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.160
the problem is we can't
differentiate.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.650
Okay? So we pick up
a lot of disease.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.230
You saw that peak in prostate
cancer incidence rates

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.750
because of this test.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.410
Okay? So, which means, in our
studies since the early 1990's,

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:30.310
the majority of cases that
we're studying are PSA detected.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.320
Well, it turns out, when we start
dividing by disease that's detected

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.710
by PSA and disease that's not,
the risk factors aren't the same.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.630
So we don't want to
contaminate our studies

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.460
by studying total prostate cancer

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.310
because we may not be finding
the right risk factors.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.460
So, again, lethal prostate cancer,
we mean metastatic at diagnosis,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.820
we mean metastatic
during follow-up time,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.540
and we mean death from the disease.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.060
And, so, in our studies
now, we have shifted

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.140
to using lethal as the outcome.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.640
Okay? I know that sounds
horrible to say it that way.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.160
We use lethal as the outcome,
but you follow what I mean.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.390
That we specifically
look at the subset in men

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.960
who have experienced
lethal prostate cancer.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.540
Okay? And, then, just to show
you, this is sort of a model

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.230
of the natural history
of prostate cancer,

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.990
so normal prostate epithelial,
meaning that the cells

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.420
that are the secretory
cells of the prostate.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.190
It's unclear exactly what the
intermediate disease states are

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.330
that then result in
prostate adenocarcinoma.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.220
We think there may be
something called focal atrophy.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.590
We know there's something called
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.890
that seems to be on
route to the disease,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.720
but we're not a 100 percent sure.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.380
Okay? And, then, most men with
this disease die of something else

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.260
when they eventually die.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.840
Okay? But there's a subset of
men who develop metastasis,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.650
and the typical treatment for men

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.090 position:56%
when they have metastatic disease is
something called androgen ablation.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.230
So, basically, knocking
down androgens,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.390
either chemically or surgically.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.890
And these men, unfortunately,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.030
a subset of them will develop
something called hormone refractory

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.250
disease, and many of those men will
go on to die of prostate cancer,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.030
and so it's these men that
we want to be able to study.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.100
We want to find risk
factors for this disease

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.740
and be able to intervene on them.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.000
Okay? And, then, what about men
who already have prostate cancer?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.540
What are the right
outcomes in those men?

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.330
Well, I should tell you, about
a third of men who were treated

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.240
for a local disease, meaning at the
time that they're being treated,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.470
the disease is confined
to the prostate.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.770
It hasn't spread yet.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.620
About a third of those
men will actual recur.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.560
Disease will come back
after surgical treatment.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.660
Okay? And, so, how do we know
that the disease has recurred?

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.760
Well, after a man has had a
prostatectomy, a few months later,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.600
his PSA should drop
to not detectable.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.830
The prostate is the source of
PSA, so once the prostate is out

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.350
and enough of time has gone by
that the half-life of PSA would,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.920
you have to have that clearance,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.750
the concentration should
be not detectable.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.680
Okay? So, men who recur, if they
have biochemical recurrence,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.230
it means their PSA
level has gone back up.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.900 position:56%
Not all of those men, though, will
go on to develop metastasis and die.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.860
Okay? So, we tend not to use
now recurrence based on PSA

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.800
as the sole outcome
that we want to study.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.590
We actually do want to study,
again, the worse prognosis,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.130
which is progression to
men's metastasis and death.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.250
Okay? So in our association
studies, our epidemiology studies,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.650
that's the outcome
that we want to study.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.100
So, now, for these, the next
slides, I'm going to only show you,

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.100
or mostly focus on, lethal
disease, and, then, also,

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.300
progression to death from prostate
cancer in men with the disease.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.600
All right.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.900
Let's start with cigarette smoking.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.430
So, we know it's a major
risk factor for lung cancer,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.910
head and neck cancer, kidney,
pancreas, among many other cancers.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.460
Is it a risk factor
for prostate cancer?

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.840
And let me show you, I told you,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.050
but let me show you,
Americans still smoke.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.540
So, we've got tremendous
declines in smoking.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.060
This is 1965 immediately after
the U.S. Surgeon General's report

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.660
on smoking and health.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.960
People did quit.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.720
We'd see the tremendous declines.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.360
Okay? But we're still
about at 20 percent.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.400
I can tell you in my
state, in Maryland --

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.460
how many of you are Marylanders?

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.760
Okay. Just a few of you.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.520
In my state, in our state,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.410
among those who do not have
a high school education,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:27.710
so people who have less than a high
school education, about 30 percent

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.590
of them smoke, even though
in the state of Maryland

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.090
as a whole, only 15 percent smoke.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:36.100
Okay? So, we do have socio
economic disparities in smoking.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.680
Okay? So it's something to know
and something we need to act on.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.490 position:56%
Okay. So, the U.S. Surgeon General's
report, there's been an update.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.870
The 50th anniversary update was
published January last year,

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.330
and here's what it says
about prostate cancer.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.500
The evidence is suggestive of no
causal relationship between smoking

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.540
and risk of incident
prostate cancer.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.370
Okay? There's no association.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.220
And, so, for a very long time,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.350
that's what was in
the public domain.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.540 position:56%
Smoking is not related to prostate
cancer, so let's not worry about it.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.960
But here's what's now been found.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.300
Okay? So, once the evidence
has been put together,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.120 position:56%
we now see that the evidence is
suggestive of a higher risk of death

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.740
from prostate cancer in
smokers than in nonsmokers.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.120
So the worse outcome, smoking
is a risk factor for it.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.250
Okay? And, then, in men
who have prostate cancer,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.010
smoking is associated with disease

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.200
that has a worse phenotype
for prognosis.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.560
So at the tissue level, the grade
is poorer, and it's a risk factor

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.240
for progression of the disease
in men with the disease.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.970
Okay? So we now believe,
based on evidence,

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.950 position:56%
That smoking is a risk factor for
the most aggressive prostate cancer.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.860
Okay? So, this is a
point for prevention.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.350
So, let me show you
some research, again,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.120
that we did in Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.420
There's no relationship.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.370 position:56%
Okay? So, this is the relative risk.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.840
Says the risk comparing risk of
the development of prostate cancer

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.360
in men who smoke compared to
the risk in men who don't smoke.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.040
There's no relationship.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.430
Okay? So. Here's the never
smokers, here are the men

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.420
who quit a long time ago, and here
are the current or recent quitters.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.740
No relationships.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.890
But for fatal prostate
cancer, here's what we see.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.630
The blue bar, again, is men who are
current smokers or recent quitters,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.780
meaning, they quit
within the last ten years.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.870
These men have a 40 percent higher
risk of developing prostate cancer

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.020
that will lead to their death.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.610
Okay? And here's another study.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.250
This is an American
Cancer Society cohort.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.570
Cancer prevention study, too.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.870
It's the same findings.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.090
Same rough strength of association.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.390
Okay? All right.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.220
And, then, taking a look at
men who have prostate cancer,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.160
looking at risk of poor outcome.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.460
Okay? So, here, the never smokers,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.520
these are men who have
a prostatectomy.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.070
Former smokers, meaning, they quit
a long time ago, no increased risk.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.780
But men who were current smokers,
meaning, they continue to smoke

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.320
after their diagnosis and treatment
for prostate cancer, they have more

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.740
than twice the risk of recurrence.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.130
Okay? And if we look at this as
accumulative incidence, okay,

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:11.740
over across about seven years, 34
percent of the smokers recurred,

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.160
and 12, 14 percent of the never
smokers and the former smokers,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.710
those who quit a long
time ago, recurred.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.940
Big difference in the
likelihood of recurrence.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.810
Okay? So, public health action.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.280
So, I'm here to tell you about
research, but I'm also here

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.750
to tell you what we need
to do to make a difference.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.120
Okay? So, what's the
public health action?

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.650
So, we need to continue to promote
smoking cessation and prevention

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.820
of starting smoking, right,
in the general population.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.840
So, we know we need to do that,
but we need to continue to do it

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.700
and we have to make sure
men know this too, right?

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.550
And this is including to prevent
fatal prostate cancer among a very

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.000
long list of other
poor health outcomes.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.330
And, then, from men who have
this disease and actually

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.480
for all cancer patients, we have

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.010
to make sure we promote
smoking cessation.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.310
Okay? Traditionally,
we didn't do this.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.280
Okay? Once someone was
diagnosed with cancer, we just --

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.600
that was no longer
on the to-do list.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.420
Okay? But there are now guidelines

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:11.570 position:56%
that were just released earlier this
year that say we need to promote,

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:15.390
in a very active way at the time
of diagnosis, smoking cessation

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.080
in cancer patients, and, again,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.810
this should include men
with prostate cancer.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.870
Okay? Let's move on to
the epidemic of obesity.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.810
So, we know that this is a major
concern in the U.S. and globally.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.110
We all know -- everybody
know your body mass index?

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.600
Okay. More or less where you fall?

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.280
Okay. So, overweight is 25 plus
kilograms per meter square,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.580
obesity is 30 plus kilograms per
meter square, and BMI is calculated

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.420
as your weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.920
Okay? So, obesity is a risk factor

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.090
for many common cancers
including colon cancer.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:52.290
Okay? And we do know that we've
had this massive rise in obesity

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.890
in the U.S. starting
in the mid 1970's.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.410
I mean, this is a horrible
rise, right?

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.300
We're up to about 66
percent of American, adults,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.760
being overweight or obese.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.330
Same thing's happening globally.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.290
Not to the same extent,
but it's on the rise.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.060
Okay? So, are these types
of factors, so, obesity,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.560
physical inactivity, risk
factors, for prostate cancer?

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.990
Well, for years, we thought
there was no relationship.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.890
Okay? This is a consensus
document, 2007.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.940 position:56%
This is specific to prostate cancer,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.840
and you can see here a limited
no conclusion body fatness.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.150
Okay? So we thought there
was nothing going on.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:35.480
Well, now, in 2014, that same
organization updated the evidence

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.410
base, meaning, they
looked at the literature,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.680 position:56%
they found all the new studies, they
put it together in a systematic way,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.280
and, now, what they find is
that there's strong evidence

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.690
that being overweight or
obese increased the risk

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.380
of advanced prostate cancer.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.350
So, the way we used
to our studies, again,

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.870
was to look at total
prostate cancer,

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.270
but that PSA problem
messed up our studies.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.930
Okay? So, once we started
sorting out the men

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.960
with most the aggressive disease,
finding them within our cohorts,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.180
and, then, studying
these common risk factors

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.230
for many chronic diseases,
now we see associations.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.260
The evidence base is there.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.810
Okay? And, then, just to
show you example studies.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.110
This was a landmark study.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.710
It was back in 2003.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.580
This is the cancer
prevention study II

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.100
out in the American Cancer
Society, and you can see

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.930
as body mass index
increases, the risk of death

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.070
from prostate cancer increases.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.370
Okay. Here's another cohort.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.530
This is by my colleagues at
the National Cancer Institute.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.870
This is the NIH-ARP
diet and health study.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.260
The darker blue bars are
for fatal prostate cancer,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.030
the lighter blue bars are for the
incidence of the disease, and,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.560
again, as you may see,
as BMI goes up,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.900
the risk of fatal prostate
cancer goes up.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.410
And, then, something to
note as obesity goes up,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.270
the risk of incidence
disease goes down.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.340
And, so, when all this was
combined together in the past,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.130
it made it look like
there was no association.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.510
So, it wasn't until we
partitioned into advanced or fatal

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.860
and incident disease, which
was primarily PSA based,

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.190
that PSA detected base
disease, then,

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.800
we were able to see
these associations.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.010
Okay? And what about men
who have prostate cancer?

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.380
This is, again, work by my group.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.820
Cory Joshu was the first author.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.050
So, these are men who
underwent treatment

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.380
for prostate cancer,
they had early disease.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.210 position:56%
If they maintained their weight from
the years before their diagnosis

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.500
to after their diagnosis,
that was the reference group,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.410
and when we said maintain,
it was a five-pound range.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:32.690
Men who gained weight,
some more than five pounds,

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.870
the typical weight gain
was about 11 pounds

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.110
from five years before
to one year after.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.540
We see that these men have
twice the risk of recurring.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.510
Okay? Men who lost weight,
there weren't that many.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.340
[ Laughs ]

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.870
But there's a hint of
an inverse association.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.170
All right.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.470
How about physical inactivity?

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.210
Well, it doesn't appear to be
associated with prostate cancer,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:35:00.050
but it does appear to be
associated with outcomes

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.250
in men who have the disease.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.400
So, this is from my
colleagues, again,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.930
it's The Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.490
Stacy Kenfield is the first author.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.190
And, so, this is level
of physical activities,

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.750
so you can see number of med hours.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.250
This is just a measure
of both frequency

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.090
and intensity of the activity.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.600
So, increasing med hours is
increasing activity and intensity,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.730
and what we can see is, as the
number of med hours increases,

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.450
in general, the risk of
poor outcome decreases.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.750
All right.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.050
So, how we're going to intervene?

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.350
Again, public health action.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.400
It's perhaps even harder to
combat obesity and inactivity,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.820
and I didn't really
talk about poor diet.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.750
That's a very complex literature.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.540
It's hard to intervene.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.140
And you know when we take public
health action and we try to do it

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:51.070
through policy and laws,
it's a tough sell, right?

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.780
It's been a tough sell,
but we've done it.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.850
We've taxed smoking, and
we've had tremendous declines

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.150
in smoking prevalence.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.650
You saw what happened in New York
City with the attempt at taxation

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.330
of sugar-sweetened beverages, and
it failed because of the pushback.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.190
Okay? So, maybe we need to go back

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.240
into the primary care
setting, right?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.800
So, instead of doing it as
big population messages,

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.290
maybe we need to do it in
the primary care setting

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.230
and have health systems try
to deal with this problem.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.890
Okay? And, maybe, take advantage

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.930
of the Affordable Care Act
provisions for prevention.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:26.160
Okay? And, so, the Affordable Care
Act mandates that any service,

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.030
preventive service, that the U.S.
preventive service is task force

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.780
says has a recommendation
of B or A needs

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.980
to be covered without copayment.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.430
Okay? So no cost to the person.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.730
And, so, there is a
recommendation for adults

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.090
that all adults should
be screened for obesity,

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.970
and if individuals are obese,
they should be counseled.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.440
Okay? All right.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.740
And, so, what do we need?

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.820
We need research desperately
on weight loss

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.610
and inactivity for cancer patients.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:59.110 position:56%
Okay? So, we need to know whether
changing weight after the diagnosis,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:02.160
increasing activity
after the diagnosis,

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.670
would produce better
outcomes in those patients.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.920
Okay? And we need to know when
to start these interventions.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.500
Is it at the time of diagnosis,
or is it sometime later?

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.720
Okay. After some survivorship time.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.020
Okay? So, now let me
summarize the risk factors

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.390
for lethal prostate cancer.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.450
So, we looked at non-modifiable
factors, older age,

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.580
being African American or
having African ancestry,

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.100
and family history.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.350
For genetics, we now know there are
about a 100 risk alleles associated

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.520
with prostate cancer,
although I should point out,

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.550
this is not for lethal disease,
it's for total prostate cancer,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.450
and there's a search for
SNPs for lethal disease.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.630
And, then, modifiable factors,
most that have been found,

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.040
these few that I showed you,
are primarily for lethal

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.870
or fatal disease, and, again,
smoking, obesity, and inactivity.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.700 position:56%
And I highlight obesity because it's
going to be so hard to intervene on.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.000
We have to figure out what to do.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.300
All right.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.470
So, now let me give you examples
of the research that's being done

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.780
on risk factors and
also prognostic tools,

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.490
and I'm going to show you
work from my own group.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.790
So, what do I study?

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.590
So, I'm going to give you two
examples for prostate cancer.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.700
One is a cause and one
is a prognostic marker,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.610
inflammation and telomere length.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:17.830
And, then, I'm going to show you
telomere length as a risk factor

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.640
for prostate cancer,
looking at obesity

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.420
as it influences telomere length.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.610
Okay? And, then, I also
want to point out something

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:29.820
that Tomoko eluded to, which is
translational research is critical,

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.980
and that's what we're trying to do.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.700
Translational research is best done

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.910
by bringing multiple
disciplines together.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.950
And, so, here's part of our team.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.250
So, we're basic, clinical,

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.300
and population scientists working
together; so, Angelo De Marzo,

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.110 position:56%
a pathologist; Alan Meeker, a cancer
biologist, and, more specifically,

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.140
a telomere biologist; me, an
epidemiologist; my colleague,

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.390
Vasan Yegnasubramanian
who's a cancer biologist;

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.310
and Will Nelson who's
a medical oncologist

00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.610
and also a cancer biologist,

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.730
and we all come together
to do our research.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.790
Okay. So, let me start
with inflammation.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.850
So, what we hypothesize is that
chronic or recurrent inflammation

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.270
in the prostate itself,
so not systemic,

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.780
but actually in the
prostate, increases the risk

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.360
of the development
of prostate cancer.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.400
And we made this hypothesis
based on other cancers.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.830
We know that inflammation can
serve as both an initiator

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.150
and a promoter of cancer.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:31.110
Okay? So, think about H.
Pylori and stomach cancer.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.970
Okay. So, it's a bacterium
that increases inflammation

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.770
of the stomach mucosum, it's
known to be a risk factor

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.500
and a cause of stomach cancer.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.890 position:56%
Okay? If this hypothesis is true
for prostate cancer, we would expect

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.900
that inflammation would be
incredibly common in the prostate

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.650 position:56%
because prostate cancer's so common.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.420
All right?

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.810
So, do we know whether

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.730
or not inflammation is
common in the prostate?

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.960
Well, we do know that
based on studies

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.530
where tissue was removed
for indication.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.450
So, tissue removed when men have
benign prostatic hyperplasia,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.110 position:56%
tissue removed at the time of
biopsy if a man has an elevated PSA,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.980
and tissue removed at the time
of surgery for prostate cancer.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.030
But what we don't know is
in men without indication,

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.260
whether inflammation is
common in the prostate

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.300
because all these states tend
to be related to PSA level,

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.640
and it turns out that
inflammation increases PSA.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.380
Okay? So, it's sort of circular.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.420
So, what we needed was a
place where we could look

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.480
where men don't have an indication
for biopsy, and we'd be able

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.420
to get an unbiased estimate of
inflammation in the prostate.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.210
Well, turns out, there was a big
trial conducted called the Prostate

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.200
Cancer Prevention Trial.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.320
It tested the drug finasteride,
which inhibits the enzyme

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.000
that catalyzes the conversion
of the male hormone testosterone

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.490
to another male hormone,
dihydrotestosterone.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:01.620
And, in that trial, they
biopsied the men at the end.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.700
Irrespective of whether
they had an elevated PSA.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.400
Irrespective if they had an
abnormal digital rectal exam.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.460 position:56%
And, so, we were able to collaborate
with the investigators on this trial

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.910
to use that biopsy tissue.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.070
The majority of the men,
at tend of the trial,

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.030
did not have indication for biopsy.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.330
They were just biopsy
as part of the trial.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.260
Okay? So here are the results
of that study that we did.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.750 position:56%
Okay? First thing to note is that
78 percent of the controls, meaning,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.820
men who were not diagnosed with
prostate cancer in the trial,

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:37.310
had at least one biopsy
core with inflammation.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:40.880
About six to ten we are taken,
we sampled three per man,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.990
so men who had at least one of
those three with inflammation

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.980
in it, that was our measure.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.870
Okay? And 78 percent of the
controls had inflammation

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.170
and at least one core.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.010
Okay? So, it turns out
inflammation is incredibly common

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.310
in the prostate.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.610
It probably needs to be there.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:01.290
You probably need inflammatory
cells to clear any type of agent

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.850
like E. coli that might
enter the prostate.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.980
Prostates actually opened
to the outside environment

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.280
and will give you process.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.580
It's open to the outside
environment,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.270
so you need immune
cells present to be able

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.800
to clear those types of agents.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.470
So it makes sense.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.620
Okay? And, then, something
else to note is the prevalence

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.160
of inflammation in the cases.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.730
So total prostate cancer, about
86 percent had one or more core

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.330
with inflammation and high
grade disease, which, again,

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.700
is a prognostic marker
by 88 percent.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.390
Okay? And, then, if we looked at
the association between having

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.970
at least one biopsy core with
inflammation and the risk

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:40.310
of prostate cancer, we found
about an 80 percent increased risk

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.740
from men who at least one core
positive and even higher risk,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.760
so it's about twice the risk for
men who had at least one core,

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.130
and the outcome here
was high grade disease.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.900
Okay? So, again, these
were end of study biopsies.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.280
We actually measured inflammation
in those biopsies that were used

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.800
to rule in or out the
diagnosis of prostate cancer.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.930
Okay? So, what that means is our
study was not temporally correct,

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:10.830
so we didn't have biopsies
from men who, biopsies from men

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.530
and then follow them forward for
the development of prostate cancer

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.910
because not a lot of men would
volunteer for a study like that

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.070
where you, like, 100
thousand men say we're going

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.330
to biopsy your prostate and
then follow forward in time.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.640
So, the study we did
was not prospective.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.040
It's not temporally correct.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.220 position:56%
But turns out through collaboration,

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.790
we were able to link the
prostate cancer prevention trial

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.080
with another trial conducted
by the same cooperative group.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.140
The next trial was called SELECT.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.620
Some of the men in the PCPT
participated in SELECT,

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.870
which means their end of study
biopsy became the baseline biopsy

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.890
for that next trial, therefore,

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:55.220
we were able to conduct a
prospective cohort study

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.840
of inflammation in the
etiology of prostate cancer.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.420
Okay? So, here's the design.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.200
So, again, the end of study biopsy

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.960
from PCPT became the
baseline biopsy in SELECT.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.460 position:56%
We assessed inflammation in that
biopsy and then determined who ended

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.150
up with prostate cancer later.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.470
Okay? And this work is supported
by the Department of Defense.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.770
All right?

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:18.070
And here's what we saw.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.180
We saw men who at least,
had at least one biopsy core

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.750
of inflammation in the controls
with 72 percent, so very similar

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.410
to what we had seen before.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.910 position:56%
And you can see that in, with
various outcomes, low grade disease,

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.350
men with low PSA but with prostate
cancer, men with low grade disease,

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:37.320
and suppose to say, and low PSA,
all these men had a higher risk

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.080
if they had at least one
core with inflammation.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.520
Now, what's missing from
here is high grade disease,

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.070
and it's because very few men in
the study had high grade disease.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:53.250 position:56%
They had to make it through the
PCPT and then enter SELECT, and, so,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.660
once they got into this trial,
we had served depleted the men

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.110
of more aggressive disease.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.760
Okay? Never the less, we do
see evidence of an association.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.360 position:56%
And, so, this is the number of cores
with inflammation, so some cores

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.360
and then all cores, we
see a dose response.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.410
When we see dose response, we
tend to believe more strongly

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:17.730
that there's an association verses
when we don't see dose response.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.230
Okay. So what's the
clinical import of this work?

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.020
Well, if there's truly a causal
association between inflammation

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.060
and prostate cancer,
which we're hoping it is,

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.030
we need to do more
research, we may be able

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.440
to identify what it
is about inflammation.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.940
Which cells, which immune
cells are increasing the risk?

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.970
Okay? So, additional
work we could do.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.480
What's not going to happen is
inflammation will never be able

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.760
to be used as a tool to
screen for this disease,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.550
and the reason is it would
have a poor predictive value.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.510
So many men have inflammation
of prostate,

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.240
so I have no predictive
capacity whatsoever.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.250
Okay? But from understanding
the etiology of the disease,

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.640
we think that these findings
have potential import.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.720
Okay? So, move on to the
next topic, telomere length.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.980
So, telomeres are the
ends of the chromosomes.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:11.710 position:56%
Okay? They help maintain the patency
of the structure of the chromosome.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.960
They're known telomere shorten
with each round of replication,

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.790
and it's well recognized that
cancers have shorter telomeres

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.390
than normal tissue
from the same organ.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.810
So, we wanted to address
the question

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.420
of whether there's
prognostic information

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.890
in knowing telomere
length in prostate cancer.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.690
Okay? Again, this is a
multidisciplinary study done

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:37.450
with our colleagues in
cancer biology, and, so,

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:41.500
what we did is we had tissue
from men with prostate cancer,

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.430
we had the cancer, and we had the
cells near by called stromal cell.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.660
The stromal cells, the supportive
cells, so fiberglass, for example,

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.260
smooth muscle cells,
all from the prostate.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.360
We determined telomere length
using a technique called FISH.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.220
We were able to imagine
the telomeres,

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.990
we were able to determine
the length of the telomeres,

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:04.000
and what we found was it
wasn't how short the telomeres

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.170
in the cancers were because they
were short across the board,

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:11.280 position:56%
it was how variable telomere length
was from cancer cell to cancer cell.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.800
The greater the variability,
the higher the risk of death

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.450
from prostate cancer in those men.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.130
Okay? When we looked at the
cells near by, the stromal cells,

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:24.710
it turned out how short the
telomeres were was associated

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.730
with risk of death
from prostate cancer.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.650 position:56%
And when we put those two parameters
together, those two measurements,

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.780
what we found is that men
who had the combinations,

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.650
purple bar is the combination
of more variable telomere length

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:42.980
from cell to cell in the cancer
combined with shorter telomeres

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:49.680
in the stromal cells was associated
with 14 times the risk of dying

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.960
of prostate cancer in men with
prostate cancer, even after taking

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.440
into account the other
known prognostic markers.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.130
Okay? This is a very
strong association.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.390
We tend not to see associations
like this in epidemiology.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:08.720
Okay? The men in the middle
bars had other combinations.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.710
So, they either had variable
in the cancer and not short,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.020
or they had not variable and short.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.370 position:56%
Okay? And, so, you can see that they
also have increased risk but not

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:23.420
on the order of the men
with the poor combination.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.140
Okay? All right?

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.190
And, so, let's talk a
little bit about these men.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:33.120
So, the men who had this better
profile, so the men who are here,

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.780
they had less variability in their
telomere length from cancer cell

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.060
to cancer cell, and they had longer
telomeres in their stromal cells.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.690
Only one man died of
his prostate cancer.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:45.380
Okay? We had expected about six
men to have died in this cohort.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.130
The time for this one man,
from diagnosis to death,

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.470
was a very long time, 16.5
years, which is longer

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:56.980
than the usual life expectancy for
a man who had Gleason 9 disease.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.260
Okay? This is the very,
usually considered

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:04.320 position:56%
to be a very aggressive disease, but
he managed to live a very long time.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.100
And, again, there was only one man
who died of his disease in those

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.940
who had what we considered to
be the good combination, so.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.850
Less variable and longer.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.390
Among the men who had more variable
telomere length in the cancer

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.430
and shorter telomeres
in the stromal,

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:25.610 position:56%
20 men died, about 10 were expected.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.680
Okay? So that's a big,
big difference.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.340
And the median time from diagnosis

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.360
to prostate cancer death
was about eight years.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.790
So, you can see this one
man live twice as long

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.050
as would have been expected.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.860
Okay? So, we don't
think this was an error.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.870 position:56%
Okay? So we -- if our biomarker
works very well, you'd expect no men

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.430
in that group to have
died of prostate cancer.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:48.370
Well, this one man who did died
of it, his time to death was twice

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:53.460
that in the group that we
think has the worse prognosis.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.010
All right?

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.280
So, now let's tie together
the findings that we just,

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.310
I just showed you for
telomere length with some

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:01.610
of the modifiable factors.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.600
And, so, this is work done in
collaboration with Cory Joshu.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.390
She's an assistant
professor in our department,

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.470
and this work was supported,
her specific work,

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:13.310
was supported by the
Prostate Cancer Foundation.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.060
Okay? So, I've told you that
her work showed that men

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.780
who gained weight had a
higher risk of recurring

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.790 position:56%
after treatment for prostate cancer.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.860
So, what she wanted to
do was to look at obesity

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.840
in relation to telomere length.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.960
Okay? We didn't want to look into
cancer because the cancer we know

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.310
because of its higher proliferation
rate and just greater damage

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:34.960
that goes on in cancer cells.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.320
It didn't make sense
to look at obesity

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.610
and telomere length in the cancers.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.900
Instead, what she did, she
looked in stromal cells.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.200
So, recall that we saw
that short telomeres

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.150
in the stromal were
related to an increased risk

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.680
of prostate cancer death.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.130
So, when she looked in the
stromal, men who were overweight,

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.010
were obese, had shorter telomeres.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:51:01.010
Okay? So, men who were overweight
had shorter telomeres, overweight

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.020
or obese, than men who
were of normal weight.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.970
Okay? This is in the stromal cells.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.130
Okay. When she looked
at physical activity,

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:14.550
men who had low physical activity
levels had shorter telomeres.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.120 position:56%
Okay. This had not been seen before.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.740
No one has been able to look in the
tissue, in the target organ itself.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.120
Okay? So, now we're seeing
evidence of potential impact

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.250 position:56%
of these modifiable risk factors
for prostate cancer, lethal disease,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:34.170
and poor outcome, and their effects
potentially on telomere length.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:38.830
Okay? When she combined obesity and
inactivity, she found that the men

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.680
who were obese and had low
physical activity levels had

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:47.500
about 21 percent shorter telomeres
in their stromal cells than men

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.320
who were normal weight
and were active.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.250
Okay? And she also
looked at smoking.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.550
So, remember her finding.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.680
Men who continue to smoke have
a higher risk of recurrence.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.460
She looked at smoking
and telomere length.

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.850
There was no relationship with
how short the telomeres were,

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.610
but in the stromal and
actually in the cancer as well,

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.300
she noted relationships between
smoking and how variable,

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.830
and just to remind you,
more variability is worse.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.130
Okay? So, variables worse.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:20.090
So, these are the men who are never
smokers, and, so, they have --

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:21.390
here's never smokers again.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.460
These are people who quit recently
and these are the current smokers.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.760
So variabilities worse.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.060
This is more variable.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.930
Okay? All right.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.620
So, that's some few examples

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.880
of contemporary research
on prostate cancers.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.120
The last thing I want to do
is discuss the controversies

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.610
in the early detection
of prostate cancer,

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.000
and by early detection,
we mean screening.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.230
And, so, I want to remind
you what screening is.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:46.000
So, screening is the use of a test

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.400
in individuals who
are A symptomatic.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.150 position:56%
Okay? And that test is used to
determine whether a person is likely

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.320
or not likely to have
the disease or state.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.970
It doesn't mean they have it.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.830
Okay? So, it's that they're likely
to have, more likely to have it.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.100
Okay? And, then, usually, there's
diagnostic workup that needs

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.780
to happen to actually determine
whether or not disease is present.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.870
Okay? So that's what screening is.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.810
And, so, we know that PSA-based
prostate cancer screening has had a

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.830
profound effect on prostate cancer
in the U.S. and in other places

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:23.010
where this type of screening
has been used more widely.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.680
Okay? And, so, recall this figure
from the American Cancer Society.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.480
We saw this huge bump in the
incidence, the number of new cases,

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.170
because of PSA-based
prostate cancer screening.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:39.350
And I also showed you the change
in survival, five-year survival,

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:43.420 position:56%
and this change is because of
PSA-based prostate cancer screening.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.390
But I should also tell
you that a lot

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.940
of this 100 percent
survivorship consists of men,

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.610
if their cancer hadn't
been detected,

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.820
it would have never
killed him, killed them.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.230
Okay? Because we've over
detected the disease.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:54:00.290
Okay. And the pre-PSA era, these
were men who were symptomatic

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:04.820
at diagnosis or had clinically
palpable disease of their prostate.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:09.760
Okay? So, we have to consider
the benefits verses the harms.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.880
We, as a public health discipline
and also the medical community,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.710
convinced everybody that screening

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:19.050
for cancer is necessarily
good, right?

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.770
We wanted people to be screened.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.540
It was the right thing to do.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.170 position:56%
We made people feel guilty about it,

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:27.110
but that was a population-level
recommendation.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:30.540
We now realize that we've
overdone it to some extent,

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.390 position:56%
and so what we're doing now is we're
pulling back and we're thinking

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.670
about who should be
targeted for screening.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.410 position:56%
Who is at highest risk and that risk
may change throughout the lifetime.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.920
Okay? We need to think about
this because there's a tradeoff

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.790
between the benefits of screening
and the harms of screening.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:48.700
A lot of people say, well, there
aren't harms for screening.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.000
Well, but they are.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.230
Okay? So, we pick up disease that
may not be cancer at all, but, yet,

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.700
are medically worked up,
surgically worked up.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.490
We pick up cancers
that are indolent,

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.140
would have never caused
premature mortality,

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.240
so you're better off not
knowing if you have it.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.610
And, then, there's
adverse effects related

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.360
to the tests themselves including
the diagnostic workup, and,

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.530
certainly, the adverse effects
of associative treatments.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.890
Okay? There's also
psychological harms, right?

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.240
There's the worry.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.140
If someone turns out
to be a false positive,

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.840
they're told that their
screening test is positive,

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.140
but on diagnostic workup they're
negative, imagine the worry.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.530 position:56%
Okay? A person will always think, I
probably do have the disease, right?

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:26.830
It's a problem.

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.340
Okay? Plus, we have the burden
on our healthcare system, right?

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.640
There's cost.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.940
There's actual cost.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.390
Okay? So we have to
be cognizant of that.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.690
All right?

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.980
And, then, we have this problem
where our guidelines keep evolving,

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.280
but that's important, right?

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.360
We're updating our evidence base,

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.960
but the public isn't
able to respond to that.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.730
Okay? And, so, there's confusion.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.030
Doctors are confused.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.770 position:56%
They don't know what they're
supposed to do, who are you supposed

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:52.400
to screen, when you screen.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.220
It's very complicated.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.420
And, again, these uncertainties are
coming up because of good reasons.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.560
We have new knowledge, new
evidence, and we have new tools.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.370
But as these come online, the
recommendations are not changing

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:08.100
across all of our societies,
right, our professional societies.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.680
They're not changing at
the same time concurrently

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.660
in the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.850
for the American Cancer Society,
so everyone's getting confused.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.990
Okay? Before the message
was you should be screened,

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.290
now the message is changing.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:22.270
Okay? So for prostate
cancer, the first thing

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.930
that happened just a few years
ago, was there was a recommendation

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:28.090
to stop screening after age 70.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.370 position:56%
Okay? And the idea was that the risk

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.930
of other reasons why people
might die, why men might die,

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.840
actually become greater in that
age range than for prostate cancer,

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.100
especially for men who've made
it to 70, they've been screened,

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.390
the prior probability of
later having prostate cancer,

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.240
if you've been negative on those
screens multiple times, is low.

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.240
And, so, the idea was
just stop screening.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:55.610
But, then, the most recent change,
again, 2012, was to not screen

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.630
at all using PSA-based approach.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:03.110 position:56%
Okay? So, here's the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force website.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:04.870
Here's the recommendation.

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.680
Okay? They gave it a grade
of D. And, basically,

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.230
what they did is they
looked at the evidence base.

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.750
There were two large
trials that were published.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.290
One was done in Europe.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.760
One was done in the U.S. The study
in Europe was done in a background

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.920
of populations that did not have
a history of routine screening.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.700
The use of the test did result in
reduced prostate cancer mortality,

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.880
but at the expense
of over detection.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.180
They're very clear on their paper.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.040
They say that over 14 hundred
men would need to be screened

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.720
and 48 additional cases of
prostate cancer would need

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.810
to be treated to prevent one death.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:42.040
Okay? So, a lot of men
would need to be medicalized

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.470
to be able to prevent one death.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.120
Okay? In the U.S. study,
it was done on a background

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.350
of PSA-based prostate cancer
screening, and the prevalence

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.100
of that uptake increased
during the trial.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.220
So, by the end of the trial,
they did not find a relationship

00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:00.270
between PSA and reduction
in mortality.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.360
Okay? So, we already
have a background.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.150
So, these studies are not
inconsistent with each other,

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.180 position:56%
even though when it got into the
news, they were called inconsistent.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.260
It's the nature of what population
was included in the two studies.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.220
Okay. So, based on
this evidence base,

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:16.160
the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force found good evidence

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.570
that PSA screening can detect
early stage prostate cancer,

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.740
so the test does pick up the
disease, but there's mixed

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:26.960 position:56%
and inconclusive evidence that early
detection improves health outcomes.

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.400 position:56%
Okay? And they go on to talk about
the harms associated with screening,

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.790
so at the end, they concluded
that the evidence is insufficient

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.430
to determine whether the
benefits outweigh the harms

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.470
for a screened population.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.180
Of course, men got very upset.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.550
Okay? So, we had told everybody
go be screened, and then,

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.850
suddenly, we're going, nope!

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.150
Don't be screened.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:47.450
Okay? And, so, we saw
letters, we heard --

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.570
I had a man stop me in
a hotel hallway once.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.730
I was there to give a talk and was
in a hotel, and the man stopped me,

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.030
he said, "I'm a survivor.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.480
You can't let this happen."

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.750
Right? And, so, the
message that a lot of men

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:02.970
who were survivors was that,
but it saved me, right?

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:04.270
I was screened.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:05.570
I had prostate cancer.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.870
I was treated.

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.170
I'm alive.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:09.470
It saved me.

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:10.770 position:56%
Okay. Well, I'm sympathetic to this,

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.070
but we lack the counterfactual
state.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.370
We don't know what
would have happened

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.670
to this man had he
not been screened.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.420
Okay? Undoubtedly,
some men are saved.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.560
That decline in prostate cancer
mortality that we showed you,

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.700
no doubt is in part due to
prostate cancer screening.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:27.000
The problem is we pick up disease
we shouldn't be picking up.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.860
We do not have a tool
that, at this time,

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.580
will specifically identify
the cases that are likely

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.460
to result in premature mortality.

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.270
Okay? We do have differences
in guidelines.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:41.290
The American Cancer Society
guidelines say in men

00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:44.220
in average risk, screening
should start at age 50 plus,

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.830 position:56%
DRE couple with PSA, and it should
be based on informed decision making

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.330
between the individual and
the healthcare provider.

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:54.380
Man's own values need
to come into play.

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.480
His other health characteristics
need to come into play.

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.860
Okay? And that decision,
is that a joint decision,

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.820
between that patient
and his provider.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.120
Okay?

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.180
The AUA, based on the European
trial, has a series of guidelines.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:15.670
They recommend that screening could
occur for men 55 to 69 years old,

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:19.440
and, again, this would be in a
shared decision making setting.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.350
Okay? So, I do want to remind you
that under the Affordable Care Act,

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.340
there are certain preventive
services

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.320
that are covered without
cost sharing.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.210
You'll notice that PSA-based
prostate cancer screening is not

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.560
here, but others are.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.950
So, colorectal cancer screening,
mammography, and there's age ranges

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:37.230
and timing that are here.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:39.080
Okay? All right.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.640
So, what do we need urgently,
given the burden of this disease,

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.930
given that men do die
of this disease?

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.490
We need to figure out strategies

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:51.410
to improve the benefits verses the
harms in the screening that we do.

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:53.540
And, so, we need new
algorithms for use

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.460
of our current technology,
so who should we screen?

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.760
Which men?

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.060
When? How often?

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.360
And so on.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.660
So, that's an active
area of research.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.970
And we need new screening
tests all together,

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:07.920 position:56%
whether they're blood based or maybe
even better based on imagining.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.260
Okay? So, all of this
is under active study.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.560
Okay? So, I hope that
I've met the objectives

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.890
of talking with you today.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.890
We described the burden
of this disease.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:20.910
We talked about known and
suspected risk factors

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.690
for the disease and
including outcomes.

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.610
I gave you examples
of ongoing research,

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.310
and we discussed the controversies

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.530
in the early detection
of prostate cancer.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.490
And I just want to point out,
major knowledge gaps where we need

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.140
to put lots of attention.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.670
Why do African American men have
a higher risk of prostate cancer,

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.590
especially disease that kills?

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.250
Are there additional modifiable
factors for lethal disease

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:44.320
in poor outcome in men with a
disease that we can intervene on?

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.670
And what is the optimal prostate
cancer screening approach?

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.560
Okay? Going forward, make sure
we emphasize as risk factors,

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.900
not just for prostate cancer, but
for cancer in general, smoking,

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.550
obesity, inactivity, poor
diet, doing so is going

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.040
to desilo our diseases, right?

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.440
So, we tend to say, oh,
cardiovascular disease is

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.920
over there, diabetes
is here, cancer's here.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.010
Well, these are all
the same risk factors.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:13.130
We have to desilo and get the most
bang for our public health dollars.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:17.190 position:56%
It avoids duplication of efforts and
expenses, creates a seamless model

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.630
for public health promotion.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:23.550
Okay? And we want to
deemphasize controversial factors

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.670
and quick fixes, like magic pills.

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:28.310
Okay? We have to be active.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.640
We have to maintain
our weight, right?

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.730
We've got to quit smoking
or not start.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:34.020
Those are things we should work
on, and I'd like to acknowledge all

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.850
of my collaborators from both
Johns Hopkins, from Harvard.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.880
I've had a ton of trainees
over the years

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.500
who have contributed to this work.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.630
Also want to thank
the PCT investigators

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:48.270
who have provided a great
setting for us to do or our work.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:49.570
And, then, here's our school.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.830
We're celebrating our 100
anniversary this year.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.380
Here are my close colleagues,
Dr. Marzo, Dr. Meeker, Dr. Joshu,

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.710
and here's some of the team
members in my office one day,

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.280
and we just got a shot of us all.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.500
And, of course, the funders
for the work, NCI, DOD,

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.900
the Marilyn Cigarette Restitution
Fund at Johns Hopkins as well

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.940
as the Prostate Cancer
Foundation for Dr. Joshu.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.330
So, I thank you all for coming
today, and I'm open to questions.

01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:12.630
Thank you.

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:16.570 position:56%
So, the question was whether hormone
replacement therapy effects the

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:18.830
aggressiveness, either the presence

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.060
of prostate cancer or
its aggressiveness.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.520
And, so, you know, there is
some research that's being done.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.330
There are panels that are being
convened to try to understand,

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:31.370
do we have enough information
yet to say one way or another?

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.020
So, the answer's I don't
have an answer for you yet.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.860
Yup. So, the question is whether
there's a coordination of effort

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:42.310
for men who have BPH, and, yeah.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.730 position:56%
It depends on what order you want to
say the words, and, so, basically,

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.190
in large prostate that
produces symptoms

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:50.780
in prostate cancer,
and, so, you're right.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.780
These men tend to overlap.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.610
The region where BPH
occurs in the prostate

01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:59.220
and where the cancer occurs
are actually different regions.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.140
And, so, some people try to
study whether ones a risk factor

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.440
for the another.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.780 position:56%
At this time, it doesn't appear that
one is a risk factor for the other,

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.720
instead, they seem to
have common risk factors.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.910
So, factors that influence
prostate cancer risk also tend

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.560 position:56%
to influence the development of BHP.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.660
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:21.090
So the question is: One,
Asian men have a lower risk

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.140
of prostate cancer.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:27.030
Given that there are differences in
what men eat and what they do based

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.640
on where they live
globally, has anyone tried

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.270
to evaluate whether an Asian diet
would prevent prostate cancer

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:36.570
in Western men?

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.900
Okay. And, so, one, I should
tell you when Asian men,

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:45.250
these are historical studies, when
Asian men move from Asia to the US,

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.860
which is actually Hawaii in
these studies, their own risk

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.890
of prostate cancer goes up.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:55.330
Their sons have a risk of
prostate cancer that begins

01:04:55.330 --> 01:05:01.030
to approach the risk of
White men living in Hawaii.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:06.130
Okay? So, that says it's probably
not genetics that are counting

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:10.230
for this profound racial
variation in prostate cancer risk.

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.590
It says it's probably
diet, lifestyle,

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:13.980
things people have control over.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:18.080
We haven't been able to
work out what is different

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.810
about the Asian diet, in Asia,
and risk of prostate cancer.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:28.910
So, we have not done major
trials of Asian style, diet,

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:30.940
and other factors, but we've tried

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:34.360
to isolate individual
factors in cohort studies.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.970
So, prospective studies, not
trials, but observational studies.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:41.840
We've tried to look at,
for example, soy intake.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.520
The problem is that people in the
U.S., in places like the U.S.,

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.240
don't eat a lot of soy
intentionally, right?

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.290 position:56%
We have soy that's mixed into our
foods that we don't even know about,

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:56.810 position:56%
but what men can report that
they're eating is low levels of soy.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.630
So we cannot pick up association.

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:00.260
So, it's a great question.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:04.160
We do not know what explains
the racial differences,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.430
the profound racial differences,

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:11.850
including the much lower
rate in Asian man in Asia.

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:16.530
So the question is: Beyond
looking at individual factors,

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.840
have we looked at contextual
factors.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.580
So, where people live,
their social structures,

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.130
not just whether healthcare's
available,

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:28.920
but whether people are able
to actually access healthcare,

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:34.390
and how this may affect differences
in risk of prostate cancer and,

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.380
in particular, prostate
cancer death.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.700
And, so, there are studies that
try to look at contextual factors.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.550
So, these are factors that are
above individual decision making

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:45.500
about whether you're going
to smoke and, you know,

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.450
physical inactivity, for example.

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:50.070
And, so, if you don't even have
sidewalks in your neighborhood,

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:51.370
how are you going to walk?

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:52.670
So, it's work like that.

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:54.980
And, so, my group has not
done that style of research,

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.800
but there are researchers who
are working in those areas.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.420
Thus far, we have not been
able to find those types

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:08.240
of contextual factors, aside
from looking at disparities

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.040
in prostate cancer outcomes
in equal access care systems

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.820
like within the VA.

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:18.280 position:56%
So, within the VA, it doesn't
matter who you are, there's a system

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.510
in place to make sure people
have equal access to care,

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:25.890
and so in those settings,
some studies have found

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:28.580
that the disparities are reduced,
others still see disparities

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.380
that the disease still
looks more aggressive,

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.750
for example, in African
American men.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:37.040
The question is: Who
is it that we are able

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.870
to study based on who participates?

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:44.410
Okay. So, historically, studies
were primarily White men,

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.840
these are prostate cancer studies,
maybe a little more well to do,

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:55.840
maybe less opposed to, sort of,

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.910
the worries about hospital
systems and so on.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:05.530
We have made, in the field,
not just for prostate cancer,

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:09.280 position:56%
but just in health research in
general, a concerted effort to reach

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.790
out to communities that were not
represented in earlier studies,

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.370
and there are now a
number of cohort study.

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:16.880
I'm an observational researcher.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.650
A number of cohort studies
that focus on communities

01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:23.250
that were traditionally
harder to reach,

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.600
so my colleague Bill Blot has a
cohort study called the Southern

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.040
Community Cohort Study.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:34.070
He went into clinics that
are federally subsidized,

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:37.430
recruited middle Asian
older individuals

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:39.540
to participate in those studies.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:42.080
Those studies are primarily
African Americans,

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.290
and he has done a really
tremendous job

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:47.480
of people, keeping people engaged.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.520
But we're still missing out
on the poorest of poor, right?

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.660
We're missing out on
people who are not connected

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.850
to health systems, right?

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:58.080
And, so, your question about
whether it could make a difference

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.650
in findings, it could, right?

01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:02.870
It could because it's not just a
single risk factor that we study,

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:05.170
it's a risk factor on a
background of other factors.

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:09.340
Okay? So, we do need
to keep this in mind.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.410
We need to make sure
we reach everybody.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:16.290
We have to make sure we, not
just recruit people into studies,

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.210
but maintain equal follow up.

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:19.970
It can be quite difficult.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:24.780
There are people whose research,
career, is around identifying,

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.990
recruiting, and retaining
people in studies.

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.210 position:56%
I think it's a very important point.

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:33.930
The NIH, when we receive money
for our research studies,

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:37.060
we report on the diversity
of those we've recruited.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.080
We've tried to make sure we
have sufficient representation

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.240
that we can look within
subgroups of individuals defined

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.530
by race ethnicity, defined by socio
economic status where possible.

01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:52.210
Okay. So, it's actually
two parts to your question.

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:56.950
And, so, he wanted to know what's
the research on sedentary behavior

01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.090
in risk of prostate cancer,
and, then, more specifically,

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.560
sedentary behavior that
puts pressure, actually,

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.350
it may not even be sedentary,
it could be active behavior,

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:06.470
that puts direct pressure
on the prostate.

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:11.590
So, with respect to sedentary
behavior, that's a newer area.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:17.560
So, it's more newly recognized that
there's a separate contribution

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.800 position:56%
to risk of cancers in other diseases

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.080
from being sedentary
verses just not being active

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.560
because there are some
people who are not,

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.890
they're not exercising, right?

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.190
There's no leisure
time physical activity,

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.190
but they're also not
seated all day long.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.770 position:56%
And, then, there are people like me.

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:32.850
I'm seated all day long, and,
then, I go to the gym, right?

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:36.170
So, I get my exercise in, but
I'm seated most of the day.

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:40.820
And, so, again, activity level
seems to have a different

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:46.980
and independent contribution from
the sedentary part of one's day.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.780
So, for prostate cancer,
that's a new area.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.060
So we don't have a
body of evidence yet.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.420
The question you asked
about behavior activity

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:59.020
and sedentary behaviors that put
district pressure on the prostate,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.320
it's an interesting question.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.070
We certainly know that if a man has
just ridden a bicycle and then goes

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:07.450
and has a PSA test, PSA will have
been, I'm going to use the word

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.840
"expressed", it leaks into
circulation, so there's advice not

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.930
to do that right before PSA test.

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:15.870 position:56%
But there's not, they're not, again,

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.530
not a body of studies
addressing that question.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.040
It's an interesting one.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.340
Yes?

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.960
&gt;&gt; You can have some
private conversation.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.000
