00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.380
We know how to take
derivatives of functions.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.730
If I apply the derivative
operator to x squared,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.760
I get 2x.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.450
Now, if I also apply
the derivative operator

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.200
to x squared plus
1, I also get 2x.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.650
If I apply the derivative
operator to x squared plus pi,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.810
I also get 2x.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.800
The derivative of
x squared is 2x.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.740
Derivative, with respect to x
of pi of a constant, is just 0.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.560
Derivative, with
respect to x of 1,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.370
is just a constant, is just 0.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.380
So once again, this is just
going to be equal to 2x.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.570
In general, the
derivative, with respect

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.740
to x of x squared
plus any constant,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.840
is going to be equal to 2x.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.920
The derivative of x squared,
with respect to x, is 2x.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.216
Derivative of a constant,
with respect to x,

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:55.840
a constant does not
change with respect

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.760
to x, so it's just equal to 0.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.510
So you have-- You apply
the derivative operator

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.280
to any of these
expressions and you get 2x.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.070
Now, let's go the
other way around.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.611
Let's think about
the antiderivative.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.900
And one way to think
about it is we're

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.400
doing the opposite of
the derivative operator.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.560
The derivative operator,
you get an expression

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.110
and you find it's derivative.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.170
Now, what we want to do,
is given some expression,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.763
we want to find what it
could be the derivative of.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.580
So if someone were
to tell-- or give

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.270
you 2x-- if someone were to
say 2x-- let me write this.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:51.420
So if someone were to ask you
what is 2x the derivative of?

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.510
They're essentially asking
you for the antiderivative.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.820
And so you could say, well, 2x
is the derivative of x squared.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.085
But you could also say 2x is the
derivative of x squared plus 1.

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:07.460
You could also say that 2x is
the derivative of x squared

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.769
plus pi, I think you
get the general idea.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.060
So if you wanted to write it
in the most general sense,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.070
you would write that
2x is the derivative

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.904
of x squared plus some constant.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.320
So this is what
you would consider

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.710
the antiderivative of 2x.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.860
Now, that's all
nice, but this is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.950
kind of clumsy to have to write
a sentence like this, so let's

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.150
come up with some notation
for the antiderivative.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.300
And the convention
here is to use

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.530
kind of a strange
looking notation, is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.390
to use a big elongated s
looking thing like that,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.080
and a dx around the
function that you're

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.690
trying to take the
antiderivative of.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.290
So in this case, it would
look something like this.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.560
This is just saying this is
equal to the antiderivative

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.770
of 2x, and the antiderivative
of 2x, we have already seen,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.660
is x squared plus c.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.780
Now, you might be
saying, why do we

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.240
use this type of crazy notation.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.120
It'll become more obvious when
we study the definite integral

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
and areas under curves and
taking sums of rectangles

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.220
in order to approximate
the area of the curve.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.050
Here, it really
should just be viewed

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.140
as a notation for
antiderivative.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.890
And this notation right over
here, this whole expression,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:35.060
is called the
indefinite integral

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.030
of 2x, which is another
way of just saying

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.010
the antiderivative of 2x.
