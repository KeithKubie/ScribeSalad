00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:01.650
- [Voiceover] So what we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.943
is several examples where
we evaluate expressions

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:06.306
with definite integrals

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.214
and so right over here we
have the definite integral

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:11.160
from negative two to three of 2 f(x)dx

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.401
plus the definite integral
from 3 to seven of

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:15.486
3 f(x)dx

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:16.626
and all we know about f(x)

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:19.453
is the graph of y=f(x)

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.005
from negative, from x equals negative six

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.414
to x equals seven.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.179
They also give us the areas between

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.560
f(x), y equals f(x)

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.651
and the x axis.

00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.434
The negative areas show that our function

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.635
is below the x axis

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:33.642
and so given that,

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:34.912
can we evaluate that

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:36.048
and like always,

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:38.002
pause the video and see if
you can do it on your own.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.524
Well the first thing that
my brain wants to do is

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:41.357
I want to,

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:46.161
I want to take these
constants out of the integral

00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:47.364
because then once they're out

00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:49.789
and I'm just taking the
straight up definite integrals

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.813
of f(x),

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:53.361
I can relate that to the areas over here

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:54.538
and I know I can do that

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:57.240
and this is a very common
integration property

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.615
and applies to definite
and indefinite integrals

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:01.418
but if I'm taking the integral of

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:03.585
k f(x)dx,

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:09.303
this is the same thing as k
times the integral of f(x)dx.

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:12.398
So let's just apply that property there

00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:14.422
which is really you're
taking the scaler outside

00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:15.929
of the integral.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.182
To say this is going to be the same thing

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:20.668
as two times the definite
integral from negative two

00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:24.001
to three of f(x)dx plus

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:30.672
three times the integral from
three to seven of f(x)dx.

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:35.073
All right.

00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:37.130
Now can we evaluate these things?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.463
So what is this going to be?

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.860
The definite integral
from negative two to three

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.918
of f(x)dx.

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:45.655
Well we can view that as the area

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.632
between the curves y
equals f(x) and the x axis,

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.705
between x equals negative
two and x equals three.

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:53.872
So between x equals two

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:56.981
and x equals three,

00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.997
they give us the area
between y equals f(x)

00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:01.304
and the x axis.

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:02.332
It is seven.

00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:03.573
So this thing over here

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:04.701
is seven

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:08.800
and then we have the
integral from three to seven

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.116
of f(x)

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:12.587
so we're gonna go from three to seven

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:13.832
and once again,

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.778
well this is going to evaluate

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:17.134
to a negative value

00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:19.291
because f(x) is below the x axis there

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.810
and it's going to evaluate
to negative three.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.708
So this is all going to be

00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:28.625
this is going to be two
times seven so 14 plus,

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.224
14 plus three times negative three

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.731
so plus negative nine

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.898
and so 14 minus nine is equal to five.

00:02:41.012 --> 00:02:42.147
This is fun.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:43.385
Let's do more of these.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:44.519
All right.

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.269
Okay, so here this first integral

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.866
the integral from zero to five

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.429
of f(x)dx,

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.046
so this is pretty straightforward.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:56.531
This right over here,

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.237
we're gonna go from zero to five.

00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:00.038
Zero to five

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:02.031
and of f(x)dx,

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.170
so we're talking about this area there

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.643
which they tell us is four

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.792
so that was pretty easy to evaluate

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.596
and now we're gonna subtract,

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:12.752
we're gonna subtract
going from negative eight

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:16.315
to negative four times 2f(x),

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:18.096
well let's just take this two outside.

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:21.096
So if we just take this two outside,

00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:25.170
then this just becomes the
integral from negative eight

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.174
to negative four of f(x)

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:28.674
and so this thing,

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:31.916
this thing right over here

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:33.416
evaluates to five.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.627
It's this area they're talking about.

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:38.232
So this is all going to simplify to

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:41.417
four minus that two that we brought out,

00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.167
minus two times five.

00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:47.180
Times five, which is equal to

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.550
let's see four minus 10

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.997
which is equal to negative six.

00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:55.971
All right.

00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:58.436
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:02.352
So here I have the integral
from negative seven

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:03.689
to negative five

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.483
so I'm going from negative seven

00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:07.535
to negative five

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.053
which is, it's gonna be right around there

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:11.366
so I want to find,

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:13.366
I want to find this area

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.327
right over here.

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:18.075
So I want to find that area.

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:19.695
That's that

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:23.390
and then I'm gonna go from
negative five to zero.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.364
So then this is going to be

00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:29.031
going from negative five to zero

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.458
so it's gonna be all of that.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.935
Now there's a couple of
ways you can think about

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:35.979
doing it.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.697
You can assume I have some symmetry here

00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:39.254
and they don't tell it for sure

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:42.345
but it looks very symmetric
around x equals negative five

00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.089
so you could assume that this eight

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:45.576
is split between these two regions

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:46.778
but an easier way to do it

00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:47.952
is just to realize look,

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:49.951
I went from negative seven

00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:50.993
to negative five

00:04:50.993 --> 00:04:52.819
and then from negative five to zero

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.366
and I'm integrating the same thing.

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:55.722
F(x)dx

00:04:55.722 --> 00:04:57.673
so this integral I can rewrite

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.898
as the integral from negative seven

00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:04.051
so negative seven all the way to zero

00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:07.871
of f(x), f(x)dx

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.525
and so really that's just going to be

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:11.901
the net area between negative seven

00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.067
and zero

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:15.334
and so we have the positive eight there

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:18.354
so this is going to be
equal to the positive eight

00:05:18.354 --> 00:05:20.719
and then we have the negative one there

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:21.958
so minus one

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958
which is equal to seven.
