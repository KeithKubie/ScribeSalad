00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.035
 When I was young, games were developed only by big companies 

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:09.348
 Which includes hundreds of employees and generates millions of dollars. 

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:13.905
 Now any two friends can meet at leisure and develop games. 

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.778
 The Balloons was one of the first great games we developed, 

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.080
 It is a classic balloons game. 

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.330
 It was the first thing everyone said 

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:22.708
 It is difficult and impossible, not fun for users. 

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.000
 Although we had an audience, 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
 But not asking for comments hurt us a lot. 

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:29.122
 This is what we did in "KleptoCats". 

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.330
 We did nothing at all and then we checked all the comments 

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:34.500
 Sent by users to try to improve the game. 

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.125
 We discover the sensitive point between what we offer 

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.622
 And what users want to be able to continue. 

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.877
 To encourage players to continue playing, 

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:49.333
 We try to improve the sources of fun and the aspects that make the games interesting. 

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:52.030
 We believe it at times 

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:55.000
 When you make a surprise gift for you, the game offers a lot of emotions. 

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:57.292
 It is a kind of gifts offered by Gasha machines, 

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.018
 Where you get a gift you do not know what. 

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:05.030
 For a long time, the simplified games were not desirable, but this is not our opinion. 

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:09.033
 We have adopted the development of simplified games and try to provide experiences that respect your time 

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:11.497
 It does not include a barrier to entry. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.257
 The mission of SkyAlert is to save lives. 

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:20.772
 Mexico is constantly exposed to earthquakes. 

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:25.415
 So we need to invent technology that will help us live better, 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.262
 And to coexist with seismic phenomena, 

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.937
 And better equip our society to deal with them. 

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.562
 What you need to think about when launching a subscription form, 

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.940
 Is the value you will provide to the user. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.417
 This app lets you receive multiple notifications in real time 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.888
 When our network of monitoring devices is confirmed 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.792
 Of an earthquake. 

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:57.208
 We started sending warnings about earthquakes, incorporating new features and models. 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.750
 This will convert users to subscribers, 

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.667
 Achieving a retention rate of approximately 50%. 

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.208
 People continue to use the application daily 

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.833
 Three months after downloading it. 

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:16.508
 We have about 47% of users paying an annual subscription, 

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.450
 And 53% pay monthly. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.275
 Once the application is self-renewing, the company will become self-sustaining. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.458
 In the Latin American market, 70% of people are obese. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.703
 Only 3% of them can reach the gym. 

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.292
 With InstaFit, users are available without worry, 

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:39.797
 Or without spending a large amount, or having to go to a gym, 

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.750
 Or purchase equipment or weights, 

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.708
 Where they receive daily programs 

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.792
 Very diverse and includes all kinds of exercises, 

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.250
 It can be done at home 

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.223
 In an area of ​​10 square feet without needing anything else. 

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.120
 The subscription form is the future. 

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.547
 The subscription form lets you plan your earnings 

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:03.013
 Thus creating a sustainable business that grows through the user base involved. 

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:08.907
 Last year, we achieved a growth of 450% in the Android subscriber base, 

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.507
 Because of hiring a better team of internal developers. 

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:16.790
 We devoted much more resources to the marketing budget, 

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.632
 We started to do a lot of optimization tests 

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:24.115
 In both the acquisition and retention of users exclusively on Android. 

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.675
 One of our tests included a change 

00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:33.985
 The trial period is 7 days to 30 days. 

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:38.288
 This had a direct effect that led to a 25% 

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:41.643
 In the size of free trial periods. 

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.403
 Understand the needs of users 

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.377
 And support them during the application usage experience 

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:51.470
 You can establish a business that grows through a loyal user base 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.583
 Who have been following your app for a long time.
