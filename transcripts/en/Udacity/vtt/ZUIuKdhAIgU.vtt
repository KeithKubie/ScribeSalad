00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.850
One of the most important tips
I can give what they saw is

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.030
think like a search engine.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.290
You want to give signals
to the search engine.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.100
If it's Play, if it's iTunes,
if it's whatever search

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.960
engine there is that you're
app is relevant and useful.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.540
So for example anchor text.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.460
Anchor text is huge SEO.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.170
If you'll think about most of the,
let's say,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.066
articles that we know in the Internet.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.756
Google Play, iTunes,

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:35.800
Download, the anchor text has
nothing to do with the actual app.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.240
We're losing SEO juice.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.420
We're losing ASO juice.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.080
Make sure that the anchor text has
something to do with your app.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.524
The best closing app or
a game that's worth downloading or

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:50.550
a game about fish, whatever.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420
Make sure that the anchor
text makes sense.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.860
Also make sure to be that relevant.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.360
Make sure there's people that are not
uninstalling your app immediately.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.510
On that note, another great technique
to get users is paid campaigns.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.820
There's many ways to do it.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.010
There's many affiliate networks and
there's a lot of display campaigns.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.430
But because one of the best signals
that the app stores are getting

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.970
is a lot of downloads,
a lot of installs.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.570
Sometimes we want to invest in
getting more paid downloads.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.870
Because that will eventually
get you more organic downloads.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.350
Another thing is the comments.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.040
People that are giving bad reviews
are giving them mostly for a reason.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.620
And mostly because they didn't get
what they were expecting to get.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.400
So if you're using
a name that makes sense.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.730
If the images that you're
using actually elaborate and

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.830
explain what this
product is all about and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.350
is not some kind of illustration that
has nothing to do with your website.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.410
If the description is accurate and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.050
describes exactly what you're going
to get the metatext makes sense.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.380
Everything makes sense and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.040
correlates with your product,
that's the best approach.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.280
So, ASO tricks.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.786
The best thing that you can
do is optimize your web page.

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:15.350
You can A/B test everything from
the icon that is representing your app,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.770
to the description to the metatext to
the images to video that you're using.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.300
You can optimize everything.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.950
Another thing is if you have something
in the app store if you have an option

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.620
to do something targeted, use it.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.420
If there's special display for
tablet's, do it.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.130
If you can translate,
localization is so important.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.490
If you can use Portuguese for

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.300
Brazilian, translate your app
because that will be much better.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.280
Translate the images.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.190
Be professional.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.905
Invest time in creating the presentation
because that's the only

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.510
asset you can control.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.020
You can't control how people
will react to your app but

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.660
you can control about
what they understand.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.670
You can test it.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.420
You can test it.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.460
You can iterate about it.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.980
You can iterate on it.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.470
And that's the best advice I can get.
