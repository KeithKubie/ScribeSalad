in Britain and that that was a typical
 

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.309
in Britain and that that was a typical
late 18th century thing to do

00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:23.319
late 18th century thing to do
 

00:11:23.319 --> 00:11:28.499
late 18th century thing to do
and then later on without ever

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:28.509
and then later on without ever
 

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:31.199
and then later on without ever
explaining exactly how it happened you

00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:31.209
explaining exactly how it happened you
 

00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:34.470
explaining exactly how it happened you
say as it happened the American

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480
say as it happened the American
 

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.340

rebellion produced a stable government
 

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.360
rebellion produced a stable government
democratic institutions the president

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.370
democratic institutions the president
 

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.030
democratic institutions the president
first president did not become a

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040
first president did not become a
 

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.579
first president did not become a
dictator or a king and so you you then

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:50.589
dictator or a king and so you you then
 

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:51.940
dictator or a king and so you you then
say well you

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:51.950
say well you
 

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.780
say well you
had a different outcome which then goes

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:55.790
had a different outcome which then goes
 

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.720
had a different outcome which then goes
back to the original question if if if

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:58.730
back to the original question if if if
 

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.600
back to the original question if if if
the outcome is different

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.610
the outcome is different
 

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.320
the outcome is different
should the outcome have guided the

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.330
should the outcome have guided the
 

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.610
should the outcome have guided the
narrative into getting at the root of

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:09.620
narrative into getting at the root of
 

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.460
narrative into getting at the root of
why the outcome was was different and

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:12.470
why the outcome was was different and
 

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.860
why the outcome was was different and
that's where you go back to the what he

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:14.870
that's where you go back to the what he
 

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:23.230
that's where you go back to the what he
calls here the the traditional narrative

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240
calls here the the traditional narrative
 

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.080
calls here the the traditional narrative

like most political upheavals it rose

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.290
like most political upheavals it rose
 

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.330
like most political upheavals it rose
suddenly in the particular circumstances

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:11.340
suddenly in the particular circumstances
 

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.940
suddenly in the particular circumstances
a time and unrolled rapidly in ways

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:13.950
a time and unrolled rapidly in ways
 

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:20.620
a time and unrolled rapidly in ways
previously unforeseeable this is a

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:20.630
previously unforeseeable this is a
 

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.150
previously unforeseeable this is a
description that could be applied to

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160
description that could be applied to
 

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.190
description that could be applied to
everything that has happened in history

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:27.200
 

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:34.430
the question of the the developments of

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440
the question of the the developments of
 

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.690
the question of the the developments of
political people being unforeseeable

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:37.700
political people being unforeseeable
 

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.500
political people being unforeseeable
well

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:42.510
 

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.870
are there has there ever been any

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880
are there has there ever been any
 

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.829
are there has there ever been any
political developments that are

00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839
political developments that are
 

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:49.730
political developments that are
unperceivable I mean foresight is really

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740
unperceivable I mean foresight is really
 

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.610
unperceivable I mean foresight is really
not something that works any human

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620
not something that works any human
 

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.069
not something that works any human
affairs very well so so then you get to

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079
affairs very well so so then you get to
 

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:02.900
affairs very well so so then you get to
a later part of the chapter and he he

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:02.910
a later part of the chapter and he he
 

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.579
a later part of the chapter and he he
says the French Revolution was part of

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:07.589
says the French Revolution was part of
