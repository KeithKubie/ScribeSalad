00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To talk about electric potential energy, let's imagine a universe

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that only has two charges in it and let's say they're both positive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the separation between these charges we'll call r.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And what I want to know is when do you think electric potential energy

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which I'm using a big U with the subscript E to indicate--when do you think that's highest?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you think it's highest when r is big? when it's small? Or maybe it doesn't matter what r is.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now when you're thinking about this question,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want you to think okay there's two positive charges. Are they going to attract or repel?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Given whatever that tendency is, if I move them closer

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
well is there going to be more energy stored in them or less?

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Are they going to have more capacity to do work or less?
