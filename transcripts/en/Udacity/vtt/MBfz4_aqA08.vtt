00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.290
So now that we have seen two policies
that try to approximate LRU replacement,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.620
let's see if we understood
how NMRU works.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.650
Suppose we have a fully associative
cache with only four lines and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.480
it's choosing NMRU replacement.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.060
Starts out empty,
none of the lines contain any blocks.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.840
And suppose the processor accesses
blocks in the following order.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.060
It accesses something in Block A,
then again something in Block A,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.990
then something in Block B,
then something in Block A,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.000
then something in Block C, then
something in Block A, then something in

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.336
Block D, then something in Block A,
then something in Block E.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:49.720
A, A, A, A, and
finally something in block B.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.130
The question for you.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.380
What's the smallest
number of cache misses

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.460
we will have on this sequence
of accesses, and what's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
the largest number of cache misses
that we might have on these accesses?
