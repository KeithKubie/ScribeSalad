00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.920
Today, we are going to be working
in the manner of Yayoi Kusama.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.920
Specifically.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
her Infinity Net paintings.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.960
These are the paintings that
really launched her career here in New York

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.150
City in the 1950s.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.420
You'll see that we're working on, I guess
what I'd say is a medium format painting.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.880
It will be an easel painting shortly,
as you'll see.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.680
You'll also notice that
this canvas is stretched.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859
And it is already primed here.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.099
Kusama, typically, not always.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.169
But almost always worked
on primed canvases.

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.169
And very much like all the other artists
we're discussing together in this course.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.680
There's not one way that Kusama
made an Infinity Net painting.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
There's not one way that Martin
made a gridded composition.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420
So we're just exploring one approach here.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.860
Feel free to experiment
quite wildly from this.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.860
All right.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.400
So what we're going to do here, first of all,
is to apply a base coat of a color.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.400
Let that dry.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.360
And then we're going to work on
top of that in so-called net to the gestural

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.220
brushstrokes
over this work.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.570
And in fact, because I'm pressed for
time a little bit.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.210
And you may be, too, in the studio.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.050
I certainly could work in oil.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.310
Put on a flat coat of oil.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.030
But then I might have to wait a week for
that oil to dry.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.219
So I'm going to work in a first
coat of acrylic emulsion paints.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.890
Those are water soluble paints.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.909
I'm going to let that dry and
use a hair dryer.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.380
You can dry it quite quickly.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.149
And then I'm going to switch to oil for
the top coat.

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.159
Rule of thumb here, one more time.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.159
Don't forget, please.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.929
It's totally fine to
work in oil over acrylic.

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.649
It is not totally fine to
work in acrylic over oil.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.939
If you paint acrylic over oil,
it's going to peel off rather quickly.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.139
Oil over acrylic, no problem.

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.549
That's what we're going to do here.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.549
Okay.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.140
So let's talk about mixing paints here.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.869
I'm working with acrylic emulsion paints.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.869
These happen to be made by Dick Blick.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.090
But there are plenty of the other
companies out there that make good ones.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.189
And what I've decided to do today Is
to make a black and white painting.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.030
As Kusama did so
many times early in her career.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.380
But black by itself is
a little bit boring.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.209
At least I happen to think so.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.869
So I'm going to juice up this black
a little bit by making it somewhat chromatic.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.840
I'm going to start off with
a generous douse of black paint here.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.800
What I'm going to do is use
a little bit of burnt umber.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.200
This is a much warmer color here.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
Kind of a dark brown color.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.030
Add some of that in there.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.970
And I'm going to make it a little
bit complicated with a dioxazine.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.810
An organic violet color.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.330
Adding some of that there, as well.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.280
Now, black and white are colors that really
overwhelm

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.810
what other colors you add them to.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.140
So this is still going to look quite
black by the time I'm done with it.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.220
Depending on the consistency
of your paint out of the tube.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.590
You may need to add water.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.010
I don't, because this is going to
be a nice brushable paint here.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.390
But if you're working with
some artist quality acrylic, sometimes they

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.260
have a heavy pigment load.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.820
Sometimes they're kind
of toothpaste thickness.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.800
And you may want to add some solvent.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.940
In this case, some water to thin that.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.260
So, nice thorough mixing there.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.230
You can use the canvas to clean off
your paint brush, your palette knife.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.360
Why not?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.160
Another thing to think about here is
what is going to happen to the edges?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.290
Kusama usually left the priming
visible on the edges of her canvas.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.560
And sometimes the net, the gestural
composition, goes slightly over the edge.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.970
That's what we're going to do here.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.460
Again, feel free to deviate this
from this model as much as you like.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.480
And what I'm going to do now.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.350
This is very similar to just the brushing
technique of how to gesso a painting.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.290
I'm just going to stretch
out this paint quite thinly.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.610
Quite widely here, using a lot of
action with the bristles of the brush.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.400
Forcing that paint down into all the
little interstices of the canvas here to make

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.700
sure I don't have any
white peeking through.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.830
Now, the reason I'm stretching this out
is that I don't want to have a lot of texture

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.830
here.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.830
Why?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.850
Well, the texture is going to come in
that second coat, as we'll see shortly.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.480
Other things you may do,
depending on your fancy here.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.630
You may use masking tape on
the edges of your priming here.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.210
And what that would do is allow
you to have a really crisp line between this

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.370
dark violet brown color.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.490
Violet black color that I'm adding here.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.630
And the white priming visible
on the edges of your canvas.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.790
Again, that's purely aesthetic.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.940
It has nothing to do with the structural
dimension of the painting.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.060
It's really just how it looks.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
Okay.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.150
So just very quickly fanning out this nice
kind of black violet layer I put on here.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.210
And now I'm really just barely
kissing over the canvas here.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.180
Barely touching it.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.040
So I'm really smoothing
out the surface and not leaving a whole lot

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040
of brushwork behind.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040
Okay.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.470
And because this is an acrylic emulsion paint,
it's waterborne paint.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.850
This is going to dry very quickly,
I've painted this very thinly.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.550
So it should dry within an hour or
something like that.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.040
Again, if you're in a rush.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.000
Using a hair dryer is a nice
way to speed up this process.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.470
Okay, so
our paint layer is now completely dry.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.580
And what I'm going to do next
is to do some sanding here.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.060
I'll tell you why in a second.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.850
But any time you're sanding paint, you
really need to make sure it's bone dry.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.340
Because if it's a little bit wet,
then you're going to end up smearing it.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.930
And pulling and perhaps tearing the paint.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.240
So, what I'm going to do here is just
work with a medium grit sandpaper.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.560
It's 120.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.540
You don't want to use something that's really
rough here.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.600
But it's not so
critical what grade you are using.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.590
And the reason I'm going do
some sanding here is twofold.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.720
One, I want to matte out this surface.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.510
As you can see, in the way that the light
is reflecting off the surface here.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.890
It's pretty glossy.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.290
And, in fact, the top coat that I'm
going to put on is also pretty glossy.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.480
So I want to provide a little
bit of interesting matte gloss relationships

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
here.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.820
So I'm going to sand out
the surface to matte this out.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.050
To provide a kind of counterpoint to the
glossy top coat that I'm about to put on.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.860
Number two, in sanding.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.740
[SOUND] I'm also starting to expose
the tops of the weave white again.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.510
So, in other words, I'm sanding off some
of this acrylic paint I just put on to give

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.630
me a really nice active surface.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.160
Not something that's so flat here.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.810
And you can see a little goes a long way.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.330
So, just very light sanding.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.840
[SOUND] One thing you don't
want to do is sand too hard.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.080
Push down too hard on the edges.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.570
Because remember,
looking at the back of the canvas.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.540
You have this wooden stretcher bar here.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.180
And if I'm sanding right over that edge.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.020
And I'm pushing down the canvas.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.660
I'm going to get a rather
stupid looking white line.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.840
A box within a box,
all the way around the painting.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.900
So, don't press here.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.449
Really just some light
sanding is all we need.

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:57.250
[SOUND]
All right.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.199
So we have the canvas on the easel now.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.930
We're going do some work with the brush.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.050
And I just want to
emphasize that this is not the way to make

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.280
an infinity net painting.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.460
Kusama worked in many different ways.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.820
Sometimes with sanding,
sometimes without, for example.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.560
What I've chosen to do here is to
work with a titanium white oil paint.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.430
Remember, oil over acrylic no problem.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.490
The reverse, big problem.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.560
Working with titanium white,
which is kind of a neutral white color.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.270
Not too warm.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.320
Slightly on the cool side of whites here.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.210
And hopefully has a nice contrast
with this roughed up background here.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.460
So what I'm going to start
doing here is just to squeeze some of this

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.510
paint from the tube here.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.669
And you see that its consistency
is very similar to toothpaste.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.979
Quite thick or quite pastose.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:46.740
As I'm getting a feel for
this paint here, it's quite sculptural.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.729
In fact, I'm actually working as
a sculptor here in the palette.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.590
Pushing this these really pastose,
this really stiff paint around.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.419
And it's that kind of use of oil here.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.660
The sculptural use of oil that we're
really going to be playing with.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.180
And my first brush load,
you see here, is kind of a scoop.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.960
Typically, you'd wipe off excess paint
from your brush to paint like this.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.449
I'm going to use that excess paint.

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:15.040
I'm scooping that paint up, almost
trowelling that paint onto the brush.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.550
And as I'm getting ready for
the first mark of the painting here, it's

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.790
just going to be
kind of a looping mark.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:28.930
Now I'm going to simply reload and
then make a similar one of those marks.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.320
And we start to see that, okay,
the gesture here was almost identical for

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
those two marks.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320
What kind of gesture is it?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.700
It's a movement of the fingers.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.700
The wrist is pretty much stationary.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.370
The elbow's absolutely stationary.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.360
So as we start seeing here, each one of these
brush strokes

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.360
is a little bit different.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.800
They're all off kilter,
they're all cousins.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.380
In a way, it's the same kind of
gestures here again and again.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:57.920
Slow, tracing gestures using
curves of the fingers,the thumb a little bit

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.130
of the knuckles here.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.970
Not really the wrist, not the elbows and
certainly not the torso like the.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.830
So something serial, there's definitely something
repetitious

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.140
about this kind of brush work.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.020
There is something therapeutic
about this kind of mark making.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.810
There are many legends about Kusama, many
of them propagated by the artist herself,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:22.610
that she would stay up for days on end,
with this kind of brush stroke and a huge

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.850
canvas, literally doing exactly what I'm
doing right now for three days straight.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.720
Now, whether that's actually true or not,
well, maybe we'll find out, maybe not.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.120
But, regardless, what I'd like you
to try to do here is really lose yourself

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.220
in this serial activity
here as a way to quiet the mind.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.450
Now I'm talking here and
trying to describe what I'm doing.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:50.020
But very likely in the studio, if you can
really lose yourself in this activity, you

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.230
won't be thinking about your job,
or your children, or whatever it is, whatever

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.760
kind of
stresses that you have on your mind.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.150
Normally, you can really lose
yourself in this activity.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.700
And this is not unique to painting.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:09.300
Some people get the same loss of inertia
and escape from anything repetitious.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.810
Chopping wood, running, sowing, whatever it
is that you're

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.440
accepting what's happening here.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.320
You're not doing any kind of aggressive
editing, you're just allowing the mind to

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.060
just accept what the hand is doing
here and really just to go with the flow.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.640
Because I'm working with
paint unadulterated here, straight out of

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.550
the tube, you'll notice
that there's a lot of very rich imposto.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.060
There's some very loud tracks
of the brush, if you will.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.240
All these bristles leaving these
strokes in the paint here.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.771
And you'll see that in some,
but not all of Kusama's work, because as I

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.430
run out of this paint.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.250
I'll change it, I'll do something else
to it, and then a different zone of this infinity

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.529
net will take on a different
character from a preceding one.

00:10:56.529 --> 00:11:01.990
It's important that these brush strokes
go all the way to the edge, and perhaps over

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.130
it.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.430
These infinity nets, they're all
over a composition meaning that.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:13.260
Just kind of slow gestural, tracing mark
making does indeed go all over the canvas.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.600
It's not something that is
kind of relational composition where you're

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.970
reading one
part to another part.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.640
Instead, this entire painting
will be able to of a kind, it will have a

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.120
kind of optical flow.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.180
Couple of things I'd like to
bring your attention to here.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.170
First of all,
I'm not doing a whole lot of editing.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.550
I'm accepting almost every
single mark that's made here.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.620
Also, I'm trying to really
have some kind of consistency.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.480
Not exactly the same kind of mark, but same
kind of speed, the same general

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.810
amount of paint on the brush.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:54.330
Also, I'm leaving roughly the same
amount of empty white space between all of

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.910
these marks, but you can
see that none of these are identical.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.500
Of course, each one is different, but they're
all informed by the same

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.540
general parameters of mark making.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.160
Where did Kusama's technique come from?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.950
Well, in the slide lecture this week, we talked
about her hallucinations

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.519
that she had as a young girl.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:18.840
But certainly, when she arrived
in New York City in the 1950s as a Japanese

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.459
woman, the odds were stacked
rather violently against her chances of becoming

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.950
a successful artist in this very
male dominated New York Avant-garde, Kusama

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.520
a very bright young woman.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.720
You better believe she did some careful
looking at the other painters around her.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.980
And I promise you that she was deeply and
very sensitively aware of the abstract

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.870
paintings of Philip Guston in the 1950s.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:48.640
Guston known for his very slow
anxiety-ridden kind of nervous brushwork.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.970
Which doesn't look identical to what
I'm doing here, and what Kusama often does

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.850
in her work, but rather,
it's a reference for Kusama.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.899
The slow sculpture or
sculpting type of brush stroke here.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:08.170
Because actually, if you look at each and
every one of these marks here,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.300
think about them as individual sculptures.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.940
And in fact,
when you start to explore Kusama's work, you

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.980
realize that she
does make sculptures but all these strange

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.510
little organic
protrusions off of them and really those are

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:25.170
an extension on this very sculptural
process of painting that she practiced.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.700
Okay, so I've a nice start here, and we can
see some really beautiful

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.860
texture being developed here, a lot of really
bizarre and

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.010
interesting little nnoks and crannies.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.990
These voids, these black voids in there.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.399
But I am going to use something
a little bit different.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:42.990
Adding a little bit of
a material called Maygilp.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.421
Maygilp has been used since the Italian
Renaissance and you can see it's thick, kind

00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:49.010
of this honey consistency.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:56.060
But you can see it's like adding
honey into your paint here.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.100
And it's going to soften the texture
of the paint considerably.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.709
So, this next area of the painting
that I'm going to be working with, is going

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:07.230
to have more of
a buttery consistency, rather than that toothpaste

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.290
consistency
of our first paint application.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.780
Kusama would more typically doing this, adding
some more medium to her paint in

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.089
a different hour of painting, let's say.

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:23.260
So that although the infinity net
is relatively consistent in terms of the color,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.120
in terms of the brushwork, etc.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.930
The paint itself does have these does
have these rather nebulous zones floating

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.800
around within it.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.880
And what you'll notice in a studio, when you
start adding more medium into

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.579
your paint, whether it's maygilp, as I'm working
here, or perhaps

00:14:37.579 --> 00:14:40.329
Venetian turpentine, another medium.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:42.920
Or just more binder,
more linseed oil or poppy.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.880
The oil is that the feed back
from your own hand has changed.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.030
And be sensitive to what
this paint feels like.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.240
Because it's really part of the process
as I'm feeling out this canvas, as I'm allowing

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.000
painting to
really grow in front of me here.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.160
The friction this really slow, solid,
mark making that I started out with here has

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.209
been replaced by something
much smoother, much softer and much more buttery

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.209
again, here.

00:15:07.209 --> 00:15:12.230
So that you hand knows that, and as you're
becoming a better painter, now when you look

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.440
at that paint, you should be able to
know, that's what that paint feels like.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.430
And this is going to help you when you
start going to museums and galleries, and

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.130
you start understanding how some
of these gestural paintings, the aesthetics

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.850
that the artists
are dealing with, have so much to do with

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.580
the way their
body moves with the way.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.490
That they've prepared the material
to track the different actions or gestures

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.290
of the body in different ways.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.970
So, even though my hand is moving in
the identical way, as I did earlier here,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.200
the pain feels different,
the paint looks different, and really, this

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.490
is the name of the game here.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.709
This is how this painting is
going to grow in an organic way.

00:15:50.709 --> 00:16:00.120
Okay, and for the third application here,
sticking with nice titanium white here.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.090
But now I'm just going to use
good old fashioned linseed oil.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.660
This is the binder that's
already in this paint.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:11.440
So, I'm just going to give it
a haphazard nice generous douse there.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.709
And again, I'm not going to be to methodical
about blending this paint perfectly.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:21.149
Because in fact, I like the fact that each
one of my brushstrokes are a little bit different

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:25.800
here, so, I’m just going to get
some of that nice juicy medium in there.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.950
And this is good enough, a kind of
heterogeneous, incompletely mixed, blobby,

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.310
kind of slimy
mixture of this paint.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.080
And this heterogeneity is what I'm
actually going to capture here.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.649
What I'm also going to capture is
a different geometry of my hand here.

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:44.060
Because everything I've been doing,
I happen to be right-handed, everything has

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.760
a certain logic to it,
based on how a right-handed person is going

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.200
to move the knuckles and
the wrist, so on and so forth.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.410
I don't want that to inform
the entire painting.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.029
So rather than paint left-handed, although
you could do that if you're feeling daring,

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:01.270
I'm just going to change
the orientation of the painting, and I'll

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.669
continue to do this a couple
times throughout the painting.

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:07.150
So that, again, it's one more variables that
each one

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:12.010
of these little zones Within the entire infinity
net composition is imparted

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.829
with a slightly different character.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:17.140
And now I'm going to carry on
painting exactly the same kind of gestural

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:22.049
slow brush mark that I
made before, but look at that already.

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:26.020
You'll notice that because this is so
poorly mixed, intentionally poorly mixed,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.000
that it's falling off of my brush.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.900
It's going to have a slightly lumpy,
moving blobby kind of a texture.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.850
Great, I'm accepting everything here,
and that's the name of the game.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.990
Work with it, don't try to force it to
follow any kind of preconceived notion of

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.270
what the painting should look like,
and allow it to be translating your hand in

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:52.140
different ways as you
move across the canvass.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:18:01.530
Okay, so after a nice course of painting
here, a painting that could be finished or

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.050
could keep going.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.410
Couple things I want to draw
your attention to, first of all, these different

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.660
zones of the painting
that each have their own character.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.220
This area here,
you can see these dry brush marks, which really

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.120
highlight the texture of the
canvas, at the end of those brush strokes,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.520
contrast that to a much more richly
painted area that has some really thick, kind

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.960
of blobby soft areas of paint.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.861
And then,
contrast that to some more thick paint, but

00:18:27.861 --> 00:18:29.460
here the texture is much heavier.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.090
We have a much more crisp kind of impasto
there, kind of a crackle of the paint as you

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.370
have some of these real
stiff spikes of paint peaking up.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.140
The reason for
changing that consistency is that, okay, this

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.210
is an all over composition,
but it doesn't get boring.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:49.230
Because your eye has no center of gravity
here, your eye kind of, restlessly moves around

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.580
this canvas, and it's not the same,
so that, wherever your eye roams, there's

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.490
always something really
satisfying for it to appreciate.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.679
This is the reason why Kusama's
painting work when they're real small.

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:07.360
When they're medium format, or when
they're huge and almost environmental.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.650
Other things to think about, some Kusama paintings
are not

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.400
painted as thickly as this.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.450
Some are actually quite thin,
others are thicker than this.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.070
So start to think about how
you want to handle your paint.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.669
Also, this painting is not necessarily
done, sometimes what she does then is to go

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:26.650
back into these black holes, if you
will, with something really dilute,and to

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.270
color them, or to make them glossy,
or to make them matte.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.970
So that essentially what we are dealing
with is a figure and a ground, only two part

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.470
painting, but she does very, very complex
handling of that figure and

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.730
that ground.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.470
So a painting here looks really simple,
white on black in the beginning but as we

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.880
start to test our hand and
also our eyes on them, we realize that there's

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.610
actually
a lot of complexity here.
