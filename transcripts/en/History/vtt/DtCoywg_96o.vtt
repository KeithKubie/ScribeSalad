00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:04.337
NARRATOR: In March of

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:06.214
Jr. traveled to
Memphis, Tennessee

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.758
to lead a group of
striking sanitation workers

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.468
in peaceful protest.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.513
He traveled to the city amid
threats against his life, which

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.265
had escalated as
his message grew

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:20.520
from seeking racial equality to
also seeking economic equality.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.231
The threats against
his life were real.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.483
Martin Luther King,
Jr. Was assassinated

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:29.738
in Memphis on April 4, 1968.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.906
The night before
his death, Dr. King

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.534
gave a speech at the
Mason Temple in Memphis

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.203
to promote the plight
of the striking workers.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.123
In it he discussed a
previous attempt on his life

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.918
in 1958, when a mentally ill
woman stabbed him with a letter

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:46.629
opener in a Harlem bookstore.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.965
The blade was so close
to a major artery

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.094
that the "New York Times"
reported, "If King had sneezed,

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.096
he would have died."

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.391
He used that speech to reflect
on how happy he was that he had

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.352
not sneezed, highlighting
the great achievements

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.062
he had witnessed.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.691
In 1960, students stood up by
sitting in at lunch counters

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.818
all over the south.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.988
In 1961, groups of black
and white Americans

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.199
rode buses for
freedom and an end

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.243
to segregation in
interstate travel.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.414
In 1963, black people
in Birmingham, Alabama

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.708
aroused the conscience
of the nation

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:27.462
and brought into being
the civil rights bill.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.923
He also spoke of the
personal accomplishments

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.759
he had made since the
assassination attempt.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.930
If Martin Luther King, Jr.
had sneezed back in 1958,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.849
he wouldn't have been able to
tell America about a dream he

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.186
once had, or gone
to Selma, Alabama

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.856
to see a great movement
there, or been in Memphis

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:50.109
to see a community rally
around his brothers and sisters

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.195
who were suffering.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.031
On the eve of his death,
Martin Luther King

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.492
declared that he
had no fear, that he

00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.036
had seen the promised
land and that one

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:03.373
day the world would reach it.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.333
So I'm happy tonight.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.293
I'm not worried about anything.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.754
I'm not fearing any man.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:13.633
Mine eyes have seen the
glory of the promised land.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.009
[cheering]

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.638
NARRATOR: He was
killed the next day.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.099
Shot in the neck while
standing on the balcony

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.061
of his second floor room at
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:29.482
He was rushed to the hospital,
and died within the hour.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.734
The ensuing manhunt
for King's killer

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.279
lasted for just
over three months,

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.531
ending with the capture
of James Earl Ray

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.410
at Heathrow Airport on June 8.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.495
The outpouring of
grief for King's death

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.456
was immediate and overwhelming.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:49.544
His assassination shook
people from all walks of life,

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:53.840
white, black, rich, poor.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.552
His loss was felt
across the nation.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.847
Robert F. Kennedy, campaigning
for the Democratic nomination

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.516
for president, informed
supporters at a rally

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.687
that King had died, remarking,
"We can make an effort,

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:12.692
as Martin Luther King did, to
understand and to comprehend,

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.279
and to replace that violence,
that stain of bloodshed that

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.074
has spread across our land,
with an effort to understand

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:23.828
with compassion and love."

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:28.374
Kennedy was killed
two months later.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.377
Some argue the civil rights
movement never fully recovered

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.671
after Dr. King's assassination.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.549
But most agree his
message of nonviolence

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.345
forever altered protest
movements in this country.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.973
His life continues to inspire
generations of Americans,

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.225
showing that those
united in peace

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.187
can be the greatest adversary
to conflict and injustice

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.396
around the world.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:53.608
