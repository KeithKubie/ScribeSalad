scenarios quite near to us nearer to us
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.660
scenarios quite near to us nearer to us
in time than a profound change in the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
in time than a profound change in the
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.249
in time than a profound change in the
Earth's climate and of course there's a

Earth's climate and of course there's a
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.440
Earth's climate and of course there's a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
and energy to worry
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910
and energy to worry
about climate change over a hundred

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
about climate change over a hundred
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.610
about climate change over a hundred
years we could lose sight of our ability

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
years we could lose sight of our ability
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.019
years we could lose sight of our ability
to destroy ourselves within five years
