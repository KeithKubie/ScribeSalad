FEMALE SPEAKER: Before
we do the introduction,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.380
I have a quick clip that
I wanted to show first.

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:11.660
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.900
RAMIT SETHI: Hey, guys.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.730
Ramit Sethi here.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.920
I'm actually in the studio
right now here in San Francisco,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.670
recording some videos
for another project.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.280
Today I want to talk
about social skills

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.120
and how I used to be
a freak of nature.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.550
You have funded your 401(k).

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.740
You've funded your Roth IRA.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.315
And it is all automatic.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:31.870
CHASE JARVIS: How's it going?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.520
I'm Chase Jarvis.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.910
I'm an artist and
an entrepreneur.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.160
And I'm lucky enough to be
sitting here with my man Ramit.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.618
RAMIT SETHI: It's
because we really

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:41.409
got deep into the psychology
of, you know, becoming the best.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:42.200
CHASE JARVIS: Yeah.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.616
RAMIT SETHI: I want you to ask
yourself the same question.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:46.459
What business are you really in?

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:47.750
SUSAN CAIN: Hi, I'm Susan Cain.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.180
I am author of the
book "Quiet: The Power

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.264
of Introverts in a World
That Can't Stop Talking."

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.096
RAMIT SETHI: Your book
made that very clear.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.640
And, as you mentioned, it's
almost, in a word, stigmatized.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.330
PAMELA SLIM: I'm
Pamela Slim, author

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.920
of "Escape From Cubicle
Nation," and the upcoming "Body

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.420
of Work."

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.461
KRIS CARR: Hi, everybody.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.635
I'm Kris Carr, and I'm the
founder of kriscarr.com.

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:06.176
RAMIT SETHI: Thank
you for coming in.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:08.650
If I asked you, what
percentage of your income

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.940
do you invest back in
yourself, what would you say?

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:15.330
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.155
FEMALE SPEAKER:
So that video clip

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:17.490
was a good intro for Ramit.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.790
But just for those who are
not familiar with his work,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.940
he's known for his witty advice
on a wide range of topics,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.900
from personal finance
to negotiation tactics,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300
to testing systems.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.420
That's a lot of what
we'll talk about today,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.340
to be your own master
of personal influence.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.930
And what he shares
is based on results

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.000
of hundreds of tests he's run
in his personal laboratory

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.430
of 500,000 monthly readers and
about 56,000 Twitter followers,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.930
I guess.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.180
That's just a little bit
of Twitter there for us.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.510
And much of his work is
based on his background

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.370
in personal influence
and persuasion

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.680
that he studied at Stanford.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.439
So today we'll hear
from him and talk

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.980
about his personal
experience and how

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.500
he's leveraged his
background in psychology

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
to grow himself
and his business.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.528
So please welcome Ramit.

00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:13.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:14.280
RAMIT SETHI: Thank you.

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:20.670
FEMALE SPEAKER:
How are you today?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.390
RAMIT SETHI: I'm great.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.260
Thank you for having me.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.135
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:26.400
Actually, let me kill the
video here so we can see that.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330
So let's talk a little bit
about your background first.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.460
And we've known that
you have worn many hats.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.420
You've been an entrepreneur, a
best selling author, business

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.940
owner, financial guru,
and you started out

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.220
as a finance blogger
a couple of years ago.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.320
So you even spoke here
at Google a couple years

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.640
ago about that book, "I
Will Teach You to Be Rich."

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.760
So tell us a little bit
about where you've come from.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.010
Where have you been?

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.490
And how did you go from being
that entrepreneurially minded

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.090
person-- graduate, to
where you are today?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.680
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I remember--
I have a pretty big family.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.982
And when I was in high
school, my parents

00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:06.440
were like, OK, you want to go
to college, which you have to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.570
because you're Indian-- so
if you want to go to college,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.980
you have to find scholarships
because we can't afford it.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.220
And so I remember
building a system

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.270
to apply to
scholarships rapidly.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.000
So I applied to
about 65 of them.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.250
And it occurred to me, I love
the systems part of this.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.129
I built the system.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.670
That's one of the systems I'm
most proud of because I applied

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.040
in a really cool
way, and I ended up

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.400
paying my way through school.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.816
And I took that
first scholarship,

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.450
and I invested it
in the stock market.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.950
This is like '99, 2000.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.220
That's what you do, right?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.520
And then I lost a lot of money.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.090
And I was like,
OK, I better learn

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.510
how this money stuff works.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.710
And so I started reading
books on personal finance

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.560
and investing.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.060
But at the same
time, I was studying

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.870
psychology and persuasion.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.655
And do you remember that book,
"The Emperor Has No Clothes?"

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:51.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: I do.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.500
RAMIT SETHI: And it's like--

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Movie too.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.660
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.330
And I'm looking at this advice
that everyone's telling us.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.590
Keep a budget.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.620
Stop spending money on lattes.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.260
And I'm like, nobody does this.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.920
Nobody listens.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.070
My friends, the
people in this room--

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.350
they don't want to stop
spending money on lattes.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.210
They want to live a rich life.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.240
They want to go out.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240
They want to buy a round of
drinks for their friends.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.198
Maybe they want to live
in an awesome apartment

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:14.470
or even have two apartments.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.042
And so this typical advice
just didn't make sense to me.

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:20.500
And I started applying what I
had learned in the psychology

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.360
area to money.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.660
And I started trying to teach
a class which nobody ever

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.650
came to.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.970
And so it's like, all right,
these lazy kids-- maybe

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.200
they'll read a blog
if I post a blog.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.760
So over time, I learned
how to write in a way

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.040
that-- a non- judgmental
way, where it's like, look,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.420
if you want to buy
$300 jeans, cool.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.100
Let me show you how to do that.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.290
And so I took that blog. .

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.450
And over time, I turned
it into a business.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.530
I wrote a book based on
the systems that I tested.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.910
And now, basically, my site
is not just about money.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.340
It's all about
living a rich life,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.840
whether that is traveling
or finding your dream job

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.210
or negotiating your salary.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.970
And it's all using the
strategies, tactics,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.170
and systems that we find
in the world of psychology.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: And you even
got an offer from Google

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.360
at one point.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.805
RAMIT SETHI: I accepted
an offer here actually.

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:11.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
accepted an offer.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.270
RAMIT SETHI: Well, it
was weird because-- OK,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.350
so the first time I applied
here, I got rejected.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.310
And then I was like, who
are you to reject me?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.450
So I came back the next year.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.720
This is why I'm unemployable.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.680
So I came back the next
year, and I applied again.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.420
And it was like a four
month interview process.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.370
So they're just
stringing me along.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.014
And then I was like, look,
guys, I have five other offers,

00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:33.930
and I need a decision.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.030
And they're like, OK, OK.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.340
So they made me the offer.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.180
And it was an APMM,
which was a great offer.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.160
And I felt like, wow.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.580
And I decided to come here.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.140
So I accepted the offer.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.557
And then they were like, why
don't you take some time off?

00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:48.139
You've been in school
for a long time.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.400
And I was like, oh, I will.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.600
I will.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.780
So they're like,
what do you need?

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.450
Two weeks?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.840
I was like, uh, I'll come
back in three months.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.770
So I take three
months for the summer.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.420
And at that time, my
friend was like, hey, come

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.800
work on this startup.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.320
And I started working on it.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.764
It was called PBwiki,
and it really took off.

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.180
And so I came back
to my recruiter

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.940
at the end of the
summer, and I was like,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.490
can I have a little
bit more time?

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.781
And she goes, what do you need?

00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:10.800
A week or two?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.450
I was like, how about two years?

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.930
And she's like,
I don't think so.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.160
So I decided to go
work at the startup.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.170
And that was a very
tough decision for me

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.910
because a lot of my
friends worked here.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.080
The company was amazing.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.780
The position was amazing.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.065
But ultimately, I decided
to go the startup route.

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:27.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.680
But you came in
for the free food.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.600
RAMIT SETHI: I came
in all the time.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.910
I mean, you don't
make that much money

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.994
as a startup entrepreneur.

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:34.493
And then you have
all these friends.

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.870
So I'm coming in like four
times a week to eat lunch,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.380
but I'm always going
with different friends.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.720
That's a good tactic.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.060
RAMIT SETHI: They didn't
catch on for a long time.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
a good strategy.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.160
Good to share.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.790
Good to share.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.980
Well, that's a good point.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.060
You bring up rejection.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.680
And a lot of us have
rejection all the time.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.930
And knowing that you've gone
through what you've done,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.270
how do you handle rejection,
even if it's not a Google

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.770
offer?

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.186
If there's something
big or small,

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:56.810
what do you do
when that happens?

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.510
And how do you repair and
come back from where that was?

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.580
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I think
all of us have been rejected.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.070
My philosophy is most of
us are not rejected enough.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.149
And so I have a folder in
my Gmail called Failures.

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.190
And if I'm not filling
that up with at least four

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.120
or five failures a
month, then I feel

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.510
like I'm not trying hard enough.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.085
So a failure could be as
simple as I emailed someone

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:20.960
that I want to have
lunch with, and they just

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.376
didn't reply to me, even though
I tried a couple of times.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.650
Or back in the day when
I applied for a job,

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.580
and I got rejected,
which happened a lot.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.900
One of the things that I try to
do to improve my failure rate

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.190
is to, number one,
to surround myself

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.880
with people who do the kind
of things I want to do.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.750
So if you have people who are,
let's say, more extroverted,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.940
or they're just great at
talking to random people,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.565
and that's something
I want to pick up,

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.910
I try to study them
and model that.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.541
Another thing is if you have
trouble going to the gym,

00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:54.040
I try to experiment in ways
that will make me go to the gym.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.270
Is it folding my clothes
before the night's over?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.080
Is it hiring a personal trainer?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.500
Notice that I didn't say,
I try to sit in my room

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.520
and say, OK, I'm going
to get better at this.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.410
Changing your attitude is
something that most of us try,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.620
but it rarely works.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.570
Attitudinal change
is extremely--

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.300
there's a low correlation
with behavioral change.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.810
So for me and for my students,
I focus on specifically,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.760
how do you change your behavior?

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.180
And then the
attitude will follow.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.680
That's a very different approach
than most of us are taught.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.200
We're taught things like, if I
show you this compound interest

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.770
chart, then you're
going to realize

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.429
how important it is
to start investing.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.280
And then you're going
to start investing.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.031
That doesn't work.

00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.446
There's a million compound
interest charts, and none of us

00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:38.159
invest.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.380
So what do we do instead?

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.400
We create defaults
to start investing.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.960
We build automated systems.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.480
We build systems so that by
default we do the right thing,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.310
instead of hoping
that we're going

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.475
to make the right decision
in certain times of the day.

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:52.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.860
And that's a good point
about following through

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.320
with what you want to do,
but you're not necessarily

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.920
doing that.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.560
So tell us a little bit
about how we can all

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.934
be a little better,
whether we're

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:04.370
wanting to invest or
start a new project

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.510
and knowing that
we should do it,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.960
versus actually
taking the action.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.630
How can we take that next step?

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.410
RAMIT SETHI: Well, all of us
know what we should be doing.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.840
And typically, they're the
same four or five things.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.540
I want to work out more.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.660
I want to have
better relationships

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.170
with the people around me.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.110
I want to eat better.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.770
I want to travel more.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.322
I want to save my
money and invest.

00:09:26.322 --> 00:09:28.530
These are the classic four
or five things that we all

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.630
know we should do,
and none of us do it.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.770
So what we typically do is we
go through these spurts of,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.520
OK, OK, OK, I know
what I'm going to do.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:36.790
All right.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.160
I'm motivated to do this today.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.460
I'm going to get this book.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.335
I'm going to read it.

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:41.860
And I'm going to buckle down.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.990
We use these words.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.160
If I try harder this month,
I can save that $100.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.660
All right.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.190
I'm going to go on
a diet this weekend.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.040
And that doesn't work.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.350
We do it over and over.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.870
We're guilted by experts
giving us these micro tactics.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.870
And I mean, if it
works for you, great.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.270
But frankly, we see the literacy
rate, financial literacy rates.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.290
We see how people
are overweight.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.260
We see all these
behavioral problems.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.540
So one of the things
that I focus on

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.930
is willpower is not enough.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.860
We've had a rash of books
recently about willpower.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.566
And we know trying
harder alone is not

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:18.690
going to solve the problem.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.195
Education alone is not
going to solve the problem.

00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:23.320
That's quite a radical
notion if you think about it

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.090
because think about what the
most money experts believe.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:31.600
They say, let's teach these
kids about financial literacy.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.755
What kid ever woke up
in the morning and said,

00:10:33.755 --> 00:10:35.940
yeah, I want to be
financially literate?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.582
Nobody.

00:10:36.582 --> 00:10:37.290
What do they say?

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.980
They say, I want to be rich.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.700
Right?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.460
And so speaking in our
customer's language, whoever

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.280
it may be-- and this is what
we do from a technical design

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.020
perspective.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.430
This is what I do from a
copywriting perspective.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.580
I can sit around and talk
about financial literacy,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.520
and exactly zero
people will care.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.170
Or I can talk about
living a rich life,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.420
automating your money so you
can get on with your life

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.950
because no one wants to be a
money expert or a negotiation

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.645
expert.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:05.930
And in my experience
with my testing,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.720
that is likely to really
generate behavioral change.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
speaking of your site,

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.290
"I Will Teach You to Be Rich,"
where a lot of this is done,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.237
that name itself
seems a little weird.

00:11:17.237 --> 00:11:18.320
RAMIT SETHI: Oh, does? it?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.790
It seems so normal to me.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
tell us a little bit

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.740
about what that's all about.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.040
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I was
sober when I picked the name.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.890
I was a college kid.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.580
But it wasn't like I was-- I
was just having a normal day.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.330
And I was like, oh,
let me pick this name.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.760
And I have come to
both love that decision

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.290
and regret it every
day of my life.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.530
It's a cool name.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.522
But let's be honest.

00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:39.980
The first time you
go to that site,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.140
you're like, what is this?

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.290
What is this weird site?

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.640
Who is this weird Indian dude?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.860
What's going on here?

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.580
And your defenses
are up a little bit.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.490
And I understand that.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.740
When you go to my
site, you will see me

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.200
with, say, Stanford graduate.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.090
That's not for my gigantic
ego, although I do have one.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.090
It's because I
have three seconds

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.470
to capture your attention.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.920
And you'll see me
on the Today Show.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.750
You'll see a video or
something like that.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.880
What I want people to
know is living a rich life

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.685
is only in a small
part about money.

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.810
But there's so many other
things that I talk about.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.570
So we talk about
negotiating your salary,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.010
finding your dream job,
starting a side business.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.560
And then one of the things
that I do with my site

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.440
that I think is a
little different

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.630
is-- has anyone here seen advice
that was just very generic?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.080
It's like, network.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.050
Go find people who are in
your network and become their.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.607
Friend You're like, OK.

00:12:36.607 --> 00:12:37.440
What does that mean?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.481
What am I supposed to do?

00:12:38.481 --> 00:12:40.540
Who are these people,
and what do I email them?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.080
So what I do with my material
is try to go ultra-specific.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.790
Here's the actual copy and
paste email that you can use.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.107
If you want to interview
better, if they

00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:53.690
ask you what's your
greatest weakness,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.930
I show you what to say and
how to use your body language.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.990
I think the true
sign of mastery is

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.620
to be able to show people a
very specific answer and then

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.600
once they get that
answer to teach them

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.290
how to think about
it in their own way.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.380
So try to get really
specific, give them

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.630
ultra-specific tactics,
and always focus on

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.240
mastery, not just
quick wins, big wins.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.115
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:16.115 --> 00:13:18.365
And I know on your site--
I've been there a few times.

00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.359
And your pages are just
scrolling in an endless way.

00:13:21.359 --> 00:13:22.900
And I think that's
really interesting

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.360
because you try to be
very specific and brief

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.870
and give advice on how
to connect with people.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.974
So why are those pages so long?

00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:30.890
What's going on there?

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.130
RAMIT SETHI: All right.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.080
So who here has ever seen
one of my sales pages for one

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.150
of my courses?

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.830
OK.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.038
So first of all, big shout
out to the front row here.

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:40.810
These are some of my students
who came in all the way

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.620
from Slovenia and DC.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.570
I want to give a big
shout out to you guys.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.530
They've all seen my sales pages.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.980
My business model is I give
away 98% of my material free.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.280
And then about 2% of
it is premium courses.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.867
These are online courses.

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:56.450
They're video.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.575
They're recorded typically.

00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:58.830
They're not live with me.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:05.210
And they may range from
14 days to eight weeks.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.970
They may range from a
couple $100 to $12,000.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.880
They're quite involved,
and they typically

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.200
take us 12 to 24 months
to build and test.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.020
And we collect 100,000 plus data
points for our biggest courses.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.620
Some of our biggest
courses-- the sales page

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.100
for those courses
is 57 pages long.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.820
And I know people in tech who
love-- especially engineers--

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.230
they love to say,
just keep it short.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.240
Just keep it concise.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.300
Just give them what they need.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.022
Totally wrong.

00:14:36.022 --> 00:14:37.480
And that's one of
the things I want

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.870
to talk about today, challenging
these assumptions that we have

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.720
with actual data,
with actual testing.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.572
So 57 pages long.

00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:46.030
A lot of people
say, who would ever

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.680
read a sales page
that's 57 pages long?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.590
And I know a very
sophisticated marketer.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.330
His emails are 15
to 30 pages long.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.810
And someone said to him, why
do you write those emails?

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.850
Who would ever read
a 30 page email.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.630
And he laughs and
says, only the buyers.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.940
So if you think of something
you have an intense pain point

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.610
with-- it could be back pain.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.656
It could be you have curly hair.

00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:14.030
If you have curly
hair, you think

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.697
about curly hair every
day of your life.

00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:16.696
What's the weather like?

00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:17.810
Is it going to be frizzy?

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.690
And there's a-- anywhere here?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.510
True?

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.630
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.650
It's OK to admit it.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.990
So you see a page that's
educational, informative.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.616
It's got other people like you.

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:32.180
You will read forever.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.000
And that's what we find when
we've tested short versus long.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And frankly, direct
response marketers

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.310
have known this for generations.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.120
Long copy, particularly
for more advanced material,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.271
almost always pulls
better than short copy.

00:15:46.271 --> 00:15:48.645
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I know
you also have a lot of scripts

00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:50.010
that you give away for free.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.090
And like you said, 98%
of your content is free.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.230
So do you have a favorite
one of those or something

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.930
that you'd want to share
that you enjoy talking about?

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.920
RAMIT SETHI: I like one.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.250
So one of the things
that I know when

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.200
I started doing things
a little different

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.040
was-- a lot of
people around me were

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.820
kind of peer pressuring me
to go back into the norm.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.860
So for an Indian
guy, you really have

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.550
two choices for your profession
and actually two choices

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.460
for your car.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.240
So anyone know what
Indian people drive?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.650
Toyota Camry, Honda Accord.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.360
And then what about jobs?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.147
What are your two job
options as an Indian guy?

00:16:25.147 --> 00:16:25.980
Engineer and doctor.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.040
OK, come on.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.310
Let's call a spade a spade.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.060
So I'm doing this
weird thing where

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.370
I'm doing this
online wiki company,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.816
and I got this weird blog.

00:16:33.816 --> 00:16:35.690
And they're just like,
what is going on here?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.940
So I had to learn how
to respond to that.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.940
And I think whenever you're
trying something new,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.550
you're in a very
vulnerable place.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.010
You're not even sure if
it's the right thing to do.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.340
And then you've got your
parents and your friends like,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.180
are you really sure about that?

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.920
And they do this
concerned troll thing.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.510
I'm just concerned about you.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.610
Are you going to be OK?

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.527
Has anyone here
experienced that?

00:16:57.527 --> 00:16:58.360
OK, a lot of people.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.149
It can be very debilitating.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:02.690
And if you don't
know how to respond,

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.810
it can really get to you.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.690
So I tested a lot of
different responses.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:08.650
And I liked this one.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.130
It's a "co-opetition"
model, we'll call it.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.490
And so what I used to do
was I would say, no, mom.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.990
This is what I want to do.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.589
And it was just-- that
never wins with anyone,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.880
whether it's a relationship
partner or a parent.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.922
What I would say
instead was-- I said,

00:17:25.922 --> 00:17:28.130
I don't really know if this
thing's going to work out

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.640
or not.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.220
I really don't know.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.410
But I figure it's worth a shot.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.040
And if it fails, who knows?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.290
But let me ask you a question.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.210
If you were in my position,
what would you do?

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.060
And so instead of fighting
against their criticism,

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.060
I co-opted it.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.070
And I actually
made them my ally.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.200
And when I've shared
that with my readers,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.600
they have found great results.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.634
Because all of us,
particularly when

00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.800
we're going through this
world of self development--

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.000
maybe we're learning yoga.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.270
Maybe we're starting to lose
weight or just trying improv.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.140
People around us will sometimes
get uncomfortable with that.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.034
And they may pressure
you to stop doing that.

00:18:03.034 --> 00:18:04.950
Maybe you're even just
trying to dress better.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.074
How do you respond to that?

00:18:06.074 --> 00:18:08.080
That's been a very good
script for my readers.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's good.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.250
That's good.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.490
And then the other thing
about your site and business

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.470
is that you do not accept
anyone with credit card debt.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.970
Correct?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.700
RAMIT SETHI: Correct.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.491
I don't accept people
with credit card debt

00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.780
into my flagship courses.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.190
That decision costs me
over $2 million a year.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.210
And I'm glad you brought it up.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:34.190
So I believe that-- when I
came out with this policy,

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.500
I was very clear about
why I was doing it.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.920
And I shared the
carrot and the stick.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.400
So I said, the carrot here
is an extra $1,000 or $2,000

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.680
from you-- it makes no
difference to my lifestyle.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.820
But it makes all the
difference to you.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.970
So don't spend your
$1,000 with me.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.460
Get my book from the library.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.540
Focus on your savings.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.650
Pay off your debt.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.441
And then when the time
is right, come back.

00:18:56.441 --> 00:18:57.830
I'm still going to be here.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.890
So I shared it with love because
I don't believe that ethically

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.960
I should be taking $2,000 from
someone with credit card debt.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.650
I don't need it.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.840
I don't want it.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.510
But then I put the
stick down too.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.400
I said, if I find out that you
joined my program with credit

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.070
card debt, not only will
I refund your money,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.110
but I will ban you for life.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.540
And so people are really scared
of me on my site, which I love.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.770
I'm like, great.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.592
And still people-- they defy me.

00:19:26.592 --> 00:19:29.050
They still join the course with
credit card debt sometimes.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.142
And we find out.

00:19:30.142 --> 00:19:31.350
And then we have to ban them.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.970
We put them on what's called
our DNS, do not sell list.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.110
And they're banned forever.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.484
But I believe that
when you start

00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:38.587
to become very
good at persuasion,

00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:39.420
it's like any skill.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.660
You can use it for
good, or you can use it

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.040
for nefarious purposes.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.080
And so I have a very clear
ethical guideline on,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.830
who do we sell to, and
who do we not sell to?

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.260
And I believe that if-- my
simple ethical guideline is

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.187
if everyone were
rational, and everyone

00:19:55.187 --> 00:19:56.770
had all the information
in the world--

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.030
just assume for a minute--
would they make this decision?

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.630
Would someone with 20
grand of credit card debt

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.020
pay $3,000 for a course?

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.540
Probably not, if
they understood how

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.220
interest rates work
and stuff like that.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.690
They may not understand
it, but I understand it.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.600
And so it's my obligation
to not sell to them.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.290
But on the other hand,
if it is right for them,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.060
and I know it could
help them, then it's

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.670
my obligation to sell
aggressively to them.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.170
That's my basic sort of ethical
compass for the business.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.128
FEMALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:20:26.128 --> 00:20:26.340
OK.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.920
So let's talk a little bit
then about mastering influence

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.220
and more about that
psychology behind it.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.200
So you have a lot
of connections.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.390
You've got contacts from Tim
Ferriss, "The 4-Hour Workweek,"

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.850
Seth Godin, the marketing
maven, Pamela Slim, Kris Carr,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.360
the folks we saw on the video.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.950
And how do you do that,
put your best foot forward

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.900
and keep an eye on the
business that you have?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.560
And then what advice would
you give us in this room

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.900
or on the web, what we can do
to start those relationships

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.200
and connect in that way?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.910
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I think
that more and more, people

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.780
are looking for
genuine connections.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.900
And the way I made friends
with a lot of those people

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.580
was just to email them.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.480
I just said, hey.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.670
And I always try to add value.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.885
One thing that you'll find
with especially people who

00:21:13.885 --> 00:21:15.880
are really, really
time crunched is

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.100
everyone wants a piece of them.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.050
So if you look in any
of those people's inbox,

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.130
they get like 1,000
plus emails a day.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.410
And 900 of them are people
asking for something.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.370
Can you send me this?

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.320
Can you do that?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.550
Can you write a
blurb for my book.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.030
And so it is so refreshing
when someone says,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.162
hey, I noticed that you've
been doing more videos.

00:21:35.162 --> 00:21:36.620
And I noticed that
there's this one

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.620
thing you could do to
increase your subscribers.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.230
And by the way, I
just did it for you.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.450
And here you go.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.880
And you're like, whoa.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.730
That's amazing.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.040
And then that person adds
value again and again.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.310
And all of a sudden, you're
like, who is this person?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.520
I want to know.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.370
Also, whenever I
try to email people,

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.470
I always try to mention
any relationship we have.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.730
So if I were here, I would
definitely be saying,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.787
I work at Google.

00:21:56.787 --> 00:21:58.370
Because a lot of
people will take your

00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:59.260
call if you work at Google.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.968
When I was a college
student, I told them

00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:01.990
where I go to college.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.050
And 95% of people would
say, cool, let's do lunch.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.469
That's just ways that I do it.

00:22:07.469 --> 00:22:09.010
I think one of the
other things to do

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.710
is what I call the closing
the loop technique.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.562
And that is to keep people--
always stay top of mind.

00:22:14.562 --> 00:22:17.020
I don't know how many people
here have had this experience.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.040
But I know I've met people.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.180
And I meet them at a
conference, or I email them.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.890
And we hit it off well.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.890
And then I just forget
to email them again.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.735
And a year later,
I'm like, oh, wow.

00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:28.860
It would be really helpful
if I could talk to them.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.910
And the relationship
has gone cold.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.000
So I always like to stay
top of mind for them.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.680
And typically, that means
something like emailing them

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.870
a value added link or
something that they

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.870
would find useful at
least once a month.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.010
Hey, here's something
I'm working on.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.240
I just wanted to
keep you in the loop.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.420
And here's a little trick
that I taught my readers,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.000
which I love because now 30% of
the emails I get use this line.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.290
I say, no reply needed.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.860
If you think of a
busy person, that's

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.609
actually adding value
to them because they

00:22:55.609 --> 00:22:57.870
don't feel the guilt and
urge to have to reply to you.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.370
You're like, hey,
here's a cool link

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.496
in the Wall Street Journal.

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:01.578
I remember when we talked.

00:23:01.578 --> 00:23:02.720
You told me about x, y, z.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.261
So I thought you'd
like this article.

00:23:04.261 --> 00:23:06.360
No reply needed, just
thought you would like it.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.776
You do that three or four
times, they're going to be like,

00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:09.735
this person is awesome.

00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:11.734
They're adding value to
my life, and they're not

00:23:11.734 --> 00:23:12.590
asking for anything.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.917
That's how I try to start
building relationships.

00:23:14.917 --> 00:23:16.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
no email blasts out

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.347
to the 500 contacts you
have, BCCing everyone.

00:23:20.347 --> 00:23:21.680
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I don't know.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.920
Does anyone do that anymore?

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.420
Does anyone do that?

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.830
I think that sometimes people
think that's sufficient

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.190
or that's a way to get after it.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.380
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.750
Relationships are
not about efficiency.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.600
You want to be efficient?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600
Try the dating market.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.310
You want to be efficient?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.726
You just go up to
a guy or a girl.

00:23:33.726 --> 00:23:34.820
You're like, hey.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.080
That's not how you
build a relationship.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.040
So I've seen people do the
quarterly updates and stuff.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.570
And OK, that's fine.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:43.130
I skim it.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.020
And then it doesn't
resonate at all.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.010
I would much rather
get just a quick email.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.995
It could be five lines.

00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:50.120
Hey, I was thinking of you.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.890
I remember what you
said about this.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.279
You should check this out.

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.320
Hope to talk to you soon.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:54.819
Bye.

00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:58.510
That's so much more
effective than a BCC blast.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.180
I mean, if you're
using the word blast,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.696
you've already gone wrong.

00:24:01.696 --> 00:24:02.571
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:03.060
Yeah.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.560
And I think it comes down to
the genuinity and authenticity,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.440
so really connecting
with that person,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.730
researching them a little
bit, and just going

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.326
in on that personalized
individual email.

00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:13.076
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:13.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:13.590
That's a good idea.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.965
RAMIT SETHI: I think it's
interesting you said efficiency

00:24:15.965 --> 00:24:17.710
because particularly
here in Silicon,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.670
we're so deep in the
world of efficiency

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.860
that we think everything
has to be efficient.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.510
Emails have to be short.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.990
Do you know how long my emails
are, the ones that people

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.130
read and buy a
lot of stuff from?

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.710
They're really long.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.040
What happens with that?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.984
One, it filters out all
the illiterate people.

00:24:35.984 --> 00:24:36.900
And so I'm like, good.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.530
Get off my site.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.160
Just unsubscribe.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.826
Here's the link.

00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:39.590
Get away.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.800
But then the people who are
left are highly committed.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.310
They want to read it,
provided it's adding value,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.210
and it's really
interesting and engaging.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.080
And we've tested it.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.080
We've done short
versus really long.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.770
Why do you think
we keep doing long?

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.870
Number one, it's more fun.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:54.953
I like to write like that.

00:24:54.953 --> 00:24:56.270
But two, it actually works.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.170
So I would urge everyone to step
out of the efficiency mindset.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.240
Efficiency can be
great in certain areas.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.920
But if you're building
a relationship,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.300
you don't be efficient.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.130
If you're communicating
with someone,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.210
efficiency sometimes
matters, but prose

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.055
and emotional
connection also matter.

00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:13.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.650
Well, it sounds like you've
got a really good pulse based

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.620
on all the testing
that you've done

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.270
on those in this room, the
Generation Y, millennials,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.090
Generation X, that
kind of thing.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.960
So what are some
of the challenges

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.760
that we face as a
group, whether it's

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.967
Silicon Valley or
anywhere, where we just

00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:32.800
want to be efficient
and that kind of thing?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.790
What are some of the big
ones that come top of mind?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.700
RAMIT SETHI: For me,
the biggest challenges

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.120
that I see with myself and
with my friends and my students

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.750
is, number one, distraction.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.000
We just have an infinite number
of things that we could do.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.310
And I know just from
the last 10 years.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.130
I used to be able to focus and
just write pages and pages.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.550
And now I'm checking my
email, going to Reddit,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.186
reading Hacker News, checking
all this crazy Twitter stuff.

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:02.560
And I think the
second thing is--

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.100
it ties in, which
is too many options.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.040
And we have so many options
that it's easy to get paralyzed.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.740
And it's a little ironic
when we hear older people.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.090
Our parents might say
to us, when I had a job,

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.590
I was just happy
to have any job.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.840
And I took that job, and I
stuck with it for 30 years.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.950
Well, that's great.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.370
But that's not how the
world works anymore.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.640
And it's difficult to
find other people who

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.480
understand because the only
other people who understand

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.494
that are the people like us.

00:26:30.494 --> 00:26:32.410
We're going through that
same thing right now.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.630
We don't have the answers.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.770
So I've really spent
a lot of time working

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.120
on how to help my
students follow through,

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.440
how to help them focus, how to
remove all these ideas that you

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.230
have to do this.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.260
You have to do that.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.843
You have to be on
this social network.

00:26:46.843 --> 00:26:48.600
You have to do all
these million things.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.680
And really take an
80-20 perspective

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.680
to say, what are the key
big wins that matter?

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.457
And forget the
rest of this stuff.

00:26:55.457 --> 00:26:57.790
If you just get these four
or five big wins in your life

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.389
right, all the rest of
this stuff falls away.

00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:02.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: So how do
you not get overwhelmed

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.650
with all of that?

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.480
RAMIT SETHI: Well,
I focus on big wins.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.140
So let's take
money, for example.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.501
Who here feels like they are
100% on top of their money?

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:16.000
OK.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.531
We got one nerd in the
back who's like, me.

00:27:18.531 --> 00:27:19.030
All right.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:19.700
I like that.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.240
I like that.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.910
AUDIENCE: Huge spreadsheet.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.000
RAMIT SETHI: You have
a-- OK, I knew it.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.110
You have a huge spreadsheet.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.820
The only guy who still
uses a spreadsheet

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.653
to manage his money.

00:27:25.653 --> 00:27:29.050
And who here feels like
there's something, at least

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.650
one thing we should be doing
more with our money, probably

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.609
more like 10 things?

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.400
OK, almost every single
person in the room.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.280
So then when we
think about, what

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.980
should we be doing
with our money?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.540
It's like, we wake
up in the morning,

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.660
and we could not go to coffee.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.240
We could cancel
that dinner we have.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.180
We could adjust
our student debt,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.360
change our asset allocation,
increase our savings.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.910
There's a million
things we can do.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.990
And when faced
with these choices,

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.420
we do the same thing we've
always done, which is nothing.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.800
What my approach is, and
which is based on psychology,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.320
is there is a such thing
as analysis paralysis.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.720
There is the paradox of choice.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.170
So what I tell people is focus
on the four or five big wins.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.430
Get a dream job.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.340
Negotiate your salary.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.030
Invest automatically so you
don't have to think about it.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.130
It's not a decision.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.200
If you do these
four or five things,

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.670
it doesn't matter how
many lattes you buy.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.720
It doesn't matter if you buy
a small Coke or a large Coke.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.530
It doesn't matter.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.654
None of that stuff matters.

00:28:25.654 --> 00:28:27.470
Those are micro
decisions that are

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.240
irrelevant in the
grand scheme of things.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.800
People are like, you
could save $3 a day.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.300
That doesn't add up to anything
if you actually do the math.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.100
People are like, save $3 a day.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.570
In 48 years, you'll
have $12,000.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.370
OK.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.870
That's it?

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.161
And I'm going to live a
miserable life every single day

00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:44.230
from here until then?

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.874
What if I could
negotiate my salary?

00:28:45.874 --> 00:28:47.790
What if I could optimize
my credit score, just

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.110
these four or five things.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.870
How many lattes
would that be worth?

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.660
And I could live the
kind of life I want.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.130
So when it comes to
so many decisions,

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.340
I want to focus on
reducing it and focus on

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.660
just the major ones,
ignore the rest.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.140
They will work themselves out.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: So for us, where
we've got these challenges,

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.376
and there's a lot
going on in our world,

00:29:08.376 --> 00:29:11.370
we are all good at a lot of that
efficiency stuff, taking tests,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.560
getting good grades,
especially here at Google.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.544
So we want to go
off the beaten path.

00:29:15.544 --> 00:29:16.710
We want to take those risks.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.230
We want to work harder to
do what our dream jobs are.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.690
So how do you take
that first step.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.536
And where can we excel to start
moving off the beaten path?

00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:29.440
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I think
that's pretty savvy to say.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.480
If you've made it
here, you're probably

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.690
really good at excelling
on the beaten path.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't all
leave your jobs, by the way.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.700
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.565
I have to be very careful here.

00:29:39.565 --> 00:29:44.140
If you're here, if you're
watching this, you're a nerd.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.840
You're really good--
let's be honest.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.010
You're really good
at taking tests.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.670
You're really good at getting
the approval of people

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.460
who matter.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.710
And honestly, that's important.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.320
When people say,
oh, just do what

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.850
you want-- if you
want to win, you

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.350
have to learn how
to play the game.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.940
And you have to
win at that game.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.840
And then you can win
at the other games.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.400
So I truly believe in that.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.920
I'm not one of
these guys who says,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.420
skip college and just
do what you want.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.628
I think college is important.

00:30:08.628 --> 00:30:11.880
And I think learning how to
master these common situations

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.161
like social skills, finding
a job-- those are important.

00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:17.660
But at a certain
point, I know a lot

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.890
of people who made it to
the top of that mountain.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.340
They got the best job.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.015
They're getting
paid a lot of money.

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:26.260
And they're like, wait a minute.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.020
What else is it?

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.060
I made it up here,
and the view isn't

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.550
what I thought it would be.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.130
And so I think that
there's a lot of things

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.340
we actually can do.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.400
But it's incredibly scary.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.180
We can readjust
our expectations,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.610
which is something that
most of us don't want to do.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.650
We don't want less.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.750
We want more.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.810
That's OK.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.670
So going along that route,
one of the things I like to do

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.100
is take micro steps.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.810
So I always encourage my
students to start a side

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.180
business, not to quit
their jobs entirely and try

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.140
to raise $10 million in VC,
but to say, you know what?

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.610
There's something I like to do.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.859
Maybe I'll try it on the side.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.670
I'm going to learn how
to validate my idea,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.030
generate a little revenue.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.060
And let me just
see how this goes.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.060
We can look
expansively at saying,

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.451
how do I improve in my
personal development?

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:12.200
This is really interesting
to me because I

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.850
have a lot of friends
who are-- they work here,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.990
or they work at top companies.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.600
And they're amazing
at their jobs.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.190
They're so good.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.129
And the personal
development side of it--

00:31:23.129 --> 00:31:25.170
it's interesting to me
because about half of them

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.190
are super into
personal development.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.220
And half of them are
not into it at all.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.070
They think it's really weird to
read a self development book.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.800
I'm curious, out
of the crowd here--

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.357
who here never reads any
kind of self development?

00:31:37.357 --> 00:31:38.190
It's OK to admit it.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.080
I won't make fun of you.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.680
OK.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.090
Appreciate the honesty.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.330
And then who here reads self
development books or courses

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.640
or materials?

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.140
Wow.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.480
A lot of-- OK, so the
people who came here.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: A lot of
Googlers are developing--

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.180
RAMIT SETHI: The people who
came here read self development.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:51.800
That's shocking.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.896
RAMIT SETHI: OK.

00:31:52.896 --> 00:31:53.440
Amazing.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.940
All right.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.900
I love it.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.020
So I actually think
it's really interesting

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.300
that there are people who are
really good at their jobs.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.010
They're at the best companies.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.060
And they're not really
into self development.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.482
I also think that it's
OK to be a weirdo.

00:32:07.482 --> 00:32:09.440
I call people in this
room a nerd and a weirdo.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.360
I actually love it.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.820
I'm both of those things.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.890
And I'm fanatical
about self development.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.640
So one of the things
that I would strongly

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.806
encourage people to do when
they're trying to go off

00:32:17.806 --> 00:32:20.450
the beaten path is to develop
themselves professionally,

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.390
whether that is books,
courses, coaches.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.130
It could be free.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.650
It could be paid.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:30.317
Find people who can save
you years of heartache

00:32:30.317 --> 00:32:31.900
by nudging you in
the right direction.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.370
That's worked
incredibly well for me.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.245
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:32:34.245 --> 00:32:36.714
So what are you doing
right now to have

00:32:36.714 --> 00:32:38.130
personal development
in your life?

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.213
Are you reading something?

00:32:39.213 --> 00:32:40.080
Do you have a coach?

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:40.830
RAMIT SETHI: I do.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.240
I have all of the above.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.690
I read, I mean, tons and
tons of self development.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.590
I have someone who--
one of my mentors

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.020
is someone who-- I
actually joined his class.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.150
And for 15 months, I flew from
New York to LA for 15 months

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.900
straight, once a month, just
to have 45 minutes with him.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.610
And it was incredibly--
it was life changing.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.460
It changed the way I
thought about business.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.310
I've invested in my health,
so food and training.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.220
And I'm huge on
self development.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.197
And it's made a
gigantic difference.

00:33:12.197 --> 00:33:14.030
But even when I think
about self development

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.780
when I was a college kid, I
didn't have that kind of money.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.730
But for me, self
development back then

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.950
was emailing some
CEO that I admired

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.860
and just asking if I could
take him out to lunch.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.900
And I put aside $20.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.571
The funny thing
is nobody lets you

00:33:28.571 --> 00:33:29.820
pay when you're a college kid.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.140
So I saved that money.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.550
But back then it was just--
that was my self development.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.330
And I think as you get more
successful in your career,

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.170
you can afford to join courses
or get a coach or things

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:41.680
like that.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.500
And truthfully, that has made
a huge difference for me.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.676
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I
think going back to that

00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:48.675
and then incorporating
it into the systems model

00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:51.304
and testing, a lot of that
a experimenting as well.

00:33:51.304 --> 00:33:52.470
What's going to work for me?

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.640
Maybe emailing
the CEO for lunch.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.520
Maybe it's a coach
or whatever it is,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.460
a book, whatever fits into
your lifestyle and your budget.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.270
So let's talk a little bit about
the systems and the testing

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:01.978
that you've done.

00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:02.645
RAMIT SETHI: OK.

00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:04.227
FEMALE SPEAKER:
You've created systems

00:34:04.227 --> 00:34:06.730
with improving a lot of things
in your life, productivity,

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.380
efficiencies, things like that.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.310
So what's a time
saving favorite system

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.872
that you have we could
all learn something from?

00:34:13.872 --> 00:34:14.705
RAMIT SETHI: OK, OK.

00:34:14.705 --> 00:34:16.250
I could talk about this all day.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.560
But I have a couple
things that I'll share.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.060
All right.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.270
Number one, if it doesn't
exist on my calendar,

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.440
it doesn't exist.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.580
So I get random
to-dos in my inbox.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.239
And I'm like, don't
send this to me.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.169
Get it on my
calendar, and that's

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:31.210
the way it will get done.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.489
If it doesn't exist on my
calendar, it doesn't exist.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.100
So we all have these
kind of random things

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.469
that we know we should be doing.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.344
And we actually don't
put it on our calendar.

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:40.659
We resist doing it.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.256
But if we put it there,
it's staring us in the face.

00:34:43.256 --> 00:34:44.130
So that's number one.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.088
Put it on the calendar.

00:34:45.088 --> 00:34:49.460
Number two, I am almost
fanatical about everything

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.320
in one place.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.610
And I'm going to reveal how
anal I am about certain things.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:54.719
All right.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:58.320
I find it really stressful if
I'm supposed to write a paper

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.910
or do something, and I
can't find something.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.920
I don't have a pen or
my research document

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.210
is even in the other room.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.220
I just won't get up.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.219
I'll just be like, oh,
I'm not going to do this.

00:35:07.219 --> 00:35:09.370
So I know myself.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.700
I need it to all be there.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.060
So I have constructed
systems that

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.870
make it so when I
open up my writing

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.140
calendar in the morning,
everything is there.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.620
Even when I open up
my calendar reminder--

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.930
this is how crazy it got.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:23.590
All right.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.798
Whatever, I'll just tell you.

00:35:24.798 --> 00:35:26.470
So I double click.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.080
I used to double click the link.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.240
And my assistant would
put "agenda," in,

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.280
and when I double clicked
it, it copied agenda.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.100
So I had to strip out the
agenda from the URL bar,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.950
manually backspace five times.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.640
And it just got me
really irritated.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.180
So I have a new policy.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.130
Always add a hard return,
so I can just double

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.859
click the link, Control L,
Control T, Control whatever.

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:49.650
And it just pastes.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.060
And I do it like that.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.130
So I know this is a
really micro example.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.050
But for me, if there was one
little minor barrier stopping

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.300
me from accomplishing
what I wanted to do,

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.640
I just wouldn't do it.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.230
And I think we all have that.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.350
But we guilt
ourselves into saying,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.640
oh, I should just try harder.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.190
Or you're just being lazy.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.440
I used to have this gym thing.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.148
I wanted to go to the
gym in the morning.

00:36:13.148 --> 00:36:15.310
And my clothes were
in the other room.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.840
And so I'd wake
up in the morning,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.997
and I would have to go to the
other room and get my clothes.

00:36:19.997 --> 00:36:21.080
And I just wouldn't do it.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.330
I would just stay in bed.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.350
I'm not lazy.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.390
But that one barrier alone
stopped me from doing it.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.169
So I learned through
testing to put

00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:30.460
my clothes folded on the floor.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.170
My shoes and socks
were right there.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.080
My gym compliance went way up.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.950
So I'm all about systems, even
to the point of ridiculousness.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.980
Whatever it takes to
help me get the things

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.400
done that I want to do.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.119
FEMALE SPEAKER: And what are--
so in that case, all of that

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:44.910
sounds really good.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.350
And I'm sure we're all going
to go right out of this room

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.810
and test out some system
that we've been thinking of.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.920
But what are some
common mistakes?

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.630
What can happen where it
might be testing something,

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.740
versus actually
implementing a system that

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.450
is typical for someone
who's new to this

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.574
or doesn't know what to do?

00:36:58.574 --> 00:37:02.820
RAMIT SETHI: Well, I think I've
made a few classic mistakes.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.920
I thought that once I
built a system, that's it.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.747
It just runs and
lives on its own,

00:37:06.747 --> 00:37:08.080
and you never have to change it.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.230
That's not true.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.710
Sometimes I-- I used to go
to the gym in the morning.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.380
And then I was going
out a lot at night.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.376
So my gym system in the
morning didn't work.

00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:19.000
So I had to move that
later in the day.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.890
Sometimes I just got crazy
busy, and my systems fell apart.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:24.360
I couldn't find certain things.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.380
That's OK.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.860
It's OK to have systems
change and be fluid.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.659
Sometimes you have
to refresh them.

00:37:29.659 --> 00:37:30.700
I think that's one thing.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.170
I think the other
thing is just-- again,

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.630
it comes back to being really
realistic with yourself.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.237
I know a lot of
people who-- they say,

00:37:39.237 --> 00:37:40.570
are you a morning person or not?

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.694
I'm a total morning person.

00:37:41.694 --> 00:37:42.730
I love waking up early.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.165
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm glad we
got this at 10 o'clock then.

00:37:44.165 --> 00:37:44.915
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:37:44.915 --> 00:37:47.970
I do all my writing, all my
cerebral work in the morning.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.110
And when you tell someone
you're a morning person,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.110
it's very interesting.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:55.430
There's two things that
happen, two situations

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.940
where people look at you
in an almost religious way.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.315
When you tell them you're a
morning person, they're like,

00:38:00.315 --> 00:38:02.530
oh, I wish I could be like that.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.950
And when I tell them that as
soon as I sit down in a plane,

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.930
I fall asleep.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.750
They're like, wow, I
wish I could do that.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.159
And I'm like, whatever.

00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.200
That's just the way I am.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.950
And also, I practiced to get
good at being a morning person.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:20.110
I think that sometimes we don't
acknowledge how we really are.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.600
So you'd have someone
who's really a night owl.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.740
And they're like, OK,
I'm going to start

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.650
by waking up at
5:45 in the morning

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.430
and writing for three hours.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.600
That's not going to happen.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.010
That's not a realistic system.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.030
Systems work for us.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.550
We don't work for the system.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.740
So I think it's critical to make
it a realistic part of who you

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.486
are and what your interests
and capabilities are.

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think that's actually

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.600
a pretty good point as well.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.400
And it's important to not just
abandon the system or give up.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.490
I think a lot of us say,
oh, that doesn't work.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.330
Obviously the gym
is just not for me.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.960
Or I'm not going to
bother to write anything,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.732
because I'm just--

00:38:56.732 --> 00:38:58.440
RAMIT SETHI: I'm not
that kind of person.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm just
not going to do that today

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.500
or whatever it is.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.940
So it's actually about that.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.981
And then just not beating
yourself up and saying,

00:39:03.981 --> 00:39:05.400
this simply doesn't work.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.550
I'm going to just tweak it.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.925
Or I'm going to
try one new thing

00:39:07.925 --> 00:39:09.459
and then implement something.

00:39:09.459 --> 00:39:11.500
And at Google, we have a
lot of systems here too.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.770
We have a lot of data.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.330
We data all the time.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.540
We make a lot of our
decisions-- and many companies

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.960
do as well-- just based on data
and facts and data, data, data

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.130
and incoming things.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.850
So what do you think
about data and how

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.530
that has made an impact on
what your decisions have been?

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.900
And is it all about the data?

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.108
Is there anything else there?

00:39:29.108 --> 00:39:30.990
And how has that
structured your business?

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.780
RAMIT SETHI: We use data a lot.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.830
We have analysts.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.990
We crunch numbers.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.170
We make projections.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.460
We split test many things.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.220
We have year long
tests that we run.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.280
We do very, very
quantitative measurement.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.175
But at the same time, we're very
interested in the qualitative.

00:39:49.175 --> 00:39:50.550
I would argue
actually we're more

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:51.950
interested in the qualitative.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.877
When we design our
courses-- again,

00:39:53.877 --> 00:39:55.460
these are the courses--
they sometimes

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.810
take two years to
build and test.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.060
We're collecting 100,000,
150,000 data points.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.470
And most of those
are qualitative.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.040
Especially at the
early stages, I

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.260
want to know the
words people use.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.920
I want to know the
emotions they feel.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.590
So we're asking all open
ended, qualitative questions.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.960
In my emails-- if anyone
here is on my email list,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.350
you've seen me say,
hey, please reply.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.010
I read every response.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.500
Has anyone here written back
to me and gotten a response?

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.000
OK.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.477
So if you're on my email list,
which has 200,000 plus people,

00:40:26.477 --> 00:40:27.310
you can write to me.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.600
And I'm not saying always,
but you'll get a response.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.850
I do that because I
want that kind of data.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.430
When it comes to art versus
science, we look at the data.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.207
But sometimes, we have
to put the data aside,

00:40:41.207 --> 00:40:43.040
just because it's not
the right thing to do.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.930
So we have-- we had courses
where the performance wasn't

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.911
good, but it was
within parameters.

00:40:49.911 --> 00:40:52.160
And we were just like, this
isn't the kind of delivery

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.310
we want to make
for our students.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.976
It's not the kind of
experience we want.

00:40:54.976 --> 00:40:57.670
So we pulled the course.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.460
But usually, the data is
very informative for us.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.830
And I can talk about what
kind of split tests we run

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.450
and our testing vault and
surprising results and all

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.950
that stuff.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:06.950
I love talking about it.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.380
But in general, I
think most of us

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.080
could depend on
data a little more.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.080
But the people who tend
to depend on data often

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.810
don't value the qualitative,
which I value above almost all.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it's
qualitative and quantitative.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.640
And in knowing that there's
these systems we could all

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.290
implement or think about
in a different way now,

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.750
what advice do you
have for implementing

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.980
that on our personal growth,
leading it back to that?

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.284
And where can we go from there?

00:41:33.284 --> 00:41:33.950
RAMIT SETHI: OK.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.200
So I recently ran a-- I'm
always running weird tests, just

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.100
simple ones.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.570
And one of them was, how do I--
I could take a 30 minute nap,

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.600
but I couldn't do
a 15 minutes nap.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.180
I would just sit in bed,
and I wouldn't go to sleep.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.690
And I was like, I want
to do a 15 minute nap.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.170
So it took me six months
to figure out how to do it.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:58.090
And it was-- I just-- and it's
like, there's no fancy Excel

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.340
regression thing that I built.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.600
It's on the back of a
piece of notepad paper.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.720
I just wrote down
a bunch of stuff.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.180
What did I eat?

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.820
Did that work?

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.030
What time of the day?

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.080
Did that work?

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.720
Was I stressed?

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.300
All kinds of crazy stuff.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.880
And I discovered
what worked for me.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.010
It took me six months.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.780
And now I can do
a 15 minute nap.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.590
Same thing for-- here's
a test you can do today.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.650
Someone comes up to you, and
they say, oh, what do you do?

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:27.210
And most of us have the
worst, most boring responses.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.795
I'm an engineer.

00:42:28.795 --> 00:42:30.214
I am a marketing coordinator.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.130
And the person's like--
their eyes glaze over.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.480
And they're just like, OK, bye.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.980
What if you could
actually test that

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.188
and make it more interesting?

00:42:36.188 --> 00:42:38.200
So for me, people used
to say, what do you do?

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.050
And I was like, I'm a writer.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.186
And they're like,
oh, my cousin too.

00:42:42.186 --> 00:42:44.060
My cousin's son is trying
to become a writer.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.310
I'm like, your cousin's
son is not a writer.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.200
Your cousin's son is unemployed.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.650
So then I was like,
I'm an author.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.300
And that got a very
different response.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.900
And whether it's,
what do you do?

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.374
Where do you live?

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.040
These are questions
that we give answers

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.800
to for our entire lives.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.960
And most of us never
test responses.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.140
All the responses were true.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.320
They were all authentic.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.240
But just a simple
way you word it

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.022
can get people
fascinated in you.

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:12.980
Or they can just be like,
oh, nice to meet you.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.689
I'm going to go get
that shrimp cocktail.

00:43:14.689 --> 00:43:16.854
FEMALE SPEAKER: So that's
a good challenge, I think,

00:43:16.854 --> 00:43:19.430
for us to take away today
and maybe try out today too.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.800
Just take an experiment.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.300
If someone you meet
or talks to you,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.466
what would you say that
might be a little different?

00:43:24.466 --> 00:43:26.125
And come up with how
that has affected

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:28.044
what your outcome
is with that person.

00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:28.835
That's a good idea.

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:29.090
I like that.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.423
RAMIT SETHI: Or another test--
so the social skills ones

00:43:31.423 --> 00:43:32.440
are really fun.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440
I met a group of people.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.200
Because my friends
when they get together,

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.500
they ask you within the first
five minutes, what do you do?

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.190
Anyone here-- are
you guys like that?

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:40.440
You ask people what do you do?

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.850
That's a common thing, right?

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.266
Because a lot of
my friends-- they

00:43:43.266 --> 00:43:44.700
identify with the work they do.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.349
I met this group of people
who-- I hung out with them

00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:48.140
two or three times.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.920
And they never ask me what I do.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.770
And I was like, what
is going on here?

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.312
But I then said, you know what?

00:43:54.312 --> 00:43:56.520
I kind of like this because
we're talking about stuff

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.300
that I would normally
never talk about.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.970
It has nothing to
do with my job.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.780
And I was like, this
is kind of refreshing.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.390
There is more to me than my job.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.410
So one of the things
I did was I just

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.080
created a little
challenge for myself.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.360
I was like, the next
time I meet people,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.700
I'm not allowed to
ask them what they do.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.087
And it was really hard.

00:44:13.087 --> 00:44:14.670
I mean, it's really
hard for me to do.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:15.290
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's a good one.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:17.260
RAMIT SETHI: So I
wonder, if we take

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.920
these little micro
challenges, how

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.190
does it help us grow socially?

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.020
And it really did help
me find other ways

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.800
to be interested in people.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:24.989
That's a good one.

00:44:24.989 --> 00:44:25.894
I like that too.

00:44:25.894 --> 00:44:28.060
So in a couple minutes,
we'll open up for questions.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.610
But just a couple of closing
questions I had for you.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:31.739
What is next, Ramit?

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:32.780
What are you going to do?

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.910
What's on your
agenda at this point?

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.170
You've got a lot of
irons in the fire.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.090
What are you working on?

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.320
RAMIT SETHI: I
have-- well, we're

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.130
always trying to do new things.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.350
For me, it's all about helping
people lead a rich life.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.650
And so whether that's
in the business world,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.530
whether that's
with social skills,

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.447
whether that's with
relationship stuff,

00:44:54.447 --> 00:44:56.030
if it's an online
course, that's fine.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.740
If it's in person, that's fine.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.240
Whatever.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.310
We're agnostic to that.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.851
We just want to find
out how to do it

00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:04.230
in a way that scales and using
our background in psychology

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.190
and stuff like that.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.040
We look at areas where
people have a burning desire

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.780
and the advice is horrible.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.330
And I'm like, that's for us.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.670
So money, burning desire,
the advice is terrible.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.220
How to start a business.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.400
A lot of people want to do it,
and the advice is really bad.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.710
We're like, see you there.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.650
So we're always looking for
opportunities like that.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.460
And that's been
pretty cool for us.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.420
So that's what's next,
just more of helping people

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.130
lead a rich life.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.075
I'm sure one day I'll do a
Ramit Sethi's parenting course.

00:45:37.075 --> 00:45:38.700
I always said, my
child is going to pay

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.197
for its entire existence in
its first year of living.

00:45:42.197 --> 00:45:43.405
So I'm just waiting for that.

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:43.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.530
20 or 21, something like that.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.810
And you talked about
rejection earlier.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.260
And that brings up a
lot of fear for people.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.640
So what is your
biggest fear when

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.530
you're looking at
developing something

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.150
or just in your personal world?

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.659
What are your fears,
if you had to name one?

00:45:58.659 --> 00:45:59.700
Because we all have them.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.011
RAMIT SETHI: We all do.

00:46:01.011 --> 00:46:02.010
I think I have a couple.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.780
I think for me, one
fear is being ordinary.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.300
I never wanted to be ordinary.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.070
And it made me nervous
to see what my path might

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.910
be if I took the default route.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.310
And then I think
another fear I have is

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.850
I think probably being alone.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.220
I'm a very extroverted guy.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.840
I need to be around people.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.630
One of my New
Year's resolutions--

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.240
every year, I try to do
something uncomfortable for me.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.450
And this year one of them
was seeing a movie alone

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.610
because I hate-- I'll
never go to a movie alone.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:33.517
I never eat alone.

00:46:33.517 --> 00:46:34.850
I never see a movie alone, ever.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:36.220
I'm terrified of it.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.510
And so I was like, OK,
I'm going to do it.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.570
And June rolled around.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.960
September rolled around.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.940
And I live pretty close
to a movie theater.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.679
And I have a free pass
one of my friends gave me.

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:48.470
They're like, here.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.730
So I have no excuse.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.780
And finally I was like,
OK, I'm going to do this.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.420
So I went.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.210
I went all in too.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.200
I got popcorn.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you do a
double movie, back to back?

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.380
RAMIT SETHI: No, no.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:56.900
Should I do that?

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.400
OK.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.430
I went at 3:00 PM on a Thursday.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:01.760
And I loved it.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.850
But I have to admit,
I was nervous.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.580
I thought everyone
was looking at me.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.380
And what is this
loner doing here?

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.240
You know what I mean?

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.280
It was an irrational
fear, but we all have it.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.216
And I always talk
to my students.

00:47:14.216 --> 00:47:15.590
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:16.950
We all have these crazy fears.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:18.491
Because a lot of my
friends are like,

00:47:18.491 --> 00:47:20.029
I love going to movies alone.

00:47:20.029 --> 00:47:20.570
They love it.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.030
They're like, it's peaceful.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.990
And I hate it.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.610
But I went, and I
forced myself to do it.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.450
And I have to say,
I kind of liked it.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.630
I didn't love it.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:29.544
But I'll do it again.

00:47:29.544 --> 00:47:30.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's good.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.860
Yeah.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.060
You took the micro
step to get there.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.120
RAMIT SETHI: Exactly.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.320
And then this is the
last question I have.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.850
What would be the one
takeaway from today

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:41.540
that you'd want our audience
to come out of this to really

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.000
know more about, one key thing?

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.080
RAMIT SETHI: I would
love for everyone here

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.650
to really challenge the
core assumptions we have.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.540
One of the simple
ones I said was, oh,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.620
email should be really
short and to the point.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.290
And that's just not
true in all cases.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.600
I used to be 40 pounds lighter.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.550
And I'm not that huge of a guy.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.690
And I would say to myself, oh,
I'm just a skinny Indian guy.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.140
I can't get big.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.720
That was real
negative self talk.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.490
And if I had challenged
my assumptions back then,

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:14.440
I would have learned how
to actually eat right, lift

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.090
weights, look like a
normal human being.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:21.247
So challenge the assumptions,
whether it's social skills,

00:48:21.247 --> 00:48:23.080
whether it's the business
that you're doing.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.840
A lot of this stuff
can be tested.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.800
And I think if you
do, you can find out

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.800
that what a lot of other
people have been doing,

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.990
best practices-- they've never
actually really tested it.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.137
So if that's one thing
you take away from today,

00:48:34.137 --> 00:48:35.720
think of some of the
core assumptions.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.780
I call them invisible
scripts you have.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.530
And try to test them
in little micro ways.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:41.920
They could really
change your life.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.204
That's good advice.

00:48:43.204 --> 00:48:43.870
Well, thank you.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.540
I want to thank you
for coming today.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:45.795
RAMIT SETHI: Thank you.

00:48:45.795 --> 00:48:47.394
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we'll
open up to questions.

00:48:47.394 --> 00:48:49.152
So we've got a mic
going around the room.

00:48:49.152 --> 00:48:51.360
And we also have a couple
that were submitted online.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.100
But we'll take the
room questions first.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.010
Does anyone have a question?

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.340
RAMIT SETHI: For me, what I
like to do is just to say,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.000
what is one key takeaway
that I can implement today?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.280
And get really specific.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.290
For example, I
wouldn't say, I'm going

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.690
to improve my social skills.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:08.440
I would say, the next
10 people I meet,

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.830
I'm going to introduce
myself in a different way.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.470
That's one key
takeaway we could take.

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:14.570
Or I would say, oh, Ramit
talked about invisible scripts.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:16.480
I'm going to Google that, and
then I'm going to find out,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.330
what are my five
invisible scripts?

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.170
And how can I
dismantle one of those?

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.160
Again, one of the big
ideas behind "I Will

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.056
Teach You to Be Rich," is
behavior first, then attitude.

00:49:28.056 --> 00:49:29.930
So a lot of people walk
away, and they think,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:31.890
I'm going to change my
attitude about money

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:33.860
or about negotiating my salary.

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.480
That's really, really hard.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.510
It almost never works.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.690
Instead, what's
the one behavior,

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.630
the one action I can
take that's going

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.750
to change for me in a measurable
way in the next 24 hours.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.680
That's something
I would recommend.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.500
AUDIENCE: So you're
an ambitious person.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.140
You care about
scaling your work.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.444
You want to reach as
many people as possible.

00:49:52.444 --> 00:49:54.610
How do you balance that
ambition with things you do,

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.100
like weeding out people
from your email list,

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.500
specifically getting rid of
C players from your customer

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.550
list, things like that?

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.500
RAMIT SETHI: Yeah.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.790
So how do I get rid of the
people from my business

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:11.830
or email list that I don't want?

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.010
And I take a pretty
clear stance on this.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.620
If anyone's on my
email list, you're

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.720
going to be like, what
is this guy doing?

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.530
He's telling me to unsubscribe.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.630
He's threatening
to kick people off.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.154
How is this a real email list?

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:25.570
And I do that on
purpose because I

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:29.260
believe that if you
really simplify it down,

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.380
there are A players, B
players, and C players.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.462
Again, gross oversimplification.

00:50:33.462 --> 00:50:35.920
The A players are already doing
the things they need to do.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.450
They're the best.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.825
They're already
optimizing stuff.

00:50:37.825 --> 00:50:40.599
The great unwashed masses--
is that offensive to say?

00:50:40.599 --> 00:50:41.140
I don't know.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.000
Whatever.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.990
There there's a big group of
Bs, and they could possibly

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.010
be As with a little
bit of guidance.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.210
And in my world, the Cs--
maybe someone can help them,

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.110
but it's not me.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:52.992
That's not my place
on this planet.

00:50:52.992 --> 00:50:54.200
That's not what I want to do.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.570
I don't want to
work with C players.

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:57.821
I want to work with B players
and help them become As.

00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.195
And I want to work
with A players

00:50:59.195 --> 00:51:00.470
and help them become A pluses.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.690
So I'm very clear about who
I don't want on my site.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.260
And I tell them to leave.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.010
I make it really easy.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.200
I write really long things.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.700
So people who have
a short attention

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.500
span-- they just leave.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.390
I tell people, we're
not here for frugality.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:14.964
If you want to cut
back on lattes,

00:51:14.964 --> 00:51:16.130
here's the unsubscribe link.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:17.560
And here are some
people I recommend.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.780
You're not going
to enjoy this site.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.655
Please go over there.

00:51:19.655 --> 00:51:20.780
It will be better for you.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.700
I believe that you're
doing them a duty,

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.180
and you're not
wasting their time.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.550
And they're not wasting mine.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.754
So if people don't take action
on what I'm recommending,

00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:31.920
I'm just like, why are we
wasting each other's time?

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.550
I know in the past,
I used to-- hey,

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.050
you really should
come to my class.

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:36.716
You should come.

00:51:36.716 --> 00:51:38.840
And I would try hard,
and no one would come.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.050
And when I changed
that, when I said,

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:44.135
here's who I'm looking for, and
here's who I'm not looking for,

00:51:44.135 --> 00:51:45.510
it really made
all the difference

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:47.159
in making those
people more committed.

00:51:47.159 --> 00:51:48.950
AUDIENCE: What are the
most common mistakes

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.540
made by average people that
severely limit their ability

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.440
to build wealth?

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.080
RAMIT SETHI: Oh, OK.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.640
Good question.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.520
One is waiting to start
investing until they're rich,

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.680
when quite honestly, it's
the other way it works.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.080
You become wealthy
through investing.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.190
The other thing is trying
to outsmart the market.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.690
Oh, man.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.370
This is crazy.

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:14.850
So so many tech people, a lot of
my really smart tech friends--

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.020
they're so smart at their job.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.690
And then they think that because
they're smart in this area,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.470
they're smart in every
other part of their life.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.136
So they're like, oh,
I'm going to invest

00:52:23.136 --> 00:52:25.541
in aggressive funds
and active management.

00:52:25.541 --> 00:52:27.040
They think they can
beat the market.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.932
I'm like, you can't.

00:52:27.932 --> 00:52:29.890
It doesn't matter how
good you are at your job.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.180
It doesn't matter how
complicated your systems

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.380
that you've built at work are.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.200
It's simple, low cost
investing, the stuff

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.320
I talk about in my book.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.930
Automate it.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.442
Move on with your life.

00:52:40.442 --> 00:52:41.150
That's one thing.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:42.566
And then the third
thing that I've

00:52:42.566 --> 00:52:45.850
discovered in the last few years
is really mindset about money.

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.876
As I worked on money,
I had to change

00:52:47.876 --> 00:52:49.000
the way I thought about it.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.589
Growing up in an
immigrant family,

00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:52.130
you learn certain
values about money.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.010
Some are good.

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.950
Some are not good.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.580
On the good side, I would
say I learned to be frugal.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.280
I learned that you don't have
to buy everything you want.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280
That was cool.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.720
On the bad side,
I think I learned

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.080
that if anyone charged
a premium price,

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.635
I immediately assumed they
were trying to rip me off.

00:53:08.635 --> 00:53:10.760
And that was something that
was really deep inside.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.200
It was an invisible script.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.420
And I had to learn how to
identify it and overcome that

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.010
as well.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.422
So I would take those three
things and try to work them.

00:53:18.422 --> 00:53:21.300
AUDIENCE: How do
you make yourself

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.290
aware of invisible scripts
that you don't know are there.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.040
RAMIT SETHI: That's a
very tough question.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.450
The quick answer is,
number one, there's

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:31.360
some introspection that goes on.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.950
Number two, I use
external frameworks.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.670
So I'll say, OK,
these are the three

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.220
things I'm working on right now.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.830
And why am I getting
stuck at this?

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.212
And then I do the five whys.

00:53:40.212 --> 00:53:41.170
Why am I getting stuck?

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.280
Because I'm not productive.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.080
Why am I not productive?

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.340
Because I'm not waking up early.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:44.890
Why?

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.327
And I really try to dig deep.

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:48.410
And the third thing I try
to do is surround myself

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.490
with other people who
might challenge me

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:52.620
and say, hey, do you really
need to be doing that?

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.090
Or why are you
thinking that way?

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:55.220
What about this?

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.010
And when I put those in
combination, in concert,

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.460
those things have helped me find
my own invisible scripts, which

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.694
I'm still discovering.
