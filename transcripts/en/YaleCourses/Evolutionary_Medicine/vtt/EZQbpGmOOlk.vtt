00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.280
Pathogens have been evolving with their hosts for a very long time,

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.050
and in the process they have come up with just about every trick in the book to

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.900
evade or suppress the host defenses.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.801
In this lecture,

5
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.740
we're going to look at how they can evade by very eating their surface

6
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.430
properties.
This is done by viruses,
bacteria,

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.830
and by you carry out like plasmodium and Trent Inter Panis Ohms.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.010
They can hide inside the genome.
That's what retroviruses do.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.110
They can hide inside cells,
which is what a plasmodium,

10
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:42.090
the malaria pathogen,
the trypanosomes Toxoplasma,
mycobacterium,
listeria,

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
all of these are pathogens that actually hide inside the host cell and they can

12
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:53.721
also suppress the host immune system by disrupting it's function by producing

13
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.000
proteins,
by blocking intracellular defenses,

14
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.820
by slowing down the recruitment of immune cells,

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.160
by and by killing immune cells.

16
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.670
So viruses can suppress the immune system.

17
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.670
They do it by inhibiting humoral immunity,

18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.790
and that's done with by disrupting sensors.

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.600
So some of the viruses that do this or herpes simplex,

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.000
Cytomegalo virus and Vaccinium,

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.150
they can inhibit inflammatory responses by disrupting cytokines and cell

22
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:30.410
adhesion.
So they play with the hosts signaling system.

23
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.910
This is done by an vaccinium Myxoma,
the Epstein Barr Virus,

24
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.050
which causes infectious mononucleosis and several cancers.

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.040
<v 0>They can block antigen processing by inhibiting gene expression and peptide</v>

27
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.670
transport.
That's done by herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus.

28
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.660
<v 0>And they can immunol suppressed the host with mimics of interleukins.</v>

30
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.180
Epstein Barr virus does this.

31
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.640
They can also disrupt the cytoplasmic sensors,
the viral RNA.

32
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.340
And that's done by payroll mixo viruses,

33
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:10.060
which include the agents that cause mumps and measles.

34
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.630
So viruses have a pretty diverse repertoire of methods of suppressing the host

35
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.044
immune system.

36
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.200
<v 0>Many bacteria can vary their surface properties by miss paring,</v>

38
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.680
simple sequence repeat.

39
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.681
So these are sequences that are involved in genes that are expressing cells that

40
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:34.630
are found on the surfaces of bacteria.

41
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.590
And if they simply can vary by adding or deleting the number of nucleotides in

42
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.294
the sequence,

43
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.720
they will be producing DNA of different lengths that will then be causing

44
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.560
different a triplet codes to be produced for the proteins.

45
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.530
<v 0>Here are some of the phenotypic consequences.</v>

47
00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:02.531
You can think of these as being molecules upon the surface.

48
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.980
So for example,

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.790
this box here is for salic acid that can be added or dropped.

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.880
Gal is a galactose that can be added or dropped.

51
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
Pc is a phosphatidylcholine that can be added or dropped and lick one a.

52
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
Those are genes that mediate the attachment of these ligands.

53
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.410
And what you see is that the bacteria,

54
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.600
a single bacteria with a single genome can produce quite an array of different

55
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:38.734
surfaces.

56
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.080
And these are the surface molecules that the antibodies from the host immune

57
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:49.000
system are binding to.
So basically what it's doing,
is it switching it's coat?

58
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.390
<v 0>Some bacteria hide inside host cells.
For example,</v>

60
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.960
Listeria Monocytogenes,

61
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.810
which causes listeriosis moves from macrophage,

62
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.560
the macrophage without emerging into the extracellular environment.

63
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.940
So it's actually hiding inside one of the cells of the immune system.

64
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.680
Toxoplasma Gondii Ai,
which causes toxoplasmosis,

65
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.420
makes assis assist inside,
which it's invisible to the immune system.

66
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.940
Michael bacteria,

67
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:26.320
which causes leprosy spreads by converting nerve cells to stem cells that then

68
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.310
can invade muscle.

69
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.880
So these are all ways that bacteria use to stay away from the humeral humidity

70
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.763
immunity,

71
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.750
the antibodies and the compliment that are circulating in the blood.

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.490
They hide inside cells.

73
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.230
Plasmodium has quite an array of methods of evading.

74
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:49.090
It's a vertebrate host.

75
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.420
Several stages hide inside cells,

76
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.320
particularly inside red blood cells or inside liver cells.

77
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.270
The mirror zone lights that are out in the blood and therefore subject to attack

78
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.190
very their surface molecules based on illegally polymorphisms and variable

79
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.460
expression from multigene families.
So

80
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.050
they are under attack from opsonizing antibodies.

81
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.870
They're under attack from complement deposition.

82
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.020
They're under attack from invasion blocking antibodies and they,

83
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.390
they're coevolved responds to evade and suppressed is to vary their sequence

84
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:34.861
while maintaining their function and they have reduced and antigenicity and to

85
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:38.290
have redundancy in their multigene families,

86
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:41.770
which allows them to generate these variable surface molecules.

87
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.430
Here is plasmodium hiding in an infected red blood cell.

88
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.610
These red blood cells do not carry MHC class one proteins.

89
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.170
They also lack nuclei.

90
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.370
There is no immune surveillance by cytotoxic t cells.

91
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.171
However,

92
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:08.171
infected red blood cells are cleared in the spleen where they can be recognized

93
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.210
because infection increases their rigidity.

94
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.720
So the membrane properties of the red blood cell or altered

95
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.220
plasmodium prevents being cleared by inserting a protein called P,

96
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.350
f,
e m p,
one p,

97
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.620
FMP one into the surface of the red blood cells.

98
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.410
<v 0>And that helps binding to capillaries and it delays passage through the spleen,</v>

100
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.240
but it also mediates cerebral malaria.

101
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.290
So this reaction to getting cleared by the spleen causes a change in the

102
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.180
properties of the red blood cell.

103
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.170
That may also make it more likely to stick the capillaries in the brain.

104
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.190
The host immune system targets Pfe MP one.

105
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.740
So you can see there's a whole series of moves and counter moves going on here.

106
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.120
The pathogen then evades by varying PFE and p one it's coated by Verigenes.

107
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.840
There are about 60 of them in the malaria genome and the plasmodium genome one

108
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:17.100
very gene is expressed at a time and there's antigenic switching at a rate of

109
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:19.950
about 2% per infected red blood cell.

110
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.590
So the immune response is out of phase with the parasite that lacks behind.

111
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.990
So this is the log of parasite density here.

112
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.170
Immunity ramps up starts to hit the first one.

113
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.800
The color indicates a switch to the second kind of protein.

114
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.570
It starts to ramp up.

115
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.090
The immune system starts to hit it during the time that the second is ramping
up.

116
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.160
The first one can persist and so forth.
In this way,

117
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the malaria parasite manages to maintain a pretty reasonable density in the

118
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:01.800
blood.
So it's showing here about log for density in the blood.

119
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.550
<v 0>Another case of varying surface proteins has done by the trypanosomes.</v>

121
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.920
The trypanosomes are you carry oats with a Slingo single flagellum.

122
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.700
Their morphology is categorized according to where you find the [inaudible],

123
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.080
the flagellum attached,
so they're called things like ams to goats,

124
00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:25.700
which lack flagella pro master goats fms to goats,

125
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.020
[inaudible] goats and so forth.

126
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.660
They are exclusively parasitic and they cause three major human diseases,

127
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:37.770
sleeping sickness,
chagas disease and leishmaniasis.

128
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.780
All pretty nasty diseases.

129
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.190
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

130
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.760
<v 0>they also vary their surface protein.
So here is a,</v>

131
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.860
an enhanced photo of a trypanosomes with some red blood cells behind it.

132
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.810
<v 0>They live extracellularly in the blood where they're subject to attack by the</v>

134
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:02.460
immune system.
There they are targeted by antibody response.

135
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.390
There's surface is covered with a dense coat of a single protein.

136
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:07.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.310
<v 0>And they have variable surface glycoproteins,</v>

138
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.830
so they can vary their surface properties.

139
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.400
This VSG variable surface glycoprotein undergoes frequent genetic modification.

140
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.480
This antigenic variation is what lets the infection survive in the blood and

141
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:29.490
it's done with cycling.

142
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.830
So the trypanosomes rapidly cycle a protective variant surface protein,

143
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.050
which is their coat.
A single for Panasonic,

144
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.130
has more than 1,500 VSG genes.

145
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.230
Most of them are located in silent arrays and most are pseudo genes.

146
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.770
So this genetic information has to be activated and moved into the right place

147
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:55.680
to be expressed.

148
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.140
We do not yet understand how the pseudo genes recombine to produce the genes

149
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.790
that encode the functional coats.

150
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.180
Only one variable surface gene is expressed at a time from one of about 15

151
00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:13.360
telomeric VSG expression site transcription units.

152
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.970
So these are moved around in the genome of Japan.

153
00:10:18.971 --> 00:10:19.804
Of Soma,

154
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.850
but exactly what mechanism gets them into position for expression is not yet

155
00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:25.684
known.

156
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.900
<v 0>Pathogens can also suppress the immune system.</v>

158
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.830
Mycobacterium tuberculosis blocks the fusion of a fake,

159
00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:37.070
a zone with a license zone.

160
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.750
<v 0>Plasmodium sporozoites slow down.
T-Cell recruitment.</v>

162
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.650
<v 0>Leishmania lives in neutrophils and in dendritic cells and it blocks their</v>

164
00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:48.484
maturation.

165
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.200
It also expresses a protein that disrupts host immune signaling.

166
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.960
So interestingly,

167
00:10:55.961 --> 00:11:00.961
a number of pathogens actually live inside the weapons that the host deploys to

168
00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:06.190
fight them.
They live inside the cells of the immune system.

169
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.560
<v 0>Pathogens from viruses to worms produce enzymes that disrupt immune system,</v>

171
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.950
immune function.
For example,
this is done by Toxoplasma,

172
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.770
which phosphorolates a host resistance protein

173
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.790
and hookworms suppress intestinal proteases and stimulate production of the

174
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:27.250
immune cells that can reduce inflammation.

175
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.280
<v 0>Some pathogens also disrupt the immune system with Cystine kinases that are</v>

177
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:37.090
immunomodulatory.

178
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.280
So these are particularly effective disruptors of immune function.

179
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.780
This method has been converged upon by parasites and pathogens.
Worms,

180
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:50.040
Meb Leishmania,

181
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.430
plasmodium trypanosomes bacteria and viruses all do this.

182
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.830
The action is to cleave the Immunoglobulin gs,

183
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.750
which are antibodies in blood and lymph to modulate interleukin concentrations

184
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:06.790
and to control immune cell populations.

185
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
So this particular kinase is a particular way of a very effective way of messing

186
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.220
up at least three aspects of immune function.

187
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.853
To summarize,

188
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.160
most pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade or suppress the immune system.

189
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.520
Some of them vary their surface properties,

190
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.050
some of them hide inside cells or in the genome.

191
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.610
Some of them manipulate cytokine and interleukin signals,

192
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.670
and some of them Cleve antibodies,

193
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.170
some of them actually kill immune cells.

194
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.520
It's a diverse repertoire of countermeasures in this game of move and counter

195
00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:54.250
move.
