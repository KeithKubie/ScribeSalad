00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:30.620 align:start position:0%
so literally when this film starts off
 

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.490 align:start position:0%
so literally when this film starts off
and<00:08:30.800><c> I</c><00:08:30.830><c> saw</c><00:08:31.040><c> on</c><00:08:31.160><c> an</c><00:08:31.280><c> IMAX</c><00:08:31.930><c> the</c><00:08:32.930><c> whole</c><00:08:33.080><c> screen</c><00:08:33.469><c> is</c>

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.500 align:start position:0%
and I saw on an IMAX the whole screen is
 

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.709 align:start position:0%
and I saw on an IMAX the whole screen is
shaking<00:08:33.860><c> I</c><00:08:34.190><c> mean</c><00:08:34.370><c> like</c><00:08:34.520><c> 90%</c><00:08:34.849><c> of</c><00:08:35.150><c> the</c><00:08:35.240><c> time</c><00:08:35.450><c> but</c>

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
shaking I mean like 90% of the time but
 

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
shaking I mean like 90% of the time but
I<00:08:35.900><c> found</c><00:08:36.229><c> I</c><00:08:36.680><c> was</c><00:08:37.460><c> actually</c><00:08:37.669><c> sort</c><00:08:38.090><c> of</c><00:08:38.210><c> getting</c>

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:38.570 align:start position:0%
I found I was actually sort of getting
 

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
I found I was actually sort of getting
into<00:08:38.930><c> that</c><00:08:39.110><c> and</c><00:08:39.410><c> I</c><00:08:39.469><c> think</c><00:08:39.770><c> it's</c><00:08:39.919><c> because</c><00:08:40.370><c> a</c><00:08:40.400><c> lot</c>

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:40.729 align:start position:0%
into that and I think it's because a lot
 

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.130 align:start position:0%
into that and I think it's because a lot
of<00:08:40.789><c> times</c><00:08:40.969><c> people</c><00:08:41.120><c> are</c><00:08:41.270><c> just</c><00:08:41.450><c> standing</c><00:08:41.660><c> around</c>

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.140 align:start position:0%
of times people are just standing around
 

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.390 align:start position:0%
of times people are just standing around
and<00:08:42.440><c> not</c><00:08:42.740><c> doing</c><00:08:42.919><c> anything</c><00:08:43.190><c> really</c>

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
and not doing anything really
 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900 align:start position:0%
and not doing anything really
action-oriented<00:08:44.060><c> and</c><00:08:44.510><c> it</c><00:08:44.600><c> did</c>

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:44.910 align:start position:0%
action-oriented and it did
 

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.850 align:start position:0%
action-oriented and it did
to<00:08:44.970><c> create</c><00:08:45.270><c> this</c><00:08:45.630><c> unease</c><00:08:46.140><c> it</c><00:08:46.410><c> sort</c><00:08:46.620><c> of</c><00:08:46.680><c> felt</c>

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
to create this unease it sort of felt
 

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
to create this unease it sort of felt
like<00:08:46.920><c> you're</c><00:08:47.190><c> just</c><00:08:47.430><c> there</c><00:08:47.670><c> sort</c><00:08:47.970><c> of</c><00:08:48.030><c> watching</c>
