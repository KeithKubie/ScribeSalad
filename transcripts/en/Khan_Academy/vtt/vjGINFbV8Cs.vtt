00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:02.883
- [Instructor] Pascale
Ricketts has invented a game

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:05.574
called Three Rolls to 10.

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:09.588
You roll a fair six-sided die three times.

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:13.465
If the sum of the rolls
is 10 or greater, you win.

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.876
If it is less than 10, you lose.

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:21.043
What is the probability of
winning Three Rolls to 10?

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.669
So, there is several ways
that you can approach this.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.068
The way we're going to
tackle it in this video

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:29.762
is we're going to try to come up

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.106
with an experimental probability.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:34.528
We're going to do many experiments

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:37.022
trying to win Three Rolls to 10

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:38.567
and figure out the proportion

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:39.868
that we actually win

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:42.181
and the more experiments we try,

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.864
the better, the more
likely that we're gonna get

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:48.969
a good approximation of
the actual probability.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.055
So, let's do that

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.867
and to help us I'm
going to have a computer

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.826
generate a string of random digits

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:57.326
from zero to nine.

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:02.298
And the way that we're going
to use this is remember,

00:01:02.298 --> 00:01:05.740
we're rolling a fair six-sided die,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.386
so the outcome could be
one, two, three, four,

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.553
five or six for each roll.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.768
In this random number list

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:15.448
that the computer has generated,

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:17.708
I do get digits from one to six

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:21.982
but I also get the digits
seven, eight, nine and zero

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.224
and so what I'm going to
do for each experiment,

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:26.689
I'm going to start at the top left

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.407
and I'm gonna consider each digit a roll.

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:32.295
If it gives me an invalid
result for a six-sided die,

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.994
so if it's a zero, an
eight, a seven or a nine

00:01:35.994 --> 00:01:37.208
I will just ignore that,

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.734
I will just say well,
that wasn't a valid roll.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.066
It's like, you roll the die
and it fell off the table

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.562
or something like that.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:44.575
So, let's do that.

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:46.376
Let's do multiple experiments

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.018
of taking three rolls, sum them up

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:50.867
and we'll see how many we can do

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.360
to figure out an experimental probability

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.356
of winning Pascale's game.

00:01:56.356 --> 00:01:59.418
So, let me set up a little table here,

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:02.546
so I want space to show the sum,

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.713
so this is going to be the experiment,

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.105
experiment, actually let me write the sum

00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:13.522
and over here we're gonna say did we win?

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:16.052
Alright.

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:19.052
So, let's start with experiment one.

00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:22.955
So, our first roll we got a one.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.705
Our second roll we got a five.

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:29.353
We're doing quite well

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:33.250
and then our third roll we got a six.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.538
Did we win?

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:37.272
Well, one plus five plus six is 12.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:38.272
Yes, we won.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.303
Let's do another experiment.

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:43.075
This is going to be experiment two.

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:44.090
We can just keep going here.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.370
These are random digits.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.007
So, we have a six in our first roll.

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.674
We got a two in our second roll,

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:56.579
we got a four in our third roll.

00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:58.582
Did we win?

00:02:58.582 --> 00:03:01.767
Yes, once again this summed up to 12.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.197
So, we won.

00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:05.851
Alright, let's do another experiment.

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.371
So, experiment number three.

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.517
So, this first thing is invalid,

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:13.230
so this is our first roll.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.313
We got a six,

00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:17.345
and then this is invalid.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.928
Our second roll we get a three,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.207
this is invalid, that is invalid,

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:26.249
that is invalid and then in our third roll

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.926
we got a two, so we squeaked by.

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:30.877
This adds up to 11.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.551
Yes, that looks like a win.

00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.024
Alright, let's do our
fourth experiment here.

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.691
So, our first roll we got a one.

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:43.431
This is invalid.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.514
Second roll we got a two.

00:03:47.112 --> 00:03:48.651
This is invalid.

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:51.512
Third roll we get a five.

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:52.806
Did we win?

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:55.397
One plus two plus five is eight.

00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:56.980
No, we did not win.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:00.428
So, that was our first non-win.

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:01.564
So, let's keep going.

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:03.055
This is interesting.

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:05.098
Alright, this is invalid,

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:08.443
so we're going to have,
so this is trial five,

00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:12.480
we're going to have four
plus three plus one.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.873
Four plus three plus one,

00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:16.618
adds up to eight.

00:04:16.618 --> 00:04:17.995
Did we win?

00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:19.280
No.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.115
Let's just keep going here.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.422
So, I'm gonna keep going with my table

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:24.798
where I have experiment,

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.881
I'll do five more trials, experiment,

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:30.514
sum and do we win?

00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:34.222
Let me make the table.

00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:36.782
This is just a continuation
of the table we had before.

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:37.870
I don't want to go below the page

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.579
'cause I wanna be able to look
at our random numbers here.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.162
So, we are onto experiment six.

00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:49.279
Experiment six, we are getting
a three in the first roll,

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.909
a three in the second roll,

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.218
this isn't looking good

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:55.042
and then a two in our third roll.

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:56.246
Did we win?

00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:59.078
No, this is less than 10.

00:04:59.078 --> 00:05:01.578
Now we go to experiment seven.

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:05.352
Experiment seven.

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:07.579
We get a two in our first roll.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:08.950
This is invalid.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.700
We get a three in our
second roll, plus three

00:05:13.637 --> 00:05:17.778
and we get a one in our
third roll, so plus one.

00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:20.422
Once again we did not win.

00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:22.422
Now we go to experiment,

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:26.407
we will go to experiment eight.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.789
We get a one in our first roll,

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.539
we get a three in our second row,

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.042
this is invalid, the
die fell off the table,

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:38.546
we could think of it that way

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:42.532
and then in our third roll
we get a five, plus five.

00:05:42.532 --> 00:05:43.540
Did we win?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.021
No, this adds up to nine.

00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.751
So, we had a string of wins to begin with

00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:50.731
but now we're getting
a strong of non-wins.

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.710
Alright.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.460
Now, let's go to experiment nine.

00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:58.776
So, we get a six in our first roll,

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:01.439
we get a four in our second roll

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.872
and then these are all invalid,

00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:07.170
and then we got a five in our third roll.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.277
Did we win here?

00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:10.033
Yes, we won over here.

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.605
This is definitely going
to be greater than 10,

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.017
this is 15 here.

00:06:14.017 --> 00:06:16.290
Alright, last experiment

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.081
or at least for this
video, last experiment.

00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:19.244
You could keep going.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:20.898
In fact, I encourage you to after this

00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:23.348
and see if you can get a more accurate,

00:06:23.348 --> 00:06:26.578
a better approximation of
the theoretical probability

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:28.865
of winning by doing more experiments

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:31.598
to calculate an experimental probability.

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:33.254
So, here experiment 10.

00:06:33.254 --> 00:06:35.337
First roll we get a five,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.441
second roll we get a two,

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.547
this is invalid, invalid, invalid,

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:44.582
then we get a six.

00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:46.499
Here we definitely won.

00:06:47.802 --> 00:06:50.969
So, with 10 trials, based on 10 trials

00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:53.255
or 10 experiments,

00:06:53.255 --> 00:06:57.074
what is our experimental
probability of winning this game?

00:06:57.074 --> 00:06:58.878
Well, out of the 10 experiments

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:00.857
how many did we win?

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:04.913
Well, it looks like we won
one, two, three, four, five.

00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:07.636
So, based on just these 10 experiments

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.458
we got a pretty clean 50%.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.331
So, do you think the
theoretical probability

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.364
is actually 50%?

00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:16.991
Maybe you'd want to continue
running these experiments

00:07:16.991 --> 00:07:17.824
over and over.

00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:19.725
Maybe we'd want to do a computer program

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:21.869
that could run this experiment
instead of 10 times,

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:23.697
maybe 10,000 times

00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:25.054
to see if we can get closer

00:07:25.054 --> 00:07:28.054
to the true theoretical probability.
