00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:01.044
- [Voiceover] In this video

00:00:01.044 --> 00:00:02.740
I wanna do a bunch of example problems

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.679
that show up on standardized exams

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.710
and definitely will help you
with our divisibility module

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.363
because it's asking you
questions like this.

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:12.243
And this is just one of the examples.

00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:14.802
All numbers divisible by both 12 and 20

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.509
are also divisible by:

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.366
And the trick here is to realize

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.967
that if a number is
divisible by both 12 and 20,

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:26.505
it has to be divisible by each
of these guy's prime factors.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.573
So let's take the prime factorization,

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:30.674
the prime factorization of 12,

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:32.635
let's see, 12 is 2 times 6.

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:35.677
6 isn't prime yet so 6 is 2 times 3.

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:37.407
So that is prime.

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:39.527
So any number divisible by 12

00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:41.972
needs to be divisible
by 2 times 2 times 3.

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:43.969
So its prime factorization needs

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.513
to have a 2 times a 2 times a 3 in it,

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.580
any number that's divisible by 12.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.353
Now any number that's divisible by 20

00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:53.200
needs to be divisible by,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.325
let's take it's prime factorization.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.181
2 times 10

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.503
10 is 2 times 5.

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.662
So any number divisible by 20

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.785
needs to also be divisible by

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:06.445
2 times 2 times 5.

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:07.618
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:12.006
it needs to have two 2's and a
5 in its prime factorization.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.644
If you're divisible by both,

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:17.021
you have to have two 2's, a 3, and a 5,

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:19.204
two 2's and a 3 for 12,

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.745
and then two 2's and a 5 for 20,

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.445
and you can verify this for yourself

00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:26.042
that this is divisible by both.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.487
Obviously if you divide it by 20,

00:01:29.487 --> 00:01:30.695
let me do it this way.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:31.636
Dividing it by 20 is the same thing

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:34.460
as dividing by 2 times 2 times 5,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.493
so you're going to have

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:37.037
the 2's are going to cancel out,

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:38.476
the 5's are going to cancel out.

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:40.404
You're just going to have a 3 left over.

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:44.026
So it's clearly divisible by 20,

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:47.357
and if you were to divide it by 12,

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.938
you'd divide it by 2 times 2 times 3.

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.517
This is the same thing as 12.

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:53.282
And so these guys would cancel out

00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:54.884
and you would just have a 5 left over

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:56.022
so it's clearly divisible by both,

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:57.624
and this number right here is 60.

00:01:57.624 --> 00:01:59.761
It's 4 times 3, which is 12,

00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:01.653
times 5, it's 60.

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:04.497
This right here is actually
the least common multiple

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.564
of 12 and 20.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:08.178
Now this isn't the only number

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:10.801
that's divisible by both 12 and 20.

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.961
You could multiply this number right here

00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.979
by a whole bunch of other factors.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.661
I could call them a, b, and c,

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.879
but this is kind of the smallest number

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.864
that's divisible by 12 and 20.

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:25.024
Any larger number will also be divisible

00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:27.775
by the same things as this smaller number.

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:31.000
Now with that said, let's
answer the questions.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.763
All numbers divisible by both 12 and 20

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:35.446
are also divisible by:

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.246
Well we don't know what these numbers are

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.429
so we can't really address it.

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.530
They might just be 1's
or they might not exist

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.132
because the number might be 60.

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:44.305
It might be 120.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.012
Who knows what this number is?

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:49.309
So the only numbers that
we know can be divided

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.133
into this number,

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.506
well we know 2 can be,

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:53.593
we know that 2 is a legitimate answer.

00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:54.951
2 is obviously divisible into

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.925
2 times 2 times 3 times 5.

00:02:56.925 --> 00:03:00.407
We know that 2 times 2
is divisible into it,

00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.974
cuz we have the 2 times 2 over there.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.284
We know that 3 is divisible into it.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:08.808
We know that 2 times 3
is divisible into it.

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:09.870
So that's 6.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.764
Let me write these.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:11.646
This is 4.

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:12.935
This is 6.

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:14.851
We know that 2 times 2 times 3

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.675
is divisible into it.

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.672
I could go through every combination

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:19.030
of these numbers right here.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.687
We know that 3 times 5
is divisible into it.

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:24.592
We know that 2 times 3 times 5

00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:25.567
is divisible into it.

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.691
So in general you can look
at these prime factors

00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:30.013
and any combination of these prime factors

00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:34.147
is divisible into any
number that's divisible by

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.795
both 12 and 20,

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.270
so if this was a multiple choice question,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.959
and the choices were

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.427
7 and 9

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:45.681
and 12

00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:48.851
and 8.

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.809
You would say, well let's see,

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.851
7 is not one of these
prime factors over here.

00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:55.811
9 is 3 times 3

00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.413
so I need to have two 3's here.

00:03:57.413 --> 00:03:58.910
I only have one 3 here

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.130
so 9 doesn't work.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.338
7 doesn't work, 9 doesn't work.

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:03.392
12 is 4 times 3

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:04.751
or another way to think about it,

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:07.619
12 is 2 times 2 times 3.

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.975
Well there is a 2 times 2 times 3

00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:11.820
in the prime factorization,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.082
of this least common multiple
of these two numbers,

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:18.798
so this is a 12 so 12 would work.

00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:20.761
8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.269
You would need three 2's
in the prime factorization.

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:24.823
We don't have three 2's,

00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:27.761
so this doesn't work.

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.805
Let's try another example

00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:31.523
just so that we make sure

00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:33.741
that we understand this fairly well.

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:35.098
So let's say we wanna know,

00:04:35.098 --> 00:04:36.979
we ask the same question.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:43.287
All numbers divisible by

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:45.340
and let me think of two
interesting numbers,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.188
all numbers divisible by 12

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.829
and let's say 9,

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.964
and I don't know, let's
make it more interesting,

00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:58.926
9 and 24

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:03.866
are also divisible by

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:06.396
are also divisible by

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:09.620
And once again we just do
the prime factorization.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.582
We essentially think about
the least common multiple

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.010
of 9 and 24.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.763
You take the prime factorization of 9,

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:16.829
it's 3 times 3 and we're done.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.384
Prime factorization of 24

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:24.023
is 2 times 12.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.195
12 is 2 times 6,

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:29.402
6 is 2 times 3.

00:05:29.402 --> 00:05:30.947
So anything that's divisible by 9

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:33.525
has to have a 9 in it's factorization

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:35.243
or if you did its prime factorization

00:05:35.243 --> 00:05:37.251
would have to be a 3 times 3,

00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.515
anything divisible by 24

00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:41.373
has got to have three 2's in it,

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:45.042
so it's gotta have a
2 times a 2 times a 2,

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.737
and it's got to have at lease one 3 here.

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:49.419
And we already have at
least one 3 from the 9,

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.405
so we have that.

00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:52.507
So this number right here is divisible

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:55.398
by both 9 and 24.

00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:57.245
And this number right here is actually 72.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:01.726
This is 8 times 9, which is 72.

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:03.502
So if the choices for this question,

00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:05.127
let's assume that it was multiple choice.

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:07.046
Let's say the choices here were

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:08.050
16

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.343
27

00:06:12.694 --> 00:06:14.076
5

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.128
11

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.962
and 9.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.643
So 16, if you were to do
its prime factorization,

00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:25.876
is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.159
It's 2 to the 4th power.

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.422
So you would need four 2's here.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.581
We don't have four 2's over here.

00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:33.485
I mean there could be
some other numbers here

00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:34.685
but we don't know what they are.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:35.864
These are the only numbers

00:06:35.864 --> 00:06:37.630
that we can assume are in
the prime factorization

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.569
of something divisible

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.718
by both 9 and 24.

00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:43.377
So we can rule out 16.

00:06:43.377 --> 00:06:44.677
We don't have four 2's here.

00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:49.578
27 is equal to 3 times 3 times 3,

00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:51.736
so you need three 3's in
the prime factorization.

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:53.037
We don't have three 3's.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:53.850
We only have two of them.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.531
So once again, cancel that out.

00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:59.091
5's a prime number.

00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.113
There are no 5's here.

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:01.112
Rule that out.

00:07:01.112 --> 00:07:02.993
11, once again, prime number.

00:07:02.993 --> 00:07:04.153
No 11's here.

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:05.593
Rule that out.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:08.752
9 is equal to 3 times 3.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.853
And actually I just realized
that this is a silly answer

00:07:10.853 --> 00:07:12.547
because obviously all numbers divisible

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:14.499
by 9 and 24 are also divisible by 9.

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.007
So obviously 9 is going to work

00:07:16.007 --> 00:07:17.274
but I shouldn't have made that a choice

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:20.187
cuz that's in the
problem, but 9 would work,

00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:22.474
and what also would work if we had a,

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:25.017
if 8 was one of the choices,

00:07:25.017 --> 00:07:28.453
because 8 is equal to 2 times 2 times 2,

00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:31.437
and we have a 2 times 2 times 2 here.

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:33.074
4 would also work.

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:35.651
That's 2 times 2.

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.063
That's 2 times 2.

00:07:37.063 --> 00:07:38.623
6 would work since that's 2 times 3.

00:07:38.623 --> 00:07:39.658
18 would work

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:42.398
cuz that's 2 times 3 times 3.

00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:44.302
So anything that's made
up of a combination

00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:47.784
of these prime factors will be divisible

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:51.221
into something divisible by both 9 and 24.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.484
Hopefully that doesn't
confuse you too much.
