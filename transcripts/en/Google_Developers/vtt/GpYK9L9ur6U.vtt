EMCEE: Next up we have Ibrahim.

00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:03.820
He's come from a
world where he used

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.390
to program robots, humanoid
robots to play football,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.820
and then doing
big data analysis.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.569
And now he's going to
help you supercharge

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.790
your games with YouTube.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.060
So please welcome Ibrahim.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.120
IBRAHIM: I think everyone here
likes the free Google UAs,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.780
right?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.120
So I'm happy to, before
starting my presentation,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.530
I'm up today here, to announce
that you get a YouTube.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.600
You get a YouTube.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.400
Everyone gets a YouTube
in this audience.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.870
It's great, right?

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.480
So it's good today to see
that you are still like bright

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.860
and you are still
good in the afternoon.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.270
I'm Ibrahim Ulukaya from
the New York City office,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.290
from the YouTube API
developer relations team.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.560
And today, we'll see like some
great videos from YouTube.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.306
So let's talk about why
you should use YouTube.

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.020
And then we'll go
through the why

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.794
should you use YouTube APIs.

00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:55.210
And in the third
phase, we'll talk

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.490
about the different
developer ecosystems.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.560
We'll talk about all different
verticals with support.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.860
And we'll see how actually
games or your apps

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.790
can play with YouTube, and what
are the actual opportunities

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.680
you can take from there.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.330
And I'm sure we'll have some
time for Q&amp;A. If not, I'll

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.145
be around and if
there's something

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:16.570
we want to dig deeper, we can
even meet at board meetings

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.430
tomorrow as well.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.550
So YouTube, besides being
the most major video sharing

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.100
platform, did you also guys know
that it's the second biggest

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.210
search engine on the web?

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.120
One billion users, unique
users, visit YouTube each month.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.670
And those users they see
six billion hours of video,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380
they watch six billion
hours of video each month.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.810
I always blame the cat videos.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.990
Can we?

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.360
What about the mobile?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.580
Like right now we see
that 25% of the traffic

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.180
is coming from the mobile,
and it's growing like rapidly.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.930
Can you still blame
the cat videos?

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.570
Or the cats?

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.940
They are getting clever, right?

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.928
[CAT MEOWING]

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.820
So why you should use YouTube,
if you don't have a channel

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.930
and you don't have
like a presence.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.680
But you can actually make
videos with almost no budget.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.260
And you don't even have to
make content to become popular.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.760
You know, actually, our
players share the videos,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.030
and you can share
those videos as well.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.190
And what are your goals
should be on YouTube?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.180
You can actually
raise awareness.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.790
Raise awareness or make
your games go viral.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.820
You can even raise
revenue from there.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.250
You can research
and support users.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.040
You can actually get
feedback from your users.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.790
And this was actually
research done in 2011.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.500
And I'm sure the numbers are
growing up higher from there

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.380
even.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.520
And they select
the people who play

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.460
video games more than seven
hours a week, and from ages

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.250
from 13 to 35.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.500
And they said-- 95% of them
said-- they are actually

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.680
watching the video game
videos on YouTube as well.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.290
And what about the YouTube APIs?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.450
So nowadays, the YouTube API
is almost equal to YouTube.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.220
You can do almost
everything you do on YouTube

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.530
through the YouTube
APIs as well.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.805
And when your app plays
with YouTube APIs,

00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:55.845
it creates awesomeness.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.650
It was like pretty
much a warm-up,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.840
let's go on to the
developer ecosystem.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.220
So we divided the developer
ecosystem into four,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.580
and we'll talk about
each developer ecosystem

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.260
with its APIs.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.170
And the examples
coming from there,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.570
I like to see that what are
they related topics for the game

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.899
developers here.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.980
The first vertical
is the creation.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.550
The creation is the
creation of the content,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.560
uploading a new content
on YouTube basically.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.910
And the second one
is discovery, which

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.040
actually are finding new videos.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.979
You are sharing those
videos with your gamers.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.270
And the third one is analytics.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.437
You are checking
out how your videos

00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:44.020
are doing, how your
channels are, like

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.620
how much popular
they are on YouTube.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.410
And you can even use promotions.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.640
You can promote your apps.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.890
You can promote your
channels through the YouTube.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.350
And the fourth one is
the content management.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.470
In this site you can actually
get revenue from that.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.480
Let's start with the creation.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.500
I'm sure most people
already familiar

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.830
with this game, the FIFA game.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.810
And in the 2013 version, they
implemented a one click share

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.370
to YouTube.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.350
So the user is like
playing the game,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.650
he actually just wants to share
to YouTube from the replay.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.740
They can just click one button
without leaving the game.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.960
They can share those replay
to the YouTube right away.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.495
So they can show it to their
friends how they play the game.

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:33.870
They can show it
to other people.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.370
Other people can just
get a taste of it.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.270
And your game gets more popular.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.300
Lots of people like
to show these videos.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.450
And we always like saw that
one of the really good ways

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.530
to get the games popular
is word of mouth.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.622
So you are looking for
a new game to play,

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:52.330
or your friend just
comes to you and says

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.830
that, I found a really nice game
like you want to check it out?

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.470
And one really easy way
to check about the game

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.780
is just going to YouTube.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.470
And see those footages
and see those replays

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.240
and see how the game is going.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.689
Is it like something that
you're really interested in?

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.980
Or even those moments that
you're are like stuck in one

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.480
level.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.896
You are playing
the "Angry Birds",

00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:14.255
and you couldn't find like
how to pass that level

00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:15.880
and you're looking
for like a solution.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.480
Rather than giving up the game,
you can just go to YouTube

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.690
and find someone who
played the same level.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.680
And your gamer
reaches his goals,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.270
and maybe just finds
out and gets happy

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.990
and keeps playing
the game from that.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.440
And for the APIs,
how they use this API

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.600
and how they implement this.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.860
One of the major APIs
we have is the Data API.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.270
Data API is where
you're actually

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.090
getting all the
content from YouTube

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.500
or putting like new
content over there.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.660
You actually get
all the metadata.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.740
You search new
content, new videos.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.290
And don't think about code,
that's messy Java code here.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.410
But, all I want to say
is in the last two lines,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.645
I'm just creating a video insert
request and then executing it.

00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:03.020
And this will
[? automatically ?]

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.565
insert a video on YouTube.

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:06.690
And you can do it through
like different libraries,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.702
different languages as well.

00:07:08.702 --> 00:07:10.160
And all the code
here actually will

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.120
be-- all the presentation--
will be shared,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.580
so don't tackle on the
code or anything else.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.990
And they're all available
in the developer website

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.240
as well as on
GitHub open source.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.620
I actually want
to share something

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.790
quick on like a Data API.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.400
So this is our
Google API Explorer.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.900
I'm sure if you guys are
already using the APIs,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.930
you've seen this one.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.540
That you don't have to
actually implement everything,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.820
you can actually just try the
APIs from this console easily.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.770
Or even if you want to change
a parameter or something else,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.010
you can just go here and
check out the parameter.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.780
Let me try to get
like-- so here we

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.360
just want to get
like the metadata.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.800
We just want 10 results.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.580
All I want to do is actually
create a source link request,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.750
just searching
videos on YouTube.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.550
So I want to just like see
the videos on YouTube API

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.690
with the query.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.550
And I want all the
videos in my result.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.320
And I'm executing this
request, and all done.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.460
We have like some videos
from the YouTube API overview

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.430
and anything about YouTube APIs
from Google Developers as well.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.630
So let's get back
to the presentation.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.804
And besides you
sharing those videos,

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:38.470
you actually want to
also like play back

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.880
those videos inside your games.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.460
So you can actually use the
in-game video playbacks.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.100
On Android we we have
the Android player API,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.330
which is super easy to
just implement player view,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.667
create a listener, just
implement this listener.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.250
And you have the
video inside your app

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.890
without leaving your app.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.160
And iOS and other platforms,
we support the iframe player.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.030
You actually show the
video inside the iframe.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.740
I will actually come to that
in the next presentation,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.620
in the next slides.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.380
And one of the examples
here was EveryPlay.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.430
EveryPlay created a
platform that if people

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.940
don't want to go and have
the resources to implement

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.320
all the YouTube APIs and upload,
they create a middle layer

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.940
that, using their
platform or data API,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.430
you can just easily share your
content on YouTube right away.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.180
This was like one of
the games they played,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.920
a shot from that, "Bad Piggies."

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.425
And I will show you guys
how they should do that.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.980
So they're actually getting
all the media frames

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.880
from the game play, with Unity.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.730
And they package them
with the webm encoder.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.360
They are using the
VP8 for video encoding

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.000
and Vorbis for the
audio encoding.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.380
And they are packaging
into like a video file.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.975
And from that video file,
they are uploading it

00:10:04.975 --> 00:10:07.850
with YouTube APIs to YouTube.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.510
So if you don't have the
resources to implement

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:16.010
this framework, you can
actually use the API as well.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.030
And one painful
thing that we always

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.990
hear from our developers'
authorization particles,

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.780
people-- like once they want to
upload some content-- they need

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.720
to go authorize and upload
to their own account.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.267
And we made it like
really easy to authorize.

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:32.850
You have like two options going
either through the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.760
OAuth2 or the Google+
sign in as well.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.759
On Android, we support the
Google aacount credentials.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:42.550
You just create a Google
account credential

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.780
and say that you
are using OAuth2

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.220
and it handles all the
authorization for you.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.200
You don't have to save
any passwords or user

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.800
names as well.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.250
NIS, we have the OAuth2
controller touch.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.780
And just like having
this on the one line,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.630
you've actually got
a way with OAuth2.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.290
And how many people
here still remember

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.040
this photo or this video?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.200
Wow, almost everyone.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.440
So this was the Red
Bull sort of jump.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.590
And this was actually sent
with the YouTube live platform.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.670
And YouTube live is
getting like really popular

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.340
nowadays as we recently opened
up the YouTube live streaming

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.030
capability to almost everyone.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.310
And it's getting really popular
between the game developers

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.200
because they want
to actually share,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.060
they want to let their gamers to
share their content right away

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.120
as a live stream.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.460
One of the early launch
partners from that was elgato.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:45.920
They created like a box,
basically an HDMI capture box.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.560
So they're just
getting an HDMI input

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.990
from any console,
any game platform,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.300
even from like mobile devices.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.080
And they are using
the YouTube APIs,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.740
the YouTube live
streaming API basically.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.780
And from there, they are sending
all the live streaming frames

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.950
to YouTube platform.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.560
And people can just
watch from there.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.400
Another example was like XSplit.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.690
They created like a software
solution, rather than

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.820
the hardware solution.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.700
And people can just
go from their computer

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.840
and just do the authorization,
and create like the settings

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.040
from there.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.705
And once they create the
stream and start stream, voila,

00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:28.010
and it goes to the
YouTube from there.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.350
They start streaming
live to YouTube.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.760
So how did they do that?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.830
They used YouTube
live streaming API.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.580
There are a few
terminologies here.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.520
One is the broadcast, the event.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.807
This is the event
address on YouTube.

00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:50.640
And there is stream.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.450
The stream is coming
from you, your device.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.920
And once you bind it, you
are actually on stream.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.620
Your devices, like
frames, show up

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.340
in the event on the
YouTube website.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.860
And we made it
back this flexible,

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.740
that you can actually
change the-- use

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.400
a few different
streams into the event.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.810
So without changing the event
address, or the YouTube watch

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.200
page, you can actually put
in like different streams.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.590
And if you are a
content partner,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.970
you can actually put cuepoints,
which are in-stream ads.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.370
You can put advertisements
inside those live streams

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.090
as well.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.350
And like the code is like
really similar if you

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.740
are using like the
[INAUDIBLE] output libraries.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.060
You just set a title,
end time, start time,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.840
putting in privacy
selections and just inserting

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.004
the live broadcast.

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:40.420
And one of the things I actually
want to talk to you about

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.270
was YouTube Direct Lite.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.970
So that can be actually
really helpful.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.530
You want to actually have your
gamers upload their content,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.200
but you wanted to share
those content too.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.040
So YouTube Direct Lite
makes it available to get

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.880
either feedback or get
shared content uploaded

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.160
into your playlist.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.550
So they still technical
upload their own accounts.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.520
But if you have like
a playlist idea,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.630
all those videos come
to your playlist.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.120
And from an easy
tool, you can actually

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.110
moderate all these videos
from that tool as well.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.620
So it looks like--
well, on this one

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.130
I will show the mobile versions
as well, that people just

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.255
can upload their platforms.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.420
If they have like some
videos they can submit--

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.440
and I wasn't authorized
so it will fail--

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.120
but then you moderate
those videos.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.800
It comes to like an easy
moderation website for you.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.690
And you can click which
videos you are interested in.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.880
So you can accept or
reject those videos

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.640
and embed the whole playlist
into your own website

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.800
or into your app.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.300
And all those
playlist they choose

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:06.618
starts playing inside your app
or wherever you embedded it.

00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:07.592
There you go.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.760
I have like some playlist.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.400
I see like some pending
videos and I approve them.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.800
If I approve them they
actually come here,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.360
and they actually
come to my playlist.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.830
Or I can just reject them.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.380
So like if there is a video
that I'm not interested in,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.680
I can easily get over it.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.140
And I created like an Android
and iOS version for this one.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.960
So actually you can
either use that.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.970
They're all open source.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.150
You can change it.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.960
Also, they have like the best
practices for using the YouTube

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.100
APIs on the Android
and iOS platform.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.950
It's like most of
the YouTube APIs

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.600
are uploading, showing new
content, playing new content.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.600
So if you are like starting
to use YouTube APIs,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.670
I encourage you to go there
and check out these examples

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.967
and use the code
you learn from that.

00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:08.300
They're all on the open source
under our GitHub channel,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.760
Github.com/YouTube.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.290
So we talked about the
main creative side.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.654
Let's talk about the
[INAUDIBLE] discovery part.

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:18.320
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.820
-Wouldn't it be amazing
if Google could understand

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.450
that the words that you use
when you're doing a search,

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.770
well, they aren't just words?

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.270
They refer to real
things in the world.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.255
That a building is a
building, and an animal

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:31.650
is an animal, and
that they're not just

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.160
random strings of characters.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.680
If we can understand that
those words are talking

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.660
about those real
world things, then we

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.200
can do a better
job of getting you

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.225
just the content that
you want off the web.

00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:48.270
-The way Google is trying
to build information

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.260
about real world connections is
by building a knowledge graph.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.600
A knowledge graph is about
collecting information

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.480
about objects in the real world.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.640
The object could be a
person, could be a book,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.145
could be a movie, and many
other types of things.

00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:04.200
For example, for
a famous person we

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.494
collect relevant
data about them,

00:17:06.494 --> 00:17:09.950
such as their date of
birth or how tall they are.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.425
We can also connect that person
to closely related objects

00:17:13.425 --> 00:17:15.295
in the knowledge graph.

00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:16.590
-Let's say you're interested--

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.545
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:17:17.545 --> 00:17:19.920
IBRAHIM: Actually, we can cut
it short a little bit here.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.875
And so Google they had the good
knowledge graph, so how can

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:23.750
we use it on YouTube?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.619
Like when we are looking to find
like some videos related to us,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.670
or we are just
trying to find videos

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.080
with our own game
or another topic?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.140
So rather than just
giving a query,

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.380
we can actually use those
queries to go to Freebase API.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.190
And get the most related
topics from those Freebase API,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.400
from the knowledge graph.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.590
And once we have the
ID, we can actually

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.220
put those ID into
our YouTube search.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.520
Rather than putting
the query line

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.780
as I did before as
a YouTube API, now

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.230
I can just say YouTube
API find a related topic

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.660
and put the topic ID here.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.760
And this way I will get the
videos that are really related

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:10.216
to that topic, not only
the queries I tell.

00:18:10.216 --> 00:18:12.590
I'm actually kind of like
breaking the rules a little bit

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.090
here.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.180
So I had a different
example before.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.910
But we are doing like a
new YouTube dev channel,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.180
and I had like some
examples for that.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.490
They are actually still kind
of in the allotment phase,

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.340
but why not show them?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.860
So this is one of
the places where

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.790
I was like playing with
the YouTube public API.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.410
So let's say I was
like in test of FIFA.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.910
So when I say FIFA, FIFA
could be like the-- I'm just

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.810
going to the YouTube topic API.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.090
I see it is like m the
Football Federation or Football

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.090
Association, or is it the game?

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.510
Or is it that's the World Cup?

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.670
Like if I search on
YouTube, it could

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.560
be like cutting results
from each one of them.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:00.350
But when I search
with the topic API,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.825
then I have the videos that are
related to only for that event.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.150
So I show this thing.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.080
And I say maybe the
game series, then

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.913
I will have like the
videos that are related

00:19:17.913 --> 00:19:20.140
to the game series-- for
the FIFA game series--

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.940
rather than the FIFA World Cup.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.440
And I said you can actually
use the iframe player

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.340
for different things.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.984
[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:40.274 --> 00:19:43.340
Like one of the developers
used the iframe player just

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.670
to create like a whole
instrument learning app.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.130
But you can actually
create like a whole game,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.580
just playing with
YouTube videos.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.030
Or you can embed those
videos in different ways,

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.190
different like really
fancy ways to put

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.140
into like a gaming platform.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.130
And it's really easy using
the iframe player API.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.670
Iframe player API is just like
you put the JavaScript in.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.850
You create it, and
then you just say

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.160
that you want to create
a YouTube player.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.225
You put the parameters,
and then you

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:16.710
will have the player easily.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.920
I will show you in
a live demo here.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.290
So all I had was just like
creating the YouTube iframe

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.380
API.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.000
And I set the player this
height, this width, and just

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.610
a video.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.480
And once I created
it, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.580
I have like the video player.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.610
You can actually put it as
an iframe inside your app,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.110
inside your game,
and everywhere else.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.490
And we talked about creation
and discovery so far.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.070
Let's talk about the analytics.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.813
Analytics is the part
that actually when

00:20:52.813 --> 00:20:56.030
you use the data API, you
get like the major statistics

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.850
like how many likes,
how many people see.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.560
But if you want to go
into deep, deep analytics,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.520
you want to go get
geographic data

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.860
or you want to get how
many users from which

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.610
ages are actually
seeing those videos,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.540
then you can actually
use the analytics.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.280
Or you want to promote your
app or your game from there.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.030
That's not really actually
correlated with the game,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.320
but it was like once
of the music industry.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.830
They played like
with analytics API.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.260
And The Next Big Sound
actually created a nice app.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.800
It's almost like a game,
actually I want to tell.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.720
That you actually want to
play with your analytics.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.150
You just click if you are like
tracking with different music

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.380
artist, record labels,
you want to actually get

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.380
like how they are doing.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.550
They want to predict how will
the next record, next song

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.050
will sell.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.130
Or how much would it be popular.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.290
So they track through like
different social media,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.280
and one of them is YouTube.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.750
And they see like the video
views, the people's interaction

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.520
through that, how the
channel is popular,

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.780
and their comments and
everything from that.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.459
And then there was like audience
analytics, tubular display.

00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:12.500
They are actually getting
all that analytics data

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.669
from four different
channels they are managing.

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:17.960
And they made like it really
easy [INAUDIBLE] platform.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.860
And they use analytics API.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.620
Basically in analytics API
there are different dimensions

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.680
you can actually get data from.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.520
The metrics that you
want to get the data,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.760
from different metrics.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.480
You have filters.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.180
You can filter data and you
will get a report from there.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.480
And actually, I
will want to show

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.980
one easy demo I created from
that, using that analytics API.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.990
Like you can actually just--
you don't need to create a demo.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.660
You can actually get
all the data easily.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.650
So I was getting
like [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.490
at Google I/O. I was
getting all the what

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.290
are the most popular
videos for each continent

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.870
and like the total views
from each continent

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.790
for those videos.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.580
I was getting for
like different days.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.150
Like as they go change for
different days as well.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.360
And we talked about a
bit on the analytics.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.440
Let's finish up with enterprise,
or the content management side.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.640
Now you have like
videos, rather than just

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.709
making your games popular.

00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:37.250
Since you had like
the game on there,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.780
you had like some content from
there, you have some rights.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.005
And you can actually
even raise revenue out

00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:44.370
of those, all those uploads.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.940
And you can actually,
on that side,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.570
you can use the
content ID platform.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.150
Rather then tracking it
with like one by one,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.620
you can use an API to
track everything from that.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.650
Zefr was one of the
apps, that they're

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.470
using the content ID platform.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.170
They created an app like
this that you can actually

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.050
just easily see
all the things that

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.220
are relevant to your
content, and you

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.270
can monetize all this
content from here.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.500
And for that they use
the content ID API.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.410
With the content ID API, you
manage the content owners.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.169
If you are the content owner
of that channel, or all

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:26.960
the product, you can
actually upload videos

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.850
on behalf of that channel.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.290
You can claim content and
manage advertising and revenue

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.610
generating option from there.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.470
Here was an easy example then.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.930
Before I was uploading just
a video to like my channel.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.490
Now I'm uploading a video on
behalf of some content owner

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.000
to another channel
that I already manage.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.510
And that was like the
four different verticals

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.580
we saw today.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.240
The creation side was
uploading or seeing

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.070
other videos from there.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.860
It was actually a
value on upload videos.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.470
And on the discovery side,
we talked a little bit

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.400
about how you can find
the related videos

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.460
or show in-game
videos to your gamers.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.730
On the analytics side, we talked
about how you can actually

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.280
get more deep analytics, or
you can promote your own data

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.470
or content.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.620
And in the content
management and last vertical,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.600
we talked about how you
can actually create revenue

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.690
in a programmatic way, rather
than doing it like one by one.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.630
And here are a few links
that I want to share.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.920
Our web site will
be hopefully will

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.844
be like a total [? relief ?]
in a week or two.

00:25:36.844 --> 00:25:38.260
That will be like
a great website.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.930
I've already showed like
some preview for you guys.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.810
[INAUDIBLE] on YouTube.com/dev.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.210
And we have an API blog.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.480
We share like the things
that coming or changing

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.980
on the APIblog.youtube.com.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.680
We have the Google+ and
Twitter accounts as well.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.460
And you can also get more
detailed documentation from

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.060
the developers at
google.com/YouTube.
