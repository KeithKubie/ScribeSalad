00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.940
To compute the maximum fare allocation, we take 20 and

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.490
we divide it by 4, which yields 5. But the first

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.810
user only needs one, which yields an excess of four. The

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.980
second user only needs two, which yields an excess of three.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.780
So in this case the maximum fare allocation is easy.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320
We simply take this excess of seven and give it to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.370
the only user whose demand is not yet satisfied, resulting in

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.015
the maximum and fair allocation of one, two, five, and 12.
