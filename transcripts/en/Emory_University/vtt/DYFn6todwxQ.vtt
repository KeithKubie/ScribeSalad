00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.040
Well, there's no question that the
opioid epidemic is evolving.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.860
So now we have most of our overdose deaths 
from heroin and fentanyl,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.720
and those deaths unfortunately are
increasing, but we do know that there are

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.940
strategies in place to address some of
these issues.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.260
We have more focus on treatment, which
is really what we need right now,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.260
we need to make sure those folks who have an opioid use disorder

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.680
who have an addiction, have access to treatment.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.060
When you talk about revaluation 
and the options and alternatives to treat pain,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.340
that requires everyone. So, again, we have to make sure that insurers pay for those alternatives.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.580
For instance, physical therapy may be helpful, but does a patient have access

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.380
to that if it's an increased copay for 
physical therapy versus a prescription?

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.620
And what about paid time off?
So doctors are certainly and have always been

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.600
willing to make treatment recommendations,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.340
but it's important to make sure that those
alternatives are available.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.540
So I think we have everyone from the FDA looking at this. People are looking at maybe

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.380
non-addictive alternatives to treat pain. 
I can tell you that I am a part of a task force at NIH

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.780
where there's a research paradigm going forward looking at alternatives to treat pain.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.300
So everyone is working together to make sure that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.560
there are alternatives to treat pain.
However, we want to make sure that

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.340
those who are doing well, taking their meds as prescribed, and have never misused

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.680
their opioid prescriptions, still 
have access to that medication.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.300
Every state has a registry, and each
state has a different law,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.940
but for the most part, this is a database. So let me just say as a physician, I prescribe an opioid.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.460
I first of all go in and check that database
to see if anyone else has prescribed

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.580
another opioid recently,  or a medication where there may be a negative side effect from that.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.700
So it really is a tool in the toolbox for our physicians.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.040
And so that is kept in a database, and physicians again can check it to see what other medications

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.120
the patient's on, and to see if there might be a need to have a discussion with the patient.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.880
One of the things we have to be careful of regarding this database

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.720
or anything else --
that we don't judge and that we have

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.000
conversations with the patients.
So these databases really are alternatives.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.160
"I see that here on anti-anxiety medication, and you're also on this opioid medication....Let's talk about the fact that that could be a deadly combination."

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.440
The databases are important, but they're not a panacea.
I will also say that we want to make sure

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.960
that we want to make sure that these databases are kept in
public health departments.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.980
Again these databases should be used as a tool.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.700
We also mentioned about the national database,
and so what's very important is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.220
that there already is an agency, the
National Association of Boards of Pharmacy,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.740
that can link, I believe, 48 of the states already.
So if I'm here in Georgia,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.960
and I'm practicing maybe near the border,
I can have access,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.960
if that state has decided to participate
in that, to information around Georgia, to Florida,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.659
Kentucky and so forth.
I have to say these databases are just

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.920
for controlled substances, so each state
might have a different list of medications,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.620
but mainly it's about either 
opioids or about benzo-based, so mainly

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.360
controlled substances in that particular database.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.140
Alcohol and opioids do not mix, 
but let's just take this back a step.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.100
It's important to have conversations about risk factors 
for a substance use disorder as a general part

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.980
of our practices, and particularly, again,
when prescribing an opioid.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.880
The AMA is encouraging physicians to do a 
risk assessment, including the past history

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.040
of problems with other drugs,
medications, misusing other medications.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.960
So that's a part of the overall evaluation and questions,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.980
and physicians ask before they prescribed an opioid.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.600
So, again, we really need more research
to make sure that we can offer

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.910
evidence-based alternatives to pain. Everyone may think they have a good idea, but really

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.910
these ideas have to be studied,
and of course, that's what we do as physicians

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.840
regarding evidence-based treatment.
But here is some we know right now --

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.190
we know that some folks are relieved 
by physical therapy, but you know what, a surgery

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.840
might be an option.
We have pain specialists who offer nerve blocks,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.280
so there could be interventional
alternatives,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.640
there could be other medications
that work, that are not opioids.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.120
It could be biofeedback and, again, physical therapy.
And so all of these alternatives are available now.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.020
It's important that we have a research agenda from the national perspective

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.340
to identify additional alternatives, non opioid alternatives.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.520
But even if an alternative exists today,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.560
if a patient cannot afford, it, either
because they have a high copay,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.000
or it requires more time of from work,
or don't have any insurance at all,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.360
we really have not provided  the access. 
We really have to work on that.
