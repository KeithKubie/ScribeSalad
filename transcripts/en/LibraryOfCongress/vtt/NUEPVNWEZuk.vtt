Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Good afternoon, everyone,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.820
and thank you for being here.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.930
On behalf of the chief
of the Hispanic division,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.020
Dr. Georgette Dorn, I would
like to welcome you all

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.310
to this very special event
with saxophonist, composer

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.040
and educator, Miguel Zenon.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.290
I am joined by my colleague from
the music division Larry Applebaum

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.510
who is senior music reference
specialist in the music division.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.980
I am Talia Guzman-Gonzalez
and I am a reference librarian

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.340
and music librarian specialist
in the Hispanic division.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.320 position:56%
Miguel Zenon was born and raised on
the beautiful island of Puerto Rico,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.020
where he attended Le
Universidad es Musica.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.790
He received his bachelor's degree
in jazz studies at Berkeley College

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.260
of Music and a master's
degree in jazz performance

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.820
from the Manhattan School of Music.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.610 position:56%
But as we know, musicians test their
chops collaborating with others.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.800
And the list of musicians
Miguel has collaborated

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.360
with is quite impressive.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.240
I will not name them all of course,
but they include Charlie Hayden,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.320
David Sanchez, Gear McKlein, the
Jeff Ballard Trio, Steve Coleman

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.260
and Dominguez Band
among many others.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.750
He has been a [inaudible]
in nearly 80 recordings.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.000
15 of those recordings have been

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.050
with the award-winning
band SF Jazz Collective,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.970
of which Miguel is one
of the founding members.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.030
Miguel has also led his
own quartet for 15 years

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.420
and has recorded ten albums, all
received with the highest praise

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.660
by the press and the public,
starting with Looking Forward

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.830
in 2002, selected by
the New York Times

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.270
as the number one alternative
jazz album of the year.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.380
His latest album, Typical, was
released this year in February.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.520
I want to highlight just a couple
of things from Miguel's outstanding

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.940
and impressive career
at such a young age.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.280
And we'll get to talk about
many others in our conversation.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.120
Miguel is the recipient
of a fellowship

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.410
from the John Simon
Guggenheim Foundation

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.290
which supported the recording
of Esta Blena, hailed by critics

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.000
in the US and Puerto Rico as one
of the best recordings of 2009.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.050
It also received two
Grammy nominations,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.910 position:56%
one for best improvised solo and one
for best jazz recording of the year,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.560 position:56%
as well as a Latin Grammy nomination

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.510
for best Latin jazz
recording of the year.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.630
Miguel was again nominated
for a Grammy award in 2012

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.160
for best large jazz ensemble album.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.510
And another Latin Grammy award
for best instrumental album

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.710
for Alma Alventro, the Puerto
Rican Songbook, which pays tribute

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.660
to the compositions and
explorers of music of some

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.500 position:56%
of the great Puerto Rican composers,
[inaudible], Pedro Flores,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.600
Rafael Hernandez and
Silvia [inaudible].

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.500
And is my personal favorite album.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.170
His ninth album, Identities
are Changeable,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.000
also received a Grammy award
nomination in 2014 and was hailed

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.560
by critics as one of the best
jazz recordings of the year.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.340
Besides being an accomplished
musician and composer,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.320
Miguel is also an educator and
is a permanent faculty member

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.200
of the New England
Conservatory of Music.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.640
He has also taught and led
workshops around the world,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.200
including the Bounce Center,
[inaudible], the Conservatory

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.830
of Paris, among many others.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.450
In 2003 he was chosen by the
Kennedy Center to teach and perform

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.000
in West Africa as part of
their jazz ambassadors program.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960
And since 2011 he has led
the program [Spanish name]

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.480
in Puerto Rico and will be
talking about that briefly.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.580
In 2008, Miguel received the
prestigious MacArthur Fellowship,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.260
also known as the Genius
Grant, for --

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.720
and I quote from the
Fellowship's page --

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.300
"For expanding the boundaries
of Latin and jazz music

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
through his elegant and
innovative musical collages.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.930
In his work as a saxophonist
and a composer,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.230 position:56%
Zenon demonstrates an astonishing
mastery of old and new jazz mediums,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.000
from African American and Latin
American rhythmic concepts

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.220
to free avant garde jazz."

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.170
Miguel, welcome to the
Library of Congress

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.520
and thank you for being here.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.820
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Thank you.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.120
It's great to be here, Talia.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.920
Thank you.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:48.010
[ Applause ]

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.310
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.610
For today's event I will be
asking Miguel a couple questions,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.980
and my colleague Larry
will be asking some others.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.470
We'll have an opportunity of Q
and A and there's a special treat

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.220
of Miguel playing for
us today as well.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.850
So we're in for a good time.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.760
So recently, Kevin Whitehead
reviewed Typical on Fresh Air,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.530
and he introduced you
with the following words.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.770
He said, "There are lots of sides
to Zenon's music that only begin

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.850
with a complex insider/outside
status

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.330
of the Puerto Rican jazz musician."

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.180
So I would like to know what
drew you to sax as an instrument?

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.860
And considering the music landscape
in Puerto Rico in the 1980's

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.560
and 1990's, what drew
you to jazz specifically?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.400
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well like you
mentioned, I went to [Spanish name]

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.530
which is a performing arts
middle school and high school

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.780
in the capital of Puerto Rico.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.450
I went there for six years.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:56.130
And when I first started
studying there, I kind of went

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:08.890
in with the idea that I just wanted
to play an instrument, you know.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.860
I didn't really have a
particular instrument in mind.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.740
For some reason I was
attracted to the piano.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.960
When I got there I was
about 11 years old.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.400
But when I got there the first
day and you were involved

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:38.960
on your instrument, everybody got
the same idea as I did of course.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.420 position:56%
And all the piano spaces were taken.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:52.780
So I had to choose something
else and I think the options were

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.530
like oboe, bassoon,
guitar and saxophone.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.470
And I think there was
someone in my family

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.850
who had a saxophone lying around.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.040
It just kind of made sense
out of all those instruments.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.820
I was like, "Yeah, it
kind of makes sense.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.120
Maybe saxophone."

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.640
And of course it eventually
grew on me.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.390
But at first I was more attracted
to the idea of being able

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.300
to play any instrument, not really
an instrument in particular.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.780
I was just attracted
to music in general.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.790
And I went to that
school for six years.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.380
It was all classical training,

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.860
so there was no jazz at
the school obviously.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:53.430
I was exposed to a lot of
popular music and dance music.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.900
And some of my early experience

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.650
as a professional musician
was when I was about 14, 15.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.930
We were playing salsa music,
you know, dance music.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:15.770
So that was kind of my early
introduction to playing something

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.760
that wasn't like chamber music.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.560
And then eventually
towards the end of my period

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.840
of school I discovered jazz through
friends in the school passing

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.080
around tapes and talking about you
know, so and so and Charlie Parker.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.170
It could be a Latin
American musician

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.770
like Pachito Rivera
or someone like that.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.790
And I was really curious about the
idea of improvisation at the time,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:55.350
because I had never been
exposed to anything like that,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.260
or had any formal kind of training.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.070
But I was really curious about it.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.940
What did it for me at the time
was hearing Charlie parker play.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.670
The first time I heard
him I was blown away,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:22.870 position:56%
not only because he played the same
instrument I played and he played it

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:29.380
with such an amazing facility
and great technical ability

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.250
and dexterity, et cetera.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.500
But when I realized that he was
improvising, I was blown away.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.390
Because I was like,
"How can you do that

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.740
and still play the
instrument that way?"

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.550
You know, such an amazing facility.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.660
So I kind of became in a good
way obsessed about trying

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.630
to understand what these
musicians were doing.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.250 position:56%
Discovery jazz music changed my life

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.960
because even though I had been
studying music for a certain amount

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.580
of years at the school, I was
never like really serious about it.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.380 position:56%
You know, I never really considered
the possibility of being a musician.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.680
You know, I was interested
in other things.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.980
I was attracted to the natural
sciences and other things.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.280
I was probably going to
follow that road somehow.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.900 position:56%
But discovering jazz, it really made
me passionate about music, you know?

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.430
And I had something I wanted
to understand and discover.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.050
And from that point on, you know,
it just became a goal of mine

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.790
and I just kind of embarked on that
trip, you know, ever since then.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.090
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: I'm
sure you would have been a great

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.390
scientist, but I'm
glad you chose the sax.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.690 position:56%
Puerto Rican culture plays a central
role in your compositions, right?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.130 position:56%
And in a way it is an archive of our
musical traditions, [Spanish name].

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.720
And at the same time it's a
laboratory where you experiment

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.370
with combinations of sounds and
rhythms to create something new.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.170
What compelled you to develop this
concept in your own compositions?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.470
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yes,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.770
so that process was also
something that came later.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.070
I mean, after I got really
interested in jazz and I realized

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.370
that jazz at least at that
time was not something

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.670
that I could pursue in Puerto Rico.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.970
There were no higher education
institutions at the time

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.270
where I could study jazz.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.570
So I had to go somewhere else.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.870
And Berkeley in Boston
at the time made sense.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.170
So I ended up going to Berkeley.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.470
And when I got to Berkeley,
I realized fairly quickly

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.770
that I was lacking a lot in terms
of sort of like the language

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.070
of the jazz style if
you will, you know.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.370
So I had a lot of work to do.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.570
And I concentrated on really
trying to play jazz well, you know,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.210
studying the music, transcribing,
listening, all the things

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.770
that musicians do, you know,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.060
like immerse yourself
in a style of music.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.070 position:56%
And I wasn't writing any music and I
wasn't thinking about anything else

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.650
that wasn't jazz music for
about two or three years.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.450
About the time that I graduated
Berkeley I started writing a little

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.620
music and kind of started to think
about what it was that I wanted,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.210
if I wrote music, what it was
my music would sound like.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:11.020
I realized that all this
effort that I had put in it

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.580
to study jazz music
was not something

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.840
that I had done with
Puerto Rican music.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.350
I realized that I knew jazz music
better than Puerto Rican music

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.070
because I had studied the
history in a more systematic way.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.850
You know, I grew up in Puerto Rico,
so I knew the sound of the music,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.880
but I couldn't explain it to
somebody else if they asked me.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.130
So I decided that I wanted
to be able to do that,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.360
and I sort of like again just
went into this kind of like --

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.610
treating it almost like
a research project.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.490
Saying, "Okay, what is
this style of music?

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.790
Where did it come from?

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.090
What is it's history?

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.210
Different dimensions,
how deep is the family?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.650
Et cetera, et cetera."

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:58.920
And as I would go into this style
of music or elements of culture

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.990
or folklore, et cetera, a lot

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.910
of those sounds started finding
their way into some of the music

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.210
that I was starting to write.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:12.290 position:56%
And as I did it more and more, I
realized that I would get a lot more

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:18.330
from the research if I just
focused on one theme, you know.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:24.400
So you plan your music
or some of the others.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.680
So a lot of my recording projects
were born out of this interest

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.210
to understand Puerto Rican music

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.460
and Puerto Rico better,
just for my own sake.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.850
And I also feel that it
just kind of helped me.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.080
I mean, I've been living
in the United States

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.610
for about 20 something years
now, so it helps me connect

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.870
to Puerto Rico from afar.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:54.380 position:56%
It helped me find a connection to my
side of what made me a Puerto Rican

00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.250
and connected to my country
that we use in the music.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.030
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
That's very interesting

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.780 position:56%
about the connections to the island,
because your recording from 2014,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.200
Identities are Changeable,
explores precisely those links

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.170
that the diaspora has
with the island

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.280
and how we define what
it is to be Puerto Rican.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.150 position:56%
Could you share with us how you
approached this project and the role

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.390
that the Puerto Rican communities
in Puerto Rico and the US played?

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.200
And what inspired you?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.180
How did they inspire
you to create it?

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah, so Identities
are Changeable was a project

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:37.480
that was born out of again
just curiosity or me trying

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.110
to understand a side of what
it means to be Puerto Rican.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.520
And like I said, I've been living
in the States for a long time,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.500
mostly in the New York City area.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.770
I have family in New York, like
many of us Puerto Ricans do.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.610
And I've experienced sort of
firsthand this idea of second

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.100
and third generation Puerto
Ricans outside of Puerto Rico.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:09.030 position:56%
And this kind of role that exists,
you know, with Puerto Ricans outside

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.720
of Puerto Rico, et cetera.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.350
So I was really curious about
what this experience was like,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.080
because this experience was
not my experience, you know.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.120
And I wanted to understand
it better.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.060
So what I decided to do was --
this all came out of an initiative,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.050
a commission from Walker University
when they first approached me.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.810
Okay, so now I can do this thing.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:40.260
And what I decided to do was
interview a series of individuals,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:46.520
all second or third generation
Puerto Ricans born and raised in

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.190
or around the New York City area.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.170
That was kind of my first step.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.840
I just wanted to talk to them about
their experience, about you know,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.700
how they felt as Puerto
Ricans or New Yorkers or both,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.250
and their identity in general.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.590 position:56%
And as I went through the interviews
and the questions of getting people

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.010
to join the project, I started
to think that what I wanted

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:16.100 position:56%
to do was use the interviews, like
clips from the interviews basically,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.870
something to lace with the music.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.560
So they kind of give their voice,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.720
like a musical identity
almost, like a solo.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.060
So that's what I ended
up doing on the project.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.080
I was very new to this whole
idea of trying to combine music

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.260
with some other kind
of multimedia platform.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:44.350
But I think ultimately what I
ended up getting from the project,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.390
not only in terms of
information for myself,

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:52.330
but trying to understand this
idea better, was that I was able

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.570
to think very differently
about this idea

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:05.520
of a what a national identity
means to us as Puerto Ricans,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:15.730
and Puerto Ricans both on the
island and outside of the island.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:27.870
And of course I would say
probably 10 years ago I had a very

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.030
narrow-minded definition
of what this is.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.500
And now after going
through this project I think

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.860
about it pretty much
totally differently.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.250
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Besides your permanent position

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:52.700
in the New England School of Music
and the workshops and seminars

00:16:52.700 --> 00:17:02.700 position:56%
that you teach around the world, you
also have a project in Puerto Rico

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:11.600
since 2011 called [Spanish name],
which in a way sort of gives you

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.740
that other leg, you know.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:22.650
One leg here in the
US and the other leg

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.020
in Puerto Rico with that project.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.070
Could you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.490
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah, definitely.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.300
So [Spanish name] is a project
that was born out of an interest

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:44.370
of trying to use in this case
jazz music because it's what I do

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:51.830
as a platform to sort of preach the
importance of culture in society.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:58.390
And how these sort of cultural
nativities that are very --

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:04.310
you know, they're not at least to
my eyes simple things, you know.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:11.290
Music and art and all those
things should be available

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.980
to everyone, you know.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:21.680
And I feel that a lot of
places around the world

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:31.150
that have done this
really well have done this

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.500
with a great amount of success.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:44.730 position:56%
So I've always had this idea in mind
of taking jazz music and taking it

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:52.000 position:56%
to places where it's not you know --
where people are not as accustomed

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.970
to seeing it or having it around

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.660
and just giving them the
opportunity to be exposed.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:07.730
You know, I don't really see it as
a way of commercializing the music

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:13.270
or opening up the gap to
one audience or anything.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:20.100
I just feel like it's important
for people to be exposed to as much

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.580
as possible and let them decide
if this stuff is for them or not.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.090 position:56%
So this idea became the reality in
part with the help of this injection

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.750
of funds from the MacArthur
Foundation.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.050
In 2011 like you mentioned,

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.350
we started putting
together these concerts.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.650
What we do is pretty simple.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.950
We put together a free of charge
jazz concert in the rural areas

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.250
of Puerto Rico, so everything
outside of the metropolitan areas

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.550
of San Juan and surrounding areas.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.850
And each concert is focused on a
specific historical jazz figure,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.340
be it Miles Davis, John Coltrane,
Charles Parker, et cetera.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.810
I mean, the locations of course,
we've been all over the place.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.110
We've been to [inaudible]
and some of those places too.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.410
And they vary from theater to
school theaters to you know --

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.920
I think we did one at the Lion's
Club with everybody, you know.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.220
But that's a part of the idea.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.520
We use what the community
has at its disposal

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.820
and we have [inaudible]
and people come out.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.120
So it's a mixed crowd, you know,

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.420
from kids to older
people and families.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.720
It's been great.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.020
So a part of the thing we do
is we put together the concert.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.320
Before the concert we'll do a
pre-concert talk where we talk

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.620
about the history of jazz.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.920
We talk about sort of the basic
concepts of improvisation.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.220
So we give people sort
of like a perspective

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.520
of what they're about to hear.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.820
Because most of the people, I would
say of all the concerts we do,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.120
about 75% of the public have never
been to a jazz concert before.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.420
So we try to give them
a little perspective.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.720
We talk about the music of a chosen
composer, you know, be it Miles

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.020
or -- we talk about their
life, their history, et cetera.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.320
And then we do the concert and
we always finish the concert

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.620
by incorporating a group of
young students from the community

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.920
and that's always of course
the climax of the thing.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.530
Because not only you get
to kind of like pass this

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:24.520
on to a younger generation of
young musicians who are interested

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.450
in getting out there, but also
I feel that it's important

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.150
that these communities feel that
they're part of the project.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.740
That it's not just us coming
in and playing and leaving,

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.410
but they're adding something to it.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:43.160
And just a couple years ago
we started giving out little

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.320
like scholarships, like
a little grant to one

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.350
of the students that plays.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.310
So we give them a little money
so they can buy instruments

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.340
or take lessons and et cetera.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:59.790
And I think we've had
maybe 11 or 12 concerts.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.090
I can't remember.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.940
But I would definitely say
that this has been the most --

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.940
at least to me -- the
most rewarding experience

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.010
that I've been in with music.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.680
You know, this idea of just
putting these concerts together,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.530
not thinking about ticket sales,

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.240
not thinking about
publicity or anything.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.540
Just go play.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.750
And it's probably back to this
idea of the purity of the art form,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.780
the purity of music and just
being able to get there, play,

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.960
connecting with someone
and have them just enjoy it

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.370
for the sake of music.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.610
For me it's been super rewarding.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:37.350
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: Would
you say then that [Spanish name] --

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:43.740
to me at least, I see it as a
vehicle that shows how music

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.370
and culture in general
is fundamental

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.960
to everyone's daily life, right?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.110
And the people in those communities

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.740
that see it also have a
right to this for sure.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.360 position:56%
Would you say that music education
is essential to the development also

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.150
of a sense of citizenship
or commitment to something?

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.450
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah,
I totally feel that way.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:13.890
I think especially these days,
this idea of having music

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:19.520
and just artistic expression around
us, especially as we're growing up,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.760
when we're young, I think
it's not given the importance

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.060
that it should be.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:34.040
And just kind of going back to
my education in Puerto Rico,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.680
and I went to a fine arts
school and became a musician.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.640
But a lot of my peers
did not, you know.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.030
They became scientists and baseball
players and all kinds of stuff.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:52.030
But when I see them now, I
feel we have this connection

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.610
because they went through
the process of seeing music

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.400
from the inside, you know,
as performers and learning

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.310
to play an instrument and getting

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.130
through this artistic
expression even if it's something

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.670
that they're not going to use
as a way of making a living.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.410
It changed them, you know.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:14.290
And I feel that it's so important
to give everyone, as many people

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.620
as we can, the opportunity
to go through the process

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.130
of seeing what it feels
to create something

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.000
from an artistic point of view.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.660
And I think that's
why it's so important

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.840
to have this available
and have this out there.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.610
And I'm a firm believer in this.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.910
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
In your webpage --

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.670
which I encourage you all to visit.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.220
It's pretty interesting.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.450
You have a section
of other interests,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.630
and you're into literature.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.960
Which gives us a glimpse into
you know, your broad interest

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.480
in other cultural things.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.220
Could you tell us what
role literature played

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.860
in your music, if any?

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.200
You have a recording also
called [Spanish name],

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.140
which is pretty unique.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:06.220
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah, well
you know, I do enjoy reading.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:13.280
I mean, it's something that I
just enjoy for the sake of it,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.440
like I like listening to
music and everything else.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.830
This project, as you mentioned,
was unique in its own way

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.380
because what I did was I focused
on this [inaudible] book along

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.180 position:56%
with this friend of mine from Paris.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.220
And it just kind of made
sense because that's kind

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.110
of like what the book
jumps back, from Paris.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.740 position:56%
We're trying to put something
together and that book just happened

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.540
to be like the perfect
sort of platform.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.120
And it just happens
to be my favorite.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.220
So we tackled it in a way that
we used the book as inspiration

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.490
to write pieces and
et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.340
But it's not something that
I usually do, you know.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:00.530
I don't usually think about
music that way, meaning --

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.510
let me see how to say this.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.480
When I write music or when
I'm thinking about music,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.600
I don't rely as much
on random inspiration.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:20.740 position:56%
And I deal with music more in a
step by step kind of systematic way,

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:26.480
where when I write something or
when I'm practicing I already kind

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.430
of have a set of materials or
tools that I already have with me.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.030
So even though there
always is some improvisation

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.980
and of course some randomness,

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:43.680
I try to rely very little
on that aspect of it.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.100
So in that sense if I'm reading a
book, it's very rare that I'm going

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.540
to write a piece of music based
on how that book made me feel.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.120
It's going to be more likely that
I'm going to take a paragraph

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.690
and try to translate that
to musical terms somehow

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.080
and then write it more
from that perspective.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: And I have
one last question before we move

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.250
to Larry's portion.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.470 position:56%
I want to ask something about
Typical, which is your recent album.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:22.290
I saw the album cover and
I read the word typical

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.280
which could be translated
to folk music in a sense.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.710
And it's not exactly that, right?

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.090
When you listen, it's not
typical music in any sense.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.440
So why that title?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.740
Why Typical?

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:42.580
And how is this term used in
this project specifically?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.620
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: So the title
came from this idea of --

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.080
like you say, when
we as Puerto Ricans

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.790
or Latin Americans here this
word typical, or musica typica,

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.240
it usually means something
with folklore.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.010
Something down to earth, you
know, earthy kind of thing.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.460 position:56%
And when I was thinking about this
and I was thinking about the meaning

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.250
and what it means, I started
thinking about how this at least

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.580
to my eyes could mean a style
of music that's connected

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.120
with a very specific
group of people.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.170 position:56%
Like Musica Typica from Puerto Rico.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.260
Then you have typica from Cuba

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.100
and everybody has their
own kind of way about it.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.420
You can break it up into
different sub-genres and all that.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:30.150
And this recording
specifically, I was writing music

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:36.200
that was inspired pretty
much directly by my quartet

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.650
and the members of the quartet.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.800
And I was thinking about
you know, writing pieces

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.750
that represent our sound
and represent you know,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:49.340
like how we perform as a band and
this sort of like this language

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.400
that we've created together so we
can communicate with each other.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.780
And I felt that that was
kind of our music, you know.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.540
And Typical in this
case comes from that.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.880
You know the title comes

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.570
from something saying,
"This is our sound.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.910
This is the music that
sort of represents us."

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.350
And the cover is a great
picture, which is from here.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:20.250
And I usually go through this
process of trying to pick a cover

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.570
and really getting to historical
pictures, actually those

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.080
that are connected to
Puerto Rico somehow.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.520
And I found this great
picture by [inaudible].

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.810
And then going through the
filters, I found out it was here.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:40.180
And the process was
actually really simple.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.380
And it just worked out perfectly.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: Thank you.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.790
Well I'm going to pass
the mic to you, Larry.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.420
Thank you.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.720
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I
like those questions.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: Thank you.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.970
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: And
of course the answers.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:01.200
I have many questions to ask,
but even before we start those,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:09.720
I want to show you something
and get your reaction to it.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.370
Let me put down the water.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.880
I want you to describe
what you're seeing.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.270
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well,
maybe if I read it.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: This
is one of the treasures

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.730
from our collection
in the music division.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.340
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: This
is Barbados, right?

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Right.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.940
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: But it's
got a different title.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Right.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.540
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: What's the title?

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Kangaroo.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.930
So this is in the hand
of Charlie Parker.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.280
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Oh my God,
this is something else.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.370
You know, it's funny you show me
this, because there's this rumor

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.250
that goes around in music.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.120
I've heard it a couple times
that Charlie didn't know how

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.720
to notate music and he wasn't
musically like trained,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.820
like he just played
everything by ear and all that.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.530
And I'm always like, "Man, it's
impossible he can play that way."

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.800
And it's great to see this.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.210
You know, it's amazing.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.510
Let me see if I'm getting
the notes right.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:21.150
[ Humming ]

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.900
Well this is something else.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.200
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Yeah.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.690
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: I'm
glad to see that.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.350
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
So I'm curious --

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.790
because you mentioned
Charlie Parker earlier.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.890
When you listen to an
improvising saxophonist

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.450
or any creative musician,
what are you listening for?

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.230
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well,
that's a good question.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:50.960
You know, as an instrumentalist
and someone that spends a lot

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.070
of time playing an instrument,
it's hard for me to disconnect

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.770
from listening to music from
that perspective, you know?

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.940
So usually if I hear
someone playing,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.380
especially if they're playing
jazz, if they're playing any music,

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.720
I'm pretty much hearing chords and
notes and rhythm you know, first.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.270
That's usually the
first thing I hear.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.070
What keys it's on,
what notes are playing,

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.370
what's the beat, what's the feel.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.730
You know, that kind of stuff.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:21.000
But the music that I find
usually attractive in terms

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.990 position:56%
of if I'm listening to an improviser
for example, or someone that's kind

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:34.330
of from a jazz perspective, I'm
attracted to personality in sound.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.150
And that's something
that I work on myself.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:44.050
And I've always been really
interested on this idea

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.260
that the instrument is a
reflection of our personality

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.600
and it's a reflection of
the way our bodies move.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.320
And because I'm an instrumentalist
I know how hard it is to attain

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.580
and get to a point where
you get that instrument

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.440
to really be an extension of you.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.820
So when I hear Charlie Parker
or [inaudible] musicians

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.590
in that category and I hear
the personality in their sound,

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.770
that's the first thing
that brings me

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:19.280
in before what they actually
are playing, you know.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:28.330
And then, again I'm really
just saying this specifically

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.990
about jazz music.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:35.010
I'm listening to a
connection to the evolution

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:39.730
of the tradition of jazz, you know.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.200
What connection do they have to
the evolution of the language.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.050
And again, I think I might
have mentioned this before,

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.460 position:56%
but when I think about jazz music --

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.460
when I first started getting into
music I realized fairly quickly

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.070
that this was a language
first of all.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.480
And second that it
wasn't my language.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.900
So I had to kind of learn it
from scratch, much like learning

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.120 position:56%
to speak English in a way, you know?

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.010
So when I hear players, be it
older or more modern players,

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.530
I'm listening for that connection.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:18.240 position:56%
And it's easier for me to relate to
someone that has a deeper connection

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:26.010
or something that I can hear more
clearly than someone that doesn't.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.560
You know, so if I hear
that connection,

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.410
in some way it's easier
for me to relate.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So
language is one thing.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:40.320 position:56%
I want to ask you about sound,
specifically your sound on the horn.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.060
When we learn to speak, we're not
necessarily conscious of the sound

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.890
of our voice, the spoken voice.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:54.520
But I wonder, how conscious
is your sound on your horn?

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.460
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well, I
like to think about this

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.810
in sort of like two ways.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.910
One way is the personality
thing that I mentioned before,

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.930 position:56%
where we're really trying to portray
something that's unique to us.

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:13.560
And it's like it might be
inspired by someone you admire,

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:20.490
like in my case Charlie Parker and
Coltrane or somebody that I like.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:24.520 position:56%
And probably my sound is going to
be some kind of combination of that,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.660
or try to be a combination of that
and other things that I like too.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.470
So that's one side of it.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:35.430
But in my opinion that's sort
of like the easier side of it.

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:39.590
The harder part is really
being able to connect

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.480
to the instrument physically.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.450
And as an instrumentalist, a lot
of the things that we do and most

00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:48.580
of the time that we spend
on the instrument is trying

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:54.220
to make this connection as
natural and seamless as possible.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.580
That takes a lot of time of course.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.620
And at least myself, I don't feel
that when I pick up the instrument,

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.220
the saxophone, it's not something

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:10.960
that my body is naturally
instructed to do.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.010
You know, I have to
train myself to be able

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.740
to actually produce a
sound and a quality sound.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.030
So I have to use parts of my
body when I play the saxophone

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.510 position:56%
and use them in a very specific way.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:29.940
And I use them in a way that I
don't use doing anything else,

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.190
doing my daily routine.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.710
I have to use my diaphragm
in a very specific way,

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.010
use my lungs in a very specific
way, the muscles in my face

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.870
and my oral cavity and my throat.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:45.380
That all adds to that
idea of just being able

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.170
to produce a sound, like one note.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:55.480 position:56%
So to me it's a balance between this
physical, almost like an athlete,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.560
fitness kind of thing where you
really need to be fit and in shape

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.700
in order to be able to
produce quality sound.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.920
And then once you can control
that, then you try to bring

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.190
to that sound personality.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.970
And like I said, this
could take forever.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.270
This could take forever.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:18.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
Was there a point

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.990
at which you felt you had
finally arrived at your own sound?

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.840
Your own musical identity?

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.790
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: There was
definitely a point where I felt

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.570
that I was in the right direction,

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.690
that I felt that I had
found something that worked

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:41.690
and I just kind of needed
to finesse it a little bit.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: There's a
mysterious process especially

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:51.080 position:56%
for jazz players, because so much of
what they do involves improvisation.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.300
So here's one of my questions, is
how did you learn to improvise?

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.600
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Okay.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.240
So one thing about improvisation
that's important to understand --

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.740
and this is something again
that helped me immensely --

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.750
was to understand the
difference between improvisation

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.630
as a general concept and
improvisation within a language

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.150
or within a musical
language in this case.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.900
Like for example, when I was in
Puerto Rico and I was listening

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.630
and mostly playing salsa music
and listening to that music,

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.750
the language that I
was using to improvise

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.430 position:56%
within that music was very different
than the language I would play

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.240
if I was playing Barbados
or Kangaroo.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.910
The music is a different language.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.670
I'm improvising in
both cases, you know,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.160
but using a different language.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.380
Again, kind of going back to
this idea of English and Spanish,

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.240
I might be saying the same thing
but using a different language

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.040
and improvising, et cetera.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:55.050
So once that became clear to me,
the next step for me was, okay,

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:01.980
so I want to improvise but I don't
have enough language in this case.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.840
So I need to acquire more language.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.070
So I do that by listening, by
transcribing, my immersing myself

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.250
in this language, in this
case in the jazz language.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.310
And as I get myself more and
more immersed in this language,

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.860
a lot of these things that you
know Charlie Parker played,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.370
or Corbin Hawk or Alyssa
Young or whoever I like.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:26.730
And I check that and I
was influenced by it.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.730
It starts as something that you
basically repeat, repetition.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.440
And then it eventually
just becomes second nature.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.040
You internalize it and
it becomes part of you.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.380
And the combinations of all
these players eventually becomes

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.860
your personality.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.330
Along with your own ideas.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:45.130 position:56%
I think there's a point where you --

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:50.240
at least for myself there was
a point where I started to look

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.320
at a Charlie Parker
composition or solo and instead

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.010
of necessarily repeating
what he played,

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.980
I would sort of analyze
what he played.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.590
And say, "Okay, so if he did
this this way on this chorus

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.850 position:56%
with this rhythm and these notes,
that means that I can turn it around

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.200
and do it differently, or
take a couple more steps."

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.380
And you start building
your language on the idea

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.270
of addition and assimilation.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.020
And then eventually you use
that language to improvise.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:24.840
So I see it more as
improvisation is not necessarily --

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.760
in this case jazz improvisation
is not where you just go up

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.090
and play whatever comes
to your mind.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.870
But it's sort of like an
organized improvisation.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.580 position:56%
You're improvising on ideas based on
information that you've already got.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.090
And you're using that
information to improvise.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I can hear that
you are a somewhat analytic person.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.870
Are you self-critical?

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.170
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.630
Yeah, you could say that too.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.930
[Laughs].

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So when you're
listening to your own music,

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:05.970 position:56%
or really for any kind of music,
what do you think makes a good solo?

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.670
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well, I
think it's a little different

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.540
when I'm listening to myself and
when I'm listening to someone else,

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.590
especially if it's
somebody that I admire.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.130
Someone like [inaudible]
and Coltrane and all those.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:31.380
You know, a lot of those solos,
I listen to them differently

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.450
because they forge
something like what I play.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.900
So it's harder for
me to be critical.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:45.430
But with myself, and
a lot of my friends

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.770
and me do this all the time --

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.690
where I record a concert
and I go listen back.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:55.500
And I say, "Okay, maybe this works
and that doesn't work, you know,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.680
from a perspective of performance."

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.710
It's also perspective of just
like a player, or you know,

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.540
when I'm naturally
playing and improvising.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:16.230 position:56%
And I'm listening for things as
basic as time, you know, intonation,

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.960
sound, to interaction
with other musician.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.520
You know, am I reacting to what's
around me, or am I just kind

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.030
of going blindly and on
my own kind of space?

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:36.330
And I'm also trying to find when
I listen back to it at least,

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.140
I'm trying to find like a
connecting sort of thread

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.930
through the improvised solo.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:46.990
And I'm trying to find
something that --

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.130
you know, you hear this all
the time, tells the story.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.900
It's kind of that, but it's more --

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.200
I like to think about it
more from the perspective of,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.540
am I paying enough attention
not only to what's around me,

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.330
but am I paying enough
attention to what I'm playing

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.970
so that I'm not just
sort of rambling

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.730
and I can actually use the
ideas I'm putting out there

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:11.590
to build something
that's logical and basic?

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: You teach also.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.170
Can you teach someone to swing?

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.640
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: I think so.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.780
I mean, it's not going
to be the kind of thing

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.370
where it's going to
take five minutes.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.040
But I think you can do it.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum:
How would you do it?

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.710
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: I think
it's like anything.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:34.450
I think that kind of
thing has to do with --

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:39.930 position:56%
it's almost like learning an accent,
like if you're speaking a language

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.230
and learning an accent, you know.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.770
Like I was somewhere the other day

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.820 position:56%
and someone told me I had a New York
accent and I was blown away by that.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.120
I was like, "Really?

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.420
A New York accent?

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.040
I've never even thought
about that before."

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.210
But it's almost like if
you're teaching someone

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.900
to learn a British accent
or something like that.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.130
It kind of is -- the
only way you can do

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.120
that is by immersion, you know.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.300
By just listening and playing along
and listening and playing along.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:07.570
And a lot of times what I end up
saying, when I hear someone play,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:11.780
like a drummer or a pianist and
I'm talking about slow swing

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.730
for example, and I will say like
your swing feel is too straight

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.720
or it's too exaggerated and so on.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.810
Sometimes it's too
much on the other side.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.280
So I would say something like that.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.550
So I would say, "Okay, so your
swing feel is too straight.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.650
So why don't you check out
so and so and so and so,

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.110
who's going to pull
you to the other side?"

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.610
And if it's too much of the other
side, then I'm going to say, "Okay,

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.640
so you should be listening to
this, this, this and this."

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.170
You know, just immersion and
listening and transcription

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.110
and trying to find your
place with what you lay.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:51.680
I mean, a lot of what we do as
jazz musicians is trying to prove

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.420
to ourselves in the place
of musicians we admire.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.450
So we play along with records.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.760
You know, we play along with
records to try to see if I'm going

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.810
to play a [inaudible]
solo or a Coltrane solo.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.460
I'm going to put that record on
and I'm going to learn that solo,

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.040
and I'm going to try to phrase
it exactly the same way.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.760 position:56%
I'm going to try to pull things
through the same exact articulation.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.550
And in that sense we're not only
getting to the notes and the theory

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.630
of it, but the actual feel.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.660
So a lot of what we do in
terms of learning and feel,

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.700
be it learning how to swing
in jazz, or just learning how

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.000
to make the music feel good,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.140
is by emulating what's
out there, you know.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.590
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Talia
was mentioning not just your

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:42.140
accomplishments, but the awards
you've received over the years.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.720
And I wonder, is recognition
important to you?

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.300
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well I like to
think about it from a perspective

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.630
of it's something that's
important in terms

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.640
of opening doors to opportunities.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.940
I mean,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.470
I definitely feel like things
like the MacArthur Fellowship

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:08.170
and the Guggenheim
Fellowship, Grammy nominations,

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:13.980
all those things, they give myself
and my music more visibility

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.060
and opens doors professionally.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.390
Which makes me work more
and makes my life easier.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:28.360 position:56%
But on the other hand, like you
said, I'm self-critical and I'm sort

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.530
of a firm believer on
being my own judge.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:40.620
I believe that I'm the
person that's most capacitive

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.090
to really accurately say what
it is that I'm doing wrong

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:49.740
and what I'm not doing well.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: As a
judge, are you forgiving?

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.740
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Yeah, sure.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.040
I mean, it's the kind of thing --

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.370
I'm not going to be
totally flagellating myself

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.130
or anything over a solo.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:13.070 position:56%
But I take recognition of these kind
of awards as something that's good.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.840
But even if it was
something that was negative,

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.970
like even if it was a
review, a negative review

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:21.920
or a positive review, to me
those things are basically

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.560
at the end of the day opinions.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.040
And they will have effect, like
this opinion and that opinion.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:37.020
But at the end of the day, I'm
working sort of based on the amount

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:42.190
of effort and the amount of
work that I still need to do.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.980
I mean, I always feel that there's
always something I can do better.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.050
And it's probably just the way
it's going to be, and that's kind

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.260
of how I do it with my work.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.820
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: You
never stop learning.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.120
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: No.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.420
That's right.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: So you
mentioned Charlie Parker

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.630
and I know how important
his music is to you.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.260
If he were here with us
today, what would you

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.040
like to ask him or
talk to him about?

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.680
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: I would probably
ask him about what he's practicing.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.610
It's funny you say that,
because there's this interview

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:17.200
with Paul Desmond,
who I'm sure you know.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.340
It blows me away every
time I hear it,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.670
because Paul Desmond was
a great saxophonist too.

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.720
He was asked about his playing.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:30.150
And I'm thinking this is probably
like late-40's, early-'50's

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:35.210
and this music was so new that
you know, to hear someone play

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:40.840
that way is almost like someone
inventing a whole new language

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:46.020
within a period of like two years,
and then that language becoming it,

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.040
like what everybody
wanted to play like.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.020
And then it was like
the greatest thing.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.150
And still now I hear
it and I'm like, "Wow,

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.960
this is the greatest thing ever."

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.190
You know, and on the interview
he's talking to Charlie Parker

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.280
about his practice routine.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.740
And it blew me away what
Charlie Parker was talking about,

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.230
how much he practiced.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:11.520
At some point he said, "I might
be practicing 10-11 hours a day."

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.870
But a lot of what he was
practicing were things

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.950
that were really basic things.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:20.350
You know, scales, time,
just assimilating solos.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:26.360
So I'm always interested
in how you know,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.540 position:56%
musicians build their routines, you
know, build their routines and build

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.560
on things that are
important to them, you know.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.060
So I would probably
ask him something

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.420
about his practice routine.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: I'm very
curious what your questions will be.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.800
And you'll have a chance to
ask them in just a moment.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.650
I'll ask one last one, and that is,
as a musician, composer, arranger,

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:53.970
educator, as a father, how
do you measure success?

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.420
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: It's hard to say.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.870
I mean, I think probably
the way I would do it --

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.980
and this is kind of how I
think about this in general.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:09.850
When I started playing this music
and when I decided that I wanted

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:17.270 position:56%
to be a musician for a living, I did
it because my goal was to be able

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.940
to play with people I
admired, you know, my heroes.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:26.310
And I've gotten to do that
a bunch over the years

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.620
and I feel you know
very lucky about that.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:35.550
I never really thought of music
as a way of creating a platform

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:38.330
for myself as an individual artist.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.220
I never thought that
someday I'm going

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.130
to have my own band
and my own records.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:48.110 position:56%
I mean, eventually that happened and
it's been a great experience too.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.730
But I usually measure in terms

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:56.550
of our very small,
little jazz world here.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:01.070 position:56%
I measure musicians sort of in terms
of who they play with, you know.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:05.000
And if I see a musician who's
playing with a whole bunch

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.850 position:56%
of different people, I think, "Okay,
so that guy must be good, you know."

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:15.220
He's respected in the
community and he's first call

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.860
for these different projects.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.390
So they must have something
that all these musicians

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.160
from different places
are attracted to.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.420
So I feel that as I get to play
with more musicians and I get

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:34.190
to be more experienced,
I feel good about that.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:37.930
You know, more than anything
else, that I have that kind

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:40.750
of connection to the community.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: That's it.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.720
You must be good.

[ Laughter ]

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.900
Okay, again, think
about your questions.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.750
But you know, I couldn't help but
notice you have your horn with you.

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.430
Yes, right behind the chair.

to let that bad boy out of the case.

Questions first?

&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Maybe we
do the questions first.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.010
&gt;&gt; AL: Okay.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.830
Who has a question?

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:13.620
There's one right there.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.680
&gt;&gt; I had a question for
all of us amateur musicians

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:26.170 position:56%
about how you encourage people to be
willing to take the chance to get up

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:29.050
and play in front of other people.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:30.700
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: Well you know,
that takes some courage for sure,

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.030
especially if you're
just getting started

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.720
and if you haven't
had the experience.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.680
But I feel like it's
like anything, you know?

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.430
As you gain confidence
in what you're doing,

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:48.560
and that was my experience,
you know, the more I practiced

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.920
and the more I felt that
I could do something

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.340
with a certain amount of comfort.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.480
It became a little
easier to get up on stage

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.020
and play in front of people.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.860
Of course, the first time
I did it I was terrified.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.220
And the second time a little less,
and the third time a little less.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.210
And it kind of goes like that.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.080
I've been doing this
for a long time.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:17.070
Still, once in a while you know,
I'll get a little something.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:21.520
Maybe it's a family member in
the audience or someone I admire,

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.030
so I'm getting really jitterish.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:32.520
But after a while if you do it
enough, it just becomes routine.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.150
It just becomes something
that you're comfortable with.

[ Inaudible ]

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.900
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: So David
and I, we actually went

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.950
to the same performing arts school
in Puerto Rico, the [Spanish name].

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:08.780
He went there -- he's about
eight years older than I am.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.100
So he was there way before me

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.230
and I didn't meet him
at the school of course.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.080
But we went through
the same courses.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.050
We had the same saxophone
teacher and everything, you know.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:22.070
And of course when I was at the
school, when I was finishing up

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:25.520
and getting into jazz, he was kind
of like putting out first records.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.140 position:56%
So I was a great admirer of his work

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.020
like when I was just
getting started.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.990
Eventually once I moved to
Boston I got really close

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.140
with another Latin American
musician, Danilo Perez.

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:45.460
He was a pianist and composer.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.450
And Danilo sort of
became a mentor in Boston.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:52.070 position:56%
You know, I spent a lot of time with
him and would go off to his house,

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:54.390 position:56%
take lessons, play with him a bunch.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.970
So I met David through Danilo
while I was still in Boston.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.530
I still remember when I met him.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.530
We met at this place for dinner and
then David was playing that night.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:08.110
I came over and I sat in and
played with him and it was cool.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:10.750
And then eventually when I
started figuring out what to do

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.860
after school, after Berkeley,
some folks suggested,

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.160
"You should go to New York."

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.420
I thought, "Okay, maybe
I'll try that."

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.690
I had family in New York so
that made sense at the time.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.120
I was going to school in New York.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.420
And when I was in New York,

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.070
the first thing I did
was I called up David.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.660
You know, I was like,
"I'm in New York.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.180
Remember we met in Boston?"

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.590
And David did basically
exactly the same thing

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:33.890
that Danilo did, you know.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.210
I would go over to his house
and he became a mentor.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.020
I would go over to
his house like, "Man,

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.740
I'm kind of playing on this tune.

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.190 position:56%
Do you think you hear another line?"

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.830
He was like, "Maybe I
hear a counter line."

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.100
And I started doing
that just for fun.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.080 position:56%
And then it was like, "You know, we
should play that at the gig tonight.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.380
Why don't you come over?"

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.680
And I went and played.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.980
And we did that in Boston.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.280
It was like, "Why don't
you come on tour?"

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.950
I did that and started
playing with him.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:59.420
The relationship was born
out of that sort of dynamic.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:04.680
And just kind of going back to
this idea of David and Danilo,

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.560 position:56%
they're very close friends and they
both played together for a long time

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.710
with [inaudible] and a
bunch of other bands.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:14.720
And to me, when I started
getting into jazz,

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.510
they represented what
I wanted to achieve,

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:19.150 position:56%
not in terms of success or anything.

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:26.140 position:56%
But I felt that as working musicians
they have both been able to get

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.310
to a place where they can be
respected as jazz musicians,

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:33.000
you know, authentic jazz musicians.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.980
But at the same time,
represent their culture, right?

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.190
In the case of David and Danilo,
they are both very connected

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.690
to you know, the music
of the country and trying

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.260
to represent that in their music.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:51.550
And I related to that idea
very deeply, you know.

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:56.870
And I related to the idea of making
music that wasn't just sound.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:02.210
Sort of like instrumental
dance music kind of thing,

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:06.490
but that had more of a
balance between what I consider

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.950
to be essential elements of
jazz, interaction, you know,

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:14.630
this idea of taking risk and
letting things kind of flow.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:18.530
And combining that with
folklore and all this.

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.900
And I felt the music at the time
represented that, and that was kind

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.990
of what I was trying to achieve.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:28.340 position:56%
So it was really nice to cross paths
with them and eventually you know,

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.300
become part of their
little circle in a way.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.060
So that was really great.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.360
Thank you.

else has a question?

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.010 position:56%
We have a question in the front row.

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.990
You have a question?

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.320
Do you want to come ask?

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.030

It can be Spanish.

[ Speaking Spanish ]

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.340
Great question.

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.920
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: She asks
who made the decision

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:26.170
that I was going to
become a decision.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:33.850
So I made that decision myself,
but it was a hard decision

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.500
because at first I wasn't sure.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.100
I was like, "Maybe I
should do something else."

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.740
I wanted to be an engineer.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.130
I wanted to study science and math.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.710
You know, I was interested
in that as well.

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:49.340
But I really loved music
and I really loved to play.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.120
So I said, "I'm going to give
it a try and see how it goes.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.690
And then if after a couple
years it doesn't feel good,

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:57.180
maybe I'll go to the other thing."

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.760
It felt good after a couple
years, so I said, "Okay,

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.620
I'll give it a couple more years."

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.820
And then eventually I just kept
going and it became what I do.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.120
Okay?

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:12.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Can you
say what you love about music?

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:16.530
&gt;&gt; Miguel Zenon: You know, when
I first started playing music

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:21.800
and not necessarily playing
jazz, but playing an instrument,

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:26.410
I liked the fact that it
felt like a game to me.

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:31.020
I remember when I was playing
music, I was also playing a lot

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.270
of basketball at the time.

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.100
And it felt the same way to me.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.550
It was almost like
something you do for fun.

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:38.870
You can interact with others.

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:42.780
You can portray your
personality, be competitive

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.040
and do things to make
yourself better.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.950 position:56%
And even though I've been doing it
for a long time, I still try to find

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:56.260
that sort of like childlike
mentality where you just do it

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:59.200
because it's fun and playful.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Applebaum: Beautiful.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.150
Who else has a question?

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.110
No? Well maybe now's the time.

We want to hear him.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:10.510
