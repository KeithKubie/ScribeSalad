00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:05.626
What is the ratio between the amount of traffic incurred by Ben's implementation,

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:08.302
versus your optimized implementation?

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:10.063
Please fill in the blank here.

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:12.700
Your answer does not have to be exact,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.934
but it should be within 10% of the actual ratio.
