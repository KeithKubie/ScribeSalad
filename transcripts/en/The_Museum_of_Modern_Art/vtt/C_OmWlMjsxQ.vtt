00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:10.589
- [voiceover] Richard Serra, standing at

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:11.716
the foot of the steps,

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:13.963
looking into his sculpture.

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:16.433
- This is a piece called
"Intersection II".

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.564
It was built in 1992, 1993.

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:22.521
It consists of four identical plates,

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.210
even though you might think that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.504
each plate is different.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.619
Each plate is a single piece of steel

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.113
about 13 feet high,

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:33.344
and they're about 50 feet long,

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:35.918
probably upward of 30 tons.

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:38.724
They're made of conical shapes.

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:40.721
When you think of a cone,

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.921
you either think of a flower pot

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.366
or a lamp shade.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.700
If you think of a section

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.700
of each of those being turned upside down,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.058
that is how this piece is formed.

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:55.799
What that does is make three

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.147
different juxtaposed spaces,

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:00.369
a contained elliptical
space in the center,

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.101
and two flanking passages.

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:04.940
I think the best thing for us to do now

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.370
is walk into the central space

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.582
so we can see how this accounts for

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:14.786
a psychological feeling
of different spaces.

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.476
When you walk into this space,

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.911
immediately the sound is limited.

00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:22.575
You're in a very, very contained space.

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:25.182
One large form is leaning toward you,

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:26.912
and the other leaning away from you,

00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:28.920
which may make you think that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.890
you have to adjust your balance.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.800
Depending on your own experience,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.324
there are references
that might come to mind,

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:42.261
nautical, cavern, enclosure, or whatever.

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.205
You feel that you're in a weighted space,

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.412
almost like the ballast

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:48.568
in the bottom of a ship.

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:51.334
- [voiceover] As you walk out the far

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:53.196
end of this central space,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.821
turn to your left and step into the

00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:56.435
narrow flanking space leading

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:59.370
back towards where you started.

00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:03.470
- We're going to walk in between

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.733
two plates leaning away from you,

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.478
and what this does is it opens

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:11.272
itself outward toward the sky.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:13.969
This space seems much more relaxing,

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.036
easier to traverse.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.835
The fact that you can see through

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:20.715
to the open end before you arrive at it,

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.953
allows you to walk freely through it.

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:27.898
- [voiceover] When you
emerge from this space,

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.682
please turn to your left and walk over

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.865
to the passage on the far side.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.627
- The interior plate is now

00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:37.725
leaning toward you.

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:38.940
The exterior plate is also

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.226
leaning toward you,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.538
and as the piece rises,

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:44.994
the space becomes more
and more compressed.

00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:46.179
This space has much more of a

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.915
vertical lift to it.

00:02:48.915 --> 00:02:50.394
I decided the height in relation

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:52.465
to my body movement.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:53.489
At a certain point,

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.614
if work becomes too high,

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:57.259
you look up and the physical space

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:59.695
won't be registered with your body.

00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:02.547
It just becomes like a building.

00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:06.652
These pieces still have
their mill scale on them.

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:08.533
The grey aspect, which is still

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:10.317
kind of deteriorating,

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:12.783
eventually will crack and fade

00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:14.331
and fall off completely,

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:18.045
and then you'll have
the dark rusted patina.

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:19.620
That patina will continue to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.139
oxidize over eight years.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.441
The reason this piece still has

00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.132
its mill scale on it is that

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:26.843
it's been stored inside.
