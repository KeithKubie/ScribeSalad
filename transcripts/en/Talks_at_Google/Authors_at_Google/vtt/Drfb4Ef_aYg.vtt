00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.630
MALE SPEAKER: Scientist,
a best selling author

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.560
whose future-oriented
novels include

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.950
"The Postman," and "Earth."

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.750
His "Uplift" Hugo Award
winners include "Star Tide

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.050
Rising" and "The Uplift
War." "The Postman"

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.169
inspired a major film; I
guess it wasn't that close

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.585
the book so it's
only inspiration.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.850
He's also known as a
leading commentator

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.850
on modern technology trends
and his nonfiction book

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.060
"The Transparent Society"
won the Freedom of Speech

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.850
Award of the American
Library Association.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.270
His newest novel,
"Existence," explores

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.880
the ultimate question--
billions of planets

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.850
may be right for intelligent
life, so where is everybody?

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.407
OK, so I'll hand
it over to David.

00:00:46.407 --> 00:00:51.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:52.760
DAVID BRIN: Nice to be back.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.980
It's nice to see
some familiar faces.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.190
Thank you very much Mike.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.762
It's great to see your director
of research sitting here,

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.140
the great Peter Norwig.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.080
Let's just start
with something that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.330
will give me time
to get my jacket on.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.310
This is a little
something that shows you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.184
how marketing is now
being done for books.

00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.176
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:24.658

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.256
DAVID BRIN: The art of the--

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:15.248
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:16.240
Oh, thanks.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.529
The great Patrick
Farley is a treasure

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.100
that our civilization
doesn't make

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.520
enough use of because he
never finishes a damn thing.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.890
This was the first piece of
video that he ever finished.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.230
Some of you might be familiar
with Electric Sheep Comics,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.220
and you should look him
up because he finally

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.110
has finished a
couple more things.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.780
The variety of his
talent is amazing.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.170
Those are all hand painted
images from the novel.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.220
I got him cheap
because civilization

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.700
hasn't been employing
him well enough.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.510
So you could snatch him up.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.320
In any event, it's
nice to be here

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.470
at one of the centers
of human civilization.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.050
Came up here all the way from
the lower left-hand corner,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.510
San Diego.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.620
But we're all sort of
on the lower left corner

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.450
of the continent, which is why
everything loose kind of rolls

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.060
down this way.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.270
And we're proud
of it, aren't we?

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.430
In any event, down
there in San Diego

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.860
we just started the
Arthur C. Clarke Center

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.670
for Human Imagination.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:36.470
An amazing center of
trans-cultural, trans-academic

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.350
study of this fundamentally
human notion that

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.330
is seeded here the prefrontal
lobes just above our eyes.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.500
The seat of what Einstein
called the Gedankenexperiment,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.090
or thought experiment.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.570
Which is that which--
there are three seats here.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.420
There's a more here if
you'd like to come on up.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.900
Don't feel you're
disturbing anything.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.260
These prefrontal lobes are the
seat the thought experiment,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.550
which is what we do
when we think what will

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.920
my boss think if I present this
idea, what will others think

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.350
if I wear this,
what might happen

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.320
if I try to run
this yellow light.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.810
It's where we, largely, give the
answer to this question, nah,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.750
I better not do that.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.460
How many of you guys have had
to say, nah, I better not do

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.072
that within the
last five minutes?

00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:33.530
Then the rest of
you aren't honest.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.060
The notion that
imagination is part

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.410
of this process of creativity
and that it's important for us

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.500
to start understanding what
it is, how to enhance it,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.560
but also how to help train
our children and our neighbors

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.640
to be able to tell the
difference between what

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.320
they imagine and what's real.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.410
Because what is the
fundamental human quandary?

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.680
It's the seat of much of our
glory, much of our greatness,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.980
and also much of our tragedy,
ever since recorded time began.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.870
That is our propensity
for delusion;

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.770
our ability to
deceive ourselves.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.530
As Richard Feynman put it,
the easiest person to fool

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.790
is yourself.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.920
And science is one of
the four great arenas

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.470
that we found in our
recent enlightenment that

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.950
empower us to find our mistakes
before they become lethal.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.080
If you look across the last
6,000 years of history,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.600
it's been one relentless
litany of horrible errors

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.860
of statecraft and
delusions of grandeur,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.810
or delusions of
impotence, delusions

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:03.880
that have left a trail of lost
potential across thousands

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.560
of years, and almost
all continents.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.910
What are the four
arenas, that we have

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.610
that Adam Smith
recommended, that

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.210
take advantage of the
greatest creative force

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.560
in the universe,
which is competition.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.310
It made us in nature.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.340
But can we harness
this force without

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.280
the incredible
inefficiency and pain

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.480
that features
natural competition,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.610
the incredible lost
opportunities, and the violence

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.720
and death.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.870
Where the losers have to lose
big time, in order for winners

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.630
to incrementally
improve and get better.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.550
You may think you have an angle
on what my politics are just

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.890
because I talk about Adam Smith.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.180
You'd be wrong.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.960
The point is that we have
developed four great arenas

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.480
based upon the competitive
provision of the only thing

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.590
that cuts through our human
propensity for delusion,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.120
and that is
reciprocal criticism.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.940
You cannot see all
of your mistakes.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.700
If you're
scientifically trained,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.750
you're among the few people
in the history of our species

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.460
who are at least trained to
find some of your own mistakes,

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.120
to have a habit of
saying the words,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.950
I might be wrong let's find
out; which are the great words

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.490
of human maturity that took us
thousands of years to develop.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.640
But do you honestly believe that
you catch all your mistakes?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.826
Who catches them for you?

00:09:55.826 --> 00:09:56.950
This is why we get married.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.820
I know who catches most of
my mistakes, either before

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.676
or after I make them.

00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:11.770
But who really
catches your mistakes?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.710
Collaborators?

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.500
Good.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.310
That's good.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.390
Your grad students?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.980
That's good.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.490
How about your enemy's?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.280
This is the ultimate irony.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.630
The people who will supply for
you the criticism that you need

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.380
in order to become even better;
the people who supply you

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.840
with the grist you need
in order to improve;

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.540
the ones who can be
relied upon to provide you

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.012
with this absolute necessary
ingredient for your success

00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:44.720
are your enemies.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.810
But criticism is the only
known antidote to error.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.830
And yet we hate it
instinctively, reflexively.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.220
We avoid it whenever possible.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.200
And this reflex explains
most of human history.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.820
If you're at the top of
a pyramidal social order

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.800
and you have the thugs,
and you have the swords,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.770
then the natural
tendency for a human male

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.390
is to repress criticism.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.490
Napoleon!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.000
Napoleon!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.120
Your emperorness, that sounds
like a great plan except I

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.710
hear they have snow in Russia.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.320
It's a gift economy.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.860
Your worst enemies will supply
the criticism that you need.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.420
And here's the point,
they'll doing it for free.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.855
And you'll happily
reciprocate the gift.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.210
There's always a positive
spin on everything,

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.690
and I just put a
positive spin on the

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.500
give and take of the hate fast.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.100
But it doesn't have
to be a hate fest.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.100
Think how you are empowered
if the next time your enemies

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.470
are criticizing
you, you say, "Yes,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.270
tell me more about that one.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.860
Uh huh, very interesting.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.750
The first four points you made
are utter bullshit, idiotic.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:29.330
But five and six,
I think you've just

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.330
helped me to be even
better, and I'll

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.940
be better able to
defeat you now.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.800
Thanks!"

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.920
Can you think of
a better win-win

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.250
than the look on your enemy's
face when you say that?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.110
When you've actually
paid attention

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.180
to the component--
it may be just 5%,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.340
of what that idiot was saying--
that was good, that was valid,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.060
that was useful?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.080
And you had the
strength of character

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.740
to say, "Huh,
idiot, idiot, idiot.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.330
Thanks!"

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.970
Can you see how strong
it makes you look

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.070
and can you see yourself
actually doing it?

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.110
It's kind of iffy.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.800
When I teach writing
I emphasize workshop,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.370
workshop, workshop so that
you can get the criticism,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.332
and get the pain that
leads to success.

00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:32.650
But to find pain attractive.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.250
Well we're a generation
that at least

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.400
is familiar with the
notion of going to the gym.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.000
I've been a little less
familiar with the notion lately.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.660
I still got some guns though.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.100
My son's are 17 and 21 and
the one thing they don't dare

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.310
do is meet me in a-- I'm 63--
meet me in arm wrestling.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:59.480
So they look at me and
they say, "so, catch me!"

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.810
In any event, I am a
member of an industry that

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:12.500
utilizes this spectacular
propensity for delusion

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.890
because it is also
the source of art.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:20.380
It's the source of some
of our greatest things

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.950
and that's why we
developed the Arthur Clark

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.170
Center for Human
Imagination down at UCSD.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.250
Think about what I do.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.541
Does somebody have a book here?

00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:32.440
Let me hold that up.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.670
You probably never
heard of this book,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.120
except I did this great
big sales pitch at you

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.650
and called it art.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.830
What do I do?

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.860
Magic, if you look
across history,

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.450
magic is the use of
incantations, and familiarity,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:57.310
and images, to create belief
in subjective realities

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.450
in other people's heads.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.520
What do I do?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.040
I create incantations of
strings of black squiggles

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.480
on pressed vegetable
matter, or now as lumens

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.380
rising up from a screen.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.230
And you are so well
trained, and so brilliant,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:22.850
that you can scan these
chains of black squiggles

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.160
so fast that you forget there
are black squiggles there.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.050
You decrypt the
incantation into star

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:37.300
spanning explosions; and
deep human insights; kissy,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.870
kissy, kissy, love, love, love.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:45.090
And you do it with your
own creative imagery.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:51.620
None of you see the same thing
when this incantation decrypts.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.800
But with good quality
control-- and at the end

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.170
of every one of my books
there's 50 names of people

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.270
I circulate my manuscripts to.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.640
I'm supposedly a modern
master of science fiction,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.820
and yet I circulate
my manuscripts

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.870
to 50 people in advance in
order to get industrial quality

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.170
control.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.540
Because I'm always
trying something new.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.080
I'm trying something daring.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.110
There's so many
ideas packed in here

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.080
that I wouldn't be
able to juggle it all

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.980
if I didn't get
feedback from people.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.460
I take care of most
of the criticisms

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.960
first, before the industrial
product comes out.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:34.220
But it's industrial grade
magic; creating incantations

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:39.090
that reliably can cause
subjective realities

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.940
in your hands to unfold.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.450
Well when you look
at it that way,

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.500
I am one of the guild
of a few thousand master

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.240
magicians who've ever
been on this planet.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.100
Now that is a strange thing
for Cal Tech boy to claim.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.240
But I was always considered a
bit of a razzle dazzle, song

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.510
and dance man, even there;
Gilbert and Sullivan.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:16.810
The point is, that we
deal in the world in which

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:22.680
the subjective and the
objective are always in flux.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.000
All the great minds of the
past-- well not all of them,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.750
but a great many who come
down to from the past, Buddah,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.600
Jesus, Socrates, Laozi,
you look at all of them

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.200
and they all said,
Plato especially--

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.620
they all said the same
thing as a premise.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.460
The premise is objective reality
is really hard to grapple with,

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.650
and even harder to improve.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.380
In Plato's "Allegory
of the cave;" give up,

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.030
you can't see what's
actually real.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.925
You don't know what this is,
you just have an impression.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.160
And therefore, they all said
give up on the temporal world

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.180
and seek a more
transcendent truth.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:17.210
And then they split up
via abstraction, or logic,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.430
or prayer, or the
abnegation of the self.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.500
The specifics vary,
but the prelude--

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:33.810
this is a filthy world that
you cannot get leverage on.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.640
Galileo answered,
"you are right.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.770
My vision is feeble,
my touch is unreliable,

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.810
my descriptions are even worse.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.170
I cannot know
precisely what this is.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:52.160
But with the help
of tools of science,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.550
and the tools of the
mind, and above all

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.640
the reciprocal
feedback that I get

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.340
in inter-playing with
colleagues and competitors,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:12.950
we can gradually carve away all
of the things that this is not,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.890
and that is enough to
incrementally, and gradually

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.070
make things better."

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.840
Now has that driven off all
the transcendentalists who say,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.720
"we don't like to
hand we've been dealt.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.420
We need something else something
elsewhere, something better."

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
Of course not.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.680
This is ingrained in all of us.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.220
And I'm not just talking
about the religious people

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.230
in our culture.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.930
And by the way, I'm not,
strictly speaking, an atheist.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.380
But we all know some of the guys
who are the new kind of people

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:57.390
who are saying, here's a
new way to a better reality.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.770
We're talking about
the post humanists;

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.570
the singularitarians.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.450
Raise your hand if you don't
know what the singularity is.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.581
Raise your hand if you do.

00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:11.080
Liars.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.720
You don't have a
clue, and neither

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.930
do I. All I know is
that I'm a contrarian.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.780
I'm ornery.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.750
Whenever I am around
people who do not

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.440
believe that we can
transcend and get better,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.980
I sound a lot like
a singularitaran.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.890
But whenever I'm around
the singularitarians,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.560
I'm the grouchy guy.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.570
I'm the one who points
out to Ray Kurzweil

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.670
that there may be
intracellular computation.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.260
And if there's computation
taking place inside the neurons

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.220
and even within the glial
cells that support the neurons,

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.300
and between the glial
cells and the neurons--

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.620
there is preliminary
evidence for all of this--

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.860
then the number of Moore's
law doublings between us

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.570
and the 60 trillion
synapses in the human brain

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.800
is a lot more, if
for every synapse

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.870
there are hundreds or
1,000 calculations that

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.470
take place inside the cell.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.540
The good news is that makes
us even more spectacular.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:35.430
Now we're talking quadrillons,
quadrillions of floating point

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:41.282
operations inside this little
three-pound piece of muck.

00:21:41.282 --> 00:21:43.115
Yes I said that-- don't--
it was a metaphor.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.940
But the bad news being,
poor Ray Kurzweil,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.400
the number of
Moore's law doublings

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.030
that it would take to
simply emulate quadrillions

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.220
it may take us to
the 2080s, 2090s

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.170
if that's your faith in AI.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.820
It turns out there are 6 or 7
different general categories

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.230
of approaches to AI.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.330
In my novel "Existence"
I talk about one

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.620
that I think is a very,
very little understood,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.590
but I think you here at
Google come closest to it.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.440
We all know some of them,
the approach taken by IBM,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.930
the approach of modeling
human brain and software,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.030
the approach that gets most
of the science fiction movies,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.390
is emergent properties.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.620
It emerges out of an
increasingly complicated set

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.940
of hardware called Skynet.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.690
[IMITATING TERMINATOR]
I'll be back.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.380
Or the Matrix, or
that sort of thing.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.730
Personally I am very
afraid of that kind.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.300
It's the kind that
sneaks up on you.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.800
And we should be
afraid of it, but I

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.480
don't think it'll come
from the military.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.610
Who can tell me
where more money is

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.660
being poured into AI than
the top 10 universities

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.920
and Google combined?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.530
It's being done in secret, and
the AI that they are forming

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.120
is absolutely based upon
fundamental precepts

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.990
of predatory behavior,
parasitism, secrecy,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.492
and voracious insatiability.

00:23:31.492 --> 00:23:33.200
AUDIENCE: Advertisements
and Wall Street.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.402
AUDIENCE: Hedge funds.

00:23:34.402 --> 00:23:36.110
DAVID BRIN: Wall Street
we're dialing in.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.840
Most of it's being
done by Goldman Sachs

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.690
and its partners-- what specific
kind of program at Wall Street?

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:44.940
AUDIENCE: High speed training?

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.250
DAVID BRIN: What?

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.499
AUDIENCE: High speed training.

00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:50.600
DAVID BRIN: High speed trading,
high frequency trading.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.670
Vast majority of the trades
taking place in our equities

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:59.120
markets are quick, predatory,
I sense this trend,

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.080
I sense this trend, and
they're spending more

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.030
on the development of
artificial intelligence

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.050
than anywhere else without
any public supervision,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.890
any supervision whatsoever,
entirely in secret.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.095
Does that like a plot of
a Michael Creighton story?

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.080
And by the way, all
Michael Creighton stories

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.185
are based upon one premise,
and that is secrecy.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.650
This is of course what my book
"The Transparent Society" is

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:36.970
about, which is the notion
that the new era that we're

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:47.300
going into is fraught with
the potential for disaster

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.470
and the only way
we will cross it,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.070
is if we can see
where we're going.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.200
But there are so
many temptations.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.290
By the way Michael Creighton
is a character in this book.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.979
Not quite the same name,
he died toward the end

00:25:03.979 --> 00:25:05.520
of my finishing
writing it; I was not

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.130
going to change the character.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.030
But there's a character who's
based upon him in the book,

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.240
and he-- would it give
away too much if I told you

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.840
he's the guy who gets the girl?

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840
I don't know.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.850
How can we get across
this critical juncture?

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.930
Within 10 years, blatantly
and obviously, we

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.280
will lie detectors;
functional lie detectors.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.070
There will be fMRI based
methods for tracking

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:47.180
certain kinds of thoughts
and at least attempts

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.030
to engage in deception.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.380
In my novel, "Sun
Diver" in 1980,

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.750
I had using eye tracking
as a lie detector

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:04.040
and as a method for detecting
deception and other personality

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.220
traits.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.100
It seems more and more
likely to come true.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.010
Under those circumstances,
if we tumble

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:18.205
into any form of Big
Brother, it will be forever.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.110
But under those circumstances,
if we can avoid Big Brother

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.490
and apply those tools to
all of our politicians,

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.410
and our oligarchs,
and our aristocrats,

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.770
we will never get Big Brother.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:41.230
And this critical crossing
of the next decade or two

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.080
is what I try to
write about in "Earth"

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.110
and in my near term,
grownup, science fiction

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:52.070
like "Existence."

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.420
You always have to watch
out for temporal chauvinism.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.910
Temporal chauvinism is
saying, "This right now.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:26:59.420
This time.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:26:59.930
This is it.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.900
This is the most
important time."

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.980
And if you had asked
me, my 30-year-old self,

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.810
I would have said 1980.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:13.320
But the fact is that the
trends are like this.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.320
These four great
accountability arenas that

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.280
enable us to apply
reciprocal criticism

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.390
to each other, and competition,
and thus find decent products.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.640
What are they?

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.270
Well I used the word products,
so therefore the first one

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.740
that comes to mind is markets.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.990
And Adam Smith
recommended that we

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:40.300
keep a flat, open,
equal opportunity market

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.700
system, so that competition
results in good goods

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.840
and services.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.690
Those of you on the
left of the spectrum,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.440
you have been doing yourself
and Adam Smith a great disfavor

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.670
by not really reading him
and realizing how heavily he

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.920
emphasized the
flat and open part.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.510
And how in 1776, he demanded
free public education

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.590
for all children.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.140
Those of you on
the right, you have

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.020
done him and
yourself a disservice

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.080
by assuming that
he said, "oh, it

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.275
doesn't matter how
much money anybody has.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.220
Let anybody become a Lord
and then meddle in markets."

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.640
Well he never said such a thing.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.460
He and the American founders
rebelled against that.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:33.280
And we're facing this issue,
this problem of the recurring

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.780
zero-sum game of success
that destroyed past markets

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.200
in the past-- past
Renaissances of freedom.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.930
In 99% of human cultures, those
who won for whatever reason,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.810
whether they won by delivering
goods and services or using

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:55.330
swords, what would they do?

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.930
They would immediately kill
their immediate competitors

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.700
and make sure
everyone else was too

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.360
afraid to try to
compete with them.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.190
Because they wanted their sons
to own other people's sons.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.890
And that's your pyramidal
social structure

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:16.090
that dominated 99% of
human civilizations.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.810
What is the shape of
our social structure,

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.700
and I'm not saying perfectly.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.260
What is the shape of our
ideal social structure?

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.320
A diamond.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.850
A flattened diamond, with
is empowered, confident

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.570
middle class.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.820
And some people get
rich, ideally fairly.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.780
But they cannot send out thugs
to prevent competition the next

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.280
time.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.180
And that's the notion Adam
Smith was talking about,

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.690
that constant churn.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:57.190
That in this diamond, even if
you were born at the bottom

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:02.620
you don't necessarily inherit
the position of your parents.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.440
And if anything
is systematically

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.700
causing you to inherit the
position of your parent,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.440
then something's wrong with the
system and it needs tweaking.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.340
And the well-off
outnumber the poor.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.470
Is this ideal?

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.100
Do we live up to it ideally?

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.530
Of course not.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.330
But the ideal is in
our hearts and when

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.940
we consider there to
be unfairness going on,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.310
this is what we aim for.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.500
I had a paper, an essay, that
was syndicated by Bloomberg

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.210
about four weeks
ago, that pointed out

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.470
a little bit of
mystic numerology.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.480
The last three
centuries all appear

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.890
to have started
on their 14 year.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.500
It's very interesting.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.620
1714, the War of
Spanish Succession

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.770
ended and started what was
called the French century,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:11.030
which ended in 1814
with the fall Napoleon.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:15.110
Which led to the great
century of colonization

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:23.130
and industrial growth and
the vigorous optimism that

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.820
crossed the 19th century,
from 1814 until--

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.245
AUDIENCE: 1914.

00:31:29.245 --> 00:31:30.690
DAVID BRIN: 1914.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.570
What happened in 1914?

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:38.010
The curse of Queen
Victoria; three

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:43.320
microsyphallic lunatic
grandsons of hers

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.260
ended what was pretty much
the greatest peak of hope

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.870
the world has ever seen.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.400
In the preceding
decade people had

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.960
been getting into their
increasingly middle class

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:05.370
homes; automobiles,
refrigerators, radios,

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:12.800
telephones, electric lights,
gas ranges, plumbing.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.600
And then they would
all leave their home

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.695
as quickly as possible
when they heard one sound.

00:32:16.695 --> 00:32:19.852
What was the sound?

00:32:19.852 --> 00:32:21.240
A flying man.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.400
Knowing, while staring
up there, within 10 years

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.210
we're going to be doing that.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.925
Everything was looking
like it was on its way;

00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:36.800
filled with optimism.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:45.210
Then we entered what I call the
concave century, because wanga!

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.410
Even though progress
continued-- progress continued!

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.740
But boy was our mood foul.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:59.440
And deservedly so, down to
the pit, the nadir of 1943.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.550
And since then climbing out,
climbing out, climbing out,

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.680
climbing out.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.980
And you see this curve?

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.240
What does it remind you of?

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.650
Starts with a S, everybody sing.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.721
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:13.721 --> 00:33:15.720
DAVID BRIN: Kind of looks
like that, doesn't it.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720
But what about our mood?

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.612
Foul, foul mood.

00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:25.820
Maybe not you guys in this
room, you work for Google.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.900
But just the horrible
mood people are in.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.370
Maybe it's just wishful
thinking on my part.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:39.070
It's 2014, it's time
for a change of mood.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.730
Do you know what it's time for?

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.340
What it's time for?

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.041
Its time for [SINGING] The
dawning of the age of-- Oh,

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:46.915
you're all too young.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.950
Somebody ask some
of the old farts

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:56.460
here what I was trying to say.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.740
No.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.166
All right, some old farts
have gotten good rejuvenation.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.140
Whatever you're
taking, I'll take some.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.940
We don't know what it's
going to be this year

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.060
and probably it's
just numerology.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.540
But it would be kind of cool
if we snapped out of it.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.095
Maybe somebody will slip the
right drug to Rupert Murdoch.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.040
That could do it.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:39.800
The other arenas-- markets,
democracy, science,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.080
and justice courts.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.050
It's masked from us how similar
they are in basic process,

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.010
because they have very
different products and therefore

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:55.010
very different
superficial rhythms.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:00.230
Markets, we can afford
a huge error rate.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.310
Personally, I'll take
Beta-Max even now.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.630
Huge error rate,
but huge fecundity;

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.760
huge productivity of new ideas.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.980
Democracy can afford less of
an error rate than markets,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.120
but it still has
a very large one.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.910
It's filthy, and noisy.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.460
Science, has a fairly low error
rate, but science is special.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.000
Science has a god.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.960
Science has a god, it's
called objective reality.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.830
You can go to the
scientific conference

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.980
and everyone can
say, you're wrong.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.760
And you just say,
wait, objective reality

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.790
will prove me right.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:56.340
What an irony that science
has this solace of faith

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.706
that if know you're right,
someday you'll be proved right,

00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:01.670
so you can be relaxed.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:05.010
Justice courts can afford
almost no error rate,

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.180
and still they have it.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.160
But that's why they're prim,
meticulous, totally uncreative.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.880
But they all have
the same rhythm.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.060
There is a centrifugal
period when

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.080
you can organize and
coordinate your forces

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.880
and your product in safety, in
your company, attorney client

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.880
privilege, your tenured
lab, your political party.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.430
But then there is an
irresistible unrefusable call

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.370
to ritual combat in the
marketplace, in the courtroom,

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.520
at the scientific
conference, in the election.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.610
And this rhythm
keep things going.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.930
But what is the fundamental
ingredient they all need?

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.360
Light.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.040
They all work best when
most of the people involved

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.810
know most of what's going
on most of the time.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:12.580
And to whatever degree shadows
exist in these four arenas,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.080
to that degree, they fail.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.730
Now I fly east to
Washington, DC every spring.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:25.480
It seems there are people back
east in these agencies who

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.400
are smart enough to know they
need to consult science fiction

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.490
authors.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.410
So I fly east to DC,
so does Werner Vingy,

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:39.520
so do the other hard
science fiction guys.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.810
And they say, "show us
some scenarios about how

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.580
enemies could
really screw us up.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.980
Scare us."

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.710
And they always go, "yeah,
like you can scare me."

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:55.900
And they always leave
the meeting going, "agh."

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.330
One fellow at one of
these meetings, he said,

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.086
"I know how to destroy
the United States.

00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:02.460
Come up with a drug that turns
all of our science fiction

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.429
authors into enemies
of the United States."

00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:07.470
One of the nicest compliments
I've ever received.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.110
Actually if you want to
compliment an author,

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:15.700
the best thing you can say
to the author is, "damn you,

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.260
damn you.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.170
I almost lost my
job because of you."

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.310
Because the fundamental thing,
what are we trying to do?

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.150
It's a sadomasochistic
relationship.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.720
We want to make it
almost impossible

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.550
for you to feed the cat, do
your report, do your homework,

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.210
or feed your children.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:45.750
If we have made this
trouble for you,

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.270
and made you almost
miss a deadline,

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.960
or almost miss your
job, or whatever,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.610
here's the thing--
you'll buy our next book.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.050
We've settled what you
are in this relationship.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.500
So I should rip out this
outer and underneath

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.500
I have leather on.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.600
I don't think that's an image
you really want your head.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.270
No, no, no, no, no, in fact I've
never thought of that before.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.210
I would have to get
it here at Google.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:25.220
I've just come here from a
four-day meeting at Stanford,

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.950
of the NASA Innovative
and Advanced Concepts

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.720
Group, where I'm on
the board of advisors.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.300
Some of the wonderful,
wonderful concepts

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:46.280
that we saw at this event
show that ingenuity is not

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.570
forsaken, especially not the
United States of America.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.460
It's in trouble.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.240
It's always in trouble.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.690
The war on "science," quote
unquote, isn't helping at all.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.680
The inability of
our political cast

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.610
to work out their
differences and restore

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.070
a process of negotiated
consensus, which

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:16.680
has been killed primarily by
a set of foreign oligarchs.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.460
This is a bad thing.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.860
And yet there was
amazing news last year

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.960
that the press didn't
know what to do with.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.270
I'm going to tell you two
amazing pieces of news

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.330
from 2013.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:41.490
One, the courts
ruled decisively,

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.840
and the Obama administration
Justice Department

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.180
declared decisively,
that is settled law

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.075
that any citizen may record
their interactions with police.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.880
It is probably the most
important civil rights decision

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.740
that's been made in 30 years.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.620
It is of spectacular importance
because at the street

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:14.565
is where we get used to our
notions of what is allowed.

00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:17.550
And there is nothing
more important

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.400
to an average helpless
citizen in their interactions

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.430
with authority than
access to the truth.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.370
The immediate result
was an awful lot

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.830
of cell phones and cameras
being broken my mistake,

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.800
and by accident.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.140
But how quickly things happen.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.770
I predicted all of this in
"The Transparent Society."

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.985
How quickly the next card falls.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.510
Before 2013 was out, we
had the image of a big man

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.250
in an orange prison
jumpsuit and shackles

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.200
being sentenced to
three years in prison

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.360
for breaking the camera of
someone he was arresting

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.680
and lying about it, because
someone else across the street

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.340
caught him doing it.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.030
And you have to
bear this in mind.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:21.680
You have to say, what
happens if this continues.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.160
It's called Brin's
corollary to Moore's Law,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.230
and people are
crediting Sergey for it.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:40.509
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:40.509 --> 00:42:44.730
DAVID BRIN: My son has
the same name as his son.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.040
My son had it first!

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.890
Hear that Sergey?

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.670
But the point is that
my son will never

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.656
have trouble making
dinner reservations.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.400
OK.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.820
OK.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.930
All right, it works out.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.320
The corollary is
this, the cameras

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.090
get smaller, cheaper,
faster, more numerous,

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.900
and better every year at a
rate faster than Moore's law.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.240
I portray this in my novel.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.080
How are you going
to banish them?

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.320
How are you going to
do the thing that's

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.540
the initial reflex
of almost all people

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.100
when faced with
internet age problems?

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.970
When you're looking
at next year,

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.640
you're not looking
at 10 years from now.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.410
When the cameras are
so cheap children

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:53.720
will peel them off a roll of
stickers with battery good

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.200
for a year, or even a
little solar charger

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:01.450
to stick them on a lamp post
and they have their own address

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.300
on IPv6 and they
are there forever.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:15.240
As Clint Eastwood said at the
end of the wisest film ever,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.660
or at least wisest
moment in a film ever,

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:23.640
"Magnum Force," he
squints and he says,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:30.150
"A man's got to know
his limitations."

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.550
Recognize your limitations
and this reflex

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.500
to say to authority,
stop looking at me!

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.420
Do you honestly think that
you can find any point

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.970
in the history of our species
when the elites allowed

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:49.220
themselves to be blinded?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.130
Here is an assignment for you.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:58.780
Go to the zoo with
a pointed stick,

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.670
Climb into the baboon
enclosure, and poke out

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.090
the eyes of the biggest baboon.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.020
Tell them I sent you.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:14.540
Here is a clue--
he won't let you.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.720
And after you're done treating
all your scratches and cuts,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.530
then realize this he will
grudgingly and reluctantly

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.670
let you look at him.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.750
What is it that we have
to fear from authority?

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:36.580
That authorities of commerce,
or criminality, or the state,

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.550
see or know something about us?

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.850
Good luck stopping that.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.060
What's important is
restricting permanently,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.330
and forever, and
ferociously, and militantly

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:54.540
what they can do to us.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.630
And in order to do that, we
have to emphasize not hiding

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:04.920
from authority, but stripping
authority naked and telling

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:12.590
them you are my watch
dog, you are not a wolf.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:16.980
And in order to do that,
you don't blind the dog.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.110
You need him.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.640
He's sniffing
around for dangers.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:28.690
But you need him to remember
that the citizens are

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.940
in charge.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.180
And to do that
takes supervision.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.510
And that's what we
should be militant about;

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.900
and that's what that
news was about this year.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.250
The other piece of news
that came out in 2013,

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.060
I'll bet that none of
you even heard of it.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.610
Can anyone tell me
which country on Earth

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.765
scored highest in
adult science literacy?

00:46:57.422 --> 00:46:58.130
AUDIENCE: Israel?

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.404
DAVID BRIN: Israel was
up there in the top 10.

00:47:00.404 --> 00:47:01.695
AUDIENCE: Singapore?

00:47:01.695 --> 00:47:03.320
DAVID BRIN: Singapore
was nowhere near.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:11.760
None of you are even
capable of imagining it.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.960
You can't even wrap your
minds around the possibility

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.800
that it was the United
States of America.

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:28.900
Not only number one, but double
the adult science literacy

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.990
of number two, which was Canada.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.900
Now how can that be?

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.450
Our children are all idiots.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.324
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:37.324 --> 00:47:40.062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] from
all those other countries.

00:47:40.062 --> 00:47:41.520
DAVID BRIN: I'll
explain it to you;

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.090
and no pundit explained
it therefore it

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.820
was just erased off the
radar, it just vanished.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.670
It's actually fairly simple.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.120
The word adult, remember
these prefrontal lobes,

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.010
they really only start
kicking in around age 20.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.190
By age 25 most
people have got them,

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.770
but I've just
explained teenagers.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.100
Trying to grasp the consequences
of their actions and all that,

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.370
it's all abstract to them.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:22.220
Most scoring systems for the
success of schooling measure

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.090
memorized knowledge,
and memorized skills,

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:29.330
and procedures, and these
have to be beaten into kid.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:34.290
And we don't beat our
kids so we score badly.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.749
But meanwhile they're
learning verbal agility.

00:48:37.749 --> 00:48:39.540
What are the kids do
mostly in high school?

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.470
Argue!

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:42.490
Argue with the teacher,
argue with each other.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.580
It's class discussion,
class discussion,

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.210
who cares what you memorize.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:50.490
So when they go to college
and they take the same course

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.900
again, they say, this
is kind of familiar.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.070
And a new part of
their brain is saying,

00:48:56.070 --> 00:49:00.440
maybe I'll pay
attention this time.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.850
What is the difference between
the American baccalaureate

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:07.610
degree and the degrees in
most parts of the world?

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.430
Most of the world it's a
three year bachelor's degree

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:17.460
in which the student
specializes at age 17.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.860
Most Americans don't
even know this.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.890
When I asked overseas
when I lived overseas--

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.760
and most Americans
haven't lived overseas--

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:30.300
but when I lived in Paris and
I lived in London and I asked,

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.320
why is our bachelor's degree
four years and yours is three?

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.470
And the answer was
almost universally,

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.370
because your students
are so stupid.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.840
When in fact the reason is
because we have a whole year's

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.670
worth of breadth requirements.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.650
If you're a science
major, if you're a nerd,

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.720
you have to take a fair
amount of history, English,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.680
and all those things.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.420
And what is the result?

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.715
Our nerds have experience
with these subjects

00:49:57.715 --> 00:49:59.954
and they say, gosh, that
was my easiest course.

00:49:59.954 --> 00:50:00.745
I could get an MBA.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:08.360
And you are sitting in the
valley that that attitude made.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.820
But more than that,
humanities, arts majors,

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.090
you have to take three
or four science survey

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:21.130
classes in college, after
your prefrontal lobes

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.870
have kicked in.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:30.550
And that is enough to explain
the wispy, wimpy, ridiculously,

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:35.660
horrific 23% adult
science literacy

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.390
that Americans
scored so much better

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.030
than the rest of the world.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.815
It's horrible.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.810
And it's better than
the rest of the world

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:48.380
simply because our bachelor's
degree is what we instinctively

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.550
know bachelor's
degree ought to be;

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:54.930
that is a time for you to
explore and become, excuse me,

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.350
a gentleman who can
then learn anything.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.770
And that's what
you're supposed to be.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.490
Now does it sound
like I'm painting

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.690
this rosy picture of everything?

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:11.280
We're going to take authority!

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.260
We're going to
look back at power!

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.763
Our kids are wonderful!

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.512
Human beings suck.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.840
I'm accused of being
this incredible optimist,

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:33.130
when in fact I know what
is likely to happen.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.410
This diamond shaped
social structure

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.700
is almost certain
to collapse, as it

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.540
did of the few
other times that it

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.220
was tried, back into the
old pyramid of power.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.650
And when that happens,
the oligarchs will do--

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.400
and I don't care whether
they're oligarchs

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:53.600
of the left or the right,
whether their commies

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.330
or bazillionaires-- they
will do what they did

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:01.390
after the Athenian
democracy of Pericles.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.310
They will make it their
number one priority

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.020
to make sure it
never happens again.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.360
Only this time they'll be
equipped with the technologies

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.650
that you're providing them.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:15.336
You!

00:52:15.336 --> 00:52:17.630
You!

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.330
Shills of the oligarchy.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:25.900
Or you liberators
of all humanity.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.350
And more than just
humanity is at stake here.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.100
I was going to show you
a whole big slide show.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.970
I was going to show you
all sorts of things,

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.890
and I just shook
hands with Frank Drake

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:40.700
just an hour ago
because he was also

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.220
an adviser at this SETI panel.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:45.180
Who can tell me the most
famous thing about Frank Drake?

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.550
AUDIENCE: The Drake Equation.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.841
DAVID BRIN: The Drake Equation.

00:52:47.841 --> 00:52:48.490
What is it?

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.490
AUDIENCE: Predicts
intelligence in the universe.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:54.950
DAVID BRIN: It's a method
by which we calculate

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.720
a general notion of how
many other intelligent life

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.580
forms there should
be in the galaxy.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.840
You've all seen it, right?

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.270
It takes a number of
stars in the galaxy,

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.910
multiplies it by a
fraction, percentage.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:13.060
Which fraction of them
are stable and solitary;

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:16.860
which fraction of those
planets; the number of planets

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.220
that orbit in their
Goldilocks zones.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:25.182
15 years ago we knew
almost nothing about that.

00:53:25.182 --> 00:53:27.140
We knew of no planets
outside the solar system.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.600
Now we know of well
over a thousand.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.100
2,000 more are candidates.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.560
And just down the road
they're building the successor

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:40.210
to Kepler, which should
find us 10,000 more.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:43.240
So that part of the equation
is starting to fill in,

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.710
but the fraction of
those that develop life

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:52.480
is looking more plausible all
the time, but we don't know.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.280
The fraction of
life bearing planets

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.200
that develop
intelligence, don't know.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.530
I've spent the last 30 years
cataloging explanations

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:05.460
for what's called the
Fermi paradox, and that

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:11.250
is that this equation seems
like it ought to result

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:15.770
in a galaxy filled with noise,
and sound, and commerce,

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.110
and communication.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.610
And the SETI Institute,
just down the road here,

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:21.920
they are very confused.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.940
There doesn't seem to
be anybody out there.

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:30.283
It's quiet out there,
maybe too quiet.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:34.887
And this is a
point that I raise,

00:54:34.887 --> 00:54:36.470
because I've been
in this for 30 years

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.100
and I'm one of the
dissenters out there

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.310
who are very critical of the
recent trend for impatient

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:45.630
radio telescopers
to say, OK, we're

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:46.990
not hearing anything transmit.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:55.540
Maybe we should
wait a little bit.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.590
But among these
things is the notion

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:03.310
of is intelligence of
our kind difficult.

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:06.150
And there's recent
reason to believe this.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:11.155
How many of you've heard of the
recent news about prairie dogs?

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:23.050
That parrots, and crows,
corvids, have vocabularies

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.310
and can use tools.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:29.640
Sea lions, otters.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.930
That so many species are
just behind the chimps

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.740
and the dolphins in
the number of words

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.170
in their discursive
vocabulary, or their ability

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.090
to parse out problems.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.870
Prairie dogs, it
now appears, they

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.520
have analyzed the
barks of prairie dogs

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:53.760
and it contains human
passing through the town,

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.665
female wearing a red sweater.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:04.090
Sweater isn't in there,
but the word red is.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.150
Now what does this mean?

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:06.700
First, it's spectacular!

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.320
Our natural tendency to enjoy
the notion of the spreading

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:14.610
around of categories, and
appreciating otherness

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.540
is improved.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:16.135
That's great!

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:24.240
But they all crowd
against a glass ceiling

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.720
that appears to be all
that Darwin and Mother

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.290
Nature will allow.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:30.860
And there's every
reason to believe

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.090
that maybe the
velociraptors bumped

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:37.270
against that same ceiling
that's easy to reach.

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:38.900
And why?

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.150
One of the biggest
of all questions, why

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:47.780
did we pound through so
vastly beyond anything

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.860
that we might have expected.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.500
Not only just beyond to
become masters of this planet;

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.370
because all we needed for that
was 100 word vocabulary, stone

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.420
tools, and fire.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.010
"Ogric wave.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.140
Fire.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.820
Chase goat this way.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.200
Me stab."

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.300
And we went so far beyond that.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.460
And then we developed
glass lenses,

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.950
and we could see more;
and printing presses,

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.965
and we could know more.

00:57:16.965 --> 00:57:18.840
Vastly more than anybody
would have imagined.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:25.400
Match And then schools,
and then you guys,

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:31.470
each generation getting a
new fire hose to drink from.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:35.160
These are the questions
that a lively civilization

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.440
needs to be asking.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.730
And with that, I think I'll
give you all opportunities

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:43.590
to buy some books.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.240
And I'll be happy to sign them.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.920
Do I have time
for any questions?

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.510
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe 1 or 2.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.940
DAVID BRIN: One or
two, I went over.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.230
Here I thought I
was being so good.

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:55.880
Thank you so very much.

00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:02.922
[APPLAUSE]
