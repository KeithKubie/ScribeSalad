00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.620
SPEAKER: Hey everybody.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.340
Thank you so much for coming
to Google Detroit today.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.347
We are super excited to have Mt.

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:17.080
Joy, a folk rock based
band from Los Angeles.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.420
They just started
their fall tour

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.550
and just actually
earlier this year

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.780
released their first studio
album called "Silver Linings."

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.700
We are thrilled
to have them here.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.340
They have just kicked
off their fall tour

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.700
which goes from now
through about Thanksgiving.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.350
Just four shows in, I think.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.650
They spent the weekend in
Wisconsin and St. Louis.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.670
After tonight when
they play The Shelter,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.500
they're going to be headed out
to New York, I think, next.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.370
But you guys are absolutely in
for such a huge treat today.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.050
These guys are amazing.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.760
And we are happy to welcome
Michael, Sam, Matt, Sotiris,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.410
and Jackie to the stage.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.170
They're going to play a
couple of songs for us.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.630
So let's give them a big
Google Detroit welcome.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.614
Woohoo.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:06.550

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.096
MATT QUINN: Hello everybody.

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:12.720
How's it going?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050
You guys have
delicious food here.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.560
If all else fails,
you've still got that.

00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:27.850
All right.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.933
This one's called "Sheep."

00:01:40.197 --> 00:01:43.191
[MUSIC - MT. JOY, "SHEEP"]

00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:36.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.840
MATT QUINN: Thank you.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.340
Thank you.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.094
Thank you.

00:05:40.094 --> 00:05:40.594
OK.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.010
Sorry.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.259
I can't get off my mind
Jackie's from Portland, Oregon

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.418
and she said this is
her favorite weather.

00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:51.852
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:57.990
Yeah.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.448
I guess we can
introduce ourselves.

00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:00.801
That's Jackie on the keys.

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.160
JACKIE MICLAU: Hi.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.390
MATT QUINN: Sotiris on the drum.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.210
Usually there's more than one.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.957
Michael on the bass
and Sam on the guitar.

00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:14.865
SAM COOPER: This is Matt here.

00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:16.296
That's him.

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:18.210
MATT QUINN: Hey.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.965
And I dropped off
an application,

00:06:19.965 --> 00:06:23.960
so if you want to look
that over let me know.

00:06:27.564 --> 00:06:28.980
This one's called
"Silver Lining."

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.170
Thanks so much again for
having us and listening.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.401
And we appreciate it.

00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:32.900
We're Mt.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.094
Joy.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.963
I think this is going to work.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.193
[MUSIC - MT.

00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:40.414

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:16.560
MATT QUINN: Thank you.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.742
Thank you.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.700
SPEAKER: OK, everybody.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.800
Thank you so much.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.240
And how about one more huge
round of applause for Mt.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:22.740
Joy.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.615

00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:26.595
MATT QUINN: All right.

00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:28.822
SPEAKER: Just want to
do one more quick round

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:29.530
of introductions.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.261
So from my side
over, this is Sam.

00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:32.760
Hey, guys.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.140
This is Michael.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.460
This is Matt.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.150
This is Sotiris
and that's Jackie.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.900
JACKIE MICLAU: Hi.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.460
SPEAKER: So all right, you guys.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.260
I think the first
thing I'd love to do

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.930
is just learn a little
bit more about the band,

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.346
because from what I read,
you guys are relatively new.

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:51.970
You've been together
a couple of years.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.360
But I cannot believe the amount
of touring you did in 2017 from

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.120
Electric Forest to
Bonnaroo, all over.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.970
And you just released
your first studio album.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.039
So first question.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:06.997
Where does the name Mt.

00:11:06.997 --> 00:11:09.720
Joy come from?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.160
SAM COOPER: So Matt and I--

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.780
Matt's in the middle here--

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.082
we met in high school
outside of Philadelphia.

00:11:16.082 --> 00:11:16.582
And Mt.

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:20.310
Joy is just a little
mountain between our houses

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.515
where we first
started making music.

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:24.390
SPEAKER: Is it true--

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.080
I think, speaking of, did I hear
that you used to record songs

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.450
in your brother's room, Sam?

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:29.665
Is that right?

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:30.373
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:11:30.373 --> 00:11:33.420
My brother had like a
little crappy console thing.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.770
This was in like--

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.602
you were in ninth grade maybe.

00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:37.310
MATT QUINN: Yeah.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.980
SAM COOPER: I'm two years older.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.430
But yeah.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.750
I think we were in high school.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.480
And we would make some
dumb songs and things

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.990
in my brother's room.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.490
But--

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.781
MATT QUINN: They were not dumb.

00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:47.040
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.954
SPEAKER: Did any of them
make it onto the new album?

00:11:49.954 --> 00:11:51.120
SAM COOPER: Did any of the--

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.586
SPEAKER: Any of
those crappy songs?

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:53.211
SAM COOPER: No.

00:11:53.211 --> 00:11:56.600
Weren't they-- I forget
what they were about.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.400
MATT QUINN: The original
was about we caught--

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.640
I don't if they have these here,
but those stink bug things.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.890
When I was in that age,
for whatever reason,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.590
they attacked America.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.990
It's one of the most vicious
attacks on our homeland.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.180
And they were truly everywhere.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.530
And so we started--
me and my friend

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.929
captured them and
would keep them to see

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:20.970
how long they would live.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.925
I have no idea why.

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:22.800
This on the internet.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.430
Oh my God.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.120
So yeah.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.790
Then we wrote a song about
one because it lived forever.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.790
SPEAKER: Stink bug, huh?

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.980
MATT QUINN: Yeah.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.720
SPEAKER: So that's
how you guys met.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.160
And then if I'm not
mistaken, then you randomly

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.127
ran into each other in Los
Angeles not that long ago.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:42.960
SAM COOPER: Kind of.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.327
So Matt and I had some
songs we wanted to record.

00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:47.910
And for whatever reason, we were
just like, we need a bassist.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.611
So we went on Craigslist
and we found Michael.

00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:52.860
SPEAKER: That's what was
going to be my next question.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.510
Craigslist.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.600
MICHAEL BYRNES: Yeah.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.340
In the man seeking group of men.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.570
Yeah.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.190
SPEAKER: That's
where you posted?

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.990
SAM COOPER: That's
where we found him.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.030
SPEAKER: And you auditioned
Michael obviously.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.387
And was he your first
choice or how did that go?

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:07.095
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:07.595
No.

00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:09.130
It was-- we literally--

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.838
we were talking about
this the other day.

00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:14.377
We went to like a little room
in Studio City or something--

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:15.710
MICHAEL BYRNES: North Hollywood.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.100
SAM COOPER: North Hollywood.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.615
And we just started
playing these songs.

00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:21.990
And then Michael was like,
oh, my roommate can record us.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.982
And then Michael's
roommate Caleb from--

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:26.190
MICHAEL BYRNES: From Detroit.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.481
SAM COOPER: From Detroit.

00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.320
SPEAKER: Woo.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.300
SAM COOPER: He recorded
the first few songs.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.670
SPEAKER: So Sotiris,
how did they find you?

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.000
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: I
was friends with Michael.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.700
We were doing a gig together.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.190
And then I think a few
months after we met,

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.360
maybe like a year--

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.430
less than a year after
we met, he hit me up.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.450
And here I am now, nervously
answering a question.

00:13:54.102 --> 00:13:55.060
SPEAKER: You did great.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.310
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Thank you.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.080
SPEAKER: Last but not
least, Jackie, I'm

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.430
pretty fascinated with you.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.060
I first of all watched some
of your Instagram stories.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.760
And I've seen you playing
piano and keyboard

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.850
at random places like in
the airports and whatnot.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.202
So tell us first.

00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:12.660
We heard that you're
from Portland,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.317
but tell us how you
joined the band.

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:15.150
JACKIE MICLAU: Yeah.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.330
So I moved to LA two years ago.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.400
And I actually met everyone
through Michael's friend.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.280
So yeah.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.910
That's how that happened.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.130
SPEAKER: And I know you're
only a couple performances

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.160
into the tour, but how
is it being the only girl

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.327
on the road with these guys?

00:14:33.327 --> 00:14:34.576
JACKIE MICLAU: Oh, it's great.

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:36.857
SPEAKER: Any secrets to
share of how you manage that?

00:14:36.857 --> 00:14:38.190
JACKIE MICLAU: I'm the princess.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.690
No, I'm just kidding.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.365
No, everyone's super chill.

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:47.700
I think we've got this
family vibe going on.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.560
So yeah.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.490
It's cool.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.424
I have like four brothers now.

00:14:55.424 --> 00:14:57.090
SPEAKER: Four brothers
and best friends.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.727
That's great.

00:14:57.727 --> 00:14:58.560
JACKIE MICLAU: BFFs.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.930
SPEAKER: Let's talk about
the album a little bit.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.970
So "Silver Lining."

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.470
Amazing album.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.062
Cannot believe you
guys posted one--

00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:10.020
I don't know if it was
a song off of the album,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.100
but you, on a whim, just
posted a song up on Spotify

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.110
and were blown away
by how many plays

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.120
you got in the first 48 hours.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.662
Is that song on this album?

00:15:20.662 --> 00:15:21.370
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.200
So that was actually recorded
at Michael's apartment.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.270
It's called "Astrovan" was
the first song we put out

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.240
almost two years ago now.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.809
But then we rerecorded
some of those songs.

00:15:33.809 --> 00:15:35.850
But that original "Astrovan"
was the original one

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.724
from Michael's house.

00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:39.670
But the album wasn't even
a thought at that point.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.910
It was just let's put
some songs online.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.587
SPEAKER: Who owned
the Astro van?

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:46.170
You're in the Motor City, so we
got to talk about cars somehow

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:46.960
I guess.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.390
MATT QUINN: Yep.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:48.950
I don't know.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.800
I don't know where I
got that reference.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.770
A lot of the songs
at that time were

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.800
sort of these sense of
humor joke kind of things

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.290
because we weren't facing
the public in any way.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.360
It was just trying to
make lighthearted songs.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.040
It was really more like I was
picturing the character Jesus,

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.570
not necessarily in
a spiritual way,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.520
but like him being
this carpenter

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.840
guy that was like a stoner.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.027
Trying to put him in 2018,
like what that would look like.

00:16:19.027 --> 00:16:20.610
And that's just the
car I felt like he

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.510
was going to be driving around.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.051
I don't know.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.550
SPEAKER: So back to the album,
the inspiration for it I read

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.785
varies from '60s and '70s rock
all the way through current.

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:34.410
It's interesting
because the first time

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:39.390
I listened to it I felt a
huge My Morning Jacket vibe.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.580
And I actually did feel a
little bit of a Deadhead

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.610
vibe come through.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.380
So hopefully I'm a
little bit on with that

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.810
if you want to talk about
the inspiration of how

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.642
you came to put this
compilation together.

00:16:51.642 --> 00:16:52.350
MATT QUINN: Yeah.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.180
I mean that's--

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:02.640
I think, at least Sam and I grew
up on a lot of '60s, '70s music

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.740
just from our parents.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.880
And it has always stayed my
favorite music, which I know

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.140
doesn't happen for everyone.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.940
So I learned to write listening
to Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.349
Paul Simon, all of that stuff.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:22.829
And then there's more
contemporary bands,

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.569
My Morning Jacket's
definitely an inspiration.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.359
So that's cool.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.944
And I don't know.

00:17:27.944 --> 00:17:32.790
I think, again, the beginning
of and writing of the songs

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.580
was really pretty--

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.830
there wasn't ever a thought
of, all right, let's try

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.530
to make something that
sounds like My Morning Jacket

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.730
or anything like that.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.610
I think that stuff
came out naturally.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.310
I don't know.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.290
SPEAKER: Well, where does
your inspiration come

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.690
from personally when
you sit down to write

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.910
or when you sit down to play?

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.590
Do you have a guilty
pleasure, some kind of a venue

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.360
that you like to create
in or get creative?

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.570
And actually, I'd love
to hear from each of you

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.880
if you don't mind
answering this question.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.749
Whoever wants to start.

00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:09.290
MICHAEL BYRNES: Want
to just go down?

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:09.998
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:18:09.998 --> 00:18:11.940
I mean I think our
songs, for the most part,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.330
start just on acoustic guitars
and then build from there.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.782
Yeah.

00:18:18.782 --> 00:18:20.740
SPEAKER: So actually,
Sam, that's a good point.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.580
So if you start--

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.890
as a guitarist, if you
start on acoustic guitar,

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.590
how would you bring someone
like Jackie in on the keyboard

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.789
into an inspiration?

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:31.830
SAM COOPER: I don't know.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.990
I think we just start playing.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.031
Like we have a bunch of
ideas now that we've just

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:39.870
been working with for album
two, whenever that ever happens.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.887
But I think it's just
finding these threads

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:42.720
and working on them.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.220
It's hard because
we're on tour so much.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.420
There's not a ton of time
to work on these things.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.080
But finding that
time and just trying

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.705
to tie the threads together.

00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:53.080
SPEAKER: What
about you, Michael?

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.992
Where does your
inspiration come from?

00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:57.367
MICHAEL BYRNES: As far as bass
playing, especially in Mt.

00:18:57.367 --> 00:19:03.130
Joy, I think it's
very just reactionary.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.180
I lack a certain skill
in just sitting in a room

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.220
and putting a song together
by myself for whatever reason.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.300
And so I think for
me it's usually

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:17.490
when there's like a skeleton
of something occurring, that's

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.850
where I sit in best is
hearing something and reacting

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.482
to it on the bass, whether
it's just one note or a bunch

00:19:23.482 --> 00:19:25.500
of notes or whatever.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.179
That's where I draw
my inspiration from.

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:29.220
MATT QUINN: I don't know.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.820
I think in terms of where I like
to create, I think a lot of it,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.610
at least on this record,
was like that thing

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.710
where you can't fall
asleep or there's

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.520
some sort of odd
energy in you where

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.330
you're restless in some way.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.220
And I think, for me, that's the
best time to pick up a guitar

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.610
or start being creative and
just trying to channel whatever

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.550
that energy is that's like
stopping me from doing what

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.020
I want to do into like song or
whatever that ends up being.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.060
SPEAKER: Like an
ex, or some kind

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.669
of fight, or some
restless night?

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:02.710
MATT QUINN: I don't know.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.650
I think it's just insomnia,
or weed, or whatever that is.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.870
Instead of scrolling
through my phone

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.764
until like the end of time,
I just pick up a guitar.

00:20:12.764 --> 00:20:15.180
And I also scroll through my
phone through the end of time

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.750
as well.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.750
SPEAKER: Are you scrolling
through social media?

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.270
We're at Google so we have to
have some digital questions.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.970
MATT QUINN: Yes.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.199
I do this thing where
it's like a loop,

00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:26.490
especially if I've been
smoking or something where it's

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.860
like I'm back at Twitter
somehow even though I've

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.360
gone through
everything on my phone,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.590
I open it again even I know
everything that's in there.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.880
And that's what I
know I'm like, oh no.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.080
SPEAKER: I think we just
cracked your insomnia issue.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.360
Social media.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.545
What about you, Sotiris?

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:44.920
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
I'd say, yes.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.090
If anyone has like a
skeleton of a song,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:53.340
I like to work
around that or just

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:59.400
sit in a room with just the
drums and just mess around

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.860
and see what happens and
then maybe show these guys.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.360
Yeah.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.070
That's about it.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.664
And if weed's
there, weed's there.

00:21:07.664 --> 00:21:08.830
If it's not, it's not there.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.480
SPEAKER: Uh, Jackie,
last but not least--

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.438
MATT QUINN: There goes
that Google application.

00:21:16.438 --> 00:21:17.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:21.340
JACKIE MICLAU: When
I create, I think

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.640
it's kind of like what
kind of a day I'm having.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.210
If I'm feeling a
certain way, I kind of

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.660
write based on those feelings.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.800
But for this project,
I think a lot of it

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.120
is just, like, vibing.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.580
And we've been
touring together for,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.460
like, what, like, a year,
a little over a year now.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.770
And so it's just kind of
figuring out where we all

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.400
fit in, and coming together
with different ideas,

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.870
trying new things
out every night.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.320
Yeah.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.180
SPEAKER: So I was
looking at all the places

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.230
that you have yet to go.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.530
I know you're four
cities or so in.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.140
How do you pick
a tour like that?

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.230
Do you feel like as the
musicians of the band,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.630
that you have any
say in where you go,

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.309
and landing in
Europe, for example?

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:16.600
Why don't you answer that, Sam?

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.308
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:22:17.308 --> 00:22:20.400
We have an agent who
maps things out for us.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.770
But we definitely have a say.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.340
Like, we get to go to
Europe later this year,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.430
which is going to be crazy.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.430
But we've been touring--

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.202
I mean, I know this tour just
started, like, four days ago

00:22:32.202 --> 00:22:33.660
or whatever it is,
but we've really

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.257
been touring pretty
nonstop since early March.

00:22:36.257 --> 00:22:38.340
And so we're kind of
starting to hit cities twice.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.565
And from there, you kind
of just have to expand.

00:22:40.565 --> 00:22:44.070
And I guess Europe's
going to be awesome.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.370
SPEAKER: I read that NPR
said that you guys are

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.900
a great festival band.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.300
How do you feel about
playing festivals

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.940
versus being on tour together
and playing at places

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.519
like the Shelter tonight?

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:58.560
MICHAEL BYRNES: A lot of
free stuff at festivals.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.530
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.050
MICHAEL BYRNES: A
lot of open bars.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.280
There's a lot of--

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.430
sometimes free shirts and shoes.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.117
So it's pretty sweet.

00:23:06.117 --> 00:23:07.450
SAM COOPER: Festivals are great.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.090
There's always a ton of people.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.435
But there's something
about your own show

00:23:11.435 --> 00:23:12.810
where you know
that people aren't

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.420
just kind of like
wandering over a field

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.430
because they hear music.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.180
They bought a ticket,
and they're into it,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.400
and they're watching and
listening and appreciating.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.464
SPEAKER: Bonnaroo,
Lollapalooza, Electric Forest.

00:23:25.464 --> 00:23:26.880
There's not much
you haven't done.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.770
But is there a festival
that you are kind of

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.964
hoping to get an invite to?

00:23:30.964 --> 00:23:32.880
And we are recording
this, and this will go up

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.580
on the YouTube channel.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.710
MATT QUINN: Looks into camera.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.834
SPEAKER: Looks into camera.

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:38.830
MATT QUINN: I don't know.

00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:44.314
I think Coachella
would be awesome.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.759
I'm probably,
like, missing them.

00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:49.300
I don't know.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.750
I'm not, like, a--

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.430
SAM COOPER: Sasquatch
would have been cool.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.730
But--

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.200
MATT QUINN: Yeah.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.370
Oh, yeah, I--

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.110
SAM COOPER: --it's gone.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.740
MATT QUINN: --always
wanted to do that.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.906
And then they retired it
because we wanted to do it.

00:23:54.906 --> 00:23:56.010
SAM COOPER: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.340
JACKIE MICLAU: Burning Man.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.600
SAM COOPER: Burning Man.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.100
Yeah.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.240
MATT QUINN: Yeah.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.130
SAM COOPER: No, we can't
afford to go to Burning Man.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.005
SPEAKER: Just missed
that, just a week or so.

00:24:03.005 --> 00:24:04.560
SAM COOPER: Next year, yeah.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.034
SPEAKER: Sotiris, I know
you're terrified of me

00:24:07.034 --> 00:24:08.200
throwing a hard ball at you.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.770
So I'm going to ask what was
your favorite thing that you

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.661
had from the lunch
at Google today?

00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:15.660
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Well,
the mushroom risotto--

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.470
is that what that is?

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.875
SPEAKER: That was good.

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:17.833
SAM COOPER: Stroganoff.

00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:19.770
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
Stroganoff, I'm sorry.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.910
Yeah.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.436
I love mushrooms and Italian.

00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:25.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.692
SAM COOPER: The food?

00:24:26.692 --> 00:24:28.400
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
The food, yeah, yeah.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.700
SAM COOPER: Not
the hallucinogen.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.470
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
Everyone, it's OK.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.300
Calm down.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.730
MICHAEL BYRNES: We truly
don't do as many drugs

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:33.570
as it seems right now.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.861
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: No, no, no.

00:24:34.861 --> 00:24:38.020
I honestly-- I do love
mushrooms, like portobellos,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.655
cremini, the whole--

00:24:39.655 --> 00:24:41.946
SAM COOPER: We get off the
stage, and we drink LaCroix.

00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:43.027
That's it.

00:24:43.027 --> 00:24:43.860
We're not that band.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.600
MATT QUINN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.240
Yeah.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.150
SPEAKER: We're big
fans of LaCroix here.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.570
So we'll hook you up afterwards.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.200
Along with a Froyo machine, too.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.610
SAM COOPER: Oh, my god.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:50.830
OK.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.285
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:51.784
[LAUGHS]

00:24:51.784 --> 00:24:52.575
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:53.370
Please.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.420
SPEAKER: OK.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.040
So Jackie, Matt said that
you love this weather.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.530
I wish it would have been
a nicer, sunnier day here.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.000
There's all kinds of stuff
happening in Detroit today,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.500
actually.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.842
We've got the Lions playing.

00:25:05.842 --> 00:25:07.050
We've got the Tigers playing.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.133
And of course, we have Mt.

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:10.740
Joy playing at the
shelter tonight.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.470
But can you talk a little
bit about your journey

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.170
from Portland to Los Angeles?

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.340
And you know, we have a
Women@ group here at Google.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.170
And we like to talk a lot
about empowering other women.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.880
So we'd love to
know if you've had

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.850
like a little secret to your
success so far on your journey

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:29.810
from Portland.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.950
JACKIE MICLAU: Oh, man.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.180
Yeah, well, I moved to LA
just kind of on a whim.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.990
It was random and
so not like me.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.640
I think I decided
in July of 2016.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.300
And then I moved
out September 2016--

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.450
that same year.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.280
But yeah, I think just
surrounding yourself with,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.620
like, a good community
of people who

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.650
are going to encourage you to
pursue what you want to pursue.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.970
And then just being
confident, knowing

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.940
that you put in the
work, and everything else

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.770
will come, as long as you
put yourself out there.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.230
So--

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.539
SPEAKER: You went from
one of the rainiest cities

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.830
to one of the sunniest cities--

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.130
JACKIE MICLAU: I know!

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.850
SPEAKER: --in the country.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.933
JACKIE MICLAU: But luckily,
we're touring so much.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:20.960
So I'm not there, ever.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.374
SPEAKER: Um, do you guys all
have your cell phones on you?

00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:28.040
SAM COOPER: Uh--

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.000
JACKIE MICLAU: Sure do.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.960
SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.200
All right.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.616
We're going to
play a little game.

00:26:31.616 --> 00:26:32.710
Pull those on out.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.560
SAM COOPER: All right.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.410
SPEAKER: So one of my best
friends from my childhood

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.310
is actually here today with me.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.302
And before I have you
look on your phone,

00:26:42.302 --> 00:26:43.760
we're going to
start with you, Sam.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.051
We're going to do a little
lightning round of questions

00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:48.290
to get to know
each of you better.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.630
What would-- just
pick one word-- what

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.520
would your best
friend from childhood,

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.530
whether that's Matt or someone
else, use to describe you?

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.730
SAM COOPER: No.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.194
I have to do this for myself?

00:26:59.194 --> 00:26:59.985
SPEAKER: Yeah, you.

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.230
SAM COOPER: Ah.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.170
JACKIE MICLAU: I'm
going to text mine.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.680
SAM COOPER: Half Jewish.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.506
I don't know.

00:27:05.506 --> 00:27:06.680
I have no idea!

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.594
I-- yeah, let's go with that.

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:10.760
SPEAKER: That's your answer.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.802
OK-- half Jewish.

00:27:11.802 --> 00:27:12.510
SAM COOPER: Sure.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.870
SPEAKER: Mike?

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.786
MICHAEL BYRNES: Oh, we're
going down the line.

00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:17.690
This is tough.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.420
I grew up in Oklahoma,
so probably just liberal.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.057
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:23.390
Because I grew up with some
really conservative friends,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.830
but they're still good friends.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.115
SPEAKER: Sure, absolutely.

00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:26.990
What about you, Matt?

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.900
MATT QUINN: Goofy.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.340
SPEAKER: Goofy.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.350
Sotiris?

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.016
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
Extremely confident.

00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:36.454
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:38.296
MATT QUINN: That's two words.

00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:40.310
AUDIENCE: Hyphenate it.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.280
SPEAKER: And Jackie?

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.900
JACKIE MICLAU: Introverted--
I'm actually sweating up here.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:47.270
SAM COOPER: It's
so cold in here.

00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:50.090
SPEAKER: OK.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.290
So pull those phones out.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.390
This is something we
actually make our clients do

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.840
when they come to Google.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.180
Well, not-- we don't make them.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.870
But it's usually, like, a fun
icebreaker, if you don't mind.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.230
And maybe you might have to
censor this a little bit.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.840
But take a look on your phone
and tell us the last thing

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.550
that you Googled.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.660
SAM COOPER: So I don't
have my phone on me,

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.734
so I already failed.

00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:09.650
But I know what it is.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:10.160
SPEAKER: OK, yeah.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.770
Tell us if you know.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.061
SAM COOPER: It was in the back.

00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:14.840
We were trying to figure out
the Little Caesars Arena.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.431
We're trying figure out how
long it's been here in Detroit.

00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:17.930
And--

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.014
SPEAKER: What'd you learn?

00:28:19.014 --> 00:28:21.138
SAM COOPER: Well, I learned
that the Red Wings used

00:28:21.138 --> 00:28:22.370
to play the Joe Louis arena.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:27.710
And then the Pistons played
at the palace in Auburn Hills.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.655
And now they're both
here, behind us.

00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:32.025
SPEAKER: That Google, it's a--

00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:33.150
SAM COOPER: Google's great.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:35.220
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.150
SPEAKER: Yeah, actually,
when you walk back out,

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.630
notice that the original, before
there was a Joe Lewis arena,

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.849
was Olympia--

00:28:42.849 --> 00:28:43.640
was the name of it.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.320
It was The Olympia Barn.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.800
The original sign from that
stadium is actually right here.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.520
You can see it from our windows
here on the fourth floor,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.640
the big Olympia logo.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.400
It's pretty cool.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.470
There's more stories.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.970
I don't know if
Dave Hoffman's here.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.830
I'm sure he's happy
to share, if he is.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.000
[? SAM COOPER: ?]
That's pretty good.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.806
SPEAKER: What
about you, Michael?

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:00.860
What's the last
thing you Googled?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.670
MICHAEL BYRNES: Aw,
it's going to make

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.230
me look like I do more drugs.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:09.020
But I was Googling articles
about Elon Musk's blow

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.769
back from smoking a
blunt with Joe Rogan.

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:11.560
SPEAKER: Hilarious.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.890
Wait, was there a blow back?

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.180
I just saw the interview.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:14.450
MICHAEL BYRNES: A little bit--

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.991
I was just reading an article
about how the Air Force doesn't

00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:18.064
know how to handle it.

00:29:18.064 --> 00:29:20.480
I guess they're, like, people
are requesting them to start

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.920
an investigation on Elon Musk.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.880
SPEAKER: It's legal.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.670
It's legal where he
was when he smoked it.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:24.880
SAM COOPER: That's true.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.180
SPEAKER: It's legal.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.165
MATT QUINN: So I'll
lead the investigation.

00:29:29.165 --> 00:29:31.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.086
SPEAKER: OK, Matt, what
did you actually Google?

00:29:33.086 --> 00:29:35.460
MATT QUINN: This is actually
crazy for where we are right

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.959
now.

00:29:35.959 --> 00:29:38.000
But me and Sotiris were
trying to figure out

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.690
how many users certain social
media applications have.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.730
So I Googled--

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.350
I just have the
list of the number

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.167
of users on the top
social media applications.

00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:50.250
SPEAKER: And what is that?

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.069
What's the top?

00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:52.610
MATT QUINN: So
Facebook's number one.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.960
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.810
MATT QUINN: YouTube
is number two.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.490
And then WhatsApp, followed
by Facebook Messenger,

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.610
which is a loser move.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.470
That should be-- whatever.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.515
[? MICHAEL BYRNES: ?] It's
two things [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:03.515 --> 00:30:04.590
MATT QUINN: They
can't have both.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.210
MICHAEL BYRNES: Yeah.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.126
MATT QUINN: And then
WeChat and then Instagram

00:30:07.126 --> 00:30:09.577
and then some foreign ones.

00:30:09.577 --> 00:30:10.160
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.960
I was doing some
research on you guys.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.030
You guys have 4,000
subscribers on YouTube.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:15.670
It's very good.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.470
That puts you into a
top creator profile.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.260
You have about 7,500
fans on Facebook.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.750
You have about 3,000
Twitter followers.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.840
And on Instagram,
you're killing it.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.230
You have 13,000
followers on Instagram.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.470
But by far and away,
your YouTube music plays

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.820
and your Spotify plays
are just off the hook.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.500
SAM COOPER: [? Is that right? ?]

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.083
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:39.052
Your streaming music services
are getting a lot of use.

00:30:39.052 --> 00:30:39.760
SAM COOPER: Cool.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.950
SPEAKER: Keep it up.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.282
Good work-- who is your--

00:30:42.282 --> 00:30:43.990
before we get to you,
Sotiris and Jackie,

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.370
who is your social
media manager?

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.010
Is it amongst the five of
you, or do you outsource that?

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.740
SAM COOPER: I kind of run
the Instagram and Facebook

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.490
for the most part.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.600
And our manager kind of
just fills in the rest.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.475
But we all kind of have
access to the account

00:30:58.475 --> 00:31:00.869
and put up stories and
goofy stuff along the way.

00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:02.410
SPEAKER: Is there
anything off limits

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.069
that you don't put up there,
since you are a public persona?

00:31:06.069 --> 00:31:08.110
SAM COOPER: There are
things that are off limits.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.692
But--

00:31:08.692 --> 00:31:10.150
SPEAKER: You can't
talk about them?

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.140
SAM COOPER: I mean,
like, I don't know.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.950
Like, naked pictures?

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.210
I don't know.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:12.710
SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.520
SPEAKER: I feel
like that's assumed.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.200
That's a given.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.908
SAM COOPER: Well, you
asked the question.

00:31:17.908 --> 00:31:18.890
I'm going to answer it.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.390
No.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:19.850
I don't know.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.010
We all just kind of just--

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:21.370
I think we're all--

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.960
MATT QUINN: I didn't know
naked pictures were off limits.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.668
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:31:23.668 --> 00:31:24.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.010
Yeah.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.260
I'm going to delete Matt's
access to the accounts now.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.759
MATT QUINN: Well,
I run the Twitter.

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:30.610
So that's fair game.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.070
SAM COOPER: That's true.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.450
Matt does run the Twitter--

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.620
MATT QUINN: I think Twitter--
you can have naked pictures.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:33.970
MICHAEL BYRNES: Yeah.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:34.180
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:34.980
SAM COOPER: Come on.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.021
What are you waiting for?

00:31:36.021 --> 00:31:36.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.320
SPEAKER: Doesn't sound very
brand safe to me, but Sotiris,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.500
what's the last
thing you Googled?

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.519
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
So mine was the thing

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:47.810
that Michael was talking about.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.530
But I guess before that was
lyrics to a Cold War Kids song.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.542
So shout out to Long
Beach, California.

00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:56.500
SPEAKER: What-- were you
looking for the lyrics

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.710
because you're going to maybe
sing for us a little bit,

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.380
a cappella here,
and surprise us.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.260
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
It was-- no, no, no.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:05.989
No.

00:32:05.989 --> 00:32:07.030
My phone just turned off.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.890
It just died.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:08.681
SPEAKER: Oh, weird.

00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:09.319
[LAUGHS]

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.360
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Yeah.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.984
I was just-- I was
trying to figure out

00:32:11.984 --> 00:32:14.170
what song it was during a--
and I watched a live set

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.140
on YouTube.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.810
And I was googling
the lyrics, because I

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.018
didn't know what song it was.

00:32:18.018 --> 00:32:20.242
So now I do.

00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:21.448
SPEAKER: Now you do.

00:32:21.448 --> 00:32:22.908
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Ah, Jackie!

00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:25.000
JACKIE MICLAU: Oh, boy.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.652
I googled Mac Miller,
rest in peace.

00:32:26.652 --> 00:32:27.610
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Aw.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:28.950
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.370
JACKIE MICLAU: Yeah.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.530
Couldn't sleep last night.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.550
SPEAKER: Well, Jackie.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.883
Actually, let's start with
you with the second question.

00:32:35.883 --> 00:32:39.010
So let's talk YouTube.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.400
What is your favorite YouTube
channel or a content creator,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.711
if you have one?

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:46.360
JACKIE MICLAU: Ooh.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.590
Yeah.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.390
SPEAKER: I mean,
if that's too hard,

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.470
what is, maybe, the last video
that you watched on YouTube?

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.807
JACKIE MICLAU:
Probably a Mac Miller--

00:32:57.807 --> 00:32:58.390
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.540
JACKIE MICLAU: --YouTube video.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.130
Yeah.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.440
But-- I'm sorry.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.200
SPEAKER: No, no,
no, please, please.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200
JACKIE MICLAU: YouTube--

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.920
I watch a lot of,
like, music videos.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.780
That is, like, my go to.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.930
SPEAKER: What's your
favorite music video or music

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.490
genre to watch on YouTube?

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.385
JACKIE MICLAU: I'll watch
anything John Mayer I can find.

00:33:21.385 --> 00:33:22.994
SPEAKER: Oh, he's your guy?

00:33:22.994 --> 00:33:24.160
JACKIE MICLAU: He is my guy.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.715
SPEAKER: Would you--

00:33:24.715 --> 00:33:26.173
JACKIE MICLAU: If
you're watching--

00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:27.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.960
JACKIE MICLAU: --I
can be your girl.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.890
No, just kidding.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.420
SPEAKER: Is he single?

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.260
I think so now.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.239
JACKIE MICLAU: Based on
my YouTube search, yes.

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:37.030
SPEAKER: All right.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.580
Well, if we have any John
Mayer connections out there,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.550
let's hook her up.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.500
Hook a girl up.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.240
MICHAEL BYRNES: Can't
you just Google?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.950
Like, I'll bet you can do that.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.170
Yeah, just strong arm him.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:49.390
SPEAKER: This gets posted
on the worldwide web.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.405
Sotiris, what's your favorite
YouTube guilty pleasure

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:55.291
or creator or last video?

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.290
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: I
watch a lot of drum stuff.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.700
So there's a lot of drum
tuning videos and drum sets.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:06.310
But I think a good comedy
one is Good Neighbor, which

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:11.350
is like the dude, Kyle Mooney,
from "SNL" and then his guys.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.851
If you go watch that
stuff, it's very funny.

00:34:14.851 --> 00:34:16.600
That's all I can think
of, top of my head.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.659
SPEAKER: Do you find yourself
watching a lot of TV, too?

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.810
Or are you watching
more streaming services?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.489
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Yeah, more,
I guess, streaming stuff--

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.550
yeah, don't watch much TV.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.820
I guess just "Seinfeld" is
the only TV I really watch.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.279
SPEAKER: And you watch
that probably through Hulu

00:34:34.279 --> 00:34:35.320
or YouTube or something--

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:35.770
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.686
SPEAKER: --or Netflix?

00:34:36.686 --> 00:34:38.690
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS:
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.940
SPEAKER: What about you, Matt?

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:43.600
MATT QUINN: I don't know.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.580
A lot of, like, music
stuff, for sure.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.982
But also, kind of
sports are my get away

00:34:47.982 --> 00:34:48.940
from all of this stuff.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.249
So I watch a lot of
House of Highlights.

00:34:51.249 --> 00:34:54.190
I watch a lot of this
guy Frankie Vision, that

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:58.400
does a lot of, like, basketball
highlights pretty quickly.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.540
And yeah, no, that's probably--

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.009
SPEAKER: So what's your team?

00:35:03.009 --> 00:35:04.800
Do you have a football
team, baseball team?

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.860
MATT QUINN: I'm
Philly all the way.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.070
SPEAKER: Philly?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.528
MATT QUINN: So I
grew up in Philly,

00:35:07.528 --> 00:35:09.670
so all the Philly sports teams.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.290
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.000
Michael?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.250
MICHAEL BYRNES: For me, I
watch a lot of gear reviews,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.580
like, music gear reviews.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.830
So there's one in particular
called pedals and effects

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.820
that's all about pedals and
effects over there behind you.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.549
And it's run by
these two funny guys,

00:35:23.549 --> 00:35:25.840
one bass player I really
admire and one guitar player I

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.423
really admire.

00:35:26.423 --> 00:35:28.928
So-- and "Hot Ones"--

00:35:28.928 --> 00:35:30.094
I watch a lot of "Hot Ones."

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:30.541
SAM COOPER: I watch
a lot of "Hot Ones."

00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:31.720
MATT QUINN: Ah,
that's a good one.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.844
SPEAKER: What's "Hot Ones?"

00:35:32.844 --> 00:35:34.920
MICHAEL BYRNES:
Ooh, it's so good.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.530
It's an interview
show in which this one

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.090
guy does the interview.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.040
And he asks 10 questions.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.200
And with each question
they eat-- both of them,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.840
the person being interviewed
and the interviewee--

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.824
--er, interviewer-- they
eat a spicy chicken wing.

00:35:49.824 --> 00:35:51.240
And they get--
with each question,

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.402
it gets way more spicy until
the last hot sauce is just,

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.110
like, diabolical.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.943
SPEAKER: Oh, my god.

00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:58.137
I totally could have
taken you in that today.

00:35:58.137 --> 00:35:59.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.470
MICHAEL BYRNES: I'll go.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.660
I mean, I'm sure I'm not--

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.642
I'm not--

00:36:01.642 --> 00:36:02.850
SAM COOPER: I can't do spicy.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.330
SPEAKER: That's crazy.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.830
MICHAEL BYRNES: But
it's very funny.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.590
And the guys ask
really good questions.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.144
And as the food gets spicier,
people don't have much--

00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:13.560
they don't think about what
they should and shouldn't say.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.540
They're just getting
the answer out.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.440
So it's a good show.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.160
SPEAKER: I'll have
to check that out.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.600
MICHAEL BYRNES:
Yeah, it's great.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.590
SPEAKER: And last,
but not least, Sam.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.298
SAM COOPER: I watch
a lot of Tim and Eric

00:36:22.298 --> 00:36:25.200
on YouTube, just because it's
very short, simple, stupid

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.660
videos that make you
stop thinking entirely.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.890
But then we also--
we just put out

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.850
a music video for
our song "Bigfoot"

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.310
by our friend Steve Gerard.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.870
And that is on YouTube as
of, like, four days ago

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.450
or something.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:40.980
Yeah.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.120
SPEAKER: Can you tell us,
speaking of that video--

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.328
oh, my god, if you guys
haven't seen it, go watch it.

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.549
How did you make that
costume for "Bigfoot"?

00:36:47.549 --> 00:36:49.590
I've seen it in my nightmares
a couple times now.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.100
SAM COOPER: So
Steve did all of it.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.724
Steve Gerard-- he
did all-- he actually

00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:54.860
did our album cover, too.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.450
But yeah, he does all of our
artwork, and he's a genius.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.441
He's an insane genius.

00:36:59.441 --> 00:37:00.690
SPEAKER: He's not here, is he?

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.280
SAM COOPER: No.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.613
SPEAKER: I was going to say,
you are a weird guy, Steve.

00:37:03.613 --> 00:37:04.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.800
That's very cool.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.625
And did you have to shut down
Times Square to do that video?

00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:11.250
SAM COOPER: I don't
know how he did it.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:15.420
I think they went out at
like 3 AM with a guy dressed

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.270
as a bat-pig man on a bicycle.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.606
And, like, drove in
front of him in a car.

00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:21.730
You got to watch the video.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.330
It's probably making no sense
right now if you've seen it.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.720
SPEAKER: A very good video,
though, and a great song, too--

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.320
so well, I was going to ask
you about that album cover.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.271
But you just did.

00:37:32.271 --> 00:37:34.020
And that was going to
be my last question.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.310
So we only have a
few minutes left.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.940
Are there any questions
from the audience

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.920
that we could open it up to?

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.247
Anyone brave enough
to take their hand?

00:37:43.247 --> 00:37:44.392
Yeah?

00:37:44.392 --> 00:37:45.225
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:37:45.225 --> 00:37:47.174
We've all met, but Jason here.

00:37:47.174 --> 00:37:49.340
Could you talk a little
bit more about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.580
Like, your band
t-shirts, your posters,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.260
the inserts for the vinyl--

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.499
it's all got, like, a really
cool, unique look to it.

00:37:57.499 --> 00:37:58.290
Was that all Steve?

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.164
SAM COOPER: Yeah, that's
literally all Steve.

00:38:00.164 --> 00:38:02.400
So I met Steve--

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.407
I was studying abroad
in West Africa.

00:38:04.407 --> 00:38:05.490
And I didn't know anybody.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.100
And he was on my trip with me.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.832
We became really close friends.

00:38:08.832 --> 00:38:11.040
And he would travel everywhere
with a little journal.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.560
And he would just draw these
dumb, goofy little things

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.300
everywhere in his
little journal.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.600
And then, like, eight years
later, we started this band.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.920
And we were, like, what
should the aesthetic be?

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.961
And I was just thinking,
like, oh, my god-- like,

00:38:22.961 --> 00:38:24.420
there's Steve!

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.950
So he drew the bison, the
sheep drawing, the cardinal,

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.360
the album cover,
the music video.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:31.860
Yeah.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.230
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.090
Well, one more
question, actually,

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.190
if there aren't any
from the audience.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.470
Raise your hand if this is
your first time in Detroit.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.970
Nope?

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.740
So you guys have all
been here on a tour,

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.410
I'm guessing, at
some point in time.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.080
Is there any favorite
scenes you like

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.810
to check out when here, or
favorite bar or restaurant,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.134
or even place to play?

00:38:59.134 --> 00:39:01.300
MICHAEL BYRNES: I like this
bagel place in Corktown,

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.680
called the Detroit
Bagel Institute.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.230
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.729
Yeah.

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:06.340
MICHAEL BYRNES:
It's pretty banging.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.510
SPEAKER: What's your order?

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.260
What's your bagel?

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.301
MICHAEL BYRNES: A lox,
you know, that's the move.

00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:12.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.602
Yeah, I like Detroit a lot.

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:15.310
It's really cool.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.040
It's like there's a lot of
hidden things in Detroit.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.748
Everyone looks at it
and thinks it's just

00:39:18.748 --> 00:39:21.100
a desolate, like,
apocalypse town.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.360
But--

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.300
MATT QUINN: I don't think
everyone looks at it

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.966
and thinks that.

00:39:23.966 --> 00:39:24.687
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:24.687 --> 00:39:26.020
SPEAKER: Well, there was a time.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.035
It's coming back now.

00:39:27.035 --> 00:39:27.910
MICHAEL BYRNES: Yeah.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.550
But I really like this place.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.380
SPEAKER: We're happy
to have you here.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.920
Any other favorite
Detroit haunts?

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.160
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Google.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.151
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:38.651
Obviously.

00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:41.645
SAM COOPER: The Joe Louis
Arena and the Palace and Little

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:42.145
Caesars.

00:39:42.145 --> 00:39:43.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.610
SPEAKER: The other two are
gone now, so here you are.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.740
Well, then, LCA is now
your favorite place.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.100
So it was such a pleasure
to have you guys here.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.240
Not only are you such an
incredibly talented group

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.050
of musicians, but you're an
absolute joy to be around

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.950
and to get to know.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.280
So if you find yourselves
ever back in the Motor City,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.720
will you please come again?

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.344
Maybe on that slip
about album 2--

00:40:10.344 --> 00:40:10.843
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:10.843 --> 00:40:11.630
SAM COOPER: Yeah.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.610
SPEAKER: --if
that's in the works.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.320
SAM COOPER: We'll be back, yeah.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.680
SPEAKER: We would
love to have you guys.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.638
Thank you so much for
coming to Google Detroit.

00:40:16.638 --> 00:40:19.480
Let's get one huge round
applause again for these guys.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.580
[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.130
SOTIRIS ELIOPOULUS: Thank you.
