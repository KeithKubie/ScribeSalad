Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 85 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I was given a very old man who could not or would not keep up with this country man because he repeatedly fell and then simply lay there. I regularly had to lift him up and drag him forward. Thus, I only reached the execution site when my comrades had already shot. They're Jews at the site of his country, men who had been shot. My Jiu threw himself on the ground and remained lying there. I then cocked my car being and shot him through the back of the head because I was already very upset from the cruel treatment of the Jews during the clearing of the town and was completely in turmoil. I shot too high. The entire back of the skull of my Jew was torn off and the brain exposed parts of the skull flew into Sergeant Steinmetz, his face. This was grounds for me. After returning to the truck to go to the first sergeant and ask for my release, I had become so sick that I simply couldn't anymore. I was then relieved by the first surgeon.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Systematic murder. That's what we're talking about. This is the Nazis final solution, which was not always carried out in the relatively detached method. Often fond of when we think of the Holocaust cause when we think of the Holocaust, a lot of times we think of this big mechanism we think of trains, we think of gas chambers, we think of process. We think of a massive bureaucratic machine that is doing the killing in in. Maybe that in some way is easier for us to understand and that's where we focus on that piece. It's easier for us to accept that, but it wasn't all like that. Many lives were taken many murders committed by hand,

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       close range, point blank, so what kind of monsters committed. Those are trustees, those personal atrocities up close and personal murders that covered the murderers in the blood of their victims. What? What kind of men were those and how did they end up there and what can we do to prevent it from occurring again now to answer or at least try and come to some understanding. We're going to explore a book that is called ordinary men, reserve police battalion 101 and the final solution in Poland written by Christopher are browning. And that first excerpt that I read is from that book and it's from a soldier in the police battalion named August Zorn. And that's actually a, a pseudonym. The names were changed for some of the Nazis in the book, but the book is incredibly detailed in what happened and where these men were from and what unfolded. And obviously this is going to be a graphic episode and you, you know, I actually wish I didn't have to talk about this.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       I do. I really do. I wish I could talk about nicer things. I wish I could talk about pleasant things and we could just forget about all this horror. But Aye, there's the rub because even though it would be easier and more pleasant to talk about something nice, the problem is that if we forget about these things, then we forget about these things and if we forget, we don't learn. And if we don't learn about what humans can do and why they do what they do, then we can repeat our mistakes in. That is awful.

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       so yeah, we go because we have to go. Can we go back to the book?

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Just as the sky was beginning to lighten the convoy halted outside yourself, it was a typical Polish village of modest white houses with thatched straw roofs among its inhabitants war 1800 Jews. The village was totally quiet. The men of Reserve Police Battalion, one o one climbed down from their trucks and assembled in the half circle around their commander, Major Ville helm trap, a 53 year old career policemen, affectionately known by his men as papa trap. The time had come for trap to address the men and inform them of the assignment. The battalion had received Pale and nervous with choking voice and tears in his eyes trap visibly fought to control himself. As he spoke the battalion, he said plaintiff Lee had to perform a frightfully unpleasant task. This assignment was not to his liking. Indeed, it was highly regrettable, but the orders came from the highest authorities. If it would make the task any easier than men should remember that in Germany the bombs were falling on women and children.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Then he turned to the matter at hand. The Jews had instigated the American boy cop that it damaged Germany. One policeman remembered trap saying there were Jews in the village of Yosef Ove who were involved with the partisans. He explained according to two others, the battalion had now been ordered to round up these Jews, the male Jews of working age where to be separated and taken to a work camp. The remaining Jews, the women, children and elderly were to be shot on the spot by the battalion. Having explained awaited his men trapped made them an extraordinary offer. If any of the older men among them did not feel up to the task that lay before them, he could step out.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       Trap paused, and after some moments, one man from third company, Aldo, Julius Schimke, stepped forward. Captain Hoffman who had arrived in Yosef directly from Zaccaro with third platoon of third company and had not been part of the officers' meetings the day before was furious that one of his men had been the first to break rakes. Hoffman begin to Berate Schimke, but trap caught him off after he had taken Schimke under his protection. Some 10 or 12 other men stepped forward as well. They turned in their rifles and we're told to await a further assignment from the major, so we'll go into this, but you've got to a battalion three companies, there's probably 500 men and we have, they get this s savage order that they're going to go and shoot the women, children and elderly on the spot in this village with pretty white houses and the commander, this guy trap who obviously isn't comfortable with it, he's got tears in his eyes when he's given this order. He says, Hey, if anybody doesn't want to participate, you can step forward now and like 10 or 12 people out of 500 step forward.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       The rest of them hold the line. In this case, going back to the book, trapped then summoned the company commanders and gave them the respect of assignments. The orders were relayed by the platoon commanders, two platoons, a third company where to surround the village. The men were explicitly ordered to shoot anyone trying to escape. The remaining men were to round up the Jews and take them to the marketplace. Those too sick or frail to walk to the marketplace as well as infants and anyone offering resistance. We're attempting to hide where to be shot on the spot.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Thereafter, a few men of the first company were escorted where do escort the work Jews who had been selected at the marketplace while the rest of first company was to proceed to the forest to form firing squads. The Jews were to be loaded onto battalion trucks by second company and Third Platoon of third company and shuttled from the marketplace to the forest, and that's for executions. Yeah. After making the assignments trap. Spent most of the day in town either in a schoolroom converted into his headquarters at the homes of the Polish mayor and at the local priest at the marketplace or on the road to the forest, but he did not go to the forest itself or witness the executions. His absence. There was conspicuous as one policeman bitterly commented. Major trap was never there. Instead of you remained in Yosef wove because he could allegedly could not bear the sight we met were upset about that and said we couldn't bear it either.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Indeed, traps distress was a secret to no one at the marketplace. One policeman remembered hearing traps wrote, say, Oh God, why did I have to be given these orders as he put his hand on his heart, another policeman witness Tim at the schoolhouse today. I can see exactly before my eyes made your trap in the room, pacing back and forth with his hands behind his back. He made a downcast impression and spoke to me. He said something like, man, such jobs don't suit me, but orders are orders. Another man remembered vividly how trap finally alone nor room sat on a stool and wept bitterly. The tiers really flowed.

Speaker 3:          00:13:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       Can you hear that? That idea that orders are orders doesn't stand, doesn't work. Back to the book. As the roundup neared completion, the men are first company were withdrawn from the search and give them a quick lesson in the gruesome task that awaited them. They were instructed by the battalion doctor and the company's first Sargent, and this is a quote from one of the men. I believe that at this point all the officers of the battalion were present, especially our battalion physician, Dr Schoenfelder. He now had to explain to us precisely how we had to shoot in order to induce the immediate death of the victim. I remember exactly that. For this demonstration, he'd you or outlined the contours of a human body, at least from the shoulders upward and then indicated precisely the point on which the fixed bayonet was to be placed as an aiming guide. So we have the battalion doctor who's instructing some of the men and you're going to see that it wasn't all of them to take the bayonet, which is on their rifle, put it on the back of the neck as an aiming guide to know where exactly where to shoot.

Speaker 3:          00:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       Back to the book. First Sergeant Camer had taken the initial contingent of shooters in first company to a forest several kilometers from Yosef. The truck's halted on a dirt road that ran along the edge at a point where a pathway led into the woods. The men climbed down from their trucks and waited. When the first truck load of 35 to 40 Jews arrived and equal number of policemen came forward and face to face were paired off with their victims led by or the policemen and Jews marched down the forest path. They turned off into the woods at a point indicated by captain Wolof, who busied himself throughout the day, selecting the execution sites. Camera then ordered the Jews to lie down in a row. The policeman stepped up behind them, place their bayonets on the backbone above the shoulder blade as instructed earlier and on cameras command fired in unison.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       In the meantime, more policemen of first company had arrived at the edge of the forest to fill out a second firing squad. As the first firing squad marched out of the woods to the unloading point, the second group took their victims along the same path into the woods. Well, half chose a site a few yards farther on, so the next batch of victims would not see the corpses from the earlier execution. These Jews were again forced to lie face down in a row and the shooting procedure was repeated. Thereafter, the pendulum traffic of the two firing squads in and out of the woods continued throughout the day except for a midday break. The shooting proceeded without interruption until nightfall. At some point in the afternoon, someone organized a supply of alcohol for the shooters. By the end of the day of nearly continuous shooting, the medic completely lost track of how many Jews they had each killed in the words of one policeman. It was, in any case, a great number. So clearly this is not what we think of when we think of the Holocaust. Go Ben being paired off with their victims to take out in the woods and shot in the back of the head.

Speaker 3:          00:17:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:32       and going through this procedure the entire day. Back to the book. In contrast to first company, the men of second company received no instruction on how to carry out the shooting initially bay, and that's we're not fixed as an aiming guide and as herder noted, there was a considerable number of missed shots that led to the unnecessary wounding of the victims. One of the policemen and hurts unit likewise noted the difficulty the men had an aiming properly. At first, we shot free hand. When one aim too high, the entire skull exploded. As a consequence, brains and bones flew everywhere. Thus we were instructed to place the bay in that point on the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       According to hergert. However, using fixed bayonets as an aiming guide was no solution. Through the point blank shot though the point blank shot that was thus required, the bullet struck the head of the victim. It's such a trajectory that often the entire skull, or at least the entire rear skullcap was torn off and blood bone splinters in brain sprayed everywhere and [inaudible] to the shooters. Her group was so in phatic that no one had first platoon was given the option of withdrawing beforehand, but once the executions began and men approached either him or sheer because they could not shoot women and children, they were given other duties. This was confirmed by one of his men during the execution word spread that anyone could not take it any longer could report. He w he then went on to note, I myself took part in some 10 shootings in which I had to shoot men and women. I simply could not shoot at people anymore, which became apparent to my sergeant hergert because at the end I repeatedly shot past. For this reason, he relieved me. Other comrades were all so relieved sooner or later because they simply could no longer continue.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       So obviously there's mixed emotions about this whole thing from the top of the chain of command right down to the frontline shooters that are only able to do this so many times. Some of them opt out of it initially, but let's remember that it's still taking place and no one's stopping it. No ones. Some I'm saying some people are excusing themselves from it, but there's no one saying, Hey, what the hell are we doing right now? Back to the book, some of the men who hurried at their tasks shot far more Jews than others who delayed as much as they could. After two rounds, one policeman simply slipped off and stayed among the trucks at the edge of the forest. Another managed to avoid taking turn with the shooters all together and here's a quote from him. It was in no way the case that those who did not want to or could not carry out the shooting of human beings with their own hands could not keep themselves out of the task.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       No strict control was being carried out here. I therefore remained by the arriving trucks and kept myself busy. At the arrival point. In any case, I gave my activity such an appearance. It could not be avoided. That one or another of my comrades noticed that I was not going to the executions to fire away at the victims. They showered me with remarks such as shit head and weakling to express their disgust, but I suffered no consequences for my actions. I must mention here that I was not the only one who kept himself out of participating in the executions. So guys, like I said, had figured out that they can not participate if they don't want to and they're getting called cowards weaklings by the guys that are actually cowards and weak links that are going out and executing people.

Speaker 3:          00:22:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       Back to the book. As with first company, alcohol was made available to the policemen under Drucker and Steinmetz who stayed in the forest and continued shooting as darkness approached at the end of a long summer day and the murders task was still not finished. The shooting became even less organized and more hectic. The forest was so full of dead bodies that it was difficult to find places to make the Jews lie down.

Speaker 3:          00:22:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       So they complete this massacre and they head back to their barracks and here we go back to the book. When the men arrived back at the barracks, they were depressed, angered in bittered and shaken the eight little but drink heavily generous quantities of alcohol were provided. And many of the policeman got quite drunk. Major trap made the rounds trying to console and reassure them. And again, placing the responsibility on higher authorities, placing responsibility on higher authorities. You're not allowed to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       but neither the drink nor traps constellation could wash away the sense of shame and horror that pervaded the barracks.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       So that was the first police action that they did this with. This took place in Poland. It was the first time that the group had deployed to Poland and to give you, you know, when you, we hear what they did. Yeah. You hear some people that that had a hard time with it, but still, like I said, that was a small percentage that was like 10% maybe 15% of people that said, no, I'm not going to do her to that. That he had or, or made themselves busy with other things. Most of the guys just went ahead and did what they were told to do and you think to yourself, okay, well who were these guys? Were they hardened combat veterans from the front line where they were they young sort of brainwashed Nazi youth that were that. That's what they believed in and they just, they, their minds just saw that as the reality that they had to go through with, and this is the strange thing about this book is that that's not what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       That's not who these guys were. And now I'll go to the book to talk about who they actually were. For the most part, reserve reserve police battalion, one o one was now composed of men without any experience of German occupation methods and eastern Europe or for that matter, with the exception of the very oldest tool in world war one, veterans, any kind of military service. Most of these guys aren't even from the military. The battalion consisted of 11 officers, five administrative officials in charge of financial matters relating to play in political, uh, provisioning, lodging, etc. And 486 noncommissioned officers and men. The battalion was divided into three companies, each of approximately 140 men when it full strength. Two companies were commanded by police captains and the third by certain senior reserve lieutenant in that battalion. Each company was divided into three platoons to them commanded by reserve lieutenants and the third by a platoon senior sergeants. So this is kind of a normal military makeup.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       The battalion was commanded by 53 year old, major Wilhelm trap, World War One veteran and recipient of the iron cross first class. Now we know World War One obviously was a brutal war and he's a survivor of that, awarded the Iron Cross first class and fought for Germany and lost. What do you do after the war? Back to the book. After the war, he became a career policemen and rose through the ranks. He had recently been promoted from captain of second company and this was his first battalion command. Though trap had joined the Nazi party in December of 1932 and thus technically qualified as an old party fighter or alter comfort. He had never been taken into the ss or even given an equivalent ss rank in spite of the fact that Himmler and Heidrick consciously tried to merge and intertwined to state and

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       party components of their ss police. Empire trap was clearly not considered ss material. So the, and, and you're going to see this, these guys, I mean, there's a war going on. So why are these guys in a police battalion as opposed to being on the front lines fighting the war? The reason is because they're not quite the right material to go out and fight. And by the way, this is, you know, we're going to get to a point as soon in the war where there's some 14 year old to Hitler youth going out to fight, but these guys aren't, aren't being selected. Back to the book. He was soon to come into conflict with his two captains, both young ss men who even in their testimony more than 20 years later made no attempt to conceal their contempt for their commander as weak unmilitary and unduly interfering in the duties of his officers.

Speaker 4:          00:27:35       So he's got a couple police captains that were a little bit more hardcore. Let me tell you about them. Wolf Gang Hoffman. He was born 19 1416 years old. He was in Hitler youth in 1932 at 18 he was in the SS, graduated from Gymnasium, which is a college preparatory high school in 1934 during the police force in 1936 I entered the Nazi party in 1937 same year completed police training was commissioned as a lieutenant and now he's in the reserves in 1942 reserve police battalion one on one. So He'd, he'd come up through the ranks, you know, as a Nazi, but still, even him, I mean, his formative years, he's born in 1914 so, you know, it's not like it's all he knew. You know, he went from 1914 until what, 1933 1930 so he was 16 years old. He had been formed, you know, lived as a normal German before the Nazi party was around. We're not talking a brainwashed, complete Nazi youth. Same thing with the other guy. Born in 1913 this is Julius Wolff off.

Speaker 4:          00:28:53       Also graduated from Gymnasium, joined the Nazi party in 1933 1936 became ss. So these guys are more, you know, they're more engaged in the whole Nazi party and obviously toeing the line along that now. So that's the two police captains that are in charge of a couple of the companies inside the battalion. Now let's talk a little bit about the men. The men aged generally from 33 to 48 years old. Uh, five were party members. None of them belong to the SS of the back of the book. Of the 32 noncommissioned officers on whom we have information. 22 were party members and seven were in the SS. They

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       ranged in age from 27 to 40 years old. Their average age was 33 and a half. They were not reservists, but rather prewar recruits to the police of the rank and file. So now we're just talking about the troops. The 400 plus troops of the rank and file. The vast majority of war from the Hamburg area, 63% were working class background, but fewer skilled laborers. The majority of them held typical Hamburg working class jobs, dock workers and truck drivers were most numerous, but there are also many warehouse and construction workers, machine operators, seaman and waiters. About 35% were lower middle class, virtually all of them white collar workers, three quarters of them were in sales of some sort. The other one quarter form various office jobs in both government and private sector. The number of under the number of independent artisans and small businesses, businessmen were very small.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       Only a handful, 2% where middleclass profession professionals and very modest ones at that such as drug tests and teachers. The average age of the men was 39 over half were between 37 and 42 a group considered too old for the army, but most heavily conscripted for reserve police duty after September, 1939. So these guys, so the, the men are, are there, they're 30 40 years old, 35 40 years old. These guys is if fully developed, right? They're not, they're not. Yeah. They're not impressionable guys that are just raised inside the nautical too. Cause I mean, let's face it, if you're raised in any, uh, cultish religion scenario, there's a really good chance that if that's what you're going to believe in and you don't understand any other way of thinking. So you can know if you can be a good excuse, but it's understandable how you end up that way.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       Yeah. Back to the book, the men of Reserve Police Battalion were from the lower orders of German society. They'd experienced neither social nord, geographic mobility by virtue of their age. And here's what we're just talking about. By virtue of their age, of course, all went through their formative period in the pre Nazi era era. These were men who had known political standards and moral norms other than those of the Nazis, most came from Hamburg by reputation, one of the least not to find cities in Germany. And the majority came from a social class that had been Anti Nazi in its political culture. These men would not seem to have been a very promising group from which to recruit mass murderers on the half on behalf of Nazi vision of a racial utopia free of Jews. And I think that title list book is ordinary men and that's why, because that's what we're talking about here. Ordinary men. I mean that's, that's, that's about it. Uh, clear cross section of society then you could come up with, I mean you'd come up with the same cross section of society in America once you guys are working as construction workers, waders, truck drivers, dockworkers I mean that's what, that's what people do. Oh, what age are they? They're 35 40 years old. Okay. Is that the group that you think is going to be all you're gonna be able to take out and get him to murder thousands and thousands of people face to face.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       Okay. Now there's a section here is the reflections on the massacre itself and it's talking about this first, like I said, this first thing that took place in Yossef Wolf, it was that their first big action as a group. So here we go. Back to the book at your associate at USF. Amir doesn't, men out of nearly 500 responded instinctively to major traps, offered a step forward and excuse themselves from the impending mass murder. Why was the number of men from the beginning declared themselves who from the beginning declare themselves unwilling to shoot so small? Any kind of offers, an explanation here. It's like the suddenness of it. And if people are kind of surprised and I, I can make sense of that, right? Like if I gave you time to think, if I was like, hey echo, we got to go do this thing right now, you'd probably be like, okay, cool, let's go do it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       But if I said, hey, echo, then we're going to go do something tomorrow, tomorrow, you know, I'll pick you up at 10 30, let me know, well now you have time to contemplate. So he surprised him with it. Uh, there's also, obviously there was peer pressure, right to conform and you know that that's going to play a role in, and we'll talk about that more later. Going back to book, back to the book. Nonetheless, the act of stepping out that morning in Yossef off meant leaving one's comrades and admitting that one was too weak or cowardly. Who would've dared? One policeman declared emphatically to lose face before the assembled troops. If the questions posed to me why I shot with the others in the first place, said another who subsequently asked to be excused after several rounds of killing, I must answer that no one wants to be thought a coward.

Speaker 1:          00:35:01       It was one thing to refuse at the beginning. He added and quite another to try and shoot but not be able to continue another policeman more aware of what truly required courage said quite simply, I was cowardly. So that person gets it. Yeah. You know, these people are that the shooters are saying, hey, I don't want to be a coward, so I wanted to go shoot when actually to stand up and say no. That's what would have taken real moral core courage at these points and obviously these guys knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew it. That's why they're, some of them weren't able to continue.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       Now, speaking of cowardly, here's a little section that I thought you should be pointed out and we were talking about this before the podcast, how people rationalize things. Yeah. Well listen to this rationalization. Perhaps the most astounding rationalization of all was that of a 35 year old metal worker from Bremerhaven quote, I made the effort and it was possible for me to shoot only children. It's so happened that the mothers led the children by the hand. My neighbor then shot the mother and I shot the child that belonged to her because I reasoned with myself that after all, without its mother, the child could not live any longer.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       It was supposed to be so to speak. Soothing to my conscious to release the children, unable to live without their mothers. And actually he goes in here and talks about the German word for release also means to like redeem or save. So this guy's really twisted things up in his head. The dangers of rationalization right there. Good God. Back to the book with few exceptions, the whole question of antisemitism is marked by silence. So this is interesting. This is very interesting. He the, as they, and I should have pointed this out earlier, but this book is based on all these different interviews and witness accounts, mostly of the policemen themselves. Now, and again, I should have pointed this out in the beginning. Of course people are making witness statements and there's all kinds of problems with those, right? They don't remember things correctly. They're trying to protect themselves, they're trying to protect her friends, they're trying to indict certain people and make them look like the bad guy.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       They might be trying to make themselves look good. So there's all these kind of angles that you have to listen to the, you have to understand this with. Yeah. But this is interesting. As they interview these guys back to the book with few exceptions, the whole question of antisemitism is marked by silence. What is clear is that the men's concerned for their standing in the eyes of their comrades was not matched by any sense of human ties with their victims. The Jews stood outside their circle of human obligation and responsibility. Such a polarization between us and them, between one's comrades and the enemy is of course standard in war. And it is indeed. But I guess what surprised me is these guys weren't going in there with thinking themselves, okay, these are the Jews that are doing us wrong and we're going to get our chance. They were just kind of saying, well, they're not us, so we'll do what we have to do. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:38:40       back to the book, even 20 or 25 years later, those who did quit shooting along the way overwhelmingly cited sheer, physical revulsion against what they were doing as the prime motive, but the not express any ethical or political principles behind this revulsion. So That's interesting. These guys were stopping because it made them feel sick and they weren't saying, look, I need, so I am actually, what I've been saying is like, Hey, these guys knew it was wrong. Oh, well they didn't think of it as wrong, or at least this is explaining that they weren't thinking, oh, this is so wrong that their thinking was, I'm going to be sick. Now any rational person can figure out that if something makes you sick to do, then you've got some deep seeded knowledge that what you're doing is wrong. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like that that was like the, the moral part of it, right or wrong and stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:39:39       That wasn't the primary, the primary. It was just, I can't take the blood and guts, man. I can't take the blood and guts. Yeah, you're exactly right. Now, like I said, there's a connection and I don't think he makes it in the book, but in my mind there's a connection. If you're doing something that makes you feel sick. Yeah. It's not just the making you feel sick. That's should be bothering you. What's should be bothering you is the fact that you're doing something that makes you feel sick. There's a reason why it makes you feel sick. There's a reason why human beings feel sick when they're laying down children shooting in the back of the head. There's a reason for that. That's an, that's a, that's a, it's like a, like a survival instinct, right? For your, for your species to carry on. Yeah. You have to make the other members of your species survive.

Speaker 4:          00:40:23       Yeah. Especially if, if, just like, are you saying they were, there wasn't like some enemy kind of feeling towards, you'd be like, girl felt like, oh, we're defending ourselves against this enemy. You know? It wasn't that. It was just that it was essentially the minimum requirements and go against somebody. They're not us and he's going to go into this a little bit, but yeah, you're right. It's not, it's not like there's, yeah. He says, Hey, there's, there's women and children being bombed back in Germany right now, but there's no direct correlation. They're not saying, hey, look, these Jews are fighting us. They're gonna, they're gonna take over. They've got ground in, you know, on our borders. No, not saying that they're actually in total control of the Jews at this point, or they're not total control, but they're getting really close. Getting really close.

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:41:11       Back to the book, the resentment and bitterness in the battalion over what they had been asked to do, and Yosef was shared by virtually everyone, even those who had shot the entire day, the exclamation of one policeman to first sergeant camera of the first company that I'd go crazy if I had to do that again, express the sentiments of many. But few went beyond complaining to extricate themselves from such a possibility. So I said, hey, I bet why never have to do that again. Yeah. But very few of them said actually made a stand the most dramatic back to the book. The most dramatic response again was that of Lieutenant Buckman who asked trapped to have him transferred back to Hamburg and declared that short of a direct personal order from trap, he would not take part in Jewish actions. In the end, he wrote to Hamburg explicitly requesting a recall because he was not suited to certain tasks, alien to the police that were being carried out by his unit.

Speaker 4:          00:42:09       And Poland Buckman had waited, had to wait until November, but his efforts to be transferred were ultimately successful. So there's a guy that, that's one guy that they're citing that actually said, dude, I'm not going to do this now. It was bad enough and did have a bad enough effect on the men. And they complained about it enough that there was some changes. So here we go back to the book and subsequent actions to vital changes were introduced, hence forth with some notable exceptions, adhere to first most of the future operations of the Reserve Po Police Battalion, one o one involved ghetto clearing and deportation not outright massacre on the spot. The policemen were thus relieved of the immediate horror of the killing process, which for deportees from the northern Logan district was carried out in the extermination camp at Treblinka. So now we're not going to, you don't have to go shoot him.

Speaker 4:          00:43:12       You just got to gather them up and get, uh, get them shipped off to the extermination camp. Second while deportation was a horrifying procedure characterized by the terrible coercive violence needed to drive people onto the death trains, as well as the systematic killing of those who could not be marched to the trains. These actions were generally undertaken jointly by units of Reserve Police Battalion, one on one and the tro Tro, Nikki's ss trained auxiliaries from the Soviet territory's recruited from the Russian POW camps and usually assigned to the very worst parts of that ghetto clearing and deportation. So imagine this group, you get a group of thugs that are from Russian pow camps and you say, Oh yeah, we'll let you out of this pow camp and you can come work for us.

Speaker 5:          00:44:02       Mm,

Speaker 4:          00:44:05       yeah. And they're trained by the SS. No, not exactly a friendly crew of guys. In fact, that's like, I can't imagine a worse group of people to come in and come after you. Yeah. Back to the book. The bulk of the killing was to be removed to the extermination camp and the worst of the, on the spot dirty work was to be assigned to the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       This change would prove sufficient to allow the men of Reserve Police Battalion One on one to become accustomed to their participation in the final solution. When the time came to kill again, the policeman did not go crazy. Instead they became increasingly efficient and catalyst executioners. So a couple of changes. It was obviously it was a little too much for them to actually do all the killing themselves. Now they got some people to help them out and or they are just going to gather them up and ship them away and they hold. Now the only plan, a little piece in the, in the, in the, in the machine, right. Just a little piece of machine. So it's a lot easier to detach from what's actually happening. Back to the book that Jews have low Mazi where to be the target of reserve battalion. One on ones. First joint killing action with a unit from the Truckee second company was to provide the bulk of the manpower for the roundup. The primary function of the tourniquets was unit was to provide the shooters, thus alleviating the chief psychological burden the German policemen had experienced at Yoseph.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       And here the, the orders come out, they're going in and now there's another term that comes up. It's, it's, it has to do with the tourniquets, but it's he Weise and it's short. I forget what the German words are, but he always is short for two big German words. One of them that means a willing and one of them that means helper. So they called these, these sort of people that had come to the German side and we're not, they called them [inaudible] and it's like I said, it stands for willing helper. It's like, it's like using, you ever heard the term Spec war for that stance where special warfare, this is the same thing with German to German words that mean willing helper. So here we go. Back to the book, the NCO is, we're told that the, he always from trawniki would do the shooting, so the policeman would for the most part be spared.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       Nonetheless, the roundup was to be conducted as had been done before, which is to say that infants and the old sick and frail who could not be easily taken to the assembly point where to be shot on the spot. So not out of all the killing according to one squad leader, however most children will once again brought to the assembly point as in Yosef, the men encountered not only German Jews but specifically Hamburg Jews. During the clearing action, the Jews quickly filled the school yard and overflowed into the adjoining sports field with some shooting. The roundup was finished in two short hours. So that's it. That's a real sort of a one sentence and if you can just try and imagine what the hell is going on there. These soldiers, these Russian soldiers, these German soldiers are coming in and rounding people up. They're using violence, shooting people to get all the Jews into the school yard.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       This is a nightmare scenario that they, that you know, he puts into a sentence here, back to the book, the 1700 Jews of Lumosity, we're then forced to sit and wait. A group of 60 to 70 young men were selected out, given shovels and spades loaded onto trucks and driven to the woods. Several of the young Jews jumped from the moving trucks and made good their escape. Another attack to German corporal, the battalion boxing championing champion who promptly knocked his desperate assailant senseless in the woods. The Jews were set to digging a mass grave back in low Mazi. The weight of the doom Jews and their police guard stretched into hours. Suddenly a contingent of 50 he weaves from [inaudible] marched into town, led by German ss officer.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       I can still remember it exactly. One policeman testified that immediately after the arrival of these Trani keys took a break. After their arrival, the tourniquets took a break. I saw that in addition to food, they also took out bottles of vodka out of their packs and drank from them, the SS officer and Nad. This is a guy that arrived on the scene. Now grenade began drinking heavily as well. The other NCO smelled of alcohol, but unlike the two commanders were not visibly drunk. So these guys are are drinking vodka and they know what they're about to have to go do. Now we're talking about this guy, lieutenant nade. Lieutenant Nade was a Nazi by conviction and an anti Semite. He was also unpredictable, affable, and approachable at times of brutal and vicious at others.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       And here's an eyewitness account from one of those soldiers back to the book. Even before the shooting began. First Lieutenant Nade had personally picked out some 20 to 25 elderly Jews. They were exclusively men with full beards. Nade made the old men crawl on the ground in the area before the grave, before he gave them the order to crawl. They had to undress while the totally naked jewel Jews crawled, first lieutenant made scream to those around where my noncommissioned officers, don't you have any clubs yet? The noncommissioned officers went to the edge of the forest, fetched themselves clubs, and vigorously beat the Jews with them.

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       They

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       get the mass grave dug, and here we go. Immediately. Large numbers of Jews were driven into the grave and the, he always took their position on the walls that had been thrown up. From there, they shot the victims. As the shooting continued, the grave began to fill. The Jews who followed, had to climb on and later, later even clamber over those shot earlier because the grave was filled with corpses almost to the edge. The ncls decided that the execution should continue with two firing squads on opposite sides of the grave. The Jews were forced to lie down in rows alongside each other, each side of the grave and were shot by the police standing on the opposite wall. Men from all three platoons were formed into squads of eight to 10 and were relieved by others in a rotation after five or six shots. After about two hours, the he weaves were ry roused from their stupor and resumed shooting in place that Joe and policemen, the shooting was finished around 7:00 PM and the work Jews who had been kept aside covered the grave. The work Jews were then shot as well. The thin covering of the overfill grave continued to move.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       So you got people that are not dead, that are now buried alive and there was a part that I didn't cover. Basically the, he always got too drunk to continue on and the the police had to go and take their place for awhile and then they kind of recovered. But this is this, this is the situation that we're talking about. Just a complete nightmare back to the book. One other factor sharply distinguished at low Mazi from Yosef wove and may well have been yet another kind of psychological relief for the men, namely and this is important from from a psychological and from a leadership perspective. One, so I'm going back through to get one other factor. Ma sharply distinguished low Mazi from Yosef OEF and may well have been yet another kind of psychological relief for the men. Namely this time they did not bear the burden of choice that trap had offered them so starkly on the occasion of the first massacre. No chance to step out

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       was given to those who did not feel up to the shooting. No one systematically excused. Those who were visibly too shaken to continue. Everyone assigned to the firing squad took his turn as ordered. Therefore, those who shot did not have to live with clear awareness that they had what they had done had been unavoidable. So that's a big difference. The big difference. And from a leadership perspective, that's something that I've, I've actually talked about this before. Um, it's interesting. When we were in Ramadi, you know, we tasking at bruiser, we kind of decided what we were going to do, right. You know, we, we weren't getting told go do this. And so everything that we did, we did because we decided that it was, we could mitigate the risk and we could take as good a good operation and we could, there was an area that we could do a good job in.

Speaker 4:          00:54:27       So we had a lot of control over our fate and that's, that's actually can be psychologically heavier because if something goes wrong, it's all, it's all on you as the leader. Yeah. Whereas the leadership team or even as the guys that are on the front leg, the point man, the point man selecting his own, you know, going down to the front row, the frontline troops, the point man is selecting the route. If he hits an IED, sure you know it's, it's the enemy's fault. But, but he's thinking to himself to why did I choose that route? Now the army, they did have some control but they had more often than not, they'd be getting told to, hey you're going to go on a patrol down this road or hey, you're going to go hit this building. So they were relieved oftentimes have that freedom of choice. Yeah. So the freedom of choice can be a little bit of a burden. And so what happened here was the freedom of choice was taken away and that burden was there for taking my look. You're going to get shut up and do this. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause you have like if you have that choice like in back to the part where the 12 guys stepped up. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       And Yeah, we can look at it as the guys who stepped out and have more courage because they're are not essentially, there's two things to be kind of scared of or have courage against. Right. One is, okay, I'm not scared to kill these people. Pulled the trigger, you know, and then there's, I'm not scared to go against the norms. Yeah. Which is bigger kind of thing or much harder. Yeah. And that, and you have the choice, which one are you going to do? You know, if they give you the choice, I'll key, you can step out if you want. What are you going to do? And everyone's looking at you like, okay, are you going to, I wonder what the tipping point would have been in other words, like he chose to do it. No. If, if 10 people, but then what if it was 30?

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       Yeah. What if it was 40? And you see that anytime in a crowd. Yeah. You've seen that stupid, uh, video where there's like one guy, he's dancing by himself and it's, it's like some viral videos that kind of old school, I don't know, but it's a stupid viral video. You don't have to go and watch it yourself, but I'll explain what happens. There's a guy there like some kind of a concerts. I'm kind of an outdoor concert. There's a guy dancing by himself. Yeah. He's dancing by himself for a long time and that's why I saw it. But his company was talking about like group or they use this as an, as an example of group psychology. The guys dancing by himself for a long time. And what they're actually saying is that the person that has the courage is, is actually the second person that joins him.

Speaker 4:          00:57:02       Uh, so anyways, the one person dancing is dancing by himself for several minutes. Yeah. Then another port person joins him. Once the other person joins him, then all of a sudden five people and then it's 20 people. And then the next thing you know, everyone is dancing. And I wonder what the tipping point would have been here. You know, you get 10 people out of 500 that wasn't enough. Yeah. But you know what? If all of a sudden 15 2030 40 people would have stepped forward, then all of a sudden does it just everyone says, hey, we're not doing this.

Speaker 6:          00:57:37       Yeah. Yeah. I think if they knew, I wonder if they knew for sure that there wasn't going to, cause some guys were getting called names.

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       Well yeah, and I think it was the suddenness that that he talked about in the book. You know, if, if you'd have said, okay, listen tomorrow. Yeah, we're going to do, where do you want to kill a bunch of women and children? Point blank range in the woods. Yeah. You're going to have to shoot them all.

Speaker 6:          00:57:56       Yeah. Let me know if you're down. Yeah. And then if you had done that, but then giving them hours to sit there and think about it and then the next guy's like, hey, what are you going to do with it? Then the, then it may have spread, but that peer pressure was hardcore, hardcore, so that, yes, especially with, like I said, they're scared of the authority. It's like, okay, the tipping point is going to be more for sure. But like, you know, you do something like, you know, your example or, or year you ever see, you know, you see this all the time where you say you're on stage, you say something kind of cool not, you know, it's not the end of your presentation. You say something kind of cool and then one guy starts clapping and then everyone starts clapping. Right. You know, it's kind of that thing where this is no consequence to clapping.

Speaker 6:          00:58:37       So it's like, all right, oh shoot, that's what we're doing. Okay. I, I all clap, I feel good about clapping, I'm going to do it, you know, kind of thing. There's no real resistance. So the tipping point is going to be one guy. That's the tipping point. But you get something where there's going to be, there might be some resistance, some risk, you know, of, of pain or you know, whatever kind of punishment. Yeah. The tipping point's going to be more, I think. Yeah. I wonder what that is man. Because it's not like, like the Nazi regime was very understanding. No, no, no, no. I mean, no,

Speaker 4:          00:59:07       you know, pretty much you can say that most military units aren't very understanding. Uh, you know, there's, there's going to be a certain level of like Adt, there's discipline in place for a region reason and you can get, you know, I talk about all the time, you know, I said, look, you can't just order people to do things. It only lasts for so long. Yeah. But how long did it need to last year? It only needed the last night. If you can get everyone to do what you need them to do tonight, you know, we'll, okay, we got through our mission and now I'll let them, you know, what did he do? He actually let them go get drunk and you know, talk to them and, and built up some more leadership capital cause he expended, he expended it a bunch of his leadership capital to get this mission done and now he's got to rebuild it and read, kind of get developed this relationship again with the guys and, and bring in some other changes.

Speaker 4:          00:59:57       Hey look, we're not gonna do all the killing this time. So yeah, it's crazy. It's, I thought it was pretty surprising and I'd be kind of a few kind of cycle saying refreshing to know that they didn't get that much punishment aside from some name calling. You know, cause you don't think of it like that. I think when you, when you think of that like all this in it, you know the guy you're saying you're saying, yeah people, there you go. Yeah. All that guy was named called. Yeah. And that's another thing that they proud that that might've changed the tipping point when they realized, you know, that those guys have stepped forward. They might've thought they get put in the ditch because there are some, and I didn't cover this part, but there's, there's definitely some parts where guys like, Hey, we'll put you in the ditch that's actually get up here and do your job. Yeah, but I think that reveals the discomfort of the overall situation. Yet they weren't looking at their buddy saying, no, I'm going to kill you now. They were like, Hey, we're actually, I kind of agree with you, but you just stay over there and we'll go forward.

Speaker 4:          01:00:57       Okay. So the next situation that they get into are these deportations to Treblinka death camp. And here we go back to the book. While the policeman did not know precisely where the Jews were being sent or what was being done with them, it was all clear and well known to all of us as Heinrich Steinmetz admitted that for the Jews effected these deportations meant the path to death. We suspected that they would be killed in some sort of camp spared. Direct participation in the killing, the men of Reserve Police Battalion one-on-one seem scary to have been disturbed by this awareness. Even though there were more victims in the deportations than in Josefa or low mousay massacres combined out of sight was truly out of mind. So now they're in this mode of they're just doing the deportations. Now I say just doing the deportations and I don't want to make that sound like it wasn't a brutal, vicious exercise that they were doing. Here we go back to the book driven by the he always and policemen, thousands of Jews steamed into the marketplace, streamed in the marketplace here. They had to sit or squat without moving or getting up. As the hours passed on this very hot August of the late summer heatwave, many Jews

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       fainted and collapsed. Moreover, beating and shooting continued in the marketplace, and I don't know if I quoted this in here or if I'll get to it, but these guys, they, they're shooting people. They also bring out whips, so they're whipping people. It's brutal. Back to the book. One final horror was reserved to the end for the train. Cars now had to be loaded while the he wheeze and security police packed 120 to 140 Jews into each car. The reserve policemen stood guard and observed as one remembered when it didn't go well. They made use of writing, whips and guns. The loading was simply frightful. There was an unearthly cry from these poor people because 10 or 20 cars were being loaded simultaneously. The entire freight train was dreadfully long. One could not see all of it. It may have been 50 to 60 cars, if not more. And after a car was loaded, the doors were closed and nailed shut. Once all the cars were sealed, the men of reserved police battalion one-on-one quickly departed without waiting to see the train pull away.

Speaker 1:          01:03:37       These guys did their little part of the job and they're gonna walk away now. But yeah, it's, it's an, again, it's a nightmare scenario. Continuing on. Shortly before the deportation program resumed in northern security zone reserve police battalion one-on-one was involved in several more mass shootings. So there's a couple of times that they don't get the help that they had before going back to the book without the experience to help of the, he always will haul off, organize the executions along the lines of Yosef, of of the Osa folks shooting the groups of 20 to 30 Jews which had been marched out of town. It's succession to gravel pits were turned over to an equal number of Peter's in year x commandos. Thus, each policemen once again faced the individual Jew he was going to shoot.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       The Jews were not forced to undress, nor was there a collection of valuables. There was also no selection for Labor. All the Jews, regardless of age and sex were to be shot. So you know, in the earlier ones they were stripping him down and collecting their valuables and not even doing that. And I bet they're not doing that because when you do that, you're getting some kind of interaction. You're seeing their personal items and they didn't want any of that. Just take them out and shoot him. Easiest psychological way to do it. Back to the book. The policemen and the shooting commandos marched their juice to the crest of one of the mountains of waste material. The area of the gravel pits, the victims were lined up facing a six foot drop from a short distance behind the policemen fired on order into the next of the Jews. The body's tumbled over the edge following each round. The next group of Jews was brought up to the same spot and thus had to look down at the growing pile of corpses of their family and friends before they were shot in turn. Only after a number of rounds did the shooters change sites.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       All right. Here's some more deportation operations. They're back to doing deportations back to the book, but even the most unfettered violence could not overcome the shortage of train cars and when the doors were finally forced, shot about 150 Jews, mostly women and children, but also some men remained made. This was that same lieutenant sadist summon Drucker and told him to take these Jews to the cemetery. At the cemetery entrance. The policemen chased away the eager spectators and waited until first Sergeant Austin arrived in a truck with a supply of vodka for the shooters. Oschman turn to one of his men who had hitherto avoided shooting and chided him drink up. Now Pfeiffer, you're in fort this time because the Judases must be shot. You've gotten yourself out of it so far, but now you must go to it. An execution squad of about 20 men were sent into the cemetery. The Jews were brought in groups of 20 men first and then women and children. They were first to lie down near the cemetery wall and then shot from behind the neck. Each policemen fired seven or eight times at the cemetery gate, one do spring at Drucker with a syringe, but was quickly subdued. The other Jews sat quietly awaiting their fate. Even after the shooting began. They were quite emaciated and looked half starved to death. One guard remembered.

Speaker 3:          01:07:53       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:07:57       the it, it's, it's covered in here. Not In the kind of detail we should cover it, but you know, these Jews that were now getting rounded up, they were already in most of the, well in some of the case in the book, they were in these

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       ghettos, Jewish ghettos, like they had been forced into these ghettos there. Now just living, they're starving, but they're living and, and then the Germans didn't, no more Jews. They want of the areas, I think the word was Juden free was like free of Jews. So now even these people, and by the way, there were some, some of the Germans that complained like, Hey, those are my laborers. You can't come my laborers now we're killing everyone. So even again, it's not like this is an enemy with a threat. These people were now completely subdued living in these, in these call them guest ghettos. They're like prison ghettos. They're living in there. They've no fret to anybody, but they round them up, take them out and kill them.

Speaker 4:          01:09:04       Now, one of the interesting points that they bring up in the book, and I want to cover the whole thing, but it's worth mentioning, is that this Guy Hoffman, one of the, well it can, one of the captains, he has this strange stomach illness like he gets upset to his stomach, so here we go. He misses some of the actions, or at least he's not their president where the executions are taking place and whatnot and it just painted a picture of the kind of leader that he is. So going back to the book uniformly, Hoffman's men offered a different perspective, meaning it's not just like Yo, he's sick to his stomach and blah, blah blah. By their UBS observation, his alleged bouts of stomach cramps, confining him safely to bed coincided all to consistently with company actions that might involve either unpleasantness or danger. It became common for the men to predict upon hearing the night before a pending action that the company chief would be bedridden in the morning.

Speaker 4:          01:10:08       Hoffman's behavior rankled as men even more because of too aggravating factors. First, he'd always been strict and on approachable. A typical base officer who liked his white collar and gloves wore is ss in Sydney on his uniform and demanded considerable difference. So that's, that's the one thing you heard about the guy. This is just paint the worst picture of just such a horrible human being. He loves wearing his rank. He loves being the guy, a base officer. Now there's, there's a, a term for that. They have, I think we made up in the, not we, but the US current war fighting soldiers and marines. It's a far bit Bob Fob. So you get something called a forward operating base overseas and the forwarding on an operating basis can actually be, you know, they're pretty nice there. They're relatively secure. And so the fob it right is the leader that just wants to stay on the fob. They didn't want to go out.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       So this guys, but of course the fob, it's always running around, you know, wanting to be respected and demanding, respect, demanding deference of this guy's a far bit. The other thing is, and this is very typical of this kind of wretched human back to the book. Second Hoffman tried to compensate for his immobility by intensified supervision of his subordinates, so he's not around, but he's, he's going to be more of a jerk and impose himself more onto the, onto the men. Now they're continuing with a another, another ghetto that had to be cleared back to the book. By October, the order was for real placards announced that all Jews who did not go to the ghettos would be shot. The shooting order was made part of regular company instructions to the men and given repeatedly, especially before they were sent on patrol. No one could be left in any doubt that not a single Jew was to remain alive in the battalion security zone.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       In official jargon, the battalion made forest patrols for suspects as the surviving Jews were to be tracked down and shot like animals. However, the men of reserved police battalion one-on-one unofficially dub this phase of the final solution. The Jew hunt that you hunt took many forms, most spectacular or two battalion sweeps and here's some George Leffler of third company talking about that. What those sweeps were like back to the book. We were told that there were many Jews hiding in the forest. We therefore searched through the woods and a skirmish line, but we could find nothing because the Jews were obviously well hidden. We combed the woods the second time. Only then could we discover individual chimney pipe sticking out of the earth. We discovered that Jews had hidden themselves in underground bunkers. Here they were hauled out with some resistance and only one monk or some of the comrades climbed down into this bunker and hauled the Jews out. The Jews were then shot on the spot. The Jews had to lie face down on the ground and were killed by a neck shot. Who is in the firing squad? I don't remember. I think it was simply a case where the men standing nearby were ordered to shoot them. Some 50 Jews were shot including men and women of all ages because entire families that hidden themselves, they're shooting took place quite publicly. No cordon was formed at all for a number of polls from [inaudible]. We're standing directly by the shooting site. They were then ordered presumably by Hoffman

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       to bury the Jews who had been shot in a half to finish bunker. So again, you've got some of the Jews had been consolidated in these ghettos and now there anyone that's not any Jew, that's not the ghetto, they're out hunting them. Here's another version of it. In cases where the farm yard and the Jewish lodgings could be reached quickly, I drove into the farm yard at high speed and the police spring out in immediately rushed to the Jewish lodgings than all the Jews. President at the time were driven out and shot in the farm yard near a haystack potato pit or dung heap. The victims were almost always naked and were shot in the neck where while lying on the ground,

Speaker 3:          01:14:52       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:14:58       now, even as this was taking place, there's still people that are trying to avoid the shooting. Back to the book, the tactic of keeping one's distance was invoked by Heinrich Feucht to explain how he avoided shooting on all, but one occasion. One always had a certain freedom of movement of a few meters. And from experience I noticed very quickly that the platoon leader almost always chose the people standing next to him. I, those always attempted to take position as far as possible from the center of events. Others likewise sought to avoid shooting by staying in the background. So there's still guys that are not, no, they're trying, they're doing their best not to participate again or they do anything to stop it. No, but this, this was a great kind of a wrap on the, on the g one and what this was like back to the book that you hunt was not a brief episode. It was a tenacious remorseless ongoing campaign in which the hunters tracked down and killed their prey in direct and personal confrontation. There was not a passing phase, but an existential condition of constant readiness and intention to kill every last Jew who could be found.

Speaker 4:          01:16:29       Now we're good to cover this last massacre that took place. And Jews had been sent from a two to a prison camp to be executed and and they were rounded up, I think it was a place called the lake lay back and they were sent to be executed and the police battalion is now acting as kind of guards and accessories to this too, to make sure that the executions, these mass executions take place correctly. Going back to the book as the pass between the chain

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       of reserve policemen into the camp music blared from two loudspeaker trucks, despite the attempt to drown out other noise, the sound of steady gunfire could be heard from the camp. The Jews were taken to the last row of barracks where they undressed arms raised, hands clasped behind their next totally naked. They were led in groups from the barracks through a hole cut in the fence to the trenches that had been dug behind the camp. This route was guarded by men from the Reserve Police Battalion one-on-one stationed only 10 meters from the graves. Heinrich Boll cult of first company witnessed the killing procedure quote. From my position. I could now observe how the Jews were driven naked from the barracks by other members of our battalion. The shooters of the execution commandos who sat on the edge of the graves directly in front of me were members of the SD and the SSD is like the SS Intel Intelligence Group. The SD, some distance behind each shooter stood several other SD men who constantly kept the magazines of the submachine guns filled and handed them to each shooter.

Speaker 1:          01:18:29       A number of shooters were assigned to each grave. Today I can no longer provide details about the number of graves. It is possible that there were many such graves were shooting took place simultaneously. I definitely remember that the naked Jews who are driven directly into the graves and forced to lie down quite precisely on top of those who had been shot before them, the shooter than fired off a burst at these prone victims. How long the action lasted. I can no longer say with certainty. Presumably it lasted the entire day because I remember that I was relieved once from my post.

Speaker 1:          01:19:11       I can give no details about the number of victims, but there were an awful lot of them. It's it's, it's almost incomprehensible to imagine that you're one of these Jews getting forced. You're naked. Lay down, go into this pit, lay down on top of those other people that were just shot so you can be shot to another witness. Martin Detmold quote, because I was a group leader in could move about more freely. I went once directly to the execution site and saw how the newly arriving Jews had to lie down on those already shot. They were then likewise shot with burst from submachine guns. The SD men took care of that. The Jews were shot in such a way that there were inclines in the piles of corpses enabling the newcomers to lie down on the corpses piled as much as three meters high. The whole business was the most gruesome I have ever seen in my life because I was frequently able to see that after a burst of a burst had been fired, the Jews were only wounded in those still living. We're more or less buried alive beneath the corpses of those shot later without the wounded being given. So called the mercy shots. I remember that from out of the pile of corpses. The SS men were cursed by the wounded.

Speaker 2:          01:20:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       and that was sort of the final participation of one on one battalion. And here we get to there how it kind of wrapped up at the conclusion of the ernt fest massacres. The district of Lublin was for all practical purposes, Utan free free of Jews, the murderous participation of Reserve Battalion Reserve Police Battalion One on one in the final solution came to an end with a conservative estimate of 6,500 Jewish shot during earlier actions like those that Yosef Oaf and low Mazi and 1000 shot during the Jew hunts in a minimum estimate of three thousand thirty thousand five hundred juice shot at [inaudible] and Pony Trois. The battalion had participated in the direct shooting deaths of at least 38,000 Jews with the death camp deportation of at least 3000 Jews from Mites, Iraq. In early May, 1943 the number of Jews they had placed on trains to drew Blanka had risen to 45,004 battalion of less than 500 men. The ultimate body count was at least 83,000 Jews.

Speaker 2:          01:22:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       unbelievable. And here he asked the question back to the book of why did most men and reserve police battalion one-on-one become killers while only a minority of perhaps 10% and certainly no more than 20% did not. A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain such behavior. Wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation, and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators careerism obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological, Indra, indoctrination and conformity. These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but none without qualifications or he's trying to now figure out why these people did what they did. And those, that's a list of all the kinds of excuses or reasons I should say of why these men behave this way. Talks a little bit about overall kind of war crimes here. Back to the book, many of the most notorious wartime atrocities, the Japanese rampage through Manila, the American slaughter of prisoners and mutilation of corpses on many of the Pacific islands and the massacre at me lie involved the kind of battlefield frenzy soldiers who inert and who were a nerd to violence numb to the taking of human life.

Speaker 1:          01:24:08       They embittered over their own casualties and frustrated by the tenacity of an insidious and seemingly inhuman enemy sometimes exploded and at other times grimly resolved to have their revenge at first opportunity. So that's one type of, for me, what's that called when you like non premeditated murder, right? Like just, you know the guy comes home and his wife's with some other guy and boom, he goes, he goes, battlefield frenzy. Yeah. That's one kind. Now we talk about this premeditated back to the book, other kinds of atrocity, lacking the immediacy of the battlefield frenzy and fully expressing official government policy decidedly weren't standard operating procedures firebombing of German, Japanese cities, the enslavement of and murderous maltreatment of foreign laborers in German camps, in factories or along the cm Burma Railroad, the reprisal shooting of a 100 civilians for every German soldier killed by partisan attack and Unical Slavia or elsewhere in eastern Europe. These were not the spontaneous explosions or cruel revenge of brutalized men, but the methodical executed policies of government.

Speaker 1:          01:25:27       Both kinds of atrocities occur in the brutalizing context of war, but the men who carry out atrocity by policy aren't in a different state of mind. They act not out of frenzy, bitterness and frustration, but with calculation, clearly the men of Reserve Police Battalion One on one and implementing the systematic Nazi policy of exterminating European Jewry belong in the second category except for a few of the oldest men who were veterans of World War One in a few [inaudible] who had been transferred from Poland to Poland from Russia. The men in the battalion had not seen battle or encountered a deadly enemy. Most of them had not fired a shot in anger or even been fired upon much less lost comrades in fighting at their side. Voss. Wartime brutalization through prior combat, was not an immediate experience directly influencing the policemen's behavior add Yoseph of once the killing began.

Speaker 1:          01:26:27       However, the men became increasingly brutalized as in combat. The horrors of initial of the initial encounter eventually became routine and the killing became premise progressively easier in a sense. In this sense, brutalization was not the cause, but the effect of the men's behavior. So he's kind of saying, look like what you said, these guys aren't fighting an enemy. They hadn't lost their buddy, they're not revet. You know, they're not avenging their buddy that got killed next to them blown up by an IED and now they're going to take it out on, on this group that they capture. And I like that

Speaker 1:          01:27:07       back to the book. As John Dour has observed the dehumanization of the other contributed immeasurably to the psychological distancing that facilitated killing, distancing, not frenzy. And brutalization is one of the keys to the behavior of the reserve position. Police Battalion, one-on-one war and negative racial stereotyping or to mutually reinforcing factors in this distancing. So in order to kill these people, you've got to distance yourself from them. You can't, you can't see them as human. You can't see them as people. Many scholars of the Holocaust, especially Raul Hilberg, have emphasized the bureaucratic and administrative aspects of the destruction process. This is very interesting. This approach emphasizes the degree to which modern bureaucratic life fosters a functional and physical distancing in the same way that war and negative racial stereotype promote a psychological distancing between perpetrator and victim. So you formed this bureaucratic machine that you're only a little piece of it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:13       Your all you're doing is collecting people. Are you doing just putting me on trains? You're not killing anybody. Yeah, you're, all you're doing is rounding them up. All you're doing is guarding as they're getting pushed down to the, into the graves. That's not you. Yeah. It's a big bureaucratic machine. You're not, you're just a little piece of it. Back to the book. Indeed. Many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust were so called desk murderers who's rolled in. The mass extermination was greatly facilitated by the bureaucratic nature of their participation. Their drops frequently consistent of tiny steps in the overall killing process and they performed them in routine manner, never seeing the victims at their actions affected segmented routine, ISED and depersonalized the job of the bureaucratic, the bureaucratic or specialist, whether it involved confiscating scheduling trains, drafting legislation, sending telegrams are compiling less lists could be performed without confronting them. Reality of mass murder.

Speaker 1:          01:29:13       Such a luxury of course was not enjoyed by the men of reserve police battalion, one o one who were quite literally saturated in the blood of victim shot at point blank range. No one confronted the reality of mass murder more directly than the men in the woods of Yosef of segmentation and routinization. The depersonalizing aspects of the bureau bureaucratic, the bureaucratic caused killing cannot explain the battalions initial behavior there. So again, he's saying, look, that makes sense. You turn this into a big bureaucratic thing, but that's not what happened here with these guys. The facilitating psychological effect of a division of labor for the killing process was not totally negligible. However. So then he talks about the fact that they did make those adjustments and take the killing out of their hands somewhat and that did make it easier for them. Now he talks about, you know, one of the things that he mentioned early on and why this happened. He talks about the special selection of the right people.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       Well that doesn't really hold true either because here we go back to the book. The case for special selection of officers is even more difficult to make by SS standards. Major trap was a patriotic German, but traditionally and overly sentimental what and not Nazi Germany was scornfully considered both weak and reactionary. So you can't say it was the selection of people. And we already talked about all the different types of normal people that were doing this. They, they didn't, they didn't pull some truck driver in Hamburg out and said this, that's 38 years old and say this guy's going to be the perfect Miletich. They didn't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:30:57       Back to the book reserve. Police battalion was not sent to Lublin to murder Jews because it was composed of men specifically selected or dean particularly suited for the task. On the contrary, the battalion was the dregs of the manpower pool available at that stage of war. It was employed to kill Jews because it was the only kind of unit available for such behind the line duties. Many studies of Nazi killer suggested a different kind of selection, namely self selection to the party and the ss by an usually violence prone people. Shortly after the war, Theodore Adorno and many others and others developed the notion that there's the, uh, an authority authoritarian personality. So they started looking at the, there's certain people that have that, that are susceptible to having this type of personality. They made up something called the f scale, which is, is like your propensity to have a authoritarian

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       personality. Here's some of the ingredients there. Back to book of rigid adherence to conventional values. Submissiveness to authoritary the to authority figures, aggressiveness toward outgroups, opposition to introspection, reflection and creativity. A tendency to superstition in stereotyping, preoccupation with power and toughness. Destructiveness and cynicism. So these are the kinds of things that they're saying that these types of personalities would become Nazis because that's the type of personality they have. There's another kind of kind of to make this as simple as possible. A guy named Zygmunt Bauman has summed up the, this approach as follows. Nazi-Ism was cruel because Nazis were cruel and the Nazis were cruel because crew people tended to become Nazis. Again, these are theories but I don't think you can apply that to a truck driver from Hamburg that got row that got drafted. They didn't even sell self select for they got drafted.

Speaker 4:          01:33:07       Yup. Told, okay, you need to be in the, in the army here. Yeah, we're in the police battalion. It's almost like, it's not necessarily, you know, a person being a truck driver is like, uh, you know this, this exclusionary occupation. It's more like just cause they're a truck driver. It just doesn't mean anything. It's like that's not enough factor. The truck driver. Now anything with Eddie, when they talked about all these people from Hamburg, anything that they talked about, none of those. It's not like we got a bunch of guys that were uh, that worked at a slaughter house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going to recruit all these people from a slaughterhouse. No, we didn't recruit hunters. We didn't know. They didn't recruit, um, football players because they're aggressive. No, just rate. It was just random. Any job. And they showed up there. So we know basically what I'm getting out of this is he saying like, no, it's like you can't really say it's that either. Right? Because it's just a waiter in a salesperson. But at the same time the guy who is a waiter could have these other qualities, you know, like how you're talking. Yeah. But you take 500 people from Hamburg between the ages of 35 and 40. You're not going to find that. It's like all these guys had those kind of fascist qualities boundman right. Not Happening. Yeah, man. That's great.

Speaker 4:          01:34:28       Some people become, this is Eric or sorry. Evan Staab accepts the notion that some people become perpetrators as a result of their personality. They are self selected and he says that under particular circumstances, most people have a capacity for extreme violence and the destruction of human life. It's an interesting one. Under certain circumstances, everyone has a propensity for violence. I'm sure there's that would argue that in all different directions. But you know, you take a a middle aged woman that's never been in a fistfight before and you have somebody attack her child that's going to kill or harm their child and they can see it propensity for violence and from a lot of them. Yeah, yeah. Maybe even a v You know what? 99%, I'm going to say 99% I'll go with that too. Yeah. Yeah. 99% if you're, if it's a middle aged woman who has someone that's about to severely hurt or kill their child and their way to stop it is with a pistol. Right. My assessment is we're going to 99%.

Speaker 6:          01:35:40       Yeah. Of that perpetrators getting guild like with, with um, specific effort towards like the violent part of it. You know, like, um, you know, I don't, I'm not saying not a movie necessarily, but you know, that'll think, well let's say imagine a scenario like that where the lady's gonna shoot this guy because the guy is attacking the kid or something. It won't be like, Oh, let me do the bare minimum force, you know, dish to eliminate the threat. She's probably going to be kind of shows the overboard killing that guy going to kill him extra. Yeah. Yeah. Because that's kind of the violence coming out of someone. It's one thing to do it because I'm scared and oh my gosh, get away from me kind of thing. That's not violence. Yeah. So it's, that's really the question when you consider a million middle aged girl, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:36:31       Yeah. Having a propensity provider, I don't think she's going to do extra. I think she's going to kill him and go and go grab her kid and make sure a kid safe. Right. I don't see this extra level, you know, desecration of the body or anything like that. I just say, Hey, I'm going to say make my kids safe. Yeah. So you're saying the propensity for violence in that case is just the mere act of killing the guy. Yeah. Well yeah, that's that's, that's it.

Speaker 6:          01:36:55       Yeah. You know, like I'm thinking of a movie,

Speaker 4:          01:37:01       whatever reason, cause that's all, that's all your brain is filled with television in general. But you know, the girl, she's like scared. It's all done out of fear, you know? And sure. It's almost like the violence is just happenstance. It's not her propensity for violence necessarily, but it's just the money. But I'm just saying if you set up an experiment yes. Where you took a middle aged group of women had children. Yeah. Like when you put them in a scenario where, you know, w was either the, either the kid dies or they kill the perpetrator. Right. You know, not like a, hey, I might be able to debate them out of it. Know that the ax is in the air. It's going to be swung down on the kid. Right, right. You have to press this button to go to kill that guy. We're violence. Violence is a choice. Yeah. I think the prevents that. He's going to be 99, and yeah, I'm going to go even higher. Agree.

Speaker 4:          01:37:50       So this then he gets into, um, some of these real experiments, kind of sociological experiments. One of them is the Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment. I'm sure you've heard of that. Everyone's heard of that where they basically take people and divide them up and just randomly, and actually I didn't know this cause I never did any deep research on the study, but they kind of do a prescreening to make sure that there's no extreme personalities. Everyone that everyone knows. Like, I mean what, however you could, you could frame the word normal. The people that participate in the experiment or just like normal people, they didn't have any extreme personalities. Well those kind of semi normal people, they put them in that prison experiment. And sure enough, some people were made guards, some people were made prisoners and they had to get him to do certain things.

Speaker 4:          01:38:42       And there's a certain number. I mean it didn't take long for the guards. I think it took six days. Some of the guards turn sadistic evil. Right? Uh, and here we go back to the book most dramatic and distressing to us was the observation of the ease with which sadistic behavior could be elicited in individuals who are not sadistic types. The prison situation alone, Zimbardo concluded was a sufficient condition to produce apparent antisocial behavior. That's from the gardens from the guards. So this is pretty scary that another fact here pointed out about that only to I less than 20% emerged as good guards who did not punish prisoners even as they end even did small favor from. So those numbers are pretty in line with this really small percentage of people that just, they're just good people, right? It's only 10 to 20% of actual good people. How's that make you feel about the human race and not real good?

Speaker 4:          01:39:44       Not real good. All right. Another thing put out here, back to the book, among the perpetrators, of course, orders have traditionally been most frequently cited explanation for their own behavior. So remember orders, orders, orders were orders and no one in such a political climate could be expected. Disobey them. They insisted this is the, this is the guards. I mean, sorry, this is the the police to battalion saying, look, we're getting order to do the stuff we were just following orders. We hear that all the time. Disobedience surely meant the concentration camp if not immediate execution possibly for their families as well. So they're saying, look, if we would, we would ended up in the concentration camps ourselves if this didn't happen. Now he pointed this out back to the book. There is a general problem with this explanation. However, quite simply in the past 45 years, no defense attorney or defendant in any of the hundreds of postwar trials has been able to document a single case in which refusal to obey an order to kill on armed civilians resulted in the allegedly inevitable Dyer punishment.

Speaker 4:          01:40:52       So no precedent for that. Now I, I, I don't think that these guys out there in the battalion are sitting there thinking about this with like legal perspectives. So actually there, there's no precedent for, you know, punishment being carried out on people that have been on. I think that's a stretch. I think that's a stretch when you're talking about like maybe someone contemplating using these guys that were saying I couldn't refuse the orders cause I would get punished. And he's saying that there's no precedent that you actually will get the severe punishment. But how has the, you know when someone out in the field going to know that that's a, that's a precedent. You don't, you just think I don't want to get in trouble. Yeah. You're not thinking about the time you remember the guy that you've heard of getting killed. Yeah. You're not thinking of that. You're thinking about, you're not even more so you're not thinking about the fact that you've never heard of that before. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:41:50       all right. Now, so we're talking about obedience of orders and here we go back to the book. A full obedience to orders out of fear of dire punishment is not a valid explanation. What about obedience to authority in the more general sense used by Stanley Milgrim deference simply as a product of socialization and evolution, a deeply ingrained behavior tendency to comply with the directives of those positioned hierarchically above them. Even to the point of performing repugnant actions in violation of universally accepted moral norms. So you've heard of the Milgram experiments? No. No, these are, these are kind of like the Stanford prison, pretty famous. And what he did was he set up these experiments where he had, you could see these actors were behind a wall, but they were getting asked questions. And the the, if they answered the question wrong, they would get a little electric shock that was done by the person that was being experimented on.

Speaker 4:          01:42:53       So, you know, I would be, they'd say, okay Jocko, you've got this guy, his name is echo, he's over there. We're going to ask them a question. If he gets it wrong, you hit him with the shock. I can't see you, but I can hear you. So when I shock you and, and every question that you get wrong, I have to escalate the level of shock. So it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse. And your reaction is more and more horrific as these things escalate. But you're the guy, the experiment, the experiment is on me. No, you're just knocked it. There's no ratchet, we'll shock. Okay, Gotcha. So, and you're actually going through a series of complaints and I'll, I'll, I'll read this here. There was an escalating series of fake electric shocks upon a Vic act or victim who responded with carefully programmed voice feedback on escalating series of complaints, cries of pain, call for help.

Speaker 4:          01:43:42       And finally, fateful silence. In the standard voice feedback experiment, two thirds of Milgram's subjects were obedient to the point of inflicting extreme pain. Several variations on the experiment produce significantly different results. If the actor slash victim was shielded so that this subject could hear and see no response. Obedience Muslim was much greater. So if I couldn't hear you and I just knew that I was shocking the hell out of you, I was good with it. If the subject had both visual and voice feedback, compliance fell to the compliance to the extreme, fell to 40% so down from 66% to 40% if the subject had had to touch the actor slash victim physically by forcing his hand onto an electric plate to deliver the shocks, obedience dropped at 30%. Now this is, this is fascinating. If a non authority figure gave orders, obedience was nil. So if some guy was like, hey, you know, am bill, I'm running the experiment, um, hey, shock this guy.

Speaker 4:          01:44:49       If the guy was no authority, the they got no, they got no, none, no obedience. So that shows you, and that's from a leadership perspective, that's very important to understand. It's important to understand how much influence you have when you're in a leadership position. And I run in this all the time and I ran into and they seal teams when a guy doesn't recognize the power of his rank and he doesn't recognize that just by wearing his rank. When he says something, people kind of like going to do it, they're good to go. Well they want to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:19       So then going back to the book here, if the naive subject performed a subsidiary or accessory task but did not personally inflict the electric shocks, obedience was nearly total. So that goes down to the division of Labor. Again, if it was just me saying, okay, I asked him a question, you'd have to shock him again and some other guy was shocking you, I'd go straight to a hundred straight to you all hundred. In contrast, if the subject or pure was part of an, if the subject was part of an act or pure group that staged carefully planned refusal to continue to follow directions of the authority figure, the vast majority of subjects, 90% joined their peer group and desist and desist as well. So that's the tipping point thing. If there was other, so if it was, if it was three of us that were conducting the experiment on you and the other, I was the, the the naive guy that doesn't know what's going on. I'm the one that they were actually doing the experiment on and there's two guys, two actors that are in the room with me, and they're going to be like, hey man, we shouldn't be doing this, and the other guy goes, yeah man, that looks like it's really hurting, but we should stop this. 90% of the time I go, yeah, you guys are right.

Speaker 4:          01:46:29       Psychology group psychology. If the subject was given complete discretion as to the level of electric shock to administer all but a few sadists consistently delivered a minimal shock when not under direct surveillance of the scientist. Many of the subjects cheated by giving lower shocks than prescribed, even though they were unable to confront authority and abandon the experiments. So they'd give lower shelves, but they wouldn't walk away from it. They wouldn't just say, I'm not going to do this. Yeah. It took her through their phones. Re Really? You know what it is. We're all just on the edge, man. In a way. Yeah, and we kind of need each other in that way to wellness. It's, again, this is, you know, this is about leadership. It's amazing how influential or how influenceable people are. They're so ready for influence are so ready to be told like, hey man, we shouldn't be doing this.

Speaker 4:          01:47:21       It's the same thing we saw with the, with the podcast on the meal, I'm asker. All it took was one officer saying stop killing and everyone, okay, stop killing. Right. Everyone just, they just need to get nudged in that direction. And by the way, they had already been nudged in the other direction, which is kill everyone. And they said, all right, cool. We'll go out. And that's what I mean by on the, I don't mean on the edge of like sanding nothing. I mean on the fence you're on the fence. That's why leadership is so important because you are walking around with people all over the world and, and whatever position you're in, regardless if it's in a work environment, if it's a social environment, if it's with your friend or your peer group, you have so much power over people just by being a leader and by using that influence to work people one way or the other. Yeah, that's crazy, man. Yeah. It is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:48:05       Going back to the book to what were the vast majority of traps men responding to when they did not step out? Was it the authority as represented by either trap or his superiors? Were they responding to trap? Not primarily as an authority figure, but as an individual, a popular and beloved officer who they Missumi who they would not leave in the lurch. What about other factors? Milgrom himself notes that far that people far more frequently invoke a 40 then conformity to explain their behavior for the only, the former seems to absolve them of personal responsibility and he quotes here. Subjects denied conformity and embrace obedience as the explanation of their actions, so people don't like to say everyone else is doing it, so I get it. People don't like to say that because that, that, that means I'm responsible for it. People don't like to take ownership of things.

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       It's probably have a book called extreme ownership. People don't like to take ownership of things, right? Instead, they want to say, as soon as I blame something on my Boston, this is one of the, you know, big things in extreme ownership leading up the chain of command. It's so easy to blame your boss because how can I control my boss? I was following, I was following orders, Boston way to do this. That's why we failed the mission. I was told to do this mean he didn't give me the right gear. That's, we hear this all the time and, and, and Milgrom says it too. No one wants to say, Hey, you know what? I decided I was just going to do what everyone else was doing. That's my decision. Instead, they put that decision on the other guy on the boss, man. Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:49:39       Another exploration here, back to the book, direct proximity to the horror of killing significantly increased the number of men who would no longer comply. On the other hand, with the division of labor and removal of the killing process to the death camps, the men felt scarcely any responsibility to offer for their actions. Same thing. MILGROM figured out. No, I got someone else that's pressing the button over there. The shocking you. I'm good with it. Yeah. Keep Rolling. Now, one thing that Milgrom kinda talks about is his, the kind of indoctrination or what kind of, what kind of ideological justification did he give to his people? It's really just preexisting in Milgram's experiment. These are just kind of normal people. So what about with the Nazis and what kind of indoctrination did they get? Brainwashed, right. We have talked about this a little bit already, but back to the book, all order police battalions were to be strengthened in character and ideology.

Speaker 4:          01:50:36       One topic for the first week, they went through like a school and education, ideological education. One topic for the first week was race as the basis of our worldview followed by the second week maintaining the purity of blood. So there you go. These guys are being indoctrinated. But the reason that that argument doesn't really hold much weight is because of the way who the people were. And back to the book, whatever the merits of such an argument, it clearly does not hold for the predominantly middle aged men of reserve with leap police battalion one on one. They were, they were educated and spent their formative years in the pre 1933 period. Many came from a social may, Lou that was relatively unreceptive to national socialism. They were, they knew perfectly well the moral norms of German society before the Nazi. So you can't really blame it on them being brainwashed.

Speaker 4:          01:51:36       So here's how, here's how a browning wraps up this book. I'm going to close it out. The behavior of any human being is of course a very complex phenomenon. And the historian who attempts to explain it is indulging in a certain arrogance when nearly 500 men are involved to undertake any general explanation of their collective behavior is even more hazardous. What then is one to conclude, most of all, one comes away from the story of Reserve Police Battalion One on one with a great unease. This story of ordinary men is not the story of all men. The reserve policemen faced choices and most of them committed terrible deeds, but those who killed cannot be absolved by the notion that anyone in the same situation would have done as they did for even among them. Some refuse to kill and others stopped. Killing human responsibility is ultimately an individual matter.

Speaker 4:          01:52:54       At the same time, however, the collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion One o one has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or Fred of war everywhere society conditions, people to respect and defer to authority and indeed could scarcely function otherwise everywhere people seek career advancement in every modern society. The complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratic ization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy within virtually every social collective. That peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms.

Speaker 4:          01:54:02       If the men of Reserve Police Battalion One on one could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot and there you have it and I think those are some extremely important warnings that are laid out there. I mean, obviously the first one, we have to be aware of traditions of racism and the threat of war, and I think those are pretty obvious and stand out pretty clearly. Yeah. I think the other ones are a little bit trickier, right? I think we've got to watch out for the fact that we are conditioned to respect and defer to authority. I say to that, no, and I actually, you know, I, when I grew up, I was a rebellious kid and I listened to rebellious music and I was a rebellious kid. I talk about that and I think that was very beneficial for me in my military career and explained that all the time that I asked questions.

Speaker 4:          01:55:30       If I don't believe in something, I'm going to ask questions. And by the way, I don't, I want the people that work for me or with me. I want them to ask questions to, I don't want to be surrounded by yes men and I'm not going to be yes ma'am. Never was. Nope, I haven't met. Let me, let me caveat that. Not that I never was because sometimes you've got to be a yes man. In order to get the inner circle where you can actually have influence. So have I played that game before? Yes, I have. Yeah. Yeah. Boss. That sounds like a good plan. Yeah. Boss yet that says good plan. Oh I trust Jocko. He agrees with me all the time. Hey boss, you're going off the rails over here. He stop it. Oh I'm going to listen to Jocko cause he listens to me.

Speaker 4:          01:56:08       So have I played that game before? Yes, of course I have. So we need to be careful that we don't submit always to authority. It's a hard thing to raise your kids with too. Right? Cause you, cause you want your kids to submit to your authority, but you don't want them to, yeah. I have to always remind myself when they rebel against me, I have to say to myself, good. Because I want them to ask questions. I want them to question authority. I don't want them to just obey. Right. Yeah. And it freaks people out. It freaks people out when you say w w you know, I'll go and work with a company and I'll be saying like, no, I want your people. You want your people to ask questions. If you want to just order them around and they're just going to obey you, first of all, I'm not going to help you there because that's not a system that's functional.

Speaker 4:          01:56:56       It will be functional for a week. It'd be functional for two weeks, but eventually you will have people that don't understand why they're doing what they're doing. They don't put their effort to and they can't make decisions on their own and you end up with a bad team. Yeah. We don't want that kind of authoritarian leadership anywhere and certainly not, not, not anywhere. Again, does it work for five minutes? Does it work for week? Yeah, it does. Is it sometimes needed because people gotta we gotta get something done right now. Yeah, but you better follow that up with some non authoritarian leadership with, with explaining and building relationships with people. Yeah. That ex explanation thing that you guys didn't talk about all the time. We're explaining why. Explain why I'm telling you to do this. It's important because of this x, Y, Z man. It, and I'm speaking from a perspective of being a parent, how effective that is.

Speaker 4:          01:57:47       You just say, this is why you're doing it. That's effectively how old is your daughter now it's already affected with a four year old. Yeah. And even maybe some mornings you can always rationalize it. A four year old. Sometimes they just want that cookie careers. Know why about it? It was strangely with the, um, we, we have a situation right now where I'm, her cousin is in and um, you know, he put in a nutshell, his diet isn't quite it. Um, as she's not on the, but he's not on the program, on the program, like how my daughter is program, but you know, he'll eat junk food or whatever. Right. And it's kind of part of the experience. I understand where, you know, hey cousins in from out of town and it's a little bit more festive. Yeah. So after awhile I started realizing like, cousin show up at my house and getting on the program.

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       It should be like that. So after awhile I was like, Hey, the, you know, we just, there's too many treats going on these days, you know, for the psycho had to drop the head to intervene a little bit. And so when I told my daughter, I was like, no, you know, we're not going to do this. And I explained why you could tell she didn't, she wasn't happy with it, but she totally understood four years old where, and I did it in a way where it wasn't like you referenced way of the Warrior Kid always. Dude, she was wearing that shirt to school today too, by the way. Coincidentally when right. They're using millennia. But um, it was, it w I didn't scare her. You no idea. I wasn't like, Ooh, then you're going to be a loser or something. You know, something like that. My kids say to each other, oh, you might as well just go out and volunteer for type two diabetes.

Speaker 4:          01:59:23       They get crazy and they learn that from, yeah. Yeah, I know exactly where they learned, but it was just the kind, you know, like where the older kids do it. To my younger daughter, you're going to get type two diabetes on the peer pressure. She thinks she's going to get it today. Yeah. That's messed up. You know it is most effective or ineffective though, right? That's your thing. No, but anyway, the point being it is, it is effective. Especially, I mean, yet, you know like how you say to, you don't have to be a dick about it. It's not a scolding. It's not nothing like that. Yeah. It's cool on explanation. Actually understanding contrary to that, it's the other end of the spectrum. Yeah. Yeah. We're using, I'm talking to you is because I care about you so much, but I want you to be healthy.

Speaker 4:          02:00:07       Yeah. That's the only reason I'm talking to you. You ever get like your parents say that? Say those exact words. I do this because I care about you. Meanwhile, they're yelling at you versus banking. You employers do it. Two bosses do that too. Yeah, no. The first thing they do is I want to jump down someone's throat and then everyone's reactions to the same to that. Yeah. One likes it. No one likes it. Whereas if you take a different approach and you say, Hey, echo, do you know why I'm talking to you right now? It's not because I'm mad at you. Right. It's because I'm actually, I see nothing but potential with you. That's what I see. And when I, when I see that you're not making, you're not making many videos. It's not, it's not, cause I'm, I'm thinking myself, oh, I want more videos. The reason I'm thinking it's because I actually see how much potential you have and you could really do some powerful stuff and have some huge influence Tang, but you're still right, Jocko. So. Right. As opposed to you better make more videos. Yeah. Or else I'm going to have my kid do it.

Speaker 4:          02:01:07       We'd be lazy. Exactly. Then you'd be like, fine, I it could do it. They won't be as good as mine. She was saying. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's not what we wanted. That's not the game we're playing here. Yeah. I do see a lot of potential in you then. I think you could make more videos. Thank you so much. So you gotta Watch out for Oh, being a 40 you've got to question authority all the time and you've, then he talks about people seeking career advancement. That was another big one and this is another big one I say no to right. There's such a much better way to get career advancement and that is by doing a good job. Yeah. That's how you get career advancement by instead of seeking career advancement, seeks, do good job, seek to make a difference to seek to do what is right.

Speaker 4:          02:01:54       The career is going to come in one form or the other. Now my you get passed up. Might some other guy that tooted his own horn and took the credit, might that happen? Yes, it might happen. You might, you might get delayed, but that guy is going to continue to build that reputation and they're, the bosses missed it on the first round of advancements. So he got it. Maybe even gets the second round by the third round. They're looking at him going, this guy has a self serving loser. We need to get them off the team. And by the way, we realized that the guy that's been behind all his work is echo over there, so we're going to promote him now. Now you're going to win. Now you've got a really solid reputation. You'll broke so you can't. But the, the, the idea of seeking career advancement, you see that in the military all the time.

Speaker 4:          02:02:38       There's people that are just trying to get advanced, trying to get advanced, trying to get, don't cares who's backed or stepping on, and I'm telling you, I said, I saw some of those guys get advanced in, in my community that advanced up through the ranks. They were stepping on people's backs to get there. The reputation eventually was so bad that it didn't get them propel. They didn't propel as far as they want it to look. Great guys, the guys that were really truly just trying to do the best for the community, those guys got promoted and aid would make it, you know, the furthest because their reputation was so solid and everyone knew that these guys were doing the right things for the right reason, not so they could get promoted, but they ended up getting promoted. Yeah. Yeah. Promotion is more for like a, like an eventuality.

Speaker 4:          02:03:18       Eventuality. Yeah. It's just like Jujitsu. If you're just trying to get your belt and that's what you're trying to prove, that's not gonna work out well for you. Getting mad when the, the game like emoted you might get your blue belt before some other white belt because you're showing off all the time, but eventually you're showing off all the time and the coach goes, hey man, why don't you help everyone? Or the coach goes, Hey, I see you. I see you're tapping a lot of people out that are the same level as you all the time, but you're not going with anyone that's harder than you. Cause you wanna prove to me that you're tapping and went out and long move. You know what you might see sometimes it's, you know, like you know when you come up through the Jujitsu ranks you, you, you just, you just find a certain mood move or handful of moves and you just, those moves, you get better. I'm still there. Yeah. I think we all kind of are in one way or another.

Speaker 4:          02:04:01       And so this is, this is what, if you're pursuing the belt is what you do on instructors around only do your good moods. Do you want to look good? Yeah. You want to look good. That's all you do. You know, and you did. And when you say it will show itself later, you know, so what you, what can happen is you get your blue belt, you get your purple belt. Cause like you show off to your instructors or whatever the tournaments to realize. I just realized something about myself. I just had a rude awakening. Huh. But what will happen is later on you ever get, okay. So this might be, it might have been a long time for you, but maybe not. So,

Speaker 6:          02:04:39       okay. So I'm taking, I'm training with, uh, in, Oh, I'm sorry. I went to class. Jeff Glover is teaching the class and Jeff Glover was like, Hey, let's do this. And he does some crazy kind of advanced move, but it takes like if you're an advanced person, you know how to, you know, how to move your body in Jujitsu kind of in an advanced way. You can do the move even though you've never done the movie before. You know, that kind of went. So was that kind of movie was one where you got to like go between the guy's legs, lift up into he'll hook or whatever, like locked you choose. So I don't do that move at all. And I've been training, I've been in this game for a long time, so I go and I do it and not, I don't want to say I was surprised, but like I could do it.

Speaker 6:          02:05:18       I can totally. But Jeff was like, oh, kind of like Dang, cause I'm a bigger guy too, you know? And that made me think of this kind of thing where some guys, they can be a black belt and they'll say, hey, hey, show this move real quick and it'll be a black man. They can't do it because they've avoided that. And not to say that this is the case all the time. I'm just saying that's like an example of how you can avoid getting better and only show off like x, Y, Z to get you to that kind of next specific level. Yeah. I don't, new belt or whatever is a similar thing maybe. But I realized when you were talking about this, what I'll do is both with Jean and with Jeff, if I do, if I'm doing something that they showed me, I'll like, I'll like call them out like a little kid.

Speaker 6:          02:06:05       I'll be like, yeah, I'd be like, oh you like that one. That New Orleans, I do it with Dean, with my kids when my kids are training, you know, I'll say 18 dean, check, look at that, look at that. He's going to get it. You know what I mean? Of like all happy. Yeah. I'm just happy that I'm learning or that they're learning. It's pretty cool when you can pull off what you just learned. Right? Yeah. That's cool. And it's cool for a teacher. I always, I'm still, when somebody does something that I showed them big time. So I guess the differences if in fact this isn't even the difference, um, is why did you do that? It's not to get your kid promoted to get me promoted cause I can't get you kind of can't get promoted right now. Yeah. So I guess, I guess it's sort of like maybe, maybe, maybe the negative aspect would be like I'm looking for some credit for calling off of the little guy move totally differently.

Speaker 6:          02:07:00       No, I don't think it's, I think it's pretty bad. I liked it. I think I'm pretty lame for that. Um, yeah. So watch out for that. Watch out for their career advancement. Don't let that be the folks, your life, man. It's God's not going to make you, it's not going to get you what you want. Now again, are there instances where you play the game so that you can move up so that you can have more control? Yes, I did that. I look, I be, I went from enlisted to officer. That's the ultimate in, Hey, I'm going to play the game. I'm going to get more. I want to, I want to be in charge of more stuff. So how am I going to do that? I'm going to be, I'm going to skip all these ranks. Become an officer. I did

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       that. Yeah. I played that game. I was about my career, but I was about my career so I could make you know, 15 guys in a seal platoon happy. Yeah. Cause I was happy when I had a good leader in my seal platoon. Um, the other one he talks about here is this bureaucrat as a nation and specialization attenuating the sense of personal responsibility. This is another thing that we have to be careful of. Just because you're part of a system doesn't mean you should just, you know, blame the system when something goes wrong. You know, if you're working somewhere and something isn't going, hey, that's the way we do it. Hey, that's the way the system works. Hey, we can't change that. And I never accepted that as an answer. And I'll tell you what, when you come up against that, you can't eat the way you fight it when you come up against as you build a relationship.

Speaker 4:          02:08:32       Right. So any you ever, you ever have a, you're trying to deal with some customer service or something and you're getting that, sorry, we can't help you. Yeah. And you go down to the store and like, Hey, what's going on? Hey Bill, I am Jocko man. I called you earlier. I just, I got to get this thing resolved. Here's what's going on. You don't, you don't go down there and say you need to take care of this. No. You say, hey bill, what's going on? Hey, I'm Jocko. Yeah man. I really liked the piece of gear, but man, it worked good. There was a couple issues I have with everyone trying to get them resolved because you know, my daughter's birthday's in two weeks and I need them. You know what I mean? Yeah. Former relationship with them. Let's get the bureaucratic, don't let them stay in their big bureaucratic system.

Speaker 4:          02:09:14       Yeah. We don't want to let that happen because then the, then the bureaucratic machine, then they're, they're not, they're not the ones that are offending you. It's the machine. They can't control the machine. It's not their machine. There's part of the machine. Right. You want to you and where this concept fundamentally is the same as this, you know, when you're in traffic, you know, and you're trying to get over kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you want to get into the lane, but you know, from the other guy's perspective or the other car's perspective, this car is trying to cut me off this car. This car's going to get in my way. Right. But you get your, whoever you're riding with, all you gotta do to get them rolled down the window, make eye contact with a person and be like, Hey, just wave at them or something.

Speaker 4:          02:09:55       Look, I'm a person. You're a person. We're not standing in line. What else? Any, like we're just, we're hoping the themes, we're not machines, we're not much. You can just give them the hint of a personal element. Let you right in the wave. You in, you weight back. You guys are friends that and before, keeping in mind two seconds before that you were pissed. Yeah. They're like, discuss the plot to get in front of me. And there's no reason to be mad about that, by the way. It's not like you're sitting in some way to get there. He's gotta be some more to the same direction in the rush. Yeah, but you got to put it on your deal. Same thing. Step out of the machine, man. The machine of trust. Step out. Hey, I'm a person. You're a person. Make the personal relationships up and down the chain of command throughout your company.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Don't let the, don't let the finance department, right? Yeah. The department, the finance department is shot us down on this thing. Yeah. Give me the name. Who did that? I'm going to walk down there and Tim, I'll see what the marketing department won't give us any more than, okay, cool. Let's find out who that is. That's not a bureaucratic maze. It's not a marketing department machine. No, it's bill. Bill's in there 100% when bill knows what you're trying to do, I noticed that you are trying to make something happen. You make that connection and we're good to go. Bill is going to take care of you. I don't even no reason to freak out. The other thing, finally here is this, this idea of this peer group, this social collective, pure pressure. We all know it exists and that's fine, but make it good, right?

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Peer pressure is powerful. It's powerful and the good thing is you get to control it in both directions. You need to recognize it when it's happened to you in a negative way and then you need to use it in a positive way to help people do good things. Jews, peer pressure, peer pressure is legit for making people do positive things. What you don't want to do is use peer pressure to make people do negative things and there's a lot of that in the world. Then I'll tell you why. There's a certain part of people that don't like to see other people succeed. Yeah. So they go, man, just come out tonight dude. But dude, I kind of work in the morning to just come out, which is going to get a couple of drinks. Here's another one. Let's do shot. You're always on that diet. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:12:05       The people, hey, loosen up. Lighten up. Yeah. They want to say there's a, there's a certain part of people that want to see everyone else fail. And if you're, you've got to pay attention to that to yourself. Yes. You got to pay attention to that in your own self because if you don't, you won't realize it. But you actually, I've seen people give other people bad advice because they're jealous. They're jealous. Certain programs, I seem to go with a gut friend of mine was going for a certain program in the military and he came to me, he said, man, I'm just going to try this program. But a couple of guys were telling me I shouldn't. And I said, Bro, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. They are jealous. They're jealous. They don't want you to do this program cause it's gonna make you more successful. Go do the program. Huh? And he said, okay. And he did it. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:12:57       that's who I want to give peer pressure of goodness out of badness. And, and the thing is, I mean, I guess you could look at peer pressure in a way is it's leadership, whether you're standing up to it or whether you're spreading the positive peer pressure. And that's leadership. And that's what we're here to do, man. Yeah. We're here to do, we're here to lead. And when you use that in a positive way, you can prevent this kind of, he's kind of sick, sadistic, horrible, horrific events like this, like we read about today from happening. I mean, it just, it's, it's crazy that this, that this occurred. Yeah. And it's crazy that it, you know, even even throughout the book and

Speaker 2:          02:13:45       it,

Speaker 4:          02:13:47       it's just referring to the Jews, right? It's just referring to the Jews and the Jews. The Jews lined up, the Jews laid down, the Jews gotten, got shot in the back of the neck. The Jews, the Jews, the Jews. Let's remember that every single one of those Jews was, her name was a person, right. Was bill was, you know, we, we do the same thing. We're putting them in a, in a sort of big chunk of machinery. Yeah. That they're just, they're part of the product of what's happening over here and yeah, don't do it on either side. Yeah. Or don't try and have it on the new side. Don't let it happen. And traffic. Don't let it happen in your life. Don't do it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:34       That's what leadership is about. It really is. And leadership, the thing about leadership is leadership is happening at all times. W W we, the minute you are interacting with another person, leadership is taking place. You're either being led, which is fine, or you're leading, which is fine as long as you're going in the right direction. But if you constantly think you're any and you're leading yourself, by the way, of course you're leading yourself, you're constantly leading yourself. But the minute you meet with someone else, you, there's a leadership situation happening. You either leading that person or you're being led and that's okay. It's okay to be led as long as you're being led in the right direction. If you start seeing yourself being led in the wrong direction and you go with it, you're at fault. Yeah. You're at fault. You can't blame that person. You went along with it. Yeah. You're culpable for your actions. So again, I know it's a brutal, brutal topic to cover and I'm sure we'll be back at it again at some point.

Speaker 2:          02:15:38       But yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:15:40       let's not, let's not forget that these, that this happened and that if we're not careful, it can happen again.

Speaker 6:          02:15:49       Yeah. And you get little things I can way lower levels. Yeah. That stuff happens all the time. You know, like little rights breakout, you know, normal people just drawing cars because that's kind of what everyone's doing. You know, one guy that's like, hey, stop, we gotta to stop and be like, okay, let me stop. Yeah. The peer pressure thing, that's why people will, you get a workout buddy, you know, or, or you, you, you joined. That's why crossfit in a big way is like, really? Okay. It's a good group thing because everyone's like, hell yeah. You know, like the true you want, you can't, in a way, you look forward to just linking up with the group and the group stuck in about like, you know, doing good stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       Yeah. Working out. And you're right. And as a matter of fact, there's a whole new phenomenon in the fitness world, which is basically all stems from crossfit and they call it just grew up exercise, right? Yeah. Hey, we've got group exercise classes X. Yeah. Group exercise classes because hey, I want to work out with other people. I want to have, you know, Echo, call me up and be like, hey, you gonna make it to class tonight. I'm kind of feeling lazy. Come on Bro. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, okay. I don't want to be weak. You know, you're pressuring me to be strong. That's good. Yup. True Story. So use that in a positive way.

Speaker 6:          02:17:05       Yeah. Yeah. You ever, you ever been? Well you probably, well yeah, you probably have, come on, we can be honest here. You know the kind where you're like, okay, I'm going to link up with whoever to go train or to go work out or whatever, and you're like, Dang, I don't really, when the time comes you're like, Dang, I don't really feel like it. I in the back of my mind, I hope that they call and cancel. I hope, and then they call, they don't cancel. They call to confirm and you go, you didn't want to go. You go at the end of the workout, you're like, Dang, I almost didn't, I almost didn't make it today. Good thing you know that's common man.

Speaker 4:          02:17:41       And that happens and I'll tell you, people ask me about this a lot. You've got to recognize, you've got to start to memorize that good feeling that comes after a good workout. Yeah. So that you don't have to force yourself through it in anticipation. Such a good way to put it, memorize the feeling, memorize the feeling of like I memorized two feelings. One is I remember eyes, how good it feels when you're done. And two, I memorized how bad it feels when you're weak. You don't, when you say no. Yeah. So that, that's a horrible, I hate that feeling. I hate that feeling of like I didn't do it. Yeah. It makes me feel like junk junk. I was just on the road and it was like, don't do it. I just feel like man, I squeezed in a couple of workouts at night. Pretty weak workouts but just to get them done and you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          02:18:32       Just to move. The worst thing you can do is be sedentary. Yeah. And I was moving during the day cause we were in the water and whatnot. Yeah. It's a little bit different. Yeah. But you got to get them done. Yeah. So memorize the feelings that there's nothing worse than the feeling of I slept in. Well, like I said, it works for you. That's probably as long statement. I don't like the feeling of I slept in and now behind the power curve. Don't like that feeling at all. Yeah. Like you memorize that feeling. Yeah. And then run from it. Speaking of memorize, are you going to go over everything that everyone has memorized you saying at this point where you talk about how they can support the podcast picture? Actually,

Speaker 6:          02:19:12       I'm going to go in and do, Amen. I'm going to go Ian, at a different angle. I'm going to say, speaking of peer pressure, because this is really what it is. The group, you peer pressuring me, you peer pressure. Everyone else is listening. We collectively peer pressure each other and this is what we're doing. We're working out. There's no reason not to work out today. Nowadays, not. I mean this day today, today could be your recipe. You should work out today too. You should have. Yes. Yeah. You should later. Even if you haven't already. Anyway, this is what we're doing. We're working out. Yes. If we have weight to lose, we know if we're overweight, we do. Even if we're for like five pounds overweight, think of like your ideal weight. Think of that. If you're not that 150 pounds when you roll with someone, that's massive.

Speaker 6:          02:20:01       Yeah. And you think, boy, I wish I was this massive. I wish I was, you know, 450 pounds because then you just smash everyone. Yeah. But that might get in the way in other aspects of life, like if you're 450 pounds, that would mean what, how tall? Like what, six eight? No, I would want to be like eight foot nine. Yeah. Okay. So surfing is going to be an issue for you, so, okay, so, so kinda say goodbye to your current knowledge or your current Schema of surfer. Say Goodbye to that. Good point. Good point. That's just one thing, man. There's other things. So you're just thinking Jujitsu lies. I understand. I was just your hand and just MMA over the, you'd be out of the way classes though. Yeah. Yeah. So you'd have to fight in these weird cop shoots, whatever I'm saying, look at big picture.

Speaker 6:          02:20:46       I'll just be what I am actually, you know what bow 700 feet do you bro, if you want to be that big, that's your ideal weight. You go with that. The 750 pounds, 10 on the, and that's really the point. The point is, you know, your ideal weight, you do not me. You know, I don't have an ideal weight for you. Maybe I do, but it serves my interim 100 towns. Exactly right. Um, and be with less mentally strong, but for everyone else, we all know how much we want a way or you know, whatever, whatever. So this is what we're doing. Pure pressure. We're going to do that. We're going to pursue that. We're working out, we are getting control of our ego temper and other various weaknesses. Also to facilitate that, we taking krill oil in for joints. A story. That's what we're doing.

Speaker 6:          02:21:39       We're problem solving. Ultimately it's just one big problem solving thing, you know? So look, joints us or Krill oil, boom joints not sore anymore. Moved to the next thing. So what I'm saying, so krill oil from on it. You want 10% off the Krill oil, saved money, financial discipline equals financial freedom. Boom. We'll kind of put that right in the whole equation. Go to [inaudible] dot com slash chocolate 10% off and support the podcast. You know, we're all in this thing together, kind of thing. You know, other stuff on it. I took some new mood today. Interesting. I'm not necessarily in a new mood. I think I'm in the same mood, but I don't think that's what it is. I think it's more than just, you know, balancing out your whole stuff. Yeah. I just took it because he was there and that's the of thing that I won't take. You don't want to be balanced. I won [inaudible] current mood.

Speaker 6:          02:22:32       Yeah, I'm currently, what if you're feeling angry? Good, then I'm good to go. I'm fairly certain it's for brain health, you know, any, I think the new mood, like mood part of it is more of like a kind of a happenstance kind of cool thing like you know. Anyway, maybe it took some of that. I have some of that. I'm down for that. There's a bunch of other stuff, performance stuff, you know, so if you're like, hey, I'm getting after it. I want performance supplementation. That's what we're doing too. We're doing all this stuff as a group. So was Jocko our current leader.

Speaker 6:          02:23:08       I think this is a group without a leader until someone tells him to stop, then we're all stuck in anyway. Also good way to support and this is just support yourself and support the group really. Cause you know, okay, so this book, these books, all these books, we read these books. Sure we listen to go over it and it's dope. But you know, you want to get the book. If you want to get the book, you don't need the whole thing. I'm reading less than 10% of the books. Yeah, 5% it's like a book report. Although I might've gone a little bit crazy with Sydney Jerry last week. Yeah. I just want to do it. If I'm just full on the audio book, just start and I'll stop. Seven hours later. Three and a half. Yeah, that's it. So got some good lessons though. Yeah, they're all, they're all good lessons.

Speaker 6:          02:23:54       How many people see, you know, podcast, three hours and 27 minutes and go, come on JOC, come on for, yeah. And how many people actually know what they say. Come on. Echo. You talked about actually talk to you about, you talked about supports for two hours and 27 minutes. Come on. That's not my fault. That's the machine. You know, I just did a small little party guilty. Anyway, if you want the books or one or whatever, uh, our website Jocko, podcast.com there's a section, a page if you will, menu on the top, says books from podcast. Boom, click on that. Click through there, take you to Amazon, purchased the book. That's a good way to support and you get the book. Boom. Um, also, yeah, if you're going to do any other shopping on there, hey, feel free. That's a good way to support any solid way.

Speaker 6:          02:24:45       And that's what we're all doing. Straight up seats. Now you're throwing this real heavy peer pressure on everyone. Yeah, but this is good peer pressure. You said good peer pressure is good. Well that is good because we're not, you just, you're just helping your podcast. It doesn't cost anything. Exactly. Right. Boom. And that's what we're doing. Also what we're doing is subscribing. And what were you going to say? I was going to say continue talking. All right, there you go. I will add, so subscribe to the podcast. That's what we're all doing. I'm subscribed to the podcast and I'm on, you know. Yeah. Well obviously we're all going to do it. Um, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. Also on Youtube, subscribe to the Allen. That's a good one. That's where you make all those videos. Tell me you're doing three videos a week.

Speaker 6:          02:25:30       Yeah, man, if I had not seen this in the future podcasts, video, video format, so doing one podcast video and one and then two excerpts to excerpts minimum. This is what I'm saying. Okay. That's kind of, so we should have a lot of excerpts up there and they grow every week. Um, you know, so the, and the benefit to those, by the way you make you make your extra shorter. Why? Cause they're too long. A 12 minute excerpts, not even an expert. The expert. That's just another body that's the same. That goes back to the same problem. It's essentially an order you need to do edit them. Yeah. Yeah. Get the meat. Dang. Yeah. Amazing isn't it? She'd just be like boom. So much to be able to listen to it in 30 seconds and be like, oh I got the, got the deal here.

Speaker 6:          02:26:18       Yeah. So, okay, so the problem is with you as you enjoy the, you enjoy the arc of the conversation. Yeah. See people want to hear the arc of the conversation. They just listen to the whole podcast. Maybe I've been hanging around with you too though because last week, the way you were feeling when you couldn't hand it out, just that whole, you know, 45 minutes of whatever, same thing you get in. So part of that is a joke. That part of it is a series. So you know how like, okay, I'm listening, I'm listening to your whole little segment and I'm going to cut it right. I'm gonna be like, okay, I'm going to cut it right here. And then your little followup comment is cool. And then maybe I say something which is like, Eh, whatever. I can cut myself out easily. But then your followup to me is kind of cool.

Speaker 6:          02:26:56       I'm like, Hey, that's important too. I should leave that part in it slowly. It just turns into this thing mineral, a minute excerpt, fuck time whenever. That only has the word Jocko chicken, Mick, half chicken breast with fine leg. They're not mcnuggets anymore. No, actually they are, but you know that's an exception. Sometimes they're 12 minutes. Hey Man, there's 10 minutes. The other thing we could do is we could act actually reshoot the like rerecord, just the pertinent parts of, you can edit it out without like, yeah, not, I don't know that. That's a step back. Quirts I think I'm just making repetitive, you know. Anyway, that's a good way to support subscribe that Youtube Channel, boom, shareable stuff on there in the event of the excerpts, not being taught minutes in them. In the event of them being three minutes or so, you can share them more sharable.

Speaker 6:          02:27:47       In fact, I saw what it was like right after I posted it and then I think he was like, oh, I'm going to effing Brady. Maybe he shares it and then I watched it. That's how shareable it is. I just posted it. He shared it and I watched it. You did it, cut it, edited it, posted it and then got shared back to you and you still watched it. Yeah, we'll technically wasn't sure to me directly actually technically it was a work. That's such a good accent though. So good. How I cut the beginning and the end of that. Anyways, stopping start anyway. Subscribed pee tube. That's the point. That's what we're doing also, Jack was a store. It's called Jocko store Jocko store.com so what's on here is clothing items if you will, new shirt out. Okay, so here's the thing. This is what we're doing.

Speaker 6:          02:28:47       We're wearing Jocko podcast shirt. That's what we're doing. This what I'm doing, the peer thing, I'm telling you it's good. Beer pressure looks who she, this shirt Jocko is wearing right now. Even this has become a Jocko podcast shirt because we now manufacturing victory MMA and fitness tee shirts to stay old school to the Jocko uniform. Really? Yeah. That shirts on Jocko, store.com this shirt that I'm currently wearing, chocolate store.com in fact, all the shirts are on Jocko store.com I guide. The master had this tee shirt on. Yeah, and the [inaudible] and at first I was like, you know, I just like, Oh man, somebody say three guy and then I'll say, oh even cooler. He's not an actor guy, but he's representing. Representing. Yep. That's all. That's what we're doing representing big time. And if you, I'm not saying buy a shirt, I never say buy a shirt.

Speaker 6:          02:29:39       I'm saying chocolate store.com. Check it out if you'd like one or more of the items on there including, but not limited to shirts. Get something. There's also rash guards. Hoodies kind of like got to replenish those. I understand. But some rash guards on there and the next hoodies are going to be thick and heavy Alaskan style. Okay. Minnesota style. You know what else thinking on Tana stuff, not, not, not Hawaii. Hawaii style. Hang. Well we could to both because look, you can't exclude the calm. I know. Oh come on him. And it means it means the people. Technically when you think about it comma, [inaudible] comma I n means land. So people the land. Yeah, I got a pretty good guests right there. Yeah, there you go. So anyway, you can't neglect those folks. Okay, well we need to make your style one and a and the north northerner.

Speaker 6:          02:30:39       Sure. Style. Yeah. Yeah. The two sides of the spectrum, everybody wants to represent or that's what we're all doing, you know, representing, um, anyway, yes. Some rash guards on there. Like I said, the, okay, what I was gonna say is Jack Jack was the start and we've mentioned it before. Jack was a shirt. Now, well technically he designed a shirt, varying levels of acceptance on my end. It's the echo shirt. Some people call it the Dang shirt, the echo shirt. There's some layers there. You might be able to figure him out. Technically there's more layers on this shirt than any other shirt. Really the most layered shirt. And the fact that I made

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       it as a layer in its own right. Uh, but I, my evaluation is, it's interesting. He was actually impressive. That design is impressive, like the layers and stuff. Anyway, designed exclusively by Jocko. So now I'm a fashion designer. Correct. Artists, fashion designer. Who would have thunk? I'm neither technically your bull. I'm not neglecting either. Anyway, that one's on there right now. Right this very moment. Don't ones on there if you want to check it out. I'm not saying to buy. I'm not saying that. I'm saying checking. I think the shirt it's going to be popular with your head on it is by the way it has echoes head on it because there's a layer in you gotta see it. You got to see it. You know what I'm saying is though is somebody that somebody that like doesn't want to just be forthcoming. Like for instance, a lot of the shirts that we have that have layers to them, you don't know exactly what like no, the darkness, right.

Speaker 4:          02:32:22       No one knows what the hell a lot has to do with, yeah. The Jocko podcast shirt, the one that says Jocko podcast on, okay. We know there's, there's, there's some layers there, but it's pretty, it's also pretty forthcoming what it means. Yeah. This, the shirt that I made for you with your head on it, no one's going to have any idea what that is. It's so people automatically have some good layers there just by wearing that. It's not you. No one's going to have any idea what this is. Why is that PR human's head on your chest? You're saying external people. Yes. People who absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. People in the game, they're going to get the whole thing and they're going to be like, holy Taco is on. Like if you listen to a band and you just, you have a shirt that doesn't say the band name on it, but it's got the album cover. Yeah, and people know. People that know, know people that listen. If they listen, they know. Same thing with this shirt. If they don't listen, they're not going to know. If they listen. You're going to get credit.

Speaker 6:          02:33:21       Yeah. That's a good one. Anyway, chocolate store.com that's a good one. That's what we're doing. Also what we're doing straight up is in the, in the moments of weakness that we may or may not have someone else have them more than others. But what we do is we turn to psychological warfare. If you didn't know what that is, is what is psychological warfare is an album with tracks, tracks, dig it. And these tracks, what they do is they give you a spot with any weakness or weak moments you have. So if you're waking up early every single day and that one day comes or whatever that you're like, Dang, that alarmed seller that my bed is extra comfy, I'm, you know, maybe I'll sleep in. You don't want to have slept in. But that's how you feel at that moment, that moment of weakness, play one of the tracks, wake up and get after it.

Speaker 6:          02:34:14       I don't use that particular track of use the workout once. So it's different, but it will help you through it. I'll give you that spot. Just like when you're, and I said this before and this makes perfect sense. This is what we're doing. And when we jump onto the bench and we take on lofty challenges on the bench press, we're going to grab a guide to spot us. Not to say he's going to touch the bar and not to say any of that, but we, we have a lofty challenge. So we got the, the spot to ensure our success. So to me, if you're not doing anything, if you're not pursuing anything, then this isn't for you. You just got to get up and whatever at whatever time you get up and go to where you do whatever you do, come home, do your thing, which is cool. That's not what we're doing though. So I say, wow, we do our big things. We're going to get our spot. It's called psychological warfare. I'm not even saying to use it, I'm saying, but if you need it, you got it to ensure your success.

Speaker 4:          02:35:11       It's okay. That's good. Thank you. Appreciate that one. Yeah, well done. Yeah, thanks. Uh, also, uh, you can get Jocko white tea on Amazon. Get some, if you want. Some also origin main.com if you're getting into Jujitsu or if you're into Jujitsu already and you need a g or a rash guard, I recommend you go to origin main.com it's a my brother Pete Roberts up there in Maine where they make everything, which is awesome. They weave the fabric so it's stitching it, embroider it, send it out. Jeez. Rash guards, shorts made in America and and yes we are getting in league with origin Maine, so there's a little bit of a perfect storm kind of brewing. Got Somebody that makes something in America, something that I like in your neck of the woods too, by the way, in my neck of the woods. So we're getting on the warpath with origin Maine and we're going to get after it. So check them out.

Speaker 4:          02:36:27       Then weigh the warrior kid, make a kid's life better, get him or her this book so they can get better, faster, stronger and before you give it to them little advice. Read it yourself. Uncle Jake has something for all of us, that's for sure. Also, discipline equals freedom. Feel manual. I brought like a rough copy. I forget what they, there's some name that they called us or I've called it. This will be my third book up published. I still don't understand the publishing, like they have certain words and stuff. They use terms. Sure. As our skin, we're going to do this, blah, blah, blah. And I say, what does that mean? But this is the book. This is the book inside the cover. So a couple things. Does this have a cover that's going to attract you know people to buy it? No, it doesn't. It's got an all black cover flat.

Speaker 4:          02:37:22       That's what it's got. Is it got some, you know, some interesting fluff in there for you to feel good about yourself? No, that stuff's not in there either. Does it have these incredible life hacks that are going to teach you how to rise and fulfill your dreams through simple things that you can do? No, those aren't in there either. It's called a discipline equals freedom field manual. It's about discipline and if you follow it, you're going to find freedom. Pretty simple. There you go. If you're on youtube, there's the book right there. Oh, what does it look like? Hard to see against the black background? Cause it's black. Yeah, it's stuff. So you can see the cover. That's not what the book's for. No, no. Bovill the covered does. Yeah, it's actually pretty. That's to be honest. That's that you can order. That comes out October 17th.

Speaker 4:          02:38:11       The assumption is you might want to order it now so you get a copy when it first comes out. Otherwise people will have discipline before you and that's not gonna work out. Good for you. Uh, extreme ownership. Of course you have it by the way you have it. That's good. But get it for your team because I will make your life easier if you want to do that. We also have echelon front consulting me, Leif Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke. Get your team aligned so your leadership can crush your enemies. And by the way, don't try and book us through a Speaker's agent. If you know what that is, if you know what that is, don't do it. Don't look online and find our literary agent and try and book. Don't do that. We have a company, it's called Echelon Front book through the company info@echelonfront.com email that.

Speaker 4:          02:39:02       That's how you get us to come and work with your company. The muster, we just got done with one. The next one is September 14th and 15th in San Diego. It is going to sell out just factual. It is going to sell out. It is factual. It is going to sell out because all three of the first ones I've sold out. This one's going to sell out to register. Go to extreme ownership.com if you want to come to it. If you don't want to come stay at home, that's fine too. Cool. Whatever. It also, if you train Jujitsu or if you don't train and you want to start training. Speaking of origin Maine, we're doing the origin immersion Jujitsu camp up in Maine. Echo and I are going to be their training and cruising super hard. Uh, the will be there the last day of the first session and the and the first day of the second session.

Speaker 4:          02:39:56       The sessions are August 20 through 23rd for the first session in 24th through the 27th for the second session. Come on up. We're going to be there. If you want to train some Jujitsu, it's going to be a good time. And what I like about it is that the muster, the muster is tight schedule from four o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night, 10 o'clock at night, where we're moving this thing where to do what, five hours, six hours of Jujitsu a day. Sure. And then the rest of the time, what do we do with the other 18 hours a day? Yeah, you can say total, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm saying two hours in the morning and two hours at lunch. Two hours in the afternoon. I mean maybe not training the whole time, but learning to move. Did you see that doing Jiu Jitsu showing like, Hey, can you go over this with me?

Speaker 4:          02:40:40       Hey, I got a question for you. Hey Echo, can you teach me that mount escape that you got? Like whatever. You know those things that we're going to do, we're gonna do that. Yeah. So that's six hours and then we sleep for four hours. So that's 10 hours. That's 14 hours. This is a 14 hours is going to be just walking around in circles going BTF BTF it. That's what we're gonna do is we're going to hang out. So if you want to come train some Jujitsu, hang out, come to that camp up in Maine, it's gonna be awesome. We're going to, uh, we're gonna have a good time up there and until then we'll be rolling in another place. Victory MMA. Yes.
