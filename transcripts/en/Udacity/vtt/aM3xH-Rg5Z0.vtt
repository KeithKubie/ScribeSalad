00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.420
The architecture of the Andrew System looks like this. There are client

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.460
workstations, which are called virtues. And these client workstations,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.130
are connected by insecure network links, to a local

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.550
area network. And through the local area network, they can access servers,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.460
S1, S2, S3 and so on. And these servers are in a secure

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.970
environment or in other words, accessing the servers from a client work station

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.530
uses insecure links but once inside the boundary of the servers, the servers

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.650
can talk to one another, exchange information, grab data from the disks and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.300
so on. This communication that happens inside

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.310
this server environment is a secure communication.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.260
That's part of the reason they've named the server environment as Vice, and,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.860
the client environment, where you're accessing information

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.360
from the secure servers, as the Virtue

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.010
workstation. And the important thing to note is the fact that the clients have

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.540
to access information from the server over insecure links. What that means is

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.380
that in order to make sure that information that is sent

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.240
on the wire to the servers or received from the servers to the clients. They

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.970
have to be encrypted, since anyone can sniff the packets that are flowing

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.380
on these wires. But inside the vice,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.560
the communication that happens among the servers,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.630
because it is secure, there is no need for information encryption. The client

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.280
workstations run some flavor of Unix operating

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.230
system. So inside each client workstation, there

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.880
is a special process called Venus. And this process, which runs on the virtue

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.670
workstation, is for the purpose of authentication of the user, and for client

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.820
caching of files that the user may fetch from

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.380
device servers into the workstation that they're logging in to. The

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.500
user will use RPC in order to get the files

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.820
that they want to work on, on the workstation. And this is where Venus comes in.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.700
Venus is the one that authenticates a user walking

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.860
up to a virtue workstation, to the server and then acting as the surrogate

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.250
for the user, in fetching the files that he or she wants to work on from the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.620
file server using RPC. And since I mentioned that the link that is used to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
communicate between virtue and vice is insecure. The

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.540
RPC has to be a secure RPC. In

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.180
other words, the RPC messages, both passing the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.460
parameters and receiving the results, is going to use

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.870
encryption on the data that is being sent and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.580
received between the virtue and the vice file server.
