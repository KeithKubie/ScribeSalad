see for me one thing that always drives
me nuts when TV shows do it is that they

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800
me nuts when TV shows do it is that they
 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.829
me nuts when TV shows do it is that they
have supernatural shows that is is where

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:36.839
have supernatural shows that is is where
 

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.260
have supernatural shows that is is where
they have you or the main characters

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270
they have you or the main characters
 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.679
they have you or the main characters
fighting off their deepest fears

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:41.689
fighting off their deepest fears
 

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:44.059
fighting off their deepest fears
whatever their deepest fears may be and

whatever their deepest fears may be and
 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.499
whatever their deepest fears may be and

most of time it's you just like spiders
 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:46.879
most of time it's you just like spiders
or clowns and this is the other thing

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:46.889
or clowns and this is the other thing
 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:48.800
or clowns and this is the other thing
and then these shows they always show

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810
and then these shows they always show
 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.920
and then these shows they always show
that it's incredibly easy this happens

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930
that it's incredibly easy this happens
 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.510

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:04.399
just can't battle it that fast for the
most part and this is kind of one of

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:04.409
most part and this is kind of one of
 

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:06.499
most part and this is kind of one of
those things were Finn when he battled

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:06.509
those things were Finn when he battled
 

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:08.869

really back to in a sense but this shows

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560
really back to in a sense but this shows
 

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.550
really back to in a sense but this shows
that he still has those fears there just

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560
that he still has those fears there just
 

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.320
that he still has those fears there just
cuz he conquered those beasts are those

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:21.330

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:38.439
Sopranos where it did gon do it well but
 

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:40.139
Sopranos where it did gon do it well but
they go to one or two dreams like

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:40.149
they go to one or two dreams like
 

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:41.730
they go to one or two dreams like
whatever for a minute and they wakes up

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:41.740
whatever for a minute and they wakes up
 

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.730
whatever for a minute and they wakes up
but there's one episode where either

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740
but there's one episode where either
 

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.850
but there's one episode where either
half of it or like 70% of it was just

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:47.860
half of it or like 70% of it was just
 

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.920
half of it or like 70% of it was just
this dream and it didn't connect to

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:49.930
this dream and it didn't connect to
 

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.660
this dream and it didn't connect to
anything or if you read into it it might

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:51.670
anything or if you read into it it might
 

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.860
anything or if you read into it it might
connect to something but for the

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:52.870
connect to something but for the
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.290
connect to something but for the
majority of the episode it's this dream

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:55.300
majority of the episode it's this dream
 

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.429
majority of the episode it's this dream
and that's it and it really pissed me

00:09:59.429 --> 00:09:59.439
and that's it and it really pissed me
 

00:09:59.439 --> 00:10:01.050
and that's it and it really pissed me
off that there's a lot of people off and

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.060
off that there's a lot of people off and
 

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.240
off that there's a lot of people off and
it's because it didn't match the rest of

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.250
it's because it didn't match the rest of
 

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.939
it's because it didn't match the rest of
the show and it's okay if you do

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:05.949
the show and it's okay if you do
 

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:07.350
the show and it's okay if you do
something different but stuff to be in

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360
something different but stuff to be in
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.550
something different but stuff to be in
the spirit of the show and I really

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560
the spirit of the show and I really
 

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.769
the spirit of the show and I really
thought what this did is that every

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:10.779
thought what this did is that every
 

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:12.840
thought what this did is that every
episode still even if a lot of crazy

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:12.850
episode still even if a lot of crazy
 

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.059
episode still even if a lot of crazy
stuff is going on it still has a story

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:15.069
stuff is going on it still has a story
 

00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:18.300
stuff is going on it still has a story

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.699
it still has a focus or an agenda or a
quest or something going on it follows

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:20.709
quest or something going on it follows
 

00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:24.870
quest or something going on it follows
its own rules yeah and and this one

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880
its own rules yeah and and this one
 

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.150
its own rules yeah and and this one
