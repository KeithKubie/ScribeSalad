00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.814
- (Voiceover) When we first learn about cells,

00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:03.972
because of the visualizations that we often see in

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:06.365
textbooks or even some of the micrographs we

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:07.929
might see from microscopes,

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.774
we kind of imagine cells as these little balloons of

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.048
fluid with things floating around in them.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.442
So, this right over here,

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.346
this is a fairly common textbook visualization

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.111
of a cross section of the cell and we see

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.481
all of these important parts.

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.967
We see the nucleus.

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.684
We see the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:27.331
We see the Golgi apparatus.

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:29.120
We see mitochondria here.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.466
And the way that this is drawn,

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.535
it looks like they're just floating.

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.414
It looks like they're just floating in the cytosol.

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:37.826
And it is true that there is a lot of water in cells.

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.358
In fact, you are mostly water and

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.771
most of that water that makes up you is found in cells.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.652
But it turns out that these types of drawings

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:48.926
are missing a very crucial aspect of the structure of cells.

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:51.062
They are missing the cytoskeleton.

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.823
Cyto, cytoskeleton.

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:57.331
And this is still something that we are trying to

00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.118
understand better of what, how does the

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:00.465
cytoskeleton work and how does it help

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.461
the cell have its structure and move things around

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.084
and give it its shape.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:07.082
So cytoskeleton-it's one word,

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.986
but I've written the different parts of the words,

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.540
the different parts of the word,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.119
in different colors here because this literally means

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.536
"cell skeleton".

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.579
So if I were to actually try to visualize

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:17.786
this cytoskeleton here,

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:19.853
I have all sorts of these structures.

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:21.269
I'll use a different color.

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:23.965
I have all sorts of these structures criss-crossing the cell

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.028
in different ways that have proteins

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.816
bound to them and they're even moving

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.558
and they're growing and they can

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:30.997
help the cell move around or they can help

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:32.972
transport things within the cell and

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.828
other things could be lodged in them.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.452
And so it's a much, much, much, much more

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:39.769
complex thing that we're talking about than what

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.509
was depicted in this visualization before

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.063
I had my chance to scribble on it.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.387
And to help us visualize it,

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:47.942
I've found this picture.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.172
It's a public domain picture.

00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:50.543
And I found it fascinating cause it really helps

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.329
you think about the complexity that is going on

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:55.929
in even one of your cells.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.273
So, let's look at some of the structures over here.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:04.406
So, this thing that I'm kind of tracing right over here,

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.860
this is called a microfilament.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.391
This is a microfilament.

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.668
Let me write that.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.477
That's a microfilament.

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:20.555
And just to get a sense of the scale,

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.781
its diameter, so this diameter is

00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:25.801
gonna be about six or seven nanometers.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.677
So, approximately six to seven nanometers,

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.603
six to seven billionths of a meter.

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.090
And to have, to just get a sense of that relative

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.993
to the cell itself,

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:41.079
a typical cell could be six to seven micrometers

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.936
in diameter or larger.

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:45.373
So this is essentially one thousandth of

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.579
the diameter of the cell.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.320
So these things that I am drawing right over here,

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.175
these actually would not be that far off in terms of scale.

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:54.638
In fact, I'd probably want to draw it even thinner.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.868
And that's why you often won't see it in

00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:59.167
these diagrams cause you would have to draw it so thin.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.860
The diameter of one of these filaments is roughly,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.091
order of magnitude,

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:08.176
a thousandth of the diameter of a fairly typical cell.

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:09.661
But these things are incredibly important.

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:11.731
They help give the structure of the cell.

00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:15.222
They're made up of actin proteins.

00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:16.197
So you can see,

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:17.705
there's kind of these two actin,

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.608
you could kind of visualize them as ropes,

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.188
wrapped around each other.

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:24.881
And so this, the protein involved here.

00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:25.832
Let me do this.

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:27.550
I'm using that color too much.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.126
The protein involved in these microfilaments is actin.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.447
This is actin.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.909
And what's neat about these microfilaments

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.070
in a cell, as I said,

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.139
they help give structure.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.161
They help do all sorts of things.

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.737
They can actually be dynamically kind of

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:43.294
destroyed and created.

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:44.548
Their lengths can be changed.

00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:48.170
This can help a cell actually move and even more,

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.701
you can use them.

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.234
You can transport things along them.

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:52.674
You can pull and tug on them.

00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:54.368
And there's actually a fascinating interaction

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.689
between actin and what you see over here.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.197
This right over here,

00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:01.961
this is made up of myosin.

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.238
This is myosin.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.165
My-let me write this.

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:06.396
It's hard to see.

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:07.742
That is myosin.

00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:09.019
Myosin.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.784
And the relationship with actin, myosin can

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:14.569
act as kind of this thing that kicks along the myosin.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.497
And they can move relative to each other.

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:18.980
And this is essential for muscles contracting.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.115
It's fascinating to see that even things like proteins,

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:23.949
which are just made up of a bunch of amino acids,

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.689
they can interact in these fairly complex ways

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.778
that you can have these myosin things kick along

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:33.609
and move and tug on the actin.

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.745
So that's myosin right over there.

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.368
We see ribosomes.

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:40.064
These ribosomes are the ribosomes that

00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:41.597
are not attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:44.243
So these are free ribosomes around here.

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:46.751
So you can see it's incredibly, incredibly complex.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.656
You might say ok,

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:52.370
I see these microfilaments made up of actin.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.598
I see one, the one I outlined.

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:55.899
There's others over here.

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.476
I see another one right over here.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.519
I see one up over here.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:04.350
But what are these big tube-like structures

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.000
that we also see?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.137
So for example,

00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:08.322
what is this,

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:10.387
what are these tube-like structures?

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:13.843
Well these are called microtubules.

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:18.112
So, micro, microtubules.

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:21.562
And they look massive compared to the microfilaments,

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:24.929
but they're still fairly small on the cellular scale.

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:26.901
This is about 25 nanometers.

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:31.948
And once again these play a huge role

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:33.120
in the structure of cells.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.675
And they allow things to be organized and

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:35.789
things to be transported.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.810
And these are also dynamic pieces of the cell.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.038
And they can be constructed and they can be destroyed.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:43.382
And they can change the shape of the actual cells.

00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.403
And in animal cells,

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:46.214
the things I've just described are found in most cells,

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:47.445
but in animal cells,

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:49.907
you will also find things called intermediate filaments

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:52.067
that are actually in between these two in size

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:55.410
which also help maintain shape and do other things.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.871
So the whole point of this video is to

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.635
just give you even more appreciation.

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:01.470
Hopefully all the other videos we've had on cells

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.537
have given you appreciation for how much beauty

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.858
and how much complexity there are

00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:07.599
in things that a lot of times on an everyday level,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.527
we think of as something as simple as a cell.

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:11.896
But there's all this beauty and complexity to its

00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:13.893
structure that's often not even depicted

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:15.842
in the drawings of the cells that

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.072
you might find in your textbooks.

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:19.860
And to get a better appreciation,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.182
here are some public domain images

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:23.180
I found of cells where you can see the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.525
cytoskeleton actually colored in.

00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:28.055
And what you see in this picture in particular,

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.728
in this yellowish-green color,

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:32.328
this is actually cow lung cells right over here,

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:33.628
this yellowish-green structure,

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.903
these yellowish-green lines you see,

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:37.413
those are the microtubules.

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:40.060
And what you see in this pinkish or orangish color,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.987
these are the microfilaments.

00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.355
So you get a appreciation for how complex and

00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:47.675
structured these things that you used to think

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.759
were just big blobs actually are.
