1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,330
Should someone always be detached?
Okay. Straightforward question.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,033
The answer is no.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,560
Someone shouldn't always be detached
cause otherwise you aren't enjoying

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:16,540
anything in your life. So
don't always be attached,

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,950
detached. No. But at the
same time, that being said,

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,430
you should be aware all the time if you
are getting sucked into the emotional

7
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:33,130
vortex, right? You've got to be aware
of that. Once you have that awareness,

8
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:36,040
you don't need to be attached all
the time at all. Yeah, you can.

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,790
I'm not always detached at all,
but,

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,270
but I've got clear warning signs when
things start going sideways and I started

11
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,900
going down some vortex, I know immediately
and I just attach. So it's really easy.

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,811
It's,
but it's,

13
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:57,970
it does take practice and eventually
you realize that you know when you're

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:58,751
feeling overwhelmed,

15
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,390
when you're feeling emotional and
you're feeling angry or you're feeling

16
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:02,224
frustrated,

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,890
when you start feeling those things and
you've sent them really quickly and you

18
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:09,310
recognize them, you just
attach, boom, you're done.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,140
So that's what you've got to do.

20
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,950
Start recognizing those red flags so
that you can enjoy the good things.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,110
And when something starts getting
crazy, you can detach. Yes.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,200
So it's like an overall skill of being
able to control when to detach and when

23
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,660
you don't have to.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,460
Being able to identify
when you need to detach,

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,730
then being able to
detach then you're good.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,110
So it's like it's a matter of being
capable of making an accurate,

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,180
beneficial choice. Yes.
But the identification is
the hard part. Yes. People,

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,810
what happens to people when they talk
to me is they go the after the fact,

29
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,750
they realize I lost my temper
and I did this. Yeah. Okay.

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,020
You didn't detach it in time and
that's why you ended up there. Yeah.

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,410
So or I said some things to my,
you know,

32
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:59,980
my ex girlfriend that I shouldn't have
said cause I got to emotional. Exactly.

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,490
You didn't attach in time.
You got crazy and emotional.

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,780
So the skill that you're
missing is identifying when
you're starting to get too

35
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:12,070
emotional, whatever that emotion might
be. Once you identify it, boom, detach,

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,170
take control, then you can take
control. Yes. And make tactical moves,

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,310
not emotional moves. That's ultimately
the art, you know, to make the move.

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,310
You know how like did you two guys,
if they never actually know,

39
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,160
you know what the moves,
when you're emotionally detached,

40
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,280
the moves actually aren't that hard.
They're actually usually pretty obvious.

41
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,050
Like you're, you're in a fight
with your girlfriend and,

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,500
and you're starting to go down the wrong
lane. As soon as you detach, you go, oh,

43
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,334
I know what I need to do.

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,670
I should say I'm sorry and tell her that
we can go to the restaurant that she

45
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,050
wants to go to or whatever.
You know what I mean? The,

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,780
the movers are not actually that hard,

47
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
but we never make good moves when we're
being emotional. Instead we just go, no,

48
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:51,730
I don't want to go to that restaurant.
We went there three weeks to go,

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,390
I don't care if I said that to you. You
deserve me to say that to you. Yeah, yeah,

50
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,120
yeah. That, that's a, you
go down the wrong path.

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,440
But what if like detached the whole time,
even when problems don't arise,

52
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,140
you know, like then we don't have a
relationship. Right. That's what I mean.

53
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,200
That's a problem. That's what I'm
saying. [inaudible] all the time.

54
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,910
That's what I'm, that's the
answer to the question. Right?

55
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,940
So it's like you've reiterated
it for everyone. Yeah, man.

56
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,810
That's what I'm here for.

57
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,720
I think a lot of times you don't
have guys will ask you, Hey,

58
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,660
I want to learn Jujitsu. I want to
learn to mess people up. It's like, Bro,

59
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,730
that's not really what it is.
Did you get to,

60
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,180
is having the skills to
quote unquote mess people up?

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,540
But what you learn ultimately is you
put yourself in a position where you can

62
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,610
make that decision. Is it time to
mess someone up or not? You know?

63
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,880
And you just have to
control the situation.

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,770
So that's really what most people
that start with the vision. No,

65
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,810
I want to build a mess people up.
Most people continued that,

66
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:46,260
that do continue on the journey of what
you did to arrive at a point where they

67
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:49,980
realize that they don't want to abuse this
power that they now have. Most people,

68
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,310
yeah, there's a small percentage of
people that don't, that are bullies.

69
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,790
They were bullies when they started and
they become more effective. Bullies. Yeah.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,190
More fearful,
more more fear in posing bullies,

71
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,330
which sucks. But you did see his power.
That's why you got to have some of it.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,170
Yeah. Agree. But compare it to like a,

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,470
I dunno anything where it's like striking
based or whatever. It's like you,

74
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,320
it like I've said this for,
I'm not gonna go deep in it,

75
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:19,660
but you go from zero to 10 when you throw
a strike that's you're already at 10

76
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,580
you know, you can't just throw a light
one and be like, okay, are we cool now?

77
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:25,520
You know, kind of thing goes, not cool.
Nope. You slapped me in the face man.

78
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,970
Cool it all you brought it to 10
when he knocked him out or not.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,420
So because like I see,

80
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,450
I see my kids and what you're talking
about can happen very easily when other

81
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,960
people are in the group with my kids. I
mean, yeah cause they'd been training.

82
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,103
Did you get too,

83
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,250
so even like against any
normal kid there is no factor.

84
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,210
Yeah. Like I see me and my
son will be wrestling around
with some kids. No factor.

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,130
Yeah. And it's, you know, it's kind
of cool. Yeah. Cool. It's real cool.

86
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:59,250
Yeah. You know, my kids
aren't like Jujitsu,

87
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,780
like there's kids out there that are sick,
competitive, Jujitsu all the time. Yeah.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
Right. Yeah. That's not
what I'm talking about.

89
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:10,050
Like just knowing Jujitsu a
hundred percent correct. Yes. And,

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,990
but when I see kids doing Jujitsu,
especially like,

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,660
I'm not saying in the necessarily,
even in a tournament,

92
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm just saying in Jujitsu, in
class, even at the beach or whatever,

93
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,710
when I see them, I'm like, man,

94
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,890
I wish I could have done
Jujitsu when I was a little kid.

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,900
You don't find that it'd be, yeah,
man. Yeah. Make up for it now. Try it.
