00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This problem is very similar to the previous problem,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but now we're going to add a bit of friction.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So now let's say that we have a hill of height of 45 m

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and again we have our car which will go down the track through the loop and continue on.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Remember, the car needs to be going at least 10 m/sec as it goes through the top of the loop.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This question isn't so much about designing a roller coaster.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here, it's already designed. Now, I want to know about maintaining a roller coaster.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's say after expecting the track, one of your maintenance workers finds that,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
actually, this region of track which I've highlighted in black,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
has gone a bit rusty and as a result, it's not so smooth.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, instead of sliding smoothly, the car grinds a little bit.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Clearly, this is probably not a good thing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Just how much friction could there be to still allow the car to make it through this loop?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The question is what the maximum frictional force and remember there's only friction over this 20 m

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the rest of the track, we're assuming is still nice and smooth.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What's the maximum force that would still allow the car to make it through this loop?

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
