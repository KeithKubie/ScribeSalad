00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:01.708
- [Voiceover] So we have h of x

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:05.134
is equal to five x to the
1/4th power plus seven.

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:07.627
And we wanna find what is h prime of 16,

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:09.293
or what is the derivative of this function

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:11.724
when x is equal to 16?

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:12.971
And like always, pause this video

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.378
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:16.268
All right, well let's just take

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:17.998
the derivative of both sides of this.

00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:21.147
So on the left hand side,
I'm gonna have h prime of x,

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.390
and on the right hand side,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.797
well the derivative of
the right hand side,

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:25.843
I can just take the derivative
of five x to the 1/4th

00:00:25.843 --> 00:00:27.399
and add that to the derivative,

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.732
with respect to x of seven.

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:33.260
So the derivative of five
x to the 1/4th power,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.287
well, I can just apply
the power rule here.

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:36.120
You might say, wait, wait wait,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.041
there's a fractional exponent,

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.131
and I would just say, that's okay.

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.636
The power rule is very powerful.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:43.872
So we can multiply the
1/4th times the coefficient.

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:47.522
So you have five times 1/4th

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:51.022
x to the 1/4th minus one power.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.769
That's the derivative of
five x to the 1/4th power.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.677
And then we have plus seven.

00:00:56.677 --> 00:00:59.030
Now what's the derivative of seven,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.527
with respect to x?

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.535
Well seven doesn't
change with respect to x.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:03.504
The derivative of a constant,

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:06.026
we've seen this multiple
times, is just zero.

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:08.268
So it's just plus zero.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.285
And now we just have to simplify this.

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:13.259
So this is gonna be h prime of x

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.759
is equal to 5/4ths x to the,

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:21.275
what's 1/4th minus one?

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.164
Well that's negative 3/4ths.

00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:25.659
That's 1/4th minus 4/4ths,
or negative 3/4ths.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.826
So 5/4ths x to the
negative 3/4ths plus zero,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.241
so we don't have to write that.

00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.016
And now let's see if we can evaluate

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:36.698
this when x is equal to 16.

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:39.865
So, h prime of 16 is 5/4ths

00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:46.900
times 16 to the negative 3/4ths.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.144
Well that's the same thing as

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:54.311
5/4ths times one over 16 to the 3/4ths,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.367
which is the same thing
as 5/4ths times one over,

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.131
let's see, I could view this as

00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:09.214
16 to the 1/4th, and then cubing that.

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.784
And so, what is this?

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:14.919
16 to the 1/4th is two,

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.533
and then you cube two.

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.439
Two to the third power is
eight, so that's eight.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.144
So you have 5/4ths times 1/8th,

00:02:22.144 --> 00:02:23.787
which is going to be equal to

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:25.974
five times one is five,

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:28.557
and then four times eight is...

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:32.000
four times eight is 32.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.333
And we are done.
