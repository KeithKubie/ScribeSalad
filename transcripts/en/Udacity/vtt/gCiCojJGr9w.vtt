00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.400
The media queries used most often for

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.890
responsive web design are,
min-width, and max-width.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.810
Max-width rules are applied
any time the viewport width,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.138
is less than the value specified.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:18.075
For example, max-width 500 pixels
is matched when the viewport is

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:20.370
500 pixels or less.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.720
It's also possible to create queries
based on min device width, or

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.480
max device width, but
this is strongly discouraged.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.740
The difference is subtle,
but very important.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.250
Min width, is based on the size
of the browser window.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.610
Where as min device width,
is based on the size of the screen.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.470
In addition using device width,
can prevent content from

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.370
adapting on desktops or other desktops
that allow the windows to be resized.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.450
Because the query is based on the actual
device size, not the browser window.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.910
The other reason some browsers, [COUGH],

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
the Legacy Android browser,
may report the wrong value.
