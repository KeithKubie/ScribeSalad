1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,390
We're good.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,280
Roy Wood jr. how are
you sir? Man, pleasure.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,250
Pleasure to have you on here man. And
when you shake fun of these guys alive.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,040
I don't solutely you are
just trying to pay bills.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,710
Probably one of the funniest
guys out there, man.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,370
I'm very excited to have
you in here. Foxconn.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,730
And we were talking shit
about Apple and electronics.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,070
Apples fucking you out here. So

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,700
got the new back book right and the new
Mac book with the new OLS or whatever it

10
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,790
is. It doesn't fuck with the
old versions or final cut.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,380
The old video editing software.

12
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:40,010
I used to use new Matt but goes you got
buy that shit again. I'm like my n***a,

13
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:44,430
I just paid for that shit a hundreds of
dollars with my last computer and now I

14
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,010
got to give you, you telling me
my old software, no good. But the,

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,200
and you could make the software work
with the new O S if you want it to,

16
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:54,410
but they don't want to get you to
mind again and all that shit so dirty.

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,250
So now I'm having to learn Adobe
premiere. I was pretty good.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,480
But final cut but I'm
having to swap out and yeah,

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,530
I've got to relearn a whole new thing
and if I'm going to do that then I may as

20
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:08,420
well relearn a whole new
piece of electronics.

21
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,510
But to do that means I
have to gut everything.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,480
That means you have to gut the Apple
TV, you have to let go of the iPhone,

23
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,620
you have to let go of the iPad.
My girlfriend had the whole house.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,260
The companies get you. So everybody in
the house, even my son, he had a Samsung,

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,470
he had a Samsung tablet and I was
like get that shit outta here.

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,990
You had to get you a iPad. So we re
gifted that and then got in my eyes.

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,050
So it's like nah man.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,820
Fierce about that Mac versus Android
shit as much as they do about like

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,100
Republicans versus demo [inaudible]

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,340
I want something where I don't have to
keep paying for the same shit over and

31
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,750
over again every three, four years.

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,970
Apple makes great shit, but they fucked,

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,850
the interface is so smooth. It's so
convenient. I can check text messages,

34
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,960
I can do whatever I want on my Mac
book. Yes, I can talk to my television,

35
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:59,220
I can one click and all the app pay
and all of that stuff. It's beautiful,

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,430
but in three years it's
time to pay up again.

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,600
I almost switched over
a couple years back.

38
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:08,620
I bought a pixel and the pixel two came
out but then when it came out I couldn't

39
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:11,410
get text messages and I had a,

40
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,830
I got an email Apple and ask them to take
my email address off of the I message

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,110
database in order for you.

42
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:25,510
I'm like take that email off so that I
can't get I messages anymore and it still

43
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:28,390
didn't work. I went online to
try to figure out what is a way,

44
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:32,700
how do you get out of this? How does
this work? You can't, no. And if you,

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,430
unless you switch over to text message
for a long period of time beforehand,

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,130
like switch your iMessages to
text messages on your Apple,

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,130
on your phone or unless
you buy a new number,

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,400
you got to kind of buy it is if you're
going to get an an a Samsung phone or

49
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,030
something, you gotta
get a new number. What

50
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,020
got you, what, when did you make the
switch to Apple in the first one second.

51
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,910
What was the thing forever?
But what was the Genesis?

52
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:57,110
At some point you had to have had like
a Sangio 59 that was my old flip phone.

53
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,960
Shout out to CGU. Um, I remember
when I was in radio, uh,

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,460
back home in Birmingham, I
was gifted an iPod touch.

55
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,110
Oh yeah. And I was all Android
phones, Android, everything.

56
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,920
And I had an iPod touch and at the time
all I had to play music was the mini

57
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,190
disc player. So I could only hold
like five hours. I mean, this is like,

58
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,120
Oh one Oh two and I had a five
hour minutes and I go, fuck it.

59
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,120
I'll carry around the iPod touch
and then it made more sense.

60
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,050
Why am I carrying an iPod touch and an
Android phone when I could just have an

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,020
iPhone that does both. And
that started the journey.

62
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,740
I started with iPhone one but
before that I was using Mac books.

63
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,280
I was using Mac forever. But
even before they had an iPhone,

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,470
I used to make my own PCs or used to
go to the store, like go to Fry's,

65
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,230
buy a motherboard, buy hard
drives all time for that.

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,530
That's a it you gotta you gotta want
to do that? Like it was for me. I was,

67
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,520
I wanted to find out
how to do it and it was,

68
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,820
it was cool to play games on a
computer that I put together myself.

69
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,730
But then you knew how to like, so
you're building the games as well.

70
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,560
Are you going out and buying
the floppy disc and all that?

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,540
Um, I'm not definitely not building
any games. I would just, you know,

72
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,910
like I'd buy video games,
just play them on this,

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
but even format in it
and doing everything,

74
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,920
I would have to call friends that really
knew what the fuck was up and they'd

75
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,030
have to talk me through shit.

76
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:18,720
There's some things you'd have
to do in the bios and you know,

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,910
the irony of all of this is that I still
have an AOL email address as much as I

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,230
bitch about it. Really? Yeah,
I know. And you know what?

79
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,760
I don't understand email slander.
It's like my fucker. It's,

80
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,710
I'm sending you words electronically.
Does it matter what company?

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,650
What does it need? Is
my email more ghetto?

82
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:44,280
Does it come with chicken grease
stains when you open it in your lap?

83
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,050
No,

84
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,220
it's the same words that if I send it
from Gmail now I have a Gmail account so

85
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:52,850
that people will take me seriously when
I emailed them about business ideas.

86
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:57,610
But I still have an old school AOL email
that I've had since college and I'm

87
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,300
like, it's fine.

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,060
It's a one. It's one of those things
though when you just don't let it go.

89
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,020
And just think about you've got mail.

90
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,930
You remember when you first heard
that you've got [inaudible].

91
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,640
They were happy. [inaudible]
someone want to talk to me.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,270
It was very exciting to talk to me and
then you get older and you realize what,

93
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:19,230
please leave me alone. Who the
fuck is this? No, God. Male. Yeah.

94
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,480
It was exciting. It was like a new thing.

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,370
That was 96 that's when I
got to five. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:31,371
95 96 we had an old CompuServe account
at the house and that was how we got

97
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:38,280
online and then we started getting
the AOL disc and all of that shit.

98
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,890
We had a Compaq Presario too.

99
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,240
Oh, I had one of those.
I had one of those.

100
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:49,241
I started out with one of those old Macs
that was like a beige box member with

101
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,130
[inaudible]. Yeah. I don't
remember what number it was,

102
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:54,500
but it was 95 94 somewhere around there.

103
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,771
I don't know.

104
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,670
That might be like the O G Mac book
where the keyboard in the CPU was its own

105
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,980
little, like heavy.

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,371
No.

107
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,420
You had a keyboard that had plug in a
monitor that you had to plug in and it was

108
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,830
like a tower. I was like a
beige funky looking tower.

109
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,060
It was slow as shit. It was
14 four modem. Come on. Yeah,

110
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:17,030
14 four I remember when you got
56 cat. I couldn't believe it.

111
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:20,330
Look at the speed a, wasn't that Jamie?

112
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,280
It was a a monitor. Didn't have
the floppy disc built into it.

113
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,590
I don't think it's hard to remember.
I remember it being, there was a,

114
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,610
an actual tower and it wasn't a joint

115
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,820
where the whole computer was like the
monitor itself or the computer on CPU all

116
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:36,250
together.

117
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,290
No, but man, I thought I
was living in the future.

118
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,490
I couldn't believe something like that.
Jamie bro, my older brother had. Yeah,

119
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:45,100
that one on the far
right. That was it. Moda.

120
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,690
I had a Mac book, man.

121
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,760
It had an old school Macintosh and in
90s and he had Microsoft flight simulator

122
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,690
and you couldn't tell me shit. I
go to his house for five hours,

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,830
would just fly assessments
in real time like I get it.

124
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,360
I get why people will sit down with the
flight simulator and fly in real time

125
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:08,380
from LA to San Francisco, seen the
new ones they have. Oh, it's unreal,

126
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,070
but pretty neat.

127
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,350
I would need to buy a PC and then
I knew I wouldn't get shit done.

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,030
Have you ever used the HTC
Vive? No. Oh, what's the one?

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,910
What is it? Virtual reality. We
have one here. Oh, the whole helmet.

130
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,020
Sit down joint dude.

131
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,530
My kids come here and they battle
to the death to see who gets the VR.

132
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:28,190
They fight each other. Punching,
kicking shit. It's amazing, man.

133
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,700
You put this thing on and like
you're in another world. You're,

134
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,400
you're fighting zombies. You're in
the ocean with, with, with whales.

135
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,800
I went to a Samsung event and they had
some AR type experience where you put the

136
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:42,610
phone on and it's fun. But then I just,
I don't know. In the back of my head,

137
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:46,300
I can't get, I can't get out of my
head how goofy I look to someone else.

138
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,550
So it's almost like
something I gotta do alone.

139
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,080
Yes, you look goofy, you look
really goofy when you play.

140
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,400
There's a boxing game though,

141
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,010
that you can get a great
workout in like a legitimate,

142
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,260
great workout because
this dude comes at you,

143
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,320
you see me throwing punches
and every time he hits her,

144
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:04,560
you see a bright white spark. You feel
like you're getting hit. It's wild, man.

145
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,900
You're moving around and bobbing and
ducking punches, throwing combinations.

146
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,700
If your feet start hurting,
right, your hands get tired.

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,540
Is that going to catch on for real,
Joe? Is this like the Nintendo?

148
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,530
We when it first came out,
no, he's getting bored.

149
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,850
You're going to lose calories with the
Nintendo wee and then you're just a fat

150
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:22,720
bastard on the couch and learning how
I learned how to bowl sitting down with

151
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,554
the we

152
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,150
Ken, you can get in
shape with this for real.

153
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,840
Like if you wanted to do multiple
rounds of boxing with this thing,

154
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,110
you would get in some serious
fucking shape because it feels real.

155
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,560
When you put that headset on and you're
that dudes in front of you and he comes

156
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:40,070
towards you and he's got his hands
up and then throw a punch. It's like,

157
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,830
Oh shit, and you're moving
around. He's swinging at you.

158
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,320
You see the punches flying
over your head. It's awesome.

159
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,500
Now, this isn't something
that's predictive in a sense,

160
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,410
or is it like different types of
workouts at different types of sparring

161
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:54,700
sessions? Because eventually you can
predict if you knew the patterns,

162
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,430
it's still a workout.

163
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,190
Yeah, it's a good workout, but either
way you're fucking this dude up.

164
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,200
That's the whole idea. The whole
idea is to keep it on them.

165
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,050
It's not like you hit, you don't
feel anything. If he hits you,

166
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,200
you just see the spark
that's next. Ain't no,

167
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,890
they'll have a vis that vibrates it and
then it gets electrolysis and, yeah,

168
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,860
yeah, yeah. There's a haptic
feedback vest that you wear.

169
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,150
There's a place called the void.

170
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,110
He'd go there and as a star Wars game
and the storm troopers are shooting you

171
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,950
and they hit you in the chest.
He feel like my shit hurt.

172
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,970
Like does it hurt or is it like
just a sensation? Just a sensation.

173
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,010
Like laser tag. Yeah, exactly like it,
but it'll get bores. Yeah. It's again,

174
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,840
they're, they're doing
these warehouses now.

175
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,960
When you go into a warehouse and it's
all virtual reality and so they have

176
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,570
everything planned out and like
you walk on a cross as beam,

177
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:40,140
there's fire to the left you and fire
to the rights. You feel heat. It's all,

178
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,930
it's gone now. That's dope. They
have it set up to make it, you know,

179
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,750
really sort of mimic whatever
sensation you're supposed to.

180
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,190
No, the guy that I would be, I
would be all in for, you know,

181
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,190
when I was listening to you coming up,

182
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,670
like you started talking about the
sensory deprivation chambers and I'm like,

183
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,210
that's always been something that's in
the back of my head if we want to do it.

184
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,960
It's like, do you have any time
today? You could do it. Um,

185
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,790
I don't know how much time I have
after let, let's see. It's it, I know,

186
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,920
cause I know it's a mind fuck. It's a
little bit of a mind fuck. Yeah. But it's,

187
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,030
it's, it's one of those things
where I go, when I get a house,

188
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm getting a grill and I'm getting
one of those goddamn Joe Rogan boxes.

189
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,663
That's what I call them.

190
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,320
Getting one of them Joe Rogan boxes
and I'm putting that shit in my fucking

191
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,240
man-cave. Everybody should
have an isolation tank. It's a,

192
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,350
it's a fucking beautiful
thing to have man. It just,

193
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:30,890
it settles your mind like
nothing else. Yeah. That's,

194
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,060
that's the thing that I always
struggle with is just too many.

195
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,500
I got too many tabs open, of course,
at all times. And so is comics too.

196
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,020
Yeah. And the only thing that slows me
down is video games and puzzles. Puzzles.

197
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,370
Yeah. My putting pictures,
jigsaw and Sudoku.

198
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,191
Ah, does it,

199
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:54,290
like those are the three things that I
can do that I know immediately the moment

200
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:58,130
I start the activity, everything closes
and I'm just focusing on one thing.

201
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,400
That's the only thing I can do when
I need to get my mind off of stuff.

202
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,820
I was dating this girl one
time and get on. You're not,

203
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,920
you're in the middle of an argument
and so you're trying not to,

204
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,990
you're trying not to be
a Dick in the moment.

205
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,520
So I just start doing the puzzle and just
trying to stay calm and then she walks

206
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:17,930
over and just starts undoing
the puzzle as I'm doing.

207
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,720
Oh my goodness. Oh fuck. Oh my
goodness. I'm doing, Oh, the anger

208
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,500
sign. That's a sign of
someone's intentions.

209
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,370
When someone's fun doing your puzzle,
like, Oh, you're one of those things.

210
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,310
This is my place. This is the one
place I can go and just be escalate.

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,940
Deescalate. Yeah.

212
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,190
Yeah. Well that's bad intentions. Yeah.

213
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,530
That's like seriously bad intentions.
Someone trying to undo your puzzle. Yeah.

214
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,900
That's some shitty kids will
fight to the death over that.

215
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,850
I'm gonna say the place
to start [inaudible] like

216
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,000
when we eat smokers say you
fucking up. They're high. Right,

217
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,950
I understand that now. Yeah,
that's, that's the one thing.

218
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,950
I'm not with her anymore. No, no, no,
no. I crashed that. You can't, I'll,

219
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,830
I'll take responsibility on that. We
got puzzles. That's my thing. Man.

220
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,800
Puzzles and a little bit of
video again and bad and cages.

221
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,020
I'd love to help Mark Ellison
and Craig. That would be amazing.

222
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,420
But you need a lot of space.
You need like Ellie yard? Yeah,

223
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,040
I'm in New York right now. There's
nowhere to put a few live in the city.

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,750
There's no way to fucking, do
you like living in the city? No.

225
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,440
Why are you there? Cause the
daily show, it's gonna work.

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,550
So that's where the fucking job is.
I take the train to Brooklyn. Yeah,

227
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,210
I thought about it at first, but then I
had a kid the same year I got the show,

228
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,290
so I needed to be closer.
So we got to Harlem.

229
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,430
So Harlem is at least the shorter
commute to the studio. How far?

230
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,730
Where's the studio studios on West
side Hills kitchen on the water.

231
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,790
So it's like 53rd 54th street and
we're liking the one thirties so no,

232
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,670
it's, yeah, it's closer
than Brooklyn. Right.

233
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,430
Which was where I was originally
when I first got to New York.

234
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,570
Did you take the subway from Brooklyn?
Like yay. I tried to be a city boy.

235
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,700
The problem is that I've gotten more done
career wise in New York and four years

236
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:05,290
and then I did the eight years I was in
LA probably because of the show. Yeah,

237
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,190
it's just New York. It's just more, I
just, there's more of a hustle mentality.

238
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,960
Really. Yeah, I think so.

239
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,700
I think that I'm more prone to run into
comics that are going, going, going,

240
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,940
going, going. And so when you're
around that it makes you want to,

241
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,871
Glenn makes you want to write,

242
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,360
cause you see so-and-so working on
a new bit and doing all of that.

243
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,850
And I didn't see as much of that in LA.

244
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,880
Now granted you don't get to do as many
sets in LA because of the logistics of

245
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:31,570
the city. But I just felt like
there was more of a go, go,

246
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:34,960
go mentality that just rubs off
on you more because of that.

247
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,040
You don't get to socialize. Uh,
all of my friends are in LA,

248
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,150
so a lot of social relationships have
suffered because New York is go, go,

249
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:46,540
go and you're trying to get
the next career thing done.

250
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,480
And then you also got to
go home and be a dad. Yeah.

251
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,170
That's gotta be weird raising kids
in LA or in New York too, rather. Um,

252
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,280
I talked to, um, Gaffigan about that.
He's raised all his kids in New York city.

253
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,580
Yeah. And they're in like Manhattan or
they're in Jersey. Where in Manhattan?

254
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,340
He's been in Manhattan
forever. Yeah, I don't,

255
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:06,640
I don't know if that's
something not for the long run.

256
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,020
How old your kid is three now.

257
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,820
So he's young enough so
that it will leave him.

258
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,450
Come on back out to LA Roy.

259
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,300
Either LA or I would go to Atlanta
or the last grade or some shit.

260
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,320
That's a good move. Nate BARR gas, he's
shown us the recipe. What's he live in?

261
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,610
Well, you know, he's, I know he's,

262
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:28,390
I think he's got a place down South in
Atlanta. No, in Nashville. Oh no shit.

263
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,910
Yeah. Listen, those are
both great cities. If you,

264
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,420
if you're traveling on the road all the
time and you just need a base, you know,

265
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,720
and look man, you live, I have a buddy
of mine lives outside of Nashville.

266
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,940
He fucking takes pictures of his yards.
It's all green. I hear birds chirping,

267
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,180
shit, you know. Yeah. You knew
rateable. You need yard man.

268
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,900
I grew up with a yard and you know, so
that, and then family and it's just,

269
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,750
it's a, I feel like New
York is a great place to go,

270
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,640
but it's not the best place to
start necessarily. Yeah. As a child.

271
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,550
But I mean like guys start in LA,
people can start anywhere. I mean,

272
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:06,390
it's better starting and it's better
start in there than like a place that

273
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,580
doesn't have much of a
scene. Like maybe Phoenix.

274
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:10,120
Phoenix has like a little bit of a scene.

275
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,850
Oh yeah. My first nine years were all
Southern. I was a road guy at Alabama.

276
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,410
I started in Tallahassee and
Birmingham where like those days I can,

277
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:22,410
98 open mic was once
a month per city. Wow.

278
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,210
So every week if you wanted to get on,

279
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,940
you had to get on the Greyhound
and go to another fucking city.

280
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,020
That's commitment. So that's the only
way. And then we started creating stages,

281
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,780
like in the panhandle life from
Fort Walton over to Jacksonville.

282
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:34,860
You started meeting? Yeah.

283
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:39,000
You form a little fucking network and
this guy's got a Monday night at a shit

284
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:39,301
hole.

285
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,930
This guy's got a Tuesday night at
another shit hole and looking back on it,

286
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:47,040
it was all trashed age time. That's
the best you could do until you move.

287
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,510
It is amazing though. How many guys
have crafted careers? Just doing that,

288
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,270
like the will, the will to do,

289
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,840
do time and defined spots and
to find place to work out.

290
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,470
I wouldn't make the argument that I'm
better off now as a comic 20 years in

291
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,800
having started on the road instead
of starting in a major market.

292
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,830
Just because I feel like when you're a
road guy you meet every version of what

293
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:18,690
your career could end up being when
you're young. Because if you're,

294
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,880
if you're San Fran, if
you're a big city comic,

295
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,930
you only hanging with your peers. You
run into the big wigs every now and then,

296
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:27,810
but at some high end Bible shit at the
comedy club and then they go on their

297
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:28,500
way.

298
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
But when you do a weekend with Ron white
and you get to watch him properly night

299
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,490
after night after night, that's a fucking
tutorial and that's a fucking gift.

300
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,380
And then you can do what weekend?

301
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:43,320
The very next weekend with a guy
who's been doing it 30 years,

302
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:48,270
hadn't written a new joke and 15
burnout, alcoholic hates his kids,

303
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,133
hates his wife.

304
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,350
And once I got to LA you
start seeing, well, no,

305
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,720
I know to avoid that because
I'll end up like that dude.

306
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,660
I know not to do that because I'll end
up like that. That was a comic, goddamn,

307
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,160
I can't name names. There
was a comic that used to,

308
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,340
he won custody of his child and the one
thing in the court order was that she

309
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,880
could not be around the comedy
club. So you know what he did if I,

310
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,910
William brought her around the
comedy club. So as this feature,

311
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,650
I watched his seven year old while
he would go out and do his set.

312
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,570
Oh Jesus. Yeah, but that,

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,650
that's the last that he was kid
because of that. I don't know.

314
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:30,200
I haven't seen him since. Fuck,

315
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,910
you can't bring your kids seven year olds.

316
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,940
I brought my kids when they were like a
nine and seven outside a comedy club and

317
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:42,820
I let them, I let them peek in. It was
at the improv in Irvine. And I said,

318
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,440
cause we were all down there having dinner
together. And I did my show. And uh,

319
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,040
they, they were like around
the corner. I said, come on,

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,160
let me take you backstage. I'll
show you what it's like. And I,

321
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,930
and the show was about to start
and I had my daughter like come on,

322
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:58,200
peak out peak out there. And she's like,
Oh my God, look at all those people.

323
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:01,500
I would say on stage, I was like, Oh
Ron stage. It's like, should I no,

324
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,710
don't run on stage. Come back.
And that's safe. That's safe.

325
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:07,280
But to have them listen
to your shit. Nope.

326
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,380
What that taught me was the importance
of how important it is who you end up

327
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:17,250
with as it relates to your career.
How's it can choke your career.

328
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,460
Cause a lot of the guys that I started
with, you know, a lot of road guys,

329
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,750
they're not doing it anymore or they're
doing it at the same level that they

330
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:29,751
were at 98 and a lot of them I can point
to dating the wrong person who attacked

331
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:34,230
their psyche and their self esteem
in that three, four year window.

332
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,030
Cause I feel like every year
you get another opportunity
to skip a level. Right?

333
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,610
Right. And if you don't skip that
level, you go back down to levels.

334
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,650
And so these guys are trying to go from
here to here and you're with someone

335
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,010
that's attack. Why are you doing
that? You shouldn't be doing that.

336
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,120
There was a guy that used to take me
on the road with him down South, um,

337
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,170
kind of want some mentorship type
shit. And we would go do gigs.

338
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,220
And if it was within
four hours of the city,

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,060
his wife would roll, his wife would roll.

340
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,390
And both kids are in the
back seat, car seat age.

341
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,430
It's like nine o'clock in Georgia and
we're just riding together to a fucking

342
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,264
gig.

343
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,420
We would do the show and then in exchange
for an opportunity for stage time,

344
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,470
I would drive this family back home and
then I would go home and sleep in my

345
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,970
bed. But we didn't spend the night.

346
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:26,160
The family would stay at the
hotel while we did the show,

347
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,130
and then we would get back in the
car and drive the fuck back home.

348
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,570
Knowing what I know now, he
was fucking chicks on the road.

349
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,530
Ah.

350
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,040
And the only way she was comfortable with
him still doing standup was if she got

351
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:45,850
the role. Interesting. And that's
gotta be stressful. He fucked up.

352
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,680
He fucked up. But he tried to have both.

353
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,870
He tried to say that both he tried to
save to career and tried to save the

354
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,100
marriage. Yeah.

355
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,080
And I think who you deal with outside
the business is as important as how you

356
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,250
handle yourself in the business.

357
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
I understand that her
position and that one,

358
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,700
I understand that her more than I
understand the lady who was undoing your

359
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,900
puzzle. I don't understand that.
I don't understand that mindset.

360
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:10,590
That's a different mindset. A woman,
Alicia solution. That makes sense. Yeah.

361
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,820
She's trying to figure out a
problem. Well the solutions problem.

362
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,570
You still want to do comedy or I'm
coming with you. That makes sense.

363
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:19,170
You shouldn't have a three year old
in a car seat for eight hours on no

364
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,530
Wednesday night. No, no, no. Just
cruising the freeway. Yeah. Oof.

365
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,730
But if that's the proposition she presents
to you in order for you to continue

366
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:30,060
doing your career, then you know, you
either got to take it or leave it.

367
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,120
Yeah. Comedy is a tricky one man,
because in order to do it correctly,

368
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,930
you have to do it almost all the
time. You gotta be up all the time.

369
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,460
I got a good situation where
my kids are in bed by like,

370
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:45,940
you know, eight o'clock on a week
night and that's when I leave.

371
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,130
Yeah.

372
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,700
I kiss them goodnight,
you know, and uh, I,

373
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,660
my spots in the store usually around
10, so, uh, I'll just roll in, you know,

374
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,600
I'll hang up my wife for a little
bit and then I'll drive into town.

375
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,140
It's perfect.

376
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,580
But when do you evil sense?

377
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:05,581
Cause that's where I start running into
overlap and time is figuring out the

378
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:09,640
execution of comedy versus
the preparation to do comedy.

379
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,650
Mm. So reviewing the set, watching
tapes, well a big one. Yeah.

380
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,410
A big one for me is the
drive there and home.

381
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,400
So it's 35 minutes to the
store, 35 minutes home.

382
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
So that's when I'm reviewing material.

383
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:26,020
I listen to recordings so they
have it Bluetooth on my phone.

384
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,410
So I do that through the speakers of the,

385
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,100
of the car and that helps a lot.
That helps a lot. That's gigantic.

386
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,590
You know, like uh, it
also puts me into mind.

387
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,940
I feel like the more sets you do,
right, the tidy your standup is,

388
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,980
but the more focus you put on your set,

389
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,500
like it's almost as good
as like a half a set.

390
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,040
Like listening to a full set
is like a doing a half a set.

391
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,030
That's how I think about it.

392
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,480
I feel like the same way you found all
the extra that you found all the fat to

393
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:56,470
trim. Yeah. You find the fat to trim and
you also find like a spark. Like, Oh,

394
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:59,750
why did I say that? Ooh, there
might be something there. And then,

395
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,540
and then you've got to
write that down. And then,

396
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,220
and then I spent time just going over
scribbles like right here, you know,

397
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,820
like straight pride parade, like a
little, okay. A little scribbles.

398
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,610
You know what I mean? Like, okay, what
was I thinking there? Oh, that's right,

399
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,444
that's right. It's right there.

400
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,290
And then I'll start adding stuff together
and then I spend time just straight

401
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,480
out writing the straight
out writing times.

402
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,720
Almost always when everyone's asleep.
So like when I come home from the store,

403
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,600
it's like midnight or something like
that that everyone has to pass time,

404
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:30,400
spark up a joint, fire up the old
fucking laptop. And that's when I ride.

405
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,911
There's, there's a time,

406
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:35,750
the thing that I struggled with
the most in writing is consumption.

407
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,940
Um,

408
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Chappelle says something years ago in a
magazine about how every comedian needs

409
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:47,981
to understand how their joke machine
works and identifying the stimuli that you

410
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,210
were encountering during the time when
you are having a creative high in your,

411
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,900
in the writing cycle, when ideas
are just popping in, coming to you,

412
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,570
document what was happening,

413
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,270
what was going on during that time and
do your best to recreate those situations

414
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,510
and scenarios to inspire writing
when you have writer's block.

415
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,790
So I know for me it's stuff that
bores me or stuff that annoys me,

416
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,780
be it reading, magazines, TV, whatever.

417
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:19,781
So I have to find time to watch it that
I don't like or can't stand because I

418
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:25,121
know my mind will wander into a place
where I can write some stuff but like to

419
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:29,120
physically just sit and consume television
and that's what I have to start doing

420
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,760
on the go. Like I get it now. Like, I
used to think these people were stupid,

421
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:35,180
and now I'm one of those people who walks
around staring at the fucking phone,

422
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,630
watching my DVR on the train or something
because I have to constantly take in

423
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:45,110
so that when it is time to write that
there's something that there's something

424
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,070
writing there.

425
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,120
I had a conversation with Theo Von
about this last night where he, uh,

426
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,260
he's burnt out and he had a cancel
some shows and I said, what's going on?

427
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:58,190
And he said, man, he goes, I just been
going too hard, too hard, too much,

428
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,360
too many weekends, you know, nine shows
a week over and over and over again.

429
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:06,350
Seven, eight, nine, 10 weeks in a row.
He goes, I just, I need to stop. He goes,

430
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:09,260
I'm not taking anything in recovery.
He goes, everything I'm putting,

431
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,140
I'm just putting everything out. He goes,
I didn't know. I had nothing to say.

432
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,370
Everything seems fake when I'm saying
it. Like I feel, I've felt, you know,

433
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,031
that, you know,

434
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:20,030
you laugh when you felt that spot where
you feel like everything you're saying

435
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,160
feels fake. Like you're just bullshitting.

436
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,450
Yeah. I, I'm trying to,

437
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,230
I'm still working on a lot more stuff
that has more teeth to it and I'm starting

438
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:31,440
to become obsessed as in the word,

439
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,470
but there's something noodle in at me
about veterans and the trajectory of

440
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,720
veterans when they come back
from war and all of that shit.

441
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,040
And I was trying to work on a bit about
Vietnam and started watching this Ken

442
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:51,930
burns documentary that's on
Netflix right now. And it's like,

443
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:52,910
it's fucking crazy. Like they,

444
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,980
they interviewed North Vietnamese
soldiers as well. Like I ain't never,

445
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,620
ain't never in my life.
So you know shit like,

446
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:02,970
cause normally Vietnam is always told
from our POV and they're sitting down with

447
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,820
just straight out via Carla. Yeah. We
was trying to get them motherfuckers,

448
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,680
we'd set them up like an remorseful in
the sense of speaking about the war from

449
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,980
their perspective and going and,

450
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,760
and it tells the story from
both sides and so it changed,

451
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,110
it altered how I want to tell the joke.

452
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:23,190
And that's the stuff that you have to
do from time to time to make sure that

453
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:27,200
your jokes aren't weighted to
one to one side that's black,

454
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,470
but level material, man,

455
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:32,520
if you're gonna make some jokes about
war and Vietnam and soldiers and soldiers

456
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:34,370
returning, you're just, you're,

457
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,130
you're entering into the trickiest
of balancing beams. Right.

458
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,490
That's where the reward, that's that
Gabby Douglas, double, triple, whatever.

459
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm sorry, some of them Biles. Pardon
me, Simone Biles, and yet she did,

460
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,000
what did she do? I don't know.

461
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,330
Something they'll make illegal and
competition next year because black women

462
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,980
did. And you're like, no, don't
do that shit no more bitch.

463
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,570
It's like when Syria Bonelli was figure
skating and she did a back flip on the

464
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:01,070
ice and they were like, yeah, no more.
Backflips they said, no more back. Yeah.

465
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,940
They were like, you know, yeah,

466
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,940
there's French chick did a back flip
and immediately the ILC was like,

467
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,880
no more backflips it was too amazing.

468
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,710
Wow. Maybe they're worried
about like those BMX dudes,

469
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,810
BMX dudes and they started doing double
flips and they started doing flip,

470
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,760
triple flips. A bunch of them started
crashing and breaking their necks.

471
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,540
Oh, that fucking snowboard
shit. That's insane.

472
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,180
Yeah. Snowboard freestyle.

473
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,550
You're stuck on that thing too. It's
not like skis where your legs move.

474
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,830
That one in the snowmobile where they're
coming over the handlebars of the

475
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:41,550
snowmobile and coming back
down. I'm like, no man, no

476
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,950
anything with BMX or

477
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,910
motocross or any of those crazy
white dudes that are doing flips.

478
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,270
It's all just how many flips can you do
landing on your front tire and the Rex

479
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,110
man, I spent an hour one
night just watching Rex,

480
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,900
just watching guys try to
do flips and land wrong.

481
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,920
It's like picturing nerves
getting ruined for life.

482
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,470
Spinal cord injury, compound fractures.

483
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,760
There's a birth of big air 30 for 30
where he'd talk about when he started this

484
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:15,810
shit in the 80s in Oklahoma and it
would just doing it for the love,

485
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,380
like there's just a dude with a ramp
in his yard and just work traveled.

486
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,390
No email, no nothing. Just word
of mouth does a dude with a ramp.

487
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,950
So when we're in town to do that race,

488
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,480
we're going to go over to this dude
yard do for that ward. Dangerous shit.

489
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,010
You gotta be like a trapeze guy.

490
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,640
Like before there was motorcross
and bikes and shit. What did you do?

491
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,490
Like if you are a crazy person,
you gotta be a trapeze guy. Yeah,

492
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
we'll real options. You have
winning with skateboarding.

493
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,930
Skateboarding wasn't really,

494
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,730
they weren't thrashing like
that in the 80s you know,

495
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,050
they were just rolling around like
assholes. Like we're on a sidewalk,

496
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,230
move it pedestrian. The crazy
shit they did is get in a pool.

497
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:55,860
We're in a bottom of a pool. This
is nuts man. We're on the edge.

498
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,000
The shit they do not like kids
like in general athletics wise,

499
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:04,020
like the stuff they're doing now. Like
you see it and in jujitsu and an MMA,

500
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,440
the kids that are coming up now, they're
though they're so advanced in there,

501
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,890
they're all doing flying triangles
and flying armbars on each other.

502
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:15,420
It's like God damn like humans are
evolving. So I came up playing baseball.

503
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,160
Is there, are there certain maneuver
like in baseball before you turn like 15,

504
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,680
I think they try to limit you
throwing breaking balls. Mm.

505
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,510
Cause it'll fuck with ya. Um, elbow
Tommy, John and all that shit. Right?

506
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,860
So are there MMA moves where
you just as a child, you just,

507
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,880
you're not allowed to do this yet. You
have to be your grown man leg locks.

508
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,110
As a beginner,

509
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,770
they generally try to get you to stay
the fuck away from leg locks cause leg

510
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,040
locks. I don't know if you're
familiar like heel hooks. There's,

511
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,700
there's techniques that you do that are
going against the edge of your knee.

512
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,310
So like, here's your knee, your
knee bends like this, right?

513
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,360
They're going against it this way, trying
to bend or back that way. And it just,

514
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,000
you're, there's not much
give in your knees, man.

515
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,520
And so when you get a heel
hook, it's like your leg,

516
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,440
your leg is like in front of like wrapped
around a guy and they've got their

517
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,460
heel trap like this and they're pulling
on your knees sideways and your knee

518
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:12,840
just gets ripped apart.
And it happens. It's very,

519
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,841
very common that guys get knee
injuries from being overzealous and uh,

520
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,320
not, not, not like giving a guy a
chance to get out of a technique.

521
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,230
There's a heel hook right there. I see
that guy screaming at his fucking face,

522
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,500
bro. I'm telling you it is
some fucking horrific pain.

523
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,600
You get your [inaudible] tear it
apart, your fucking ligaments pop.

524
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,020
You know, it's, it's a
terrible, terrible feeling.

525
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,110
And there's not much room for like in
an arm bar does like your arm is locked

526
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:45,280
out. You can kind of take it a
little bit before you have to tap.

527
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,060
But with your knee, the moment you feel
pain, it's too late. Your for, yeah,

528
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
look at that right there. Whoo.
Look how bad it is. Ripped apart.

529
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,070
That's Dean Lister, Dean Lister's up
fucking gorilla. That dude on the bottom.

530
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:00,430
He's like one of the leg
lock pioneers in jujitsu.

531
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,440
He's fucked up many dudes. Future
walking. I'll say this about MMA.

532
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,420
It's definitely leveled bar fights.
Oh yeah, a little bit more now.

533
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,770
I've seen some scrawny guys like really
fuck a big dude that know what they're

534
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,790
doing. Yeah.

535
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,630
Like at five and you'd just see the D
and it's funny because there's all the

536
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:22,590
shit talking before the fight
and then the fight starts.

537
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,300
And then of course the big dude is like
tapping and does the scrawny do to still

538
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,300
go on. I'm like, dude, there's
no riff. You're, you're at a bar.

539
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,060
Like this isn't, you don't get
to tap out. You get your shit

540
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,420
broken. Yeah. There's a lot
of people that get in fights,

541
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,250
don't know what they're doing.
It's strange. It's like,

542
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,610
imagine if you challenged
the guy to a basketball game.

543
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,610
You've never played basketball. We were
ridiculous. Like, I know how to do it.

544
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:47,520
I've watched it on TV, but there's a
lot of people that do that with fights,

545
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,790
but the consequences of a fight are way
more grave than the consequences of a

546
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,130
basketball game. Somebody
kicks your ass in basketball.

547
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:56,520
You just look like a fool. Somebody
kicks your ass in a fight. You're you,

548
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,410
you getting fucked up. Maybe permanently.

549
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:01,440
Maybe your face is gonna be scarred
up for life and ain't no fighter man.

550
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm Oh one in one lifetime.
Oh one and one one draw.

551
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
What happened with the draw teacher show

552
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,490
and got in a fight and got in a
fight in the eighth grade at a stop.

553
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,760
The violence rally. No, that's real shit

554
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,290
cause I figured that'd be
the best place to talk. Shit.

555
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,140
What's, what's a better spot?

556
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,450
Talk your shit than at a stop the violence
rally because presumably someone will

557
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:33,140
come in and go, Hey man, right,

558
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,960
let's not do we brothers and our
Mario Brown slept the shit out of me.

559
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:42,940
Mario Brown. Where are you at Mario?
Mario Brown is uh, air force retired.

560
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,270
We'll still, we're cool. We'll pull
it to this day now. But on that day

561
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,000
he slipped. It dug shit out of me
in the gym in front of everybody.

562
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,700
That's the worst. And you take
your ill in front of everybody.

563
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,130
Ooh, that's a hard one.

564
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:59,780
That's a hard L thought I was going to
get off on that one wrong. You know,

565
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,760
I didn't know how to fight at
all until I learned how to fight.

566
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,750
I was terrified of fights
and never, never, never was.

567
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,690
Never was the guy who like,

568
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:11,850
I was just trying to get away from
everybody cause I grew up in different

569
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:13,920
places. We moved around
a lot when I was a kid,

570
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,760
so I didn't grow up like with a bunch of
friends where everybody knew everybody.

571
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,780
It's like I was always the new kid
so, so you always had to always,

572
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,040
always. And so then when I was 14,
I was like, all right, fuck this.

573
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,570
I moved to a new city, new town. And I
was like, I gotta learn how to fight.

574
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,350
And so I take, started taking martial
arts. I just became obsessed with it.

575
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,720
Do you teach your kids?
Yeah. Yeah. I teach them,

576
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,010
but they're not into it anymore. They
uh, they were into it for a little while,

577
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,190
but they, they like doing other
stuff. Mostly gymnastics and shit.

578
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,850
But do you, are you teaching
them, did you think to it?

579
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,250
Cause I'm trying to say it with my son.

580
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,440
You know how to approach
self-defense. How he's three,

581
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,300
he's three. I noticed that early. Yeah.

582
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,210
But it's not, it's,

583
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,460
it's not a bad thing to get it to be
a part of his body when he's really

584
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:58,880
[inaudible]

585
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,230
black daughter started when she was five.

586
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,100
But the question becomes about
teaching proper conflict resolution.

587
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
Cause I also,

588
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,250
I'm wired a little weird in the sense
that I feel like because he's a black kid,

589
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,820
he's not going to get judged the
same if he throws the first punch.

590
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,910
So I don't want them in a position where
he might get expelled or some shit,

591
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,420
you know? Right. But if you've
got to get him out the fuck off,

592
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,560
you gone on bend that knee
sideways. You got to guess.

593
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,430
Well that's the beautiful thing about
kids learning jujitsu too is that also the

594
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:32,870
really used to conflict because you
have conflict in the gym all the time.

595
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:35,240
Not conflict in a negative
way, but when you're sparring,

596
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,700
you know you slap hands and you
just do it and you go full blast.

597
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,870
You try to get each other as hard as
you can and you can do that in jujitsu

598
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,800
cause you're not hitting each other.

599
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,520
You just choking each other and getting
an arm bars and then when some gets you

600
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:48,500
you just tap and then you move
on to the next thing. And the,

601
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,770
the thing about doing that is then
you're not worried about conflict.

602
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:55,070
It doesn't seem as scary
to you. Like for me,

603
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:58,490
until I started learning martial arts,
I was fucking terrified of everybody.

604
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,940
I thought everybody was going to kick
my ass. Like fuck. I was like every,

605
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,510
I'd seen some do that bullied me and
like Schiff and I'd go around the whole

606
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:09,890
opposite way of school. I'd walk the
total way around the school to get to the

607
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,580
ah bro, how much longer was that?
15 extra minutes. I didn't care.

608
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:17,410
I have to walk 20 extra minutes home if
I didn't want to cut through the South

609
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,700
park projects cause there was this dude
Spencer that was always every week for

610
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,500
sure. Go on, give me the damn business.

611
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,320
Those people would ruin
your lives every week.

612
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Like they would sit on the porch and
watch me walk in the corner store and then

613
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,860
would come and take my fucking now
ladies and laughing and mind you,

614
00:34:34,861 --> 00:34:36,110
I've set aside lunch on my,

615
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I ate less at lunch so I can eat candy
and chips on the way home and they were

616
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:45,760
snatched that shit right out. My only
thing you say me growing up, I had an ad,

617
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,520
a good ass basketball goal.

618
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:52,950
So all the gang bangers
in the neighborhood would
come to our yard to shoot

619
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:57,600
ball. So I essentially learned every,
every terrible person in my neighborhood,

620
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,370
shot ball at my house.

621
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:01,560
So you can't fuck with me because
then you won't be able to shoot ball.

622
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,670
Oh that's nice. So I don't know
if my mom did that by design.

623
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,140
I know she did it to keep me from going
up to Powderly park to shoot ball where,

624
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,910
you know, that's why the
bullshit would go down.

625
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,360
But all the bullshit came to her house.

626
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,460
But out of respect to my mom and my dad,

627
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:20,940
like they never started shit and I just
walk around the neighborhood perfectly

628
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,370
fine. Now at school I can
still get fucked with,

629
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,610
but on the walk home it was
gravy. That's very nice.

630
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,020
Once she got the basketball that was good.

631
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,910
That's very nice. Yeah, it's hard.

632
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,340
A kid who's really mean who's like
bullying you in high school and and junior

633
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,310
high school and that
could fuck whole lives up.

634
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,160
Sometimes people never recover
from that shit. You know,

635
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,580
it's a natural inclination that people
have to fuck with someone who's scared

636
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,790
and weak to just you see it in
animals man. You see in dog.

637
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,780
Yeah we are animals.
That's what we forget.

638
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:54,890
We get like clothes and automobiles
of civilizes. No it still,

639
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,520
I'm trying to take your woman
and reproduce and I'm trying to,

640
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,740
if I can spread my genes and
I'm going to take your food.

641
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,710
Like that's the basic of bullying is that

642
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,240
[inaudible] yeah, it's nature
and it forces you to overcome.

643
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,800
Cause almost every fighter that have
ever met professional fighter was fucked

644
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:15,520
with George Saint Pierre, who's like
one of the greatest of all time,

645
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,560
told the story on the podcast about,

646
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,680
he was a driving his range Rover when he
was world champion through Montreal and

647
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:28,120
he saw this homeless guy and the homeless
guy was his bully in high school and

648
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,780
he realized, he was like, Whoa.
And he's like, what's going on man?

649
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:32,614
What are you doing?

650
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,710
And like talk to the guy and try to make
amends with the guy and help him out a

651
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:39,220
little bit. But it's like fuck man,
this is his bully in high school.

652
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:43,330
And he realized like most people that
are causing pain and inflicting pain on

653
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,330
people, they're in pain, man. That's
why they're doing it. You know,

654
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:47,560
it's like victims,

655
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:53,010
you know the victims of crimes often
times perpetrate those crimes on other

656
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:57,400
people that that happens. Kids get
abused at home, they get beaten at home.

657
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,700
They're the ones who want to beaten kids
up at school. You know, they're just,

658
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:03,850
they want to dish out that violence on
someone smaller than them cause they're

659
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:08,080
getting a dished out on them by someone's
larger. Yeah, man. I mean that's,

660
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,320
that's the constant victim
narrative. But on the other hand,

661
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,490
families of people that grow up
that are martial artists, like,

662
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,150
like all the kids know how to fight.
They're the nicest, friendliest people.

663
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,120
They don't worry about it. It's not
the thing that fucks with their head.

664
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:25,090
Like for me, I knew I didn't know
how to fight. So it was scary.

665
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,690
So like every time someone would fuck
with me, I'd be like, Oh, got to get away.

666
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:30,130
I can't fight. I don't
know what I'm doing.

667
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,390
Some dude got me in a headlock and threw
me down on the ground and was gonna

668
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:37,360
punch me in the face. I'll never forget
this. Like, I forget what was happening.

669
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,960
We were talk. We, like I said something,
he said something stupid to me.

670
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,370
I said something stupid back to him.

671
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,730
Then he just got me in a headlock and
threw me on the ground and he helped me

672
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,670
like that. He was gonna punch you. I
was like, nah man, I ain't gonna bother.

673
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,310
I'm just sitting there going
God damn, I'm helpless.

674
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,400
Locked up in a headlock with this
dude on top of me going fuck.

675
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,350
And the only is the only his mercy that
he didn't punch my fucking face in or he

676
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:02,140
didn't want to get suspended or
whatever and I remember going that's it.

677
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,390
I'm going to learn how to
fight. This is ridiculous.

678
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,110
Do you,

679
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,340
do you ever run into the people from your
past who have a revision as history on

680
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,110
y'alls relationship and they

681
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,850
not too much cause the only people that
I'm friends with from back then I'm

682
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:17,940
actually good friends with and I was
friends with when I was growing up like a

683
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:20,010
couple of buddies. But
most people I don't,

684
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,060
well most of the dates they never bought
a ticket to your show and came up to

685
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,210
them?

686
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,640
No, by the time about a time
I was in high school that's,

687
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,410
that's the only people that are
still I am in contact with anymore.

688
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,910
I had already gotten balls deep in
martial arts like my first year of high

689
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,850
school. So by like into high
school, I was already crazy.

690
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,050
I was already competing and traveling
all over the place and so it was,

691
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,840
but I do run into people
that fake stories.

692
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,000
I run into people that
tell me things that hat,

693
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,900
remember that time we were at a party,
you kicked out dude in the hand.

694
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm like, dude, I never kicked
anybody. Never happened.

695
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,380
The dead a hundred percent
definitely never happened.

696
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,030
I never went to a party
and beat anybody's ass.

697
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,830
Never have him with that memory
or do you correct them? Correct.

698
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,620
Dumb. I'm like, I never fought anybody.

699
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,090
Some dude was telling me some story
about some guy told him that one time we

700
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,300
were on the street and some guys
across the street were talking shit.

701
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,540
And I went across the street and kicked
both of them in the head and like that

702
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:14,010
never happened. Never happened. I'm
a guarantee you it never happened.

703
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,680
Cause the last time I was in a street
fight, I was like 15 I'm like this,

704
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,880
it never happened. This is not a true
story. See, I'm the opposite man.

705
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,950
People come to me with shit that I
don't remember. I just let them have it.

706
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,160
If that's your memory of us in
college, fine. Whatever. Weird though.

707
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:30,994
Right? When you know

708
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,570
when you definitely know.
Like I know for a fact,

709
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,450
I was never in any street
fights outside of high school.

710
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,110
I had a professor from
college accused me in a fake,

711
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,880
this was a Facebook thread of some
article about me and like all the other

712
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,140
alumni commenting on it.

713
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,200
And one of the professors I remember in
1994 when you said this thing to me in

714
00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:54,000
class and stormed out of class, I'm like,

715
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,380
I didn't enroll until 96 but
I didn't say that. I just,

716
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,340
I literally just apologize like,

717
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,890
because she's clearly been mad at me
all of this time about something that I

718
00:40:04,891 --> 00:40:08,330
didn't even do. And I'm just like,
there's nothing I can say this.

719
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,440
That's your narrative.
Fine. You know what?

720
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,830
I'm sorry for the shit that I didn't
do. Whatever. Roy would all peaceful.

721
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,730
But yeah. But then she replies on her
that, well, thank you. It means a lot.

722
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:22,050
And then so in my weird arrogant brain,

723
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,040
I've freed her

724
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,540
of her anger or whatever the fuck it is.
She thought I did, but I didn't do it.

725
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,730
That's a great approach. I just
don't feel like going back and forth.

726
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,050
That's a great approach.
It's so much easier to evade.

727
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,990
I'm more of an Aveda and
a schemer than a fighter.

728
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,020
I'm not gonna argue with
you and go back and forth,

729
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,660
but what I will try and figure out a
way to do is over the next two years,

730
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:48,780
diabolically dismantling anything
you stand for and believe in.

731
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,420
Like that's, that's my approach to things.

732
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,630
Like there's a comedy club owner.
God is my witness before I die,

733
00:40:57,631 --> 00:41:02,130
I'm opening a comedy club across
the street. This is a NIGO. No,

734
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,770
I've heard the stories.
Where's this one? Uh,

735
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,480
can you not tell? It's easy.
It's one of the Carolinas.

736
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,010
Well, we'll, you know,
[inaudible] the internet.

737
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,160
We have such a complicated relationship
with them because we need them and we

738
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:24,800
don't want to do it. I don't want to
fucking run a goddamn comedy club,

739
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:26,120
but we need one. You know,

740
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:29,450
to have some guys dealing with a bunch
of maniacs like us, day in, day out,

741
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,370
every week coming in and telling jokes
and getting drunk smoking weed in the

742
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:38,640
green room and all the chaos that comes
to the art form. Yeah. We need this

743
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,360
to the comedy club as essential.

744
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,020
100% you ever get scared that the young
people don't really go to the clubs?

745
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,990
Don't really fuck with
clubs. Yes, yes I do.

746
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,870
It's going to change the business
model like in the next decade.

747
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,923
Well,

748
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,830
one of the beautiful things about comedy
clubs though is that we all use them.

749
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,970
Like even if you're doing arenas,
like you use comedy clubs,

750
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,680
you use comedy clubs to exercise.
Like Chappelle comes in all the time.

751
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,470
Does the belly room, that's a 70 seat
room that dude just strolls on in.

752
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:09,590
It'd be half-full. Yep. And
he'll do 40 fucking minutes.

753
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,390
And that is so critical, man. It's so,
it's so important to get that work in.

754
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,500
That's why I don't like when
a lot of the vets attack the,

755
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,500
as they call them Instagram comedians
or the vine or not vine anymore,

756
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,260
but [inaudible] what the fuck? Yeah,

757
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,280
they get mad at them because the
club will book them and they'll go,

758
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:35,290
well the live shit was
trash and it's terrible.

759
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,000
And it's true for most of them it's
not the greatest performance cause they

760
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,860
haven't had the chop shit,

761
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,830
but they sold 300 paid tickets
and everybody ate and drank.

762
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,110
What do you think is keeping the lights
on for your 30% selling capacity as

763
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,660
to come

764
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,980
back in next year and then next year
to go from 30% sold to 40% sold.

765
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,870
They're not making no money off of you,

766
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,710
but if these IgE comedians can come in
and at least help keep the lights on,

767
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,890
I think in the greater
integrator scheme of comedy,

768
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,000
there's more good than bad that comes
from that. And I also feel like there's,

769
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,571
there's a,

770
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:17,250
there's a level of ignoring the tools
that they've been able to use to get an

771
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,960
audience in lieu of the fact that they
don't put new standup on TV anymore and

772
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,780
lets it's contest shit. Comedy
central just started with the,

773
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,800
the lab at the cellar shit. But other
than that, I mean it hasn't been a lot.

774
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,700
Well no one's even watching
TV anymore. I mean,

775
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,880
the numbers on regular TV
programs are so low now.

776
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,020
Like if you're doing a set on Conan,
like what is, what did we win over this?

777
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:43,910
Right. Like the numbers are like less
than 400,000 people watch it a night.

778
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,170
Yeah. That's a lot. That might be
live plus three yeah. On top of that,

779
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,600
I might not even be just live. They might
be live plus DVR over the [inaudible].

780
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,580
Yeah. It's crazy. So no one's
watching anything anymore.

781
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,650
If you can get onto a stage,

782
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,030
the way I feel about Instagram comedians
or YouTube comedians is if you're doing

783
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:02,290
standup, you're a comic.

784
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,550
You might be a shitty comic and you
might've be a famous shitty comic because

785
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:08,500
you're famous from vine or
whatever the fuck it is,

786
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,390
but who's your comic like it's whether
or not you decide to become a real comic

787
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:17,770
and actually do the work and put in
the time and then one day be, look,

788
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:21,610
I hope that we see these YouTube comics
and they're fucking terrible and then

789
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:23,020
you go to see them seven,

790
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:26,020
eight years later and they're
murdering their crushing. Great timing,

791
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,710
great premises. I'm like, we got
one, we got one. We need more.

792
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,640
This is a hard gig. Think about what
you had to do when you were starting.

793
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,280
Think about you traveling
around, all those fucking things.

794
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,490
Getting on a bus to do open mics.
They had an open Mike once a month.

795
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,610
That takes a kind of grit and
resolve that. Most people don't.

796
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:46,180
This shit is like hazing
where the O heads feel like,

797
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:50,890
well they didn't suffer the way I suffer.
Therefore your success is invalid.

798
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,370
I don't take that cause you
didn't do it the way I did it.

799
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,940
This is the only way to do it. The
game evolves that the points of access,

800
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,040
it's like, it's like comedy is like,

801
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,060
to me it's like a fucking grocery
store and you've been in line,

802
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,620
you've been in this checkout line and
then a new checkout line opens and then

803
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:12,190
all these fuckers just cruise through
that checkout and you're still stuck in

804
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:17,191
the same waiting to get a tonight show
set line and the Instagram line opens and

805
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:22,330
people just start whisking through to
success and you don't know whether or not

806
00:45:22,331 --> 00:45:23,830
to change lines or stay in this one.

807
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,241
You build.

808
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:26,790
The beautiful thing about comedy is
you don't have to get out of the line.

809
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,750
He just opened up a new line, open up an
Instagram line, open up a YouTube line.

810
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,490
You can do all those,

811
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,140
but they ain't been waiting
in line as long as me.

812
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,710
So why did they get to leave the
store? You know you have that jealousy,

813
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:39,110
that little piece of jealousy
when someone has not been in line.

814
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,170
As long as you leave the grocery
store before you, that's comedy now.

815
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,800
It is, but it's wasted energy. You
can't think about that. You can't, like,

816
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,780
you should think about that the same way
you think about someone having success

817
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,640
in some field that has
nothing to do with yours.

818
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,580
Like if someone who is a Nobel
prize winning scientists like fuck,

819
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:59,120
I could have done that, but you didn't.
It's really the same thing. It's just,

820
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,190
yeah, it has nothing to do.
But some people are like that.

821
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:05,050
Some people see someone
with like a startup,

822
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,810
some internet startup and it makes
$1 billion and they get angry.

823
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,200
They get angry because no,
go, go fucking do something.

824
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,820
Don't worry about what
other people are doing.

825
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,440
It's a giant waste of your energy.

826
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,590
Yo, I read a book, um,
rebel without a crew.

827
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,660
Think it's um, I think rich Rodriguez,
I think his thing is his name.

828
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,650
And he was a film maker and he made the,

829
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,600
I can't remember the name of the movie,

830
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:33,470
but it was the prequel to what became
Desperado. Oh, rather target Rodriguez.

831
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,510
Yes. Yeah.

832
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,640
And you talked about just shooting that
shit gorilla and for essentially pennies

833
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:44,030
less than $10,000 shot a whole last
film and walks through how we cut the

834
00:46:44,031 --> 00:46:49,031
corners and you think of how to shot
paranormal activity for like $55,000 50 or

835
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:54,290
$60,000. The first paranormal activity
was dirt cheap. They shot the first saw

836
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,910
$4 million in 30 days
in one building. Whoa.

837
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:04,100
Every and every scene in the car did
just shaken the fucking camera and jump

838
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:08,630
cutting billion dollar franchise
getting rebooted now like that.

839
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,170
Like when I see shit like that, I
don't get jealous. I go, well fuck.

840
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:16,160
I need to go and fucking gorilla
some shit together and learn.

841
00:47:16,161 --> 00:47:19,850
So that's why I started trying
to learn like in video editing,

842
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:21,410
audio editing and all that shit, man.

843
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,400
Yeah, no, it was inspiring. I love one,

844
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,930
when I walked in the green when I
saw you fucking with that software.

845
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:30,100
I love when people are
hustling when they're doing
things like that. New things.

846
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,070
And you're like, you know what?
Fuck this final cut pro shit.

847
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,380
I'm going to learn Adobe premier.
They keep fucking with me.

848
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:37,650
Make me buy a new version
every year. [inaudible]

849
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,390
yup. Now to be fair, Adobe
makes you rent the shit,

850
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:43,810
but I think there's a way to, yeah,
does that too now with like Whoa,

851
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,410
office whole office suite $80 a year.

852
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,370
There's so many credit access
to it. Just crux, crux.

853
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,120
And then you can't use the old
version of office with the new,

854
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:57,820
and if I send you a file
that's like office Oh three,

855
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:02,821
you can't open it with the new off
like opens as a text file with no form.

856
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,780
Like they do it to fuck you

857
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,870
barely use office. I use it, I have it,

858
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,380
but I write with right room for the
most part. Do you know what that is?

859
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,170
Is that script software? It's no, it's um,

860
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,160
it's a software that turns your whole
screen black and then turns the text green

861
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,860
and you can't access your
browser. You can't do nothing.

862
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,600
You just have green software. Have you
ever seen it? No. You write down, Oh,

863
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:29,920
ms dos coding type action. Yeah.
On, uh, on my windows computer,

864
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:32,740
I use a [inaudible]. I use
a program called Scrivener.

865
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,970
I do most of my writing on that and
there is a distraction free option there.

866
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,960
That's what it looks like. That's
what it looks like. Matrix. Yes.

867
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,410
I write like I'm in the matrix.
That's how I write when I'm on my,

868
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,290
my Mac because I think they have
a version of that that they don't.

869
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,330
They have a version of that
for windows. I think they do,

870
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:54,010
but I've never really installed
it. I just use a, yeah, I need to,

871
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,180
yeah. It just says Macco S it
doesn't say anything about windows.

872
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,050
I heard a story that they wrote the first
independence day movie in three days

873
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,700
in a hotel room. Make sense?

874
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,540
So let's do it. Just focusing
in like that type of shit,

875
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:11,650
which has helped me focus.

876
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,020
You got a lot of coffee or some
Adderall or something like that.

877
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,080
You dumb action movie. Three days easy.

878
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,880
You can go crazy now. This is
a gorilla style shit man is.

879
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,290
That's how this podcast
gets started. This park,

880
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,320
this podcast reaches some
stupendous number of people
every month and it started

881
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:32,110
out with a laptop in my
living room cause I was bored.

882
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,880
Me and my friend Brian because uh, I had
just gotten back from Colorado and I'm,

883
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,630
I was like, yeah, I can't believe I'm
back in LA. This is fucking terrible.

884
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,980
I'm like, wow, let me do something.

885
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,480
And so I just started doing like Q and
A's on the like a like a laptop talking

886
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:49,000
to people on Ustream. Yeah.

887
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,310
That's the one thing I
wish I could have back.

888
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:54,070
I wish I had taken YouTube more seriously.

889
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,340
You take it right now though? I do now,

890
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,450
but not in 2005 when it
first came out to content.

891
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,490
Just start rolling out the same thing
you were complaining about before. No,

892
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:08,450
I'm just, it's the wish that I had done
something. That's what your career is,

893
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,620
is that man, if I hadn't done
this sooner and done two things,

894
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:12,450
I would've done sooner.

895
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,520
I'd taken the internet more seriously and
I would have taken some more as advice

896
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,090
and not gotten on TV for 10
years. I don't think any,

897
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:20,620
I don't think any comic can do it though.

898
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,020
I think it is impossible to be a working
comic and stay off of if you stayed off

899
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:27,950
of television for 10,

900
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,030
if you started your career and
just never did shit, no festivals,

901
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,000
just crush, crush, crush, crush.

902
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,770
You become fucking legend that
by the time you finally decide,

903
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,000
you look at college quarterback that
just stays in college for years and years

904
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:47,930
and years and never interested
the draft. And by the time you do,

905
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:51,170
then everything is stratosphere. But
there's too much money is too many offers.

906
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,020
Well, you know who did that? Joey D is,

907
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,790
Joey Diaz didn't do any standup
comedy on TV until like 1520 years in

908
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,800
[inaudible]. He was crushing. But Joey
also I think is from a different cloth.

909
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,040
We are, he wasn't seeking that out either.
He was, well, he was seeking it out.

910
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,720
They were scared of him. You know,

911
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:12,070
he was talking about eating ass and taking
in the muffler and all this chaos and

912
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:16,810
going to the Buffalo tick.
Yeah. He talks crazy.

913
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,940
But I think I have a different
perspective. I think, um, there's a,

914
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,820
I have a bunch of old sets for me.
When I was living, uh, I was on TV,

915
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:28,600
I was doing comedy like five years,
four years. They're terrible. Yeah.

916
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:33,630
But the good thing about it is they
exist and it's lets you see like,

917
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,840
look, this was in the beginning I was
talking terrible. But just keep going.

918
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,900
You just keep working at it, keep
working on it. You get better. You know,

919
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:43,750
like I'm not under any illusion
that I didn't use to suck.

920
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,640
I tried to talk about
it as much as possible.

921
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,160
I was terrible when I first started it.
You're okay with that being out there.

922
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,780
Don't give a fuck

923
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,070
dude. I've been digging in the crates.

924
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:55,060
I've been digitizing a lot of my
old VHS shit trying to, you know,

925
00:51:55,061 --> 00:52:00,061
just for posterity and going
through some of my old fucking TVs.

926
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,230
They're all terrible. Like the Letterman
set is probably the only thing.

927
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,740
The Letterman and Def jam said and Oh
six those are the only two that I'd still

928
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,470
to this day, I still
stamp the sat, those jobs,

929
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,830
everything before that
premium blend star search.

930
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:19,570
Last comic standing Apollo
comic view, all of it.

931
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,070
I'm like, Barry, that shit. My
biggest fear is becoming famous.

932
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:27,970
Whatever the fuck that is. And then
B T just rolling out some sort of,

933
00:52:27,971 --> 00:52:32,270
remember when fucking thread. Oh,

934
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,640
just you load of black comics. They used
to suck 20 years ago and just going,

935
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:37,474
no,

936
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,950
but that's who you were. That's, that's
part of the process. Yeah. I liked,

937
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,840
I liked the process. I don't
care. I'm fine with it.

938
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,270
The problem is that the
gatekeepers that decide stuff,

939
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:48,880
they only want the newest shiny
thing. So if they see you too soon,

940
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,730
you're new to rescue problem
Roy. That's the only problem.

941
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:55,210
You don't need those fucks. You
don't need gatekeepers. Internet.

942
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,250
The internet has no gatekeepers.

943
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,500
You have people that have podcasts
that get you on their podcasts.

944
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:04,930
You do your own podcast, you would put
out a lot of content. No gatekeepers.

945
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,250
I'm with is that,

946
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,600
it takes comics discovering it because
the problem is a young comic is that you

947
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:15,400
inherit the goals of your
predecessors. So as a young comic,

948
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:19,090
especially as a road comment, every
road comic is trying to get on TV.

949
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,420
So they make you believe TV
is where you need to be going.

950
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,530
Don't fuck up the YouTube shit.
Little n***a tell you right now,

951
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,120
you got to get on, goddamn, let them,

952
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:31,740
and you get on Letterman and then you
get to show I got on Letterman and is not

953
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,130
a knock on Letterman and
it's worth as it credit,

954
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:40,230
but the worth of the late night credit
in 2006 versus 1996 it's not the same

955
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:44,940
currency. No, there was a deflation in
the currency, so it got me more rooms.

956
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,960
It got me more money,

957
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,200
but there was no Ray Romano
fucking here's your career,

958
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,380
choose your career, here's your Kevin J
like, yeah, it doesn't work like that,

959
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:55,951
but the only,

960
00:53:55,951 --> 00:54:00,660
but you're chasing what somebody else
wanted and the game is always moving.

961
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,310
The school of fish are always,

962
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:05,580
so you have to be ahead of that curve
and it's just didn't listen to the

963
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,640
instincts. Yeah. It's hard to
see where it's going though.

964
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,740
If the people from your
PR, your predecessors,

965
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,990
the the guys who were successful and
you were coming up where they were

966
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,860
headlining and you were middling
for them, that that was the goal.

967
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,470
The goal was the tonight
show. The goal was yet,

968
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:22,560
but I don't think is that
hard to see the future.

969
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,140
Not necessarily see the future,
but see the trends of where people,

970
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:26,460
what people are paying attention to.

971
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:31,970
I'm quicker to read fast company than
I am a variety or Hollywood reporter

972
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,700
because we're tech goes, that's
where people going. But people go,

973
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:36,391
they want to laugh.

974
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:40,740
So you figure out a way with that to
integrate laughter into whatever the new

975
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:43,680
tech or the new hat, like this
tick-tock, shit, whatever this, this,

976
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,480
that that is, I've seen it
but I don't know what it is.

977
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,720
A better fucking figure it out. Cause
that's the next one. Is it then?

978
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:51,000
That's the one you brought
up to you. We should,

979
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,640
maybe we should do a ticktock
account. I don't know

980
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,830
that you'll like it. It's music.
It's musical vine in a way.

981
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,250
Like it's, it's music sketches, but
it's still funny. It's entertaining.

982
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:09,020
So Thompson girl does it like all
the time he's into it. That's okay.

983
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,000
He's like ironically doing it. But
yeah, but he does some fun shit.

984
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:13,703
He does some funny shit.

985
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,680
It's self aware that he's a guy
that shouldn't be on tick-tock.

986
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:20,340
So his existence on tick tock is
what makes it funny and makes it,

987
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,370
he knows how to do that shit,
but he's ahead of me. He's a hit.

988
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,900
He's ahead of that curve.

989
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:29,070
So the other thing that then compounded
gas like me from my generation is that

990
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,730
Dane cook was one of the first
that was like, all right, fuck TV,

991
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:35,940
what's over here? And so
many people shitted on Dane.

992
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,350
Out of jealousy that you ignored the
fact that his mass space move was some

993
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:43,830
fucking Bosch shit. It was. It was
huge. It was huge for everybody.

994
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,270
I remember I read people magazine,

995
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:49,740
there was an article about how he had
like 200,000 or 300,000 MySpace friends.

996
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,990
That's crazy. I remember
thinking that is crazy.

997
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:57,060
How does he have so many friends? Yeah.

998
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,960
But he was using that and
talking to people online
constantly and rather look at

999
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:04,770
him and see how he did it. You stand
in your checkout lane and go fuck him.

1000
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:07,650
He got out of the store
before me. Um, well I,

1001
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,560
I shifted and I started
promoting on it. I didn't,

1002
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm just saying a lot of comics like me
just didn't you lean on what you're told

1003
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:18,330
because you look at older
comics as mentors instead
of realizing that maybe they

1004
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,610
don't have this shit figured out
either and you should be trusting your

1005
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,350
instincts. He was the first guy, right?

1006
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,420
He was the first to really make it
through the internet on the digital side.

1007
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:28,180
Yeah, 100% yeah, I'd say that.

1008
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:30,850
I can't think of anybody performed cause
I can't think of anything before that

1009
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:34,030
other than Yahoo chat rooms.
No, he was the first guy.

1010
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,250
He was the first guy on
the first guy for sure.

1011
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:38,320
That became famous from my space.

1012
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,280
My space was like the first platform
of that social network and shit.

1013
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,650
His album sold like 2 million copies
or something crazy like retaliation.

1014
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,513
Oh my God.

1015
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:53,040
That's why if you stop and think about
how nuts that is today, like today,

1016
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:57,120
a big artists like if M and M puts
out an album, how many does he sell?

1017
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,090
I'd say 401st week. Maybe
three to 401st. Well,

1018
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,200
let's give it a year. Depending on
what week you release right now,

1019
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:08,300
you could be number one
with like 30 [inaudible]

1020
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,720
thousand sales. Whoa.
Yeah. 40 50,000 sales boy.

1021
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:16,740
They just gutted that record
business, didn't they? That is crazy.

1022
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:17,730
What happened with the internet?

1023
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:22,710
The internet took out porn and
took out music by the knees.

1024
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,330
I used to have a fucking neighbor.

1025
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:26,280
He lived right down the street
like two houses down from me.

1026
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:28,530
This crazy porn dude. I used
to do jujitsu with them too.

1027
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:33,210
It's all steroid up and maniac wild
eyes too. It was just crazy. Just Coke.

1028
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,930
Yes, Coke and steroids and he
was just fucking up a storm.

1029
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,280
Constantly pulling.

1030
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,750
It was like past his house and he's always
had these fat Mercedes parked in his

1031
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,630
driveway and [inaudible] hot girls
in their underwear walking around was

1032
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:48,510
hilarious. Let's do as
a maniac. But then they,

1033
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,780
the internet came around the
internet just gutted his business,

1034
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,930
just gut it and they repossessed
his house. I'll never forget man,

1035
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,600
his fucking house got repossessed
and I remember seeing it in the,

1036
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,610
like the real estate section. I was like,
fuck man, dude lost his house. He was,

1037
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,250
he had a fat fucking Rolex
with diamonds all over it.

1038
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,910
Pouring got really fucked over.

1039
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:16,130
But you and you want to talk about the
people selecting what they want to see.

1040
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,950
That's what's,

1041
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:21,890
what's a bigger focus group than people
who want to fucking Jack off and they've

1042
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:26,891
decided I would rather see somebody in
the hood in their house with no lighting

1043
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,640
and just terrible fucking camera work.
And that's as interesting what it was.

1044
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,690
It is that porn became free and they
just used ad clicks and they would just

1045
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:36,770
pirate everyone's porn.

1046
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,650
Say if you were a porn producer and
you were making a bunch of porn,

1047
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,370
they would just take your point and put
it on like whatever website and then you

1048
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:46,130
would have to get a lawyer
to try to take it down. Yeah,

1049
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,530
it was like some lime
wire to the 80th pallor.

1050
00:58:48,531 --> 00:58:51,630
It was like way worse
than the entire business.

1051
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,280
But you don't think the free side
or like the amateur porn? Oh yes.

1052
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,260
Part of it too. I mean that's a
bigger now, but in the beginning, yes,

1053
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,580
it was just pouring clips,

1054
00:58:58,581 --> 00:59:01,850
getting shopped up and nobody
paying a $40 for a five hour DVD.

1055
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,330
You know what I notice? Not that
know. I was doing research recently.

1056
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,780
You know what I noticed? There's
a lot of like stepmother porn.

1057
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,330
It's a lot of like a step mom,

1058
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,570
horny step-mom porn or
step-sister [inaudible].

1059
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:19,610
It's all like taboo stuff. It's all was
also a lot of getting caught porn. Yes,

1060
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:22,130
yes, yes, yes. Yeah.
Like the, the wife walks

1061
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,230
in, you're in the middle of get your Dick.

1062
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,640
Yeah. And it cuts right there
when she walks in. Yeah. Yeah.

1063
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,100
There's a lot of that. I did a,

1064
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,350
we did a story on racism
in porn for daily show.

1065
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,220
And so we were shooting up in
Chatsworth for whatever. And what I did,

1066
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:40,310
and I learned so much about the porn
industry in that I didn't know that,

1067
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,970
like they would just have a fuck house
where it's like an eight bedroom house

1068
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,620
and every bedroom is,

1069
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,560
it's individual studio set up
for whatever genre of porn.

1070
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:53,480
It was like at least five different
genres of porn being shot in that house.

1071
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,140
And we're out in the,
and, and I, and mind you,

1072
00:59:57,141 --> 01:00:00,620
I still have this image that if you're
a porn star and you're working with a

1073
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:05,330
porn studio, there's some Brit,
there's got to be little bit of money.

1074
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:09,050
And one of the, um, porn
stars was, is it actress?

1075
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,830
What's the fucking word now? Porn
actress. Yeah. So one of the actresses,

1076
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,550
her car is blocking someone. So
I'd go out, just give me a keys,

1077
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:18,230
I'll move your car in this car.

1078
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:23,231
I had to be the most at the sad is
fucking like to the point where I'm like,

1079
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,170
if this is what fucking
on camera gets you,

1080
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,030
there's gotta be something else out there
and you want to talk about people that

1081
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:33,440
need to see where the curve is.

1082
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:36,110
I think if you're a woman and
you're cool but doing porn,

1083
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:39,180
you're probably better off just doing
it on some self-starting shit than even

1084
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,360
dealing with any of these LA
crooks in the first place.

1085
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,780
Yeah. If you could figure
out a way to get an audience,

1086
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,250
I know there's a lot
of dudes who, uh, they,

1087
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,350
they run these companies that
girls use where they just, uh,

1088
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:55,500
people pay to see their videos. Like,
like someone will ask you like, uh,

1089
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,360
like if you're a, a porn
actress, they'll say, Hey,

1090
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:02,860
I want you to use this dildo and cover
your tits whip cream and I'll give you

1091
01:01:02,861 --> 01:01:04,720
150 bucks. And then,

1092
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,170
Oh, some live stream
private Skype protection.

1093
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:07,710
Yeah.

1094
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,640
They make their money doing that and
they'll do that like all day long and rake

1095
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:12,720
in thousands of dollars.

1096
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:13,160
Yeah.

1097
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,380
Just like the food videos where you sit
but neck and eat some food and you go on

1098
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,990
like a virtual date with the person. Yeah,

1099
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:23,370
I think its butt naked foodie
sometimes naked. Sometimes not.

1100
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,070
And like you haven't seen a
lot of that in Asia. Yeah.

1101
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:27,960
A woman's just looking straight
at the camera. So anyway,

1102
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:32,310
today I remember I'm young, I'm talked
to her. That's up to you. Back to her.

1103
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:36,060
It's sometimes it's just a straight video
and you don't get to interact with it

1104
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:40,170
because there's multiple people watching
the feet concurrently or if you want to

1105
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:41,880
pay a little extra. Yeah. One-on-one.

1106
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,350
I will sit here and pretend to be
on a date with you and we can just,

1107
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:46,223
and it's just,

1108
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,670
that's more feeding loneliness
and some sort of erotic desire,

1109
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:52,620
but there's not a lot of money in it.

1110
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,440
No Khalifa was talking about
this shit a couple of weeks ago.

1111
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:58,380
What was she doing? She says she
only got like 12 K for the year.

1112
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,640
She only did porn for like
a week, right? Didn't,

1113
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,960
she deals like a year or something
like that, but whatever it was,

1114
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:06,750
it should've been more than 12
K so let's all she deserves.

1115
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,220
What I'm saying is I
didn't see the points.

1116
01:02:11,221 --> 01:02:13,590
I don't know whether or not it
should have been 12 ketchup.

1117
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:16,320
She put in a solid effort. Less kidding.

1118
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,810
If you're someone that wants to do porn,

1119
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:21,990
you are coming off better
just setting up your webcam.

1120
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:26,280
Like Joe Rogan day one podcast,

1121
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:30,540
you and Brian would have a laptop and a
microphone and just turn into a web cam

1122
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,510
on and just doing whatever the
fuck you want to do with yourself.

1123
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:37,230
Then dealing with the industry and the
record industry is becoming similar to

1124
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:37,960
that too.

1125
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,800
I think so too.

1126
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:41,230
But I think that it's hard for
them to find an audience that way.

1127
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,240
There's so much porn.

1128
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,020
Like I got a joke I was doing for awhile
about why are they making new porn?

1129
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,600
Like who is jerked off to all of it. Yeah.

1130
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:54,340
There's no way anyone has seen it all,
but yet they keep making new porn.

1131
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,180
It's like, it's crazy. Like
there no demand. Like there's,

1132
01:02:58,181 --> 01:03:00,070
there's no demand for new
stuff. There's plenty.

1133
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,190
Like you would have to be some
kind of crazy creep to the scene.

1134
01:03:03,191 --> 01:03:07,570
Every porn that I've ever is ever
existed, but it's no different than MMA.

1135
01:03:07,571 --> 01:03:08,560
This people innovate,

1136
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,640
people innovate and in porn back
flipping and POV in the same areas,

1137
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,510
breaking their necks. Yeah.
It's the, I think the,

1138
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:22,150
the cam thing is the big thing. Girls
fuck on camera. You know, they'll,

1139
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:24,730
they'll have the boyfriend come over and
they'll fuck them and suck his Dick on

1140
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:27,880
camera and you pay to watch. And I
think that's, that's the big thing.

1141
01:03:27,881 --> 01:03:31,330
And they do private shows and
like the guy could tell, you know,

1142
01:03:31,331 --> 01:03:33,790
you could tell the girl, Hey,
I want you to do this to him.

1143
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:37,030
And they'll do it on
camera. You notice training.

1144
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,650
You know the funniest shit though.

1145
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,050
So Steve burn and I, um,

1146
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,180
we were in Pittsburgh and three things
lead to another and we ended up at a

1147
01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:52,810
strip club and it's a weekend.

1148
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,250
And so apparently I didn't know this,

1149
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:59,251
but porn stars tour strip clubs and
they'll go to a strip club on the weekend

1150
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,170
and dance and sale,

1151
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:07,171
whatever pocket pussy or whatever vagina
mole they have and all of the strippers

1152
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:09,070
fucking, you know

1153
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,890
like some of the shippers a cool cause.
Oh they bring more people into the club.

1154
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:18,490
But for the most part the man are saving
that tip money to tip the porn star

1155
01:04:18,491 --> 01:04:19,510
that they came to see.

1156
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,610
So it's like being a seasoned comic
and then the Instagram comment comes in

1157
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,320
who's never stripped before.

1158
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:30,340
Like yeah you fuck on camera but it's
not stripping what I do as an art.

1159
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,420
What you do is slightly behaved cause
you not like there's like a beef between

1160
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,310
like strippers and prostitutes.

1161
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,520
Cause like some strip is a second fucking
in the back of the club and it fucks

1162
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:41,800
up money for the rest of
the strippers that are,

1163
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,980
that are playing the
game straight up. Right.

1164
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,020
So it was this weird tension
in the strip club bow.

1165
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,920
The porn star was on stage
and I could not stop laughing

1166
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,231
because it was comedy.

1167
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:57,610
And that's part of why like
stripping to me is performative.

1168
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,530
It's in a weird way, it's comedy
and strip and it's damaged people,

1169
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:07,000
entertaining strangers. So
there's more of a synergy.

1170
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,120
So I don't really get anything out of
watching the stripper cause in the back of

1171
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:12,430
my head, I know you're thinking
about groceries and some other shit,

1172
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,750
but it was hilarious as a
comic to watch two different,

1173
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,250
same different types of before.

1174
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:22,840
It's like the magician versus the standup
versus the juggler and how they all

1175
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,920
kind of don't really like one another for
one reason or another because they all

1176
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:30,790
think what they do is superlative
to the other gas craft.

1177
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,210
And it was, it was God damn
it was fucking hell there.

1178
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:39,210
That is an inside scene that
only strippers can really
appreciate what you're

1179
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:42,180
talking about. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Like for them, they're like, yes,

1180
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:47,130
those bitches real than it coming
over here. Bunch of fucking whores.

1181
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,680
There's, um,

1182
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,940
there's a couple of strip clubs that I
used to go to and Birmingham where like,

1183
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,560
you know, the club would close it
too and the police would leave.

1184
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,900
And then at three the club,

1185
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:02,600
it reopened and then it was open
season and is whatever you want to do.

1186
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:06,560
And then you would see strippers in
the parking lot yelling at the other

1187
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:10,970
strippers who were choosing to stay for
the 3:00 AM session saying that y'all

1188
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:11,691
are messing it up.

1189
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:15,080
And that's why nobody comes before
two is because of what you're doing.

1190
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,150
And so it's just a,

1191
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:19,960
so at three it became like a brothel.
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's insane.

1192
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Isn't it hilarious that you could fuck
anybody you want for free and there's not

1193
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:29,290
a law about it. But as soon
as money gets exchanged,

1194
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:34,300
you're a criminal and everybody's mad
at you. If you're just a slut, no one.

1195
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,240
But if you want to fuck people from money,

1196
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:41,920
that becomes a real problem for people
because people desire sex so much and

1197
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:44,590
there's so many guys
that can not get laid,

1198
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:48,280
but they've got some money and if
they find out they can pay for it,

1199
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,740
like people are like, no, you
can't. You can't pay for it.

1200
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,200
You could pay for everything.
Everything that's legal.

1201
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:56,770
Everything else that's legal
you could pay for except sex.

1202
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,510
You could pay to have
someone cook for you.

1203
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,190
You could pay to have
someone rub your back.

1204
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,660
You could pay to have
someone cut your hair.

1205
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,280
You could pay to have
someone mow your lawn.

1206
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,050
You could pay to have
someone take out your trash.

1207
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,050
You could pay to have someone clean your
house. All things you don't want to do.

1208
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,120
You can't pay for someone
to suck your Dick.

1209
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,030
You can't that someone could do
it for free. If they like you,

1210
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:13,983
there's no problems.

1211
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,160
It's very strange or an
exchange for college tuition.

1212
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,140
You can't even do that
if you made like a deal,

1213
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:23,290
like you suck my Dick and I'll
give you a house. People go, Hey,

1214
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,380
you can't do that. That's prostitution.

1215
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,500
Very strange, right? I mean,

1216
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:33,070
think about all the things we
do that we don't want to do,

1217
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:36,910
but we do it for money. Everything's
fine. There's no issue. Even think like,

1218
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,180
you know, I grew up doing
terrible construction jobs.

1219
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,830
I'd never wanna do you know,

1220
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,760
it might be better suck dudes did for
1000 bucks then don't look Lee drywall

1221
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,980
fucking carry cement bags all
day for $400 for a whole week.

1222
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
At least she got that.
I used to work day jobs.

1223
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,730
I used to work day labor when I was on
the road as an MC so I can make more

1224
01:07:56,731 --> 01:08:01,470
money like in the one advantage to South
hat was that the comedy clubs back then

1225
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:06,330
were like five, six day runs.
So during the day Columbia runs,

1226
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,150
um, comedy house theater in Columbia.

1227
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:13,650
South Carolina used to be a six night
room and it was Tuesday through Sunday.

1228
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,540
So I would get to town Monday and
Tuesday morning I would go to a day labor

1229
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:20,480
spot, get a job assignment
and work the whole week,

1230
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,950
nine to five and then at night
go do my little MC bullshit.

1231
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:29,000
Kids need to hear this kid's
coming out. They need to hear this.

1232
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:32,380
That's important. You got it.
That's real hustling, dude,

1233
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:36,860
why am I going to sit here in a hotel
all day and do nothing when I could go

1234
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:40,690
make a quick like in minimum wage was
like five and a quarter. It's like you,

1235
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,120
you're only making 40 bucks.
But that was extra money.

1236
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,350
Like I counted on that little extra
money and we used to work summit fucking,

1237
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:52,490
Oh my God. There's a quick Creek
factory in Columbia, South Carolina,

1238
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:55,850
and I've worked there. I worked
there two weeks at a time.

1239
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,330
Anytime I played the comedy club, I
worked at the quick Creek factory. Wow.

1240
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:02,330
So did you have to call them up
or did you, how do you show up?

1241
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,610
You show up at six in
the morning with your,

1242
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,020
with your drivers license and you sign
up and then you sit in a lobby and you

1243
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,050
watch the morning news until your name
is called and then they give you your job

1244
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:14,960
assignment. Wow. And so you bring boots,

1245
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,210
you bring a hard hat cause you
don't know what you're going to get.

1246
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:18,530
You might get something with a keyboard,

1247
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,580
you might just be outside holding the
stop slow fucking stop stick while they

1248
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:26,050
pave a road. And that's your
gig for eight hours. Wow.

1249
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:31,160
You just stand in the fucking Carolina
heat and just fucking five 25 an hour.

1250
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,200
I love stories like this dude,

1251
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:38,230
that was my first 10 years was just
working day labor weird jobs to make extra

1252
01:09:38,631 --> 01:09:43,370
money. Um, and if it, if the gig was
under five hours, I would drive back home.

1253
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,380
Like I wouldn't even
stay so that I could go,

1254
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,090
at the time I was still working morning
radio. So if it was within five hours,

1255
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:52,370
I would do morning radio,
get off the air at 10,

1256
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,730
be on the road by 11 five
hours nap. Do the show,

1257
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,110
get back in my car at 10:00 PM
five hours back to Birmingham,

1258
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:04,370
sleep at the station, wake up
at six wash, rinse, repeat. Or

1259
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,410
I can't lose the radio
gig because that's too,

1260
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,420
that was too much of a good get right.

1261
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,240
And I was doing prank calls and
I was using the prank calls.

1262
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:19,420
I was taking my prank calls at the time
and sending them to other morning shows.

1263
01:10:19,421 --> 01:10:22,610
This is website radio online,
which kind of breaks down.

1264
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,240
It's almost like billboard, it's all,
it's almost like Nielsen or some shit,

1265
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:27,103
but for radio.

1266
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:32,590
And so I would go there and I would
look for other local morning shows that

1267
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:36,440
weren't syndicated in cities
where I wasn't performing.

1268
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,510
And so I would send my print calls for
free to these morning shows and go, look,

1269
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,500
I'm a comic. Here's some free
print calls we do in Birmingham.

1270
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:50,450
They're not going anywhere else. You
want to M an Omaha? The guy says,

1271
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,810
yes, he's not. He doesn't have
shit else to play on the air.

1272
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,520
So I was in the prank calls,

1273
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:58,310
the guy that played a prank calls for
a couple of weeks, a couple months,

1274
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,910
and then I would call the
local comedy club and go, Hey,

1275
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,800
I want to feature in your room.

1276
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,650
I'm on the radio and I know
I can get on there and had,

1277
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:10,760
and this is when the belief that that
radio still could bring people to the

1278
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:11,594
show.

1279
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,420
So I would call local comedy clubs in
cities where my print calls with Aaron and

1280
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,120
use that as leverage to get booked
as a feature instead of a MC.

1281
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,230
And so that's how I was able to kind
of jump a level because I was a feature

1282
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:27,150
that was coming in town with the pre
plugged in media access and all of that

1283
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:27,984
shit.

1284
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:32,720
Dude, you're a hustler, you're a real
hustler. I love hearing shit like that.

1285
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,680
I really do. I love
hearing the driving part.

1286
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:39,700
I love hearing that getting the day
job part. Kids need to hear this.

1287
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:44,701
All you fucking kids listening to this
right now to think if you wanted a job in

1288
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:48,400
show business, this is what comes with
it. And that's why you're so good, man.

1289
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:52,630
That that hustler mentality, that's
so important. That's so important.

1290
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,980
You just network,

1291
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:58,981
you find people that you can that are as
driven as you and then you just figured

1292
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:03,500
out ways to work together and
do shit. But comedy is so,

1293
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:07,170
so many motherfuckers are lying
bro. They're lying. How so?

1294
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,410
And you lie, you get the
leverage and like it's

1295
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:14,740
like, so the way I got hired on radio,

1296
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:19,741
so at the time the thought was that this
is 2001 I'm out of college and if I can

1297
01:12:21,281 --> 01:12:26,281
get on the radio then that'll give me
more access in the city and I can host my

1298
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:28,480
own comedy night by hosting
my own comedy night.

1299
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:33,900
I can offer money to out of towners who
also have comedy nights and do swap out.

1300
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,480
So I needed to get the, the radio gig.

1301
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,370
So at the time they were doing some sort
of contest or some shit and who's the

1302
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,230
funniest in Birmingham or some shit.
And I missed the window for the contest.

1303
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:51,160
And so I knew the long story.

1304
01:12:51,161 --> 01:12:55,090
Long story short is that I go to the radio
station. I asked the guy at the time,

1305
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,050
buck, while whose house a
95, seven not the same storm.

1306
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,073
Lot of different Buffalo,

1307
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,090
any buck Wild's okay, perfect.

1308
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:06,130
Say Oh different Buckwild. Okay.

1309
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:10,730
So I said, Hey man, I'm a comic.
I have a degree in journalism.

1310
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:15,380
It's a perfect fit. Fuck with me. And
he goes, nah, we're done with that.

1311
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,540
We're not going to have a
comic. I go, okay, cool.

1312
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,590
Now I've done enough of the comedy club
and Birmingham to know that on black

1313
01:13:21,591 --> 01:13:22,424
weekends,

1314
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,540
the black radio station hosts the black
comedy night on Fridays and they throw

1315
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:27,680
out tee shirts and all that shit.

1316
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,740
So I'd go to the comedy club and
I told Bruce air, as I said, Hey,

1317
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:35,060
I just got hired at 95, seven. Um,

1318
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,230
and they want me to open for doc
ugly this weekend. And he goes, okay,

1319
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,320
that's fine. I'll go back
to 95, seven. I go, yo,

1320
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:46,220
I know you don't want to fuck with me,
but I'm opening for Dio this weekend.

1321
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:50,630
Do me a favor, watch my set if I'm
funny. Put me on Monday morning. He goes,

1322
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,493
you gotta deal.

1323
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,360
So I get to the comedy club that Friday
and all I have to do is keep buck wound

1324
01:13:56,361 --> 01:13:57,530
Bruce heirs apart.

1325
01:13:59,230 --> 01:13:59,500
Okay,

1326
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,500
so that neither one knows what the fucking
lie was and Bruce came backstage and

1327
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,010
you just,

1328
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:10,180
if as long as you act like you belong
and you act like the truth is the truth,

1329
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:15,390
people will kind of merge in with that
shit and Bruce gamer and goes okay buck

1330
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:19,480
while you go out and throw the tee shirts
and then you bring up Roy and I went

1331
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:24,070
out and it was seven minutes but I fucking
crushed like just when you need that

1332
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:26,200
one set to go right. And every syllable,

1333
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:31,201
every fucking karma is perfect and I
demolished in front of DL ugly and I walk

1334
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:36,130
off stage and book wows is see you Monday
morning and that's how I got radio.

1335
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:40,000
It's just what were you going
to do? Not fucking book me.

1336
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:44,380
I'm already not really working the comedy
club. I'm already not hired by you.

1337
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:50,500
What is the penalty for this lie? Is
this lie? Will this lie send me to jail?

1338
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,060
No, can lie. It's a hustle lie. Yeah.

1339
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:59,290
I'm not saying load your resume with 50
different credits that you don't have,

1340
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,840
but if you've performed somewhere
else outside of where you're from,

1341
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
you have performed
across the country. Yeah.

1342
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,820
What you basically did is like the comedy
version of a subprime mortgage loan.

1343
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,570
You're like he sold the house to someone
who really shouldn't be buying that

1344
01:15:14,571 --> 01:15:18,590
house, but it worked out and he
kept the house. Yeah. That's amazing

1345
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,100
man. I just, I came up man, cause
you know I got arrested when I was,

1346
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,690
when I was 19 so for the credit card
fraud we were still in credit cards and

1347
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,760
college and like buying
jeans and all of that shit.

1348
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:32,760
So my first two years of
standup I was on probation.

1349
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,490
So when you have that,

1350
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,410
I could have gone to jail or
this shit could be a lot worse.

1351
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:45,300
Living in the back of your mind
forever hustling like, I don't know,

1352
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:48,270
people got the hustle. I'm just
like, no, this is, I have no choice.

1353
01:15:48,271 --> 01:15:49,104
I have to fucking do.

1354
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,780
I knew a dude who was one of the
original credit card fraudsters.

1355
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:57,340
His name was international Sal
international style. Yeah, yeah,

1356
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:58,183
yeah man.

1357
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:03,210
He was a dude who used to come to this
pool hall I was at and international Sal

1358
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:05,350
was like, uh, he was a real nice guy,

1359
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:08,800
but he was a famous loser
at gambling and that would,

1360
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:13,630
he would make millions of dollars
on credit card fraud. He had,

1361
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,870
they had an organized crime empire and
this what they would do back in the day,

1362
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:19,630
you remember they had this transparency
like they would run your card,

1363
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,990
they'll put it on a machine and go,
chill, shoot, shoot. Yeah. Carbon,

1364
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,450
carbon Heartland. They
would take those carbons,

1365
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,650
people who worked in these department
stores would take the carbons and sell

1366
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,930
them to him. He would take those carbons,

1367
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:36,010
make a totally new credit card out of
that car with some sort of machine,

1368
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,500
and then they would
distribute them to these guys.

1369
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,760
They would buy goods with this stuff and
then they would sell the goods and then

1370
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:47,140
guys would come to him in the pool
hall with paper bags filled with cash.

1371
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,440
And all he wanted to do was gamble
on pool and he could never win.

1372
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,820
And when I'm telling you never,

1373
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:53,920
when that guy was playing with
dirty money and he knew it,

1374
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,210
his head was fucked up.

1375
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,750
He would be staring that nine ball would
be in the hole and he would be like a

1376
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,880
foot away from it and you see his
hand shaking and you're just changes.

1377
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,060
Just fuck it up and hit the rail. It
bounce it off. And people would go, no,

1378
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:09,980
he his tick,

1379
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,150
I can't fucking believe he missed an
international Sao. Could never win.

1380
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,030
He could never win. But he
was one of the original dudes.

1381
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,540
Did you find something from him?
Something very weird just happened.

1382
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,740
What happened? So I'm typing, I'm
typing international Sao, right.

1383
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,190
And I hit space bar
and two things come up.

1384
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:31,700
Credit card thief and pool player.
But when I click the search for that,

1385
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,030
nothing shows up. Huh? Like for instance,

1386
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,880
credit card thief and it just brings up
a bunch of other stuff about credit card

1387
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:42,140
thieves and other people.
Honestly, it might be because us,

1388
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,480
I've not, I'd never looked her up before,

1389
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:49,660
but the search might exist because of us
because I know other international Sal

1390
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:54,350
before and him being a credit card,
these people fled. My friends.

1391
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:58,930
Mom was actually taking care of
him when he was in hospice. He was,

1392
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:01,670
he had cancer. He died of rectal cancer.

1393
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:06,860
God damn Sal. Yeah, it was bad.
It was bad. Tara. No, no, no.

1394
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,410
Salbi terrorists. A famous pool player.

1395
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:12,670
This international style was not a
famous Salbi terrible international South

1396
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:15,790
couldn't win, but he was one of the
original credit card fraudsters.

1397
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:19,090
He went to jail for quite a long time
with and then got out and was doing the

1398
01:18:19,091 --> 01:18:22,450
same goddamn thing again. What's crazy
though is that when you get arrested,

1399
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,750
especially for like some
white collar shit like that,

1400
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,500
like what they don't tell you about
getting arrested is that the first thing

1401
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:33,160
they do is try to pin
other unsolved shit on you.

1402
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,250
So before you even like
get a mugshot or anything,

1403
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:37,840
you just go sit in a room and they go,

1404
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,710
here are all the mugshots of other people.
We are looking at for similar crimes.

1405
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,020
Do you know any of these motherfuckers?

1406
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:47,710
Then you get a handwriting sample
and then a as in like there's,

1407
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:48,710
and that's when you find out like,

1408
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,320
Oh I was just a petty fucking teenager
that just took her credit card to get

1409
01:18:53,321 --> 01:18:55,630
some jeans and then you
start realizing like,

1410
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,980
Oh there's an entire fucking syndicate
of shit happening in this city that I

1411
01:18:59,981 --> 01:19:02,380
didn't know anything about. They're
trying to fucking pin on me.

1412
01:19:02,381 --> 01:19:05,680
And that's when the fear set in. Cause
like in your hair you're like all right,

1413
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:09,850
well I know I probably won't go to
jail. I hope I don't go to jail.

1414
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:14,110
Oh shit. I might go to fucking
jail for some shit he didn't do.

1415
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:17,820
Oh they don't care. They do
not go. And that's when sided,

1416
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,000
you're already a criminal. And
that's when I got into comedy. Ooh.

1417
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,730
That was the fucking depression. Like
that was the fucking moment like Oh shit.

1418
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:29,110
Well Joey Diaz went to jail for armed
kidnapping. That's how he got into comedy.

1419
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,510
He robbed the dude over some
Coke with a machine gun,

1420
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,210
taped him to a chair and shit.
And then when he was in jail,

1421
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:37,510
he learned how to do stand up. That
is the best cold open to a biopic.

1422
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:43,100
When Joey Diaz gets this biopic, it has
to start with duct tape on somebody.

1423
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:47,410
The duty kid now he
took pictures together,

1424
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:48,730
didn't he put it up on his Instagram?

1425
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:52,240
He took pictures with the guy who
kidnapped. He's like 31 years ago. I kid,

1426
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:56,800
not this cocksucker our friends.
That's the beautiful thing.

1427
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:59,890
No man is the redemption and being able
to make a mistake and get back in the

1428
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:00,724
mix. Well,

1429
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:05,170
some of the greatest discipline people
good went to jail because they were like

1430
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:07,180
Bernard Hopkins, one of
my all time favorite.

1431
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,200
He's one of the greatest
middleweight champions of all time.

1432
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:14,490
And Bernard Hopkins spent like six
years in jail for armed robbery and he

1433
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,210
learned how to be disciplined when he
was in jail and when he got out of jail,

1434
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,650
he not, not only did he have like a
drive that other people probably couldn't

1435
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,130
comprehend, but he knew what
would happen if it went bad again.

1436
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:29,730
He knew what would happen if he slid
back down that road again and apparently

1437
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,580
like legs, a corrections officer
to said when he was getting out,

1438
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:34,860
you'll be right back in
here. And he was like, fuck,

1439
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:37,020
I will be the fuck I will be.

1440
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,960
And turned out to be one of the greatest
boxers of all time. There he is.

1441
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,080
Joey's with the guy. 32 years
ago I made a mistake. So what?

1442
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:48,180
It's not where you start. [inaudible]
showed up to my show 32 years ago.

1443
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:52,920
I made a mistake so wide. His
dad's way of finish. That is crazy.

1444
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:56,430
You know, that's, that's what
the whole redemption is about.

1445
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,920
And [inaudible] you know, do what
you can, which is second chance.

1446
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:01,140
That's why I'm just trying to
grind man. All this shit is a gift.

1447
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:03,870
I could have been in prison for
whatever reasons I didn't get sent to

1448
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,760
want people to have
redemption. It's interesting.

1449
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:10,630
This culture today wants people to be in
trouble for things they did in the past

1450
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:12,380
and you have to be who you were 30

1451
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:13,420
yeah. Yeah.

1452
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:18,160
We all go to church and
ask for forgiveness every
Sunday for an opportunity to

1453
01:21:18,161 --> 01:21:20,500
be forgiven for what we were that week.

1454
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,560
Well, the idea that no one, no one
gets a chance to redeem themselves.

1455
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,880
It's a terrible world.

1456
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,900
Like that's one of the best things about
Christianity is the idea that you have

1457
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:34,650
redemption, you confess
your sins and you move on.

1458
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,520
I just think that it's all
new and I think there'll be a,

1459
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,401
I think it's all new.

1460
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:45,210
I think there'll be a market correction
at some point because as a society we

1461
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,740
are obsessed with who
you were. Credit reports,

1462
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:53,280
rental history, drug
history, employment history.

1463
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:56,700
Fucking you sit down with somebody
who want to know your dating history.

1464
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:57,660
So I can,

1465
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:03,200
Twitter is just racism history
or your bat joke history.

1466
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:04,470
It's, it's,

1467
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:09,720
it's an opportunity for the first time
as a society to audit your past behavior

1468
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:13,500
when all we do is judge who you
are now based on who you were.

1469
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,140
That's what our society
is established upon.

1470
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:20,490
So that's why it doesn't feel so out
of pocket to me that people don't,

1471
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,770
it's like Oh it's a new
way to see if you were me.

1472
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:26,370
I can literally search your name plus a
word and see if you say it the word and

1473
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:30,330
then I will fucking name no different
than African bankruptcy sitting on your

1474
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:32,360
record from, I like how you described it,

1475
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,200
market correction cause I think
that is what's going to happen.

1476
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:38,770
We're going to understand that what
we're doing now is kind of unsustainable.

1477
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,160
Like going back and judging someone on
some shit that happened in high school or

1478
01:22:42,161 --> 01:22:45,640
whatever it was and and try to look at
words you said when you're trying to make

1479
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:50,200
a joke, like what happened with Kevin
Hart and apologize for it many times.

1480
01:22:50,201 --> 01:22:52,030
And then he's hosting the
Oscar and they like, look,

1481
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,420
10 years ago he said this and he's
like, look, I'm not going to do this.

1482
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,580
I'm not going to do this again. I
already apologize for those things.

1483
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,180
I'm going to move on. Sorry.
And the Oscars got fucked.

1484
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:02,920
They went up to have a no host. Now

1485
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,070
did we get fuck did the opposite
fucker stand ups get fucked

1486
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:09,990
cause the Emmy's don't have a host
now either. It's good. Good. Listen,

1487
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:14,890
listen, I love Sebastian.
I love Sebastian,

1488
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:17,500
but Sebastian made me cry when I
was looking at this fucking video.

1489
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:21,880
Musical world ward. He's going to have
the amaze. Yeah, he's hosting that shit.

1490
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:24,340
And there's some thing, this
is what comics do. We host.

1491
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:25,900
We don't get the chance to make the jokes.

1492
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:30,901
Nobody wants to make Sebastian sold
Madison square garden out four times.

1493
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,750
Yeah, the fuck is he doing
hosting the video music awards?

1494
01:23:35,751 --> 01:23:38,620
I want to sell it out. Six. Why

1495
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:43,000
else do it? Why else do it? Let
me show it to you before you,

1496
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:45,730
before you cast any judgment, go
to it. Go to Sebastian's page.

1497
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,350
There's like a thing
where he's like asking,

1498
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,670
he's asking Jimmy Kemo how to do
it. It's like dog, get out, get out.

1499
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:55,180
Of course they're forcing them to
do a bunch of shit. That's not good.

1500
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:58,720
That's not terrible brand for him,
right? No, it's not a brand for anybody.

1501
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,620
Tear. No. There's certain who
else is going to roast that shit?

1502
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:05,740
Who else is going to show up and
you get a roasted? He's a nice guy,

1503
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,400
so that's just not going to go shit.
Look, if you got on the first promo,

1504
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:14,360
he roasted himself for even being there
in the first place. Yeah, that's okay.

1505
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,951
But if you will,

1506
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:19,330
some show face roast people like of Ricky
Gervais' was hosting something that's

1507
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:22,530
different. A totally. They'll get
mad at him and he goes after him.

1508
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:26,750
That's his brand. He is cutthroat. Yeah.
Shit's on everybody cleaning himself.

1509
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:27,970
I don't know. I just,

1510
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:32,100
I've always enjoyed comics being able
to have that to just go to whenever.

1511
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:35,050
Like if you look at the history of the
Oscars, it's almost always stand ups.

1512
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,490
A lot of times I just don't give a
fuck about award show. So there it is.

1513
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,990
That's the truth. Yeah. That's the real
truth. It's not even the award host.

1514
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,300
It's why the fuck are we doing this thing?

1515
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:49,540
And I would see Chris rock prepare
for these award shows. I'm like,

1516
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,670
you're Chris rock.

1517
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,210
You couldn't pay me to come anywhere
near one of those stupid fucking shows.

1518
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:56,230
If I was Chris rock,

1519
01:24:56,290 --> 01:25:01,290
Chris rock walked out at the NAACP
awards and did a Jessie Smollett,

1520
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,250
nobody else's going to
give you a I. You laughing,

1521
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,230
look at you enjoying
that shit's different.

1522
01:25:08,231 --> 01:25:10,810
No other comic is going to
give you that. That's true.

1523
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,470
What is the worst possible thing that
could be said in this room full of black

1524
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:18,940
people that hold him and that she'll say
crit and he fucking say there right to

1525
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:22,870
it. He went right to it. I just don't
think Kevin would have done it. No.

1526
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:24,970
Kevin would've done that. Kevin
would've done that at the Oscars,

1527
01:25:24,971 --> 01:25:27,730
but Eddie Murphy had done it. You
see Eddie Murphy when he did that,

1528
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:29,650
when he got that everybody
went after bill Cosby.

1529
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:34,220
It was just a quick little loose
solid jet. But it was great. Yeah,

1530
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,800
it was great. What he's talking about.

1531
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:39,910
And then making them give him
back his awards like Ooh, yeah.

1532
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,050
Um, wait. Does who come back from that?
Oh, does Jesse Small that you can't,

1533
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,780
right? Yeah. You can come
back from everywhere.

1534
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,600
Black people are the most
forgiving genre of people.

1535
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:54,550
R Kelly still sells tickets
now, right? No, no, no,

1536
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:59,270
no. He did come back hard though. That
is amazing, Kelly. So tickets time,

1537
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:03,320
everybody saw the piss tape. He had
supporters. That is a Raymond in Brooklyn.

1538
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:04,943
Yes.

1539
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,440
Yeah. Black aunties. Deaf. Not be, but
then, so if you're telling me justice,

1540
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:12,570
Molly can come back and telling a lie
on the streets of Chicago and taking a

1541
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:15,420
look. Wicked Huizar Kelly, that's
not as good as R Kelly. But Kiki,

1542
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:20,610
he can get cast in some Jesus movie and
diction and it'll parallel and he'll be

1543
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:22,130
fine. Meaning that anything happened?

1544
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:25,400
The problem is that the people that could
give him the redemption or some of the

1545
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:27,460
people who's trustee portrayed, right.

1546
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,010
That's the problem is that you started
looking at the lead Daniels in the Tyler

1547
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,890
Perry's and you know,

1548
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,360
maybe the Ava DuVernay's and the people
that are in that world of black cinema,

1549
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,470
they could get them back in to whatever
this crossover mainstream world is.

1550
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,830
So it's about earning that trust
again. But I think there's no,

1551
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:46,460
and I'm just saying from
personal experience, you know,

1552
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,960
there's no group of people more forgiving
than I think black entertainment.

1553
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:54,200
I don't think they're ever gonna forgive
him for calling himself the gay Tupac.

1554
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,230
I don't think gay people
would give them for that.

1555
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:01,580
And that's for gay people to decide.
I'm a Tupac fans a different way.

1556
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:02,563
What the fuck?

1557
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:08,540
Why the fuck did you just
say, yeah, he's gone.

1558
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,470
But then you sit down on somebody's couch
and you go, you, that was the old man,

1559
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:14,750
the new mean now. And then
you come out with your wife,

1560
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,830
you do some selfies on
Instagram kissing. Yeah,

1561
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,470
but he's not going to have a wife,
boyfriend, husband. Okay, fine.

1562
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,610
Whatever it is,

1563
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:27,700
come out and be happy and normal in some
level of attrition for what happened.

1564
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:32,300
He didn't have to like explain the
whole thought process for putting on the

1565
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:34,760
hoax. Why he kept the news
on his neck. Of course,

1566
01:27:34,761 --> 01:27:37,730
talking to the cops while I
was holding the subways. Yes,

1567
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:40,160
you got to get drug through the mud. Yeah.

1568
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:43,710
Come on out and get this dragging and
then get back to work and nobody's going

1569
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,020
to care. Five, 10 years from now,
nobody's going to care. Good actor.

1570
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:48,080
I thought he was fine on empire. Empire.

1571
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:51,200
It wasn't my cup of tea after a couple
of seasons, but I mean it was fun.

1572
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:54,960
Show was entertaining. Little acted I, I
never looked at it and went, Oh my God,

1573
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,460
it's fucking,

1574
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:58,580
it's not like I'm looking at it like some
self produce Netflix movie where I go,

1575
01:27:58,581 --> 01:28:00,470
how the fuck did this get on online?

1576
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,780
He's still saying that he
didn't do anything right.

1577
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:05,810
He's still saying that he actually
got mugged. I haven't kept up with it.

1578
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,590
That's one of those stories where
after he got clear at the first time,

1579
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:13,790
I quit clicking on links and then the
city of Chicago started soon when the city

1580
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:18,791
of Chicago decided to Sue him for the
cost of the investigators item done.

1581
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:19,910
Yeah.

1582
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:22,670
There's just certain shit I don't click
on anymore and just as smelly stories,

1583
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:25,130
I just said, is he in a new movie
out? I don't want to read it.

1584
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:30,290
That's the only thing I need to know.
Yeah, I get it. I think. I think,

1585
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,720
I honestly feel like there is a way, bang.

1586
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:37,070
Marv Albert was vice for people on
the back where he's wearing a dress,

1587
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,780
so there's a way back in attainment.
There's always a way back.

1588
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:46,130
This is a way back for what's his face
from the fucking, what's his name?

1589
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:51,390
The Matt Lauer is there way back for
that guy. Oh, I don't know about Dallas.

1590
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:57,290
That's why when I'm fucking around

1591
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,890
hone and justice Molay was lying
on two Nigerians, the curb. That's

1592
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,810
Matt Lauer do. He just got labeled
up. Fuckers up in the room.

1593
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,960
Can't be just hitting the
child. That's the narrative.

1594
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,600
But apparently all those
executives had that button.

1595
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,560
They all had that button to lock the
door and use it to grab the ass. Did,

1596
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:18,060
did I try not to bring that
up? Did I bet they did.

1597
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,470
I bet a lot of them are
sweating it out right now. Um,

1598
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:24,930
they lock somebody in the room. Is
there a way back from Matt Lauer?

1599
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,660
I don't know if it is a long road.

1600
01:29:27,661 --> 01:29:30,510
The problem with Matt Lauer
is I was talking about this
last night or different,

1601
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,280
the small Lake, he knows
he owned any of it.

1602
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:34,200
Here's the problem. He
doesn't do anything.

1603
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,210
He doesn't do anything that a regular
person can't do. He just talks to people.

1604
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:43,140
He doesn't do anything. He doesn't sing.
He doesn't tell jokes. He can't paint.

1605
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:47,190
So he's replacing, making motorcycles.
Yeah. What do you do? That's so awesome.

1606
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:51,510
He doesn't do anything that everybody
can't do. Everything he does,

1607
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,830
anyone can do. He's talking to people.
That's all he does is like, hi,

1608
01:29:55,831 --> 01:29:59,520
I'm Matt Lauer with good morning America.
Whatever the fuck the show was today.

1609
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:02,040
So today's show, hello, how are you?

1610
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:07,340
He just talking and he's talking
is bland and non spicy as possible.

1611
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,820
But in the, in the,

1612
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:12,600
so you think he's, cause they replaced
him. Was it a, was Carson Daly,

1613
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:15,120
was that kinda who they
used for awhile and today?

1614
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,150
I don't know why I'm asking you. I know
you don't wash this shit in the morning.

1615
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:20,430
I had Carson daily and
my girl had this shit on.

1616
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,490
Daley had this one show that
was on forever. Yeah. Last call.

1617
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:26,960
Like one o'clock in the morning that
no one watched but it stayed on. Yeah.

1618
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,690
For years. They just started the
morning show for a long time too. Yeah.

1619
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,800
Does like special interest pieces? Yeah.
He's been in a mix. Oh, I didn't know.

1620
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:39,410
Yeah. Last call. You're making that
up. No, no, they just turned it.

1621
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,520
Matter of fact, they just turned
last call over to a new house.

1622
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:45,490
They gave it to a Lilly
Singh. Mm. So there's,

1623
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:49,030
I don't know. I don't know. I
don't know. Cause here's the thing.

1624
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:52,200
For there to be a path back,
there has to be, what is,

1625
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:57,040
what does redemption and ownership
of whatever you've been accused of.

1626
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:59,140
Look like, right. Because if you're in,

1627
01:30:59,141 --> 01:31:03,340
this goes back to the whole
redemption conversation.

1628
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:09,690
Is it about your truth or is it about
the truth of your accusers or is it about

1629
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:14,950
what society perceives you as right?
Or the combination of those? Correct.

1630
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,540
Because if you don't believe,

1631
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:19,390
if you don't agree with what
your accusers said to you,

1632
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:24,870
then you're already fucked because that's
part of the redemption is respecting

1633
01:31:25,181 --> 01:31:26,014
their truth.

1634
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:29,980
Even if it's not true to you and it's
not what you believe happened and what

1635
01:31:29,981 --> 01:31:34,630
went down when you hit the shot out
like you did to the teacher. Correct?

1636
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,770
Similar. Correct. It's
just, Hey, I'm sorry.

1637
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:42,910
Right now granted, I don't know if Matt
Lauer would be saying that sincerely.

1638
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:46,060
I was sitting like, look, what can
I do to show attrition to move back?

1639
01:31:46,061 --> 01:31:50,350
Because now even if you've had
that with the, with your accusers,

1640
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:55,270
society at large still gets to decide
cause the same way society decides who

1641
01:31:55,271 --> 01:31:58,480
wears the crown, I get to decide
who to take the crown from short.

1642
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,310
You you do about that. Right. So
I mean that's in a fucked up way.

1643
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:06,010
That's the game. I hope I'll
be saved up enough money.

1644
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:10,060
He saved him the money he made. He
was making ungodly something. What?

1645
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:14,270
I fucking go spend your money. Just
relax. Go spend your money. But that's,

1646
01:32:14,271 --> 01:32:14,871
that's ego.

1647
01:32:14,871 --> 01:32:19,871
But that's ego in feeling like I deserve
to be [inaudible] took it and did it.

1648
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:23,370
Damn it. Diamond [inaudible]
turn off fucking employment.

1649
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:28,030
It's also, you get used to that gig of
being that guy who was on TV. Hello.

1650
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,090
Good morning everyone.
Welcome to the today show.

1651
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,220
Today we have Tom cruise.

1652
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,700
I'll never forget him and Tom cruise
arguing over whether or not Brooke shields

1653
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:41,200
should take antidepressants. That's a
real, that's a real clip. Oh, crazy.

1654
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:44,170
Yeah, they're, they're arguing
over it and it's so strange.

1655
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,400
Him and Matt Lauer and Tom cruise and
Tom cruise is telling Matt Lauer he's

1656
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:52,780
being glib. Who? Being glib. Matt,
you're being glib. Cause ma ma,

1657
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:56,140
you know Tom cruise is like, he's
a Scientologist and they don't,

1658
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,270
they don't believe in
pharmaceutical drugs.

1659
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:01,570
They don't believe in antidepressants
or psychiatry. There it is right there.

1660
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,390
There's the two of them arguing
and Matt Lauer has got that.

1661
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:08,560
I'm thinking cause I'm holding a pen
and pieces of paper war the world.

1662
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,310
That's early art. It was a
big deal. It's a big deal.

1663
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:16,480
It fucked a Tom Cruise's career for a
long time as people like this guy's a

1664
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:20,490
fucking nut. Plus they talking about
somebody else's business though. I,

1665
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,650
I'm talking about, he had
talked about it publicly.

1666
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,970
He had talked about the mistake
that she's making by taking, uh,

1667
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,910
antidepressants. Okay. Say, yeah, yes,
that's it. Then I saw in the game,

1668
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,290
well the psychiatry, psychiatry
is the enemy of Scientology.

1669
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:36,450
They have all these, um,

1670
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:40,420
they have a big science of psychiatry
kills and it's like someone would like an

1671
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:45,280
electric fucking shock thing in their
head going, ah, it's like in Hollywood.

1672
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,050
Like they're, they're on this crusade
against SA against psychiatry.

1673
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,450
It's like a big part
of what Scientology is.

1674
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,590
The thing that makes me laugh is
that I don't see a lot of Southern

1675
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,423
Scientologists.

1676
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:01,110
I don't see a lot of Scientologists
the big things in Clearwater.

1677
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:05,800
That's the number one headquarters.
Clearwater, my sister lives down there.

1678
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:09,220
She lives real close to where
the num, the headquarters is.

1679
01:34:09,221 --> 01:34:11,530
It's fucking weird down
there man. Everybody just,

1680
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,570
they're all walking
like they got a secret.

1681
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,710
Do you, do you think in this society,

1682
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,820
do you think Scientology will
be the last religion created?

1683
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:24,600
Like when you really think
about how recent Scientology is,

1684
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:29,850
it's like the 1940s or fifties somewhere.
Not like, it's roughly the same age.

1685
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:33,990
Just like, I don't know. I can
United airlines, Delta airlines,

1686
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:38,310
like it's not an old religion. We have
videos of the guy who made it. Yeah.

1687
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:42,690
Yeah. Will that be the last
religion that is like create it? No.

1688
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,510
Cause every other religion
is like old school. You know,

1689
01:34:45,511 --> 01:34:47,460
centuries and millennials old, but

1690
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,660
no, there'll be new ones.

1691
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,260
The interesting thing is they're probably
the last ones to get task tax exempt

1692
01:34:52,261 --> 01:34:56,190
status because their tax exempt
status is being questioned right now.

1693
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,040
Like there's people that
very angry about it,

1694
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:03,020
but they did it because they all started
lawsuits against the IRS and they

1695
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:04,490
started thousands of lawsuits.

1696
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:09,491
The idea was that they were going to
Sue the IRS into recognizing them as a

1697
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:14,030
legitimate religion and the way to
do that was just overwhelm them with

1698
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:17,920
litigation and that's what they
did, right? Yeah, they still do.

1699
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:18,800
That's what they did.

1700
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,030
They then they achieve tax exempt status
a long time ago there. They're very,

1701
01:35:23,031 --> 01:35:27,530
it's a very strange, have you ever
read, I'm going clear, I saw the,

1702
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,530
this HBO thing, it's the doc is great.

1703
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:34,400
The book is even crazier because Lawrence
Wright goes into depth with all these

1704
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:37,910
different people that were like, as they
were realizing that it was horseshit.

1705
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,420
Like as they were getting like the,

1706
01:35:39,421 --> 01:35:44,421
the ninth level of doom papers open up
and it's handwritten nonsense by a retard

1707
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,960
like that. That guy who
wrote it was a, he was self,

1708
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:51,200
he was like self-diagnosing all of his,

1709
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:56,201
his own personal ailments and dealing
with them himself and then trying to like

1710
01:35:56,811 --> 01:36:00,590
pass that off as like a way to live
amongst all these people that were paying

1711
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:04,340
attention to him. But all of it started
for him from himself diagnosing.

1712
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,160
Is it? Is it natural for
Scientologists and I'm only,

1713
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:12,850
I only know what I know from that doc
and Leah remedying within lifetime shade.

1714
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,630
Is it natural to not be like the way a
Christian is just openly Christian? Just,

1715
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,720
Hey, how you doing? The Lord loves
you. I'm here to tell you about Jesus.

1716
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,930
I don't really feel like
you get that from science.

1717
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:24,740
Like normally what I like
and watching that doc,

1718
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:28,830
I didn't know the dude from Chicago
PD used to be like the gritty.

1719
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,810
Yeah, detective guy. Yeah.

1720
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:33,880
Oh damn. I know you used
to be a Scientologist,

1721
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:37,180
but you'd never find out that somebody
was into that shit until after they're

1722
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,043
out of it

1723
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,730
now. I think people keep it tucked.

1724
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:43,520
It's not like Mormons where they riding
the bikes and you know what the fuck the

1725
01:36:43,521 --> 01:36:47,570
deal is. Yeah. Now they keep it tucked in,

1726
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,880
but I think back in the day they used
to talk about it as openly as Poe.

1727
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:53,120
They'd proselytize, they
try to get you to join,

1728
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:57,150
but how like just calm.

1729
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,830
Just try and try to get people
to come to these events,

1730
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,950
try to get people to come
to these free workshops,

1731
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,730
all these different things on
anxiety, different things on the mind.

1732
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,350
Dianetics that's what he did.

1733
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:12,880
Decided to write about Dianetics and it's
like the science of cleaning your mind

1734
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:17,440
and avoiding all external influences
that are negative and that are ruining

1735
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:18,970
your, your perspective. And

1736
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,780
you said B commercials for that.
And in the eighties and nineties

1737
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:24,170
damn man, I bought it.
I bought a Dionex book.

1738
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,440
I got on the list with the volcano
exploding in the commercial.

1739
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,500
I remember I bought everything
man. I bought Tony Robbins shit.

1740
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:35,030
I bought all kinds of, I bought book of
five rings. I bought fucking art of war.

1741
01:37:35,031 --> 01:37:37,430
I bought everything. I was just trying
to figure out like what's the best,

1742
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,670
I was into psychology when I was young
because I was fighting all the time and I

1743
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:41,570
was always scared.

1744
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:45,920
So it was trying to figure out this gotta
be a way to like overcome these mental

1745
01:37:45,921 --> 01:37:49,280
hurdles. Like does that was like
for martial arts competition.

1746
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:53,630
The big thing was the fear and wasn't
your physical ability wasn't as much of a

1747
01:37:53,631 --> 01:37:56,190
hurdle as the fear, you know,

1748
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,550
if the, the fear of competition was
terrible. So I was like, it's good,

1749
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:04,440
but sometimes I feel confident and it'd
be great and other times it'd be fucking

1750
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:07,830
terrified and like what got to
figure out how to be consistent.

1751
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:11,970
So I started getting into all that kind
of stuff and then when I came to LA, um,

1752
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,300
it's like in 94 I saw Dianetics
commercials said fuck it, I'll order that.

1753
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:20,170
So I got this little wave, the questions
you seek the answers to here it is.

1754
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:25,310
Can word said during an operation harm
you later page one 82 is it possible to

1755
01:38:25,371 --> 01:38:29,820
increase intelligence page one 22 I was
like, Oh my God, ed. Yeah, look at that.

1756
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:33,380
Tauntaun ah, Dianetics bro.

1757
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,320
Be like a fucking volcano takeover. Yeah.

1758
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,190
I was like thinking that I was going
to be able to figure out all my mental

1759
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:42,270
problems through this book.

1760
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:47,450
And then I got on the list and like every
week I got some new workshop to go to

1761
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:51,120
or this I just put it there. Just
a male, female or male, just male.

1762
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:55,350
This is the 90s that's all they did was
just mail you shit and, but Oh my God,

1763
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:56,500
I got, I wanted this.

1764
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:00,180
It wasn't until I moved and one
of the reasons why when I moved,

1765
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:04,830
I didn't forward my mail. I contacted
all the companies because of Dianetics.

1766
01:39:04,831 --> 01:39:09,210
I'd get so much shit from them.
Really? It was the fucking,

1767
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:13,030
that much shit. It was so much shit.
It was like letter after letter,

1768
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,970
like the grocery store. Also,

1769
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:18,240
it started freaking me out that they
knew where I was. Like it bothered me.

1770
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:21,750
It bothered me. Like it bothered
me that I was on a list.

1771
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:24,990
I was on a list of someone who bought
the book but didn't go to any classes and

1772
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:26,700
they knew where I was like
maybe I could get them,

1773
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,310
maybe they would just
knock on his door. Hey,

1774
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:32,700
do you want to clean up your brain?
Hey, come on, we've got the solution.

1775
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:36,480
Don't you want to be a volcano?
That's scary bro. Yeah, that's scary.

1776
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,250
There's a lot of people
get sucked into that man.

1777
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:42,210
I met quite a few people
that were Scientologists. I
was in the summer, the um,

1778
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:46,260
[inaudible] I call it the, you
can do it, motivational stuff.

1779
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:51,030
And I remember in high school,
um, I J ROTC commander w used to,

1780
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:54,450
he used to make us watch this guy
think his name was Bob Malott.

1781
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:58,590
[inaudible] M O w a D Bob
Malott if I'm not mistaken.

1782
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:02,310
He was a Vietnam vet and he like survive
like a terrible white phosphorous

1783
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,820
grenade accident and suddenly like
get fucked up real bad in Vietnam.

1784
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:09,870
But it was now doing motivational
speaking and once a month we would watch

1785
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:13,830
videos of this dude. And
like it just starts in a way,

1786
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:15,150
like if you get into one,

1787
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:17,400
you can kind of start getting in
line with the next and the next.

1788
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,390
And I think before you know it,

1789
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:22,410
that's when you're into Dianetics land
before you've realized like you can find

1790
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:24,390
someone that's meaningful
with a meaningful message.

1791
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,020
And then as you progress more
and more, is that all right?

1792
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:31,890
I agree with less and less of each
author that I'm starting to fuck with.

1793
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,570
And so it ended up Bob Malott and Dan
like I think Dave Ramsey started foe

1794
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:41,490
financial shit. Yeah. Well when I was 21
and I was first starting to do comedy,

1795
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:45,000
that's when I was really devouring as
much of it as possible cause I was trying

1796
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:48,960
to figure out like how to not
be so lazy, how to be motivated,

1797
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:50,640
how to get shit done and how to,

1798
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,580
how to like find the correct path
and think about things correctly.

1799
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,620
And so I, that's when I really
got into [inaudible]. Yeah,

1800
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,960
I would follow all those personal power.

1801
01:41:01,961 --> 01:41:05,590
Like you had workshops that you would
do like a little like notebooks and shit

1802
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,210
fill out and things to talk about
and things to concentrate on.

1803
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:13,030
Like if you did do it, it would help
you. But really what it's all about,

1804
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:14,740
it's just getting your
shit together and moving.

1805
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:19,660
Just go do something like what you did
by taking a job when you would show up at

1806
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:23,170
a gig and you'd be working there Tuesday
through Sunday and then take a day job

1807
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:23,951
and work nine to five.

1808
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:28,570
That is more hustle and more hustle
mindset than anything you're ever going to

1809
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:32,050
get out of an Anthony Robbins book.
Like that is like just doing it.

1810
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,830
Just doing it makes you do
more, like do more hardship,

1811
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:37,300
makes you do more hard shit.

1812
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:40,390
Understand that you want it bad so
you're willing to put in the work and do

1813
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:41,350
things you don't want to do.

1814
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:46,450
It's what makes you have that confidence
that you know how to push through and

1815
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,120
the the, the mentality that I'm
the type of do to get shit done.

1816
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:50,171
Like I'm gonna show,

1817
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:52,690
I'm not going to waste my day just
sitting around a fucking hotel room.

1818
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:54,790
Now I'm gonna go to work,
I'm going to work all day.

1819
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:58,390
I'm gonna drive five hours and keep that
radio gig and then dry fires and spent

1820
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:03,400
10 hours of the fucking 24 in a day
in a goddamn car to do gigs forward.

1821
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:09,400
Focus just to do gigs. Keep that radio
kid. Yeah. Those things are every,

1822
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:11,560
like I had a guy on yesterday,
this guy Dan Crenshaw,

1823
01:42:11,561 --> 01:42:13,810
he's a Congressman who's also a Navy seal.

1824
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:18,280
When we're talking about 'em mentality,
I'm like, when you went through buds,

1825
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:22,410
is there, do they teach you how to
think or do they show you by example?

1826
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:24,430
They don't teach how to
think. They just show you.

1827
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:27,550
They harden you through all that
work and through all that work,

1828
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,680
do that insane hell week.

1829
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,840
All the shit that you have to do
when you go on through buds training,

1830
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:36,270
the six months of breaking you down and
building you back up, they teach you.

1831
01:42:36,271 --> 01:42:39,850
You could do anything just
by my making you do anything,

1832
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:44,620
so you will understand how
you can pass your limits,

1833
01:42:44,621 --> 01:42:47,260
what you thought your limits
were, are no longer your limits.

1834
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,320
That's what I feel like is missing from
a lot of people that are getting into

1835
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,770
motivational this motivational
that they ain't doing shit.

1836
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,940
You got to go do something.
That's the number one thing right?

1837
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,100
Is fucking action. Take action.

1838
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:03,640
Do you believe that people that aren't
as successful as you think they should be

1839
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:07,900
are qualified to be
motivational speakers? No.

1840
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:10,520
No motorcycle. Yeah.

1841
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:15,310
Most people who are doing motivational
speaking should stop. They should stop.

1842
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:18,160
You're just robbing people. You're
not even motivated yourself.

1843
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,710
Like I want to see, I want to wake you
up at three o'clock in the morning. I go,

1844
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:22,520
come on man. We're going
running like, let me see.

1845
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:25,330
You want to see what you do when you're
tired. Let me see how you push yourself.

1846
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:28,330
Come on man. Get up. Get up again
tomorrow. Get up again tomorrow.

1847
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:31,750
Get up again tomorrow. The next day. Get
up, get up, get up, get up, keep going.

1848
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,790
How long can you maintain
a positive attitude?

1849
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:37,330
Where's all his teaching it teaching
people you can't do shit yourself.

1850
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,210
They you need to show
people that you could do it.

1851
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,310
The best motivational speakers to me
are guys like David Goggins cause that,

1852
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,670
that guy that that's and that
fucking, that coin right there.

1853
01:43:48,810 --> 01:43:51,190
That guy does it every
day and he's got videos.

1854
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,820
He just did a a hundred
mile race the other day.

1855
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,010
Put up the results on Instagram.

1856
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:58,640
You could see him showing up
22 hours after the race starts.

1857
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:02,830
He finishes a hundred miles. Like
those type of people. Those are motor.

1858
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:06,960
If you ever, you ever seen Goggins is a
Instagram page, but this is insane bro.

1859
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:11,510
He's a fucking animal. This motherfucker
got abs on a coin. He's an animal.

1860
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:16,100
He's got the world record
chin-ups in in 24 hours.

1861
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,680
He did some preposterous number
of chin-ups. What's that?

1862
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:23,910
I believe he was beat recently. Somebody
beat him. I think so. I have it. Yeah,

1863
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,080
we'll probably come back back. Yeah,
but it's those types of people.

1864
01:44:27,081 --> 01:44:31,760
Those are real motivational speakers
cause they're actually doing something.

1865
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,130
There's a lot of people that
are teaching you motivation.

1866
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:37,730
They don't have a business. They don't,
they're not their businesses motivation.

1867
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,890
Like it's a weird
business. It's like yeah,

1868
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,360
it's like teaching someone how to
drive a race car. You never drove one.

1869
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,080
But see that's why. And that
goes back to the whole for me,

1870
01:44:47,081 --> 01:44:50,230
the whole New York versus LA
thing. In terms of comics,

1871
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:52,900
you just be around other the
comics that are just doing,

1872
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:57,190
like when you see David tail, like
you'll see David Taylor in February,

1873
01:44:57,191 --> 01:45:00,820
you'll see them do 20 minutes, right?
And then you'll see him in March,

1874
01:45:00,821 --> 01:45:03,430
you'll see them do a totally different
20 and then you'll see them three months

1875
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:08,431
later and he's taken two pieces of the
five minutes from those first 20 and put

1876
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:13,180
it with a new killer. Fucking 30 and
I'll go, what happened to the 20 Oh yeah,

1877
01:45:13,181 --> 01:45:16,020
that stuff wasn't tight enough. And
it is, but this joke, this is it.

1878
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:17,560
And when he breaks down,

1879
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:22,561
why that joke that you love doesn't even
fucking mattered to them because it was

1880
01:45:23,531 --> 01:45:28,420
to get to this like that. You can't
teach that. You can't explain it,

1881
01:45:28,421 --> 01:45:31,030
but you can show it. And then I can
go home and go, fuck, I need to write.

1882
01:45:31,031 --> 01:45:32,890
I need to go back and look at my
old shit and figure out a way.

1883
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:37,100
David tells one of the rare
guys that became an alcoholic,

1884
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,660
sobered up and got better, right?

1885
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:45,560
Like usually the guys who are
drunk are fucking hilarious.

1886
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:49,370
And then they stopped drinking and they
get boring. Yeah, he got the opposite.

1887
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:53,630
He became a way better comic
titer and just punchlines. And

1888
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:56,700
people say that about M and. M they
say they don't. Once he sobered up

1889
01:45:57,270 --> 01:46:00,270
and what? Clean these better?
No, that it was worse. Yeah.

1890
01:46:00,450 --> 01:46:02,550
That's what usually happens.
So it happens to everybody.

1891
01:46:02,551 --> 01:46:05,760
It happened at Kinnison happened to
bill Hicks. It happened to everybody.

1892
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,830
I never had on, not,
not necessarily Hicks.

1893
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,360
I've never had alcohol, a love
alcoholic. I'll drink here and there.

1894
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:17,250
But I used to get pissed in my twenties
when I would go on stage drunk or tipsy

1895
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:18,084
or whatever the fuck.

1896
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:22,410
And then after the show people would
give the liquor credit for me being funny

1897
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,810
and it used to offend me. So
that's why I stopped drinking.

1898
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,240
Wow. Okay. Fuck. Gave credit to the list.

1899
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,120
You're so funny. When you joined, this
was funny. You should drink more or the,

1900
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:33,260
you know, on these road rooms,

1901
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:36,560
they'll sing you shots cause
you're on stage with Jack.

1902
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,720
And they've associated
that as part of the,

1903
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:40,790
so also you lose control of the audience.

1904
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:43,730
At least I do when I'm up there
drinking because then this is a shot.

1905
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:47,540
Someone else sends a shot and now
it's a fucking date. It's a rock.

1906
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,980
It's a pep rally. It
started about, yeah, when

1907
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,770
people are sending you
shots, that's a disaster.

1908
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,960
That's a disaster because then
everybody wants to send you a shot.

1909
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:57,720
But then what am I doing in my performance
that made someone think it was cool

1910
01:46:57,721 --> 01:47:00,780
to do that and that that would make
this experience better for everybody.

1911
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:03,390
You're doing a Bert Kreischer,
you turn it into a party,

1912
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,570
take your shirt off at the story,

1913
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,380
my style and hollering at each other
to shut the fuck up so I can get this

1914
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:11,550
chisel shit out of my mouth. So I, uh,

1915
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:14,670
so it totally changed how I, you know,

1916
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:18,930
and also alcohol makes me sleepy and then
it was too much driving in the 20s and

1917
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:22,470
stuff. So I can't be drowsy,
hit it home. So I don't know.

1918
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,440
It was just never my thing.
Yeah, it's a tricky one man.

1919
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:29,860
Because like one drink will
loosen you up two drinks. Ah,

1920
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:33,660
now again, a little silly. Three
drinks. Now you're kind of drunk,

1921
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:38,400
you know when you could still do
it. But is it as good as one drink?

1922
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:41,040
No it's not. But once you get
one drink and you get happy,

1923
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,390
you want another drink, fuck off another
one. And then next thing you know it,

1924
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:48,330
you're a little drunk and you're
on stage. Like I'm at that age now.

1925
01:47:48,331 --> 01:47:51,780
I can't remember what comic did a joke
like this, but maybe a couple of them.

1926
01:47:51,781 --> 01:47:53,640
But we're before you drink,

1927
01:47:53,641 --> 01:47:57,750
you have to look at your schedule for
the next day and a half to make sure you

1928
01:47:57,751 --> 01:48:01,230
have the bounce back and recovery
and all of that shit. Yeah.

1929
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,710
It's not just can I go out Friday? It's
what am I doing Saturday and Sunday?

1930
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:08,460
Well, you're a goal-oriented guy. It
seems like for goal oriented people,

1931
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:11,610
the alcohol is one of the biggest
impediments. You know, the craziest thing.

1932
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:14,730
And the only thing I've never been able
to make proper time for in my career is

1933
01:48:14,731 --> 01:48:17,100
exercise. Really? Yeah. Why not?

1934
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:19,980
I'm not good about exercise
because they're a trainer.

1935
01:48:19,981 --> 01:48:22,710
You've got money cause it's a
that still, I don't have time.

1936
01:48:22,711 --> 01:48:26,710
There's the time and so and my brain,
it's while I'm at, when I'm going on,

1937
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,750
when I was still living in LA,

1938
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:32,130
I had a trainer and I got to New York
and then it's must do this. Must write,

1939
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:33,270
must watch the video.

1940
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:37,060
If I exercise I will be too tired
and then productivity will go down.

1941
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:40,560
And when I know deep down when
I exercise, I'm more creative.

1942
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,290
The brain juices and shit work more.

1943
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:47,910
But it's the only thing that I've never
been able to like properly regiment in

1944
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:52,140
my life. Well this is how you fix that
force yourself. Like we're in August.

1945
01:48:52,141 --> 01:48:55,560
Okay. We have a what? Six more
days? Seven more days of August,

1946
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:58,590
something like that. What is
today? 10 more days. 10 more days.

1947
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,150
Say the 21st so we have 10 more
days. August. Do you just say,

1948
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:05,250
at the end of this fucking month,

1949
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:08,520
I am going to have a trainer and I'm
going to work out three days a week with

1950
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:10,470
that trainer, period. This
is how we're going to do it.

1951
01:49:10,471 --> 01:49:14,160
Write it down and then just get it
done and force yourself for one month,

1952
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:17,130
for one month, for the month
of September for that month.

1953
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:20,730
You have to work out three days a week
and you write it down and then publicly

1954
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:22,680
stated so that you can't back out of it.

1955
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:24,690
Put it on Twitter or put it on Instagram.

1956
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,000
Take one of those shirtless
pictures of my gut, just profile,

1957
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:31,830
show everyone and let them
clown me. But if you do that,

1958
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,560
you'll force yourself to do it. And
next thing you know you've done it.

1959
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:39,200
You know like I have this dog
that loves running and so I'm,

1960
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:41,700
I make sure that if I don't
take him running, he's,

1961
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,850
he's always a pain in the ass. He's
dropping the ball on the table,

1962
01:49:44,851 --> 01:49:47,740
trying to get you to play. Like
he's a very energetic. Yeah.

1963
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,450
So like that motherfucker makes me run
five days a week, five days a week.

1964
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:55,390
I get up, I'm like, come on bro,
let's go, let's go. He goes crazy.

1965
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:58,200
He starts running around in
circles. He and then, and then we,

1966
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:03,040
we go hit the trails. Is this the dog
that you saw? What was it? What was it?

1967
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:07,000
A snake or some shit you ran over
while you were jogging one day.

1968
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:11,350
Like [inaudible] dog. Yeah. That was a
different dog. Yeah, that was crazy, man.

1969
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:14,530
I jumped over this log and as I was
jumping over this long, I'm like,

1970
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:18,880
that's how rattlesnake it was.
Fat dude. Like my forearm.

1971
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:22,600
I was like fuck one of the biggest
snakes I've ever seen in terms of

1972
01:50:22,601 --> 01:50:25,640
rattlesnakes. It was big
like six feet long, big.

1973
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:31,090
That is a big fucking snake. And he
was just laying flat out on the road.

1974
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:35,080
Like a stick. Just warming. Yeah.
And the dogs went right over it.

1975
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:38,410
They didn't even notice it cause it
was just completely flattened out.

1976
01:50:38,411 --> 01:50:43,310
I was literally in the air over it
before. I'm like, Oh my God. Yeah.

1977
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:46,420
That was a different one. Man. I've
killed a bunch of rattlesnakes.

1978
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:48,100
Men always seeing those fuckers.

1979
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:52,570
There was one in my neighborhood real
recently where there's a video of a Bobcat

1980
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:56,350
and a rattlesnake duking it out
in the middle of the street,

1981
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,340
like telling them they fucking a mile
from my house and man, it's crazy.

1982
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:04,660
Freaking coyotes out here, man. There's
a lot of weird wildlife out here.

1983
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:08,170
You know California's got weird wildlife.
There's a lot of shit out there.

1984
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:12,070
A lot of Bobcats and mountain
lines. What did we have down South?

1985
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:13,810
We just said squirrel. So
that was the only little

1986
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:19,900
[inaudible] that shit. You guys have
coyotes now. Kylie's are everywhere.

1987
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:23,280
They have coyotes in every fucking
state. 50 States probably eating them.

1988
01:51:23,281 --> 01:51:26,290
I fucking coyote saying, Oh yeah,
for sure. People eat coyotes.

1989
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,930
There's someone eating a
coyote right now. Right now.

1990
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:32,320
While we're someone listening to
this right now. Jerky, not bad.

1991
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:35,530
I guarantee you one of your listeners
knows a person that makes a coyote jerky.

1992
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:40,060
Probably. Yeah, I'd try that
shit. My friend Steve Rinella,

1993
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:43,300
who's going to be here tomorrow,
he cooked and ate a coyote on TV.

1994
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:45,610
They wanted to see what it tasted like.

1995
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,760
Oh look at this fucker on
a trail near San Diego.

1996
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:52,750
We could go the size of that
chicken fucker. God damn,

1997
01:51:52,751 --> 01:51:57,430
it's all curled up and ready to go to,
we're two sprawled out as the society.

1998
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,210
Yeah. Well these motherfuckers
are everywhere too and
we need them by the way,

1999
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:04,390
cause that's why there's not as
many rats and rabbits and shit.

2000
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:07,180
It's a whole beautiful
ecosystem out there.

2001
01:52:07,181 --> 01:52:10,240
Have you heard the number of rats
they've found out or in LA recently?

2002
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:13,240
I just saw a story about it last
night. It's disgustingly scary.

2003
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,700
All at the comedy store.
12 million over 12 million.

2004
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:19,150
They're all the comedies and if they hit
all 12 there's about 1.5% of them that

2005
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:21,190
are, have this disgusting
diseases. And instead,

2006
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:24,510
if it hits over 2% it starts
spreading into people. Oh.

2007
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:29,950
Oh good times, bro. You got
to move to the mountains.

2008
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:32,320
Yeah man. I moved some quotes, bro.

2009
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:36,460
Genetic code to simple that
can freaking reproduce. Yeah.

2010
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:41,170
Sisters and mom is that sisters
and fathers and yeah, no problem.

2011
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:44,550
They have no problem fucking this. No
mutation. Is that true? They don't.

2012
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,940
They have like a spreading problems.

2013
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:51,360
That's why they can really dreamless
gestation can be pregnant again.

2014
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,860
Three months. Give me pregnant
again. Did you ever see that?

2015
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:58,670
A documentary on Netflix, that
rats documentary? No. Whoo.

2016
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:01,790
You ready for that one? That's
a good one. Write that down.

2017
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:04,610
That one's going to freak
you out because it details,

2018
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,700
they catch some of them and they
just run some tests on them.

2019
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:12,500
And this is a in suburban Atlanta and
they find all kinds of crazy fucking

2020
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:14,480
diseases and they have Manhattan,

2021
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:18,800
they show all these rat scrambling over
garbage and into the sewer system and

2022
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,330
they show how smart they are,

2023
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,910
how they'll send the young
rats to test out poison.

2024
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:26,810
And then the young rats will eat the
poison and die and then the old rats like,

2025
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:30,830
okay, we get it. And then they, they're
smart Daptiv. Yeah man, they're,

2026
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:31,664
they're clever.

2027
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:36,560
I mean there are the most prevalent
mammal in any city. You know,

2028
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:39,450
if you look at any like just sheer
numbers and just we're going to do,

2029
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,580
that's a hustle hustler right there.

2030
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:43,970
There's more Brown rat in New York
city than there are human beings.

2031
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:49,100
I think there's more bio mass of rats
than there is bio mass of human beings.

2032
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:54,280
So that means the weight. Yeah, just
the weight. The weight of check volume.

2033
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,210
That's true. I might've made that up,

2034
01:53:57,410 --> 01:54:02,300
but the biomass of a, I
mean just the sheer numbers,

2035
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:06,140
it's, there's not another other animal
that you can think of that's like that.

2036
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,110
What's the remix

2037
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,560
of anywhere between eight point 4,000,020
14 all the way up to 33.6 million rats

2038
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,120
in New York city. Cheesy.

2039
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:20,910
That's more than there are people
for sure. Yeah. Try 18 million.

2040
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:25,680
God, God, rats.

2041
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:31,260
The documentary's amazing man. They're
vectors of diseases. They've always been,

2042
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:33,570
wasn't carrying diseases.
What's the number of red?

2043
01:54:33,571 --> 01:54:36,480
What's the red infestation looking like
in countries where they eat rat stuff?

2044
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,020
Interests, disease. Fucking not
a lot of countries eat rats.

2045
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,240
He knows the weirdest shit.

2046
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,760
You ever seen those temples in
India where they feed the rats?

2047
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:47,880
The rats are everywhere. Dude.
That'll give you the heebie. Jeebies.

2048
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:52,050
These people were drinking out of like
bowls of milk that the rats drink out of.

2049
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:53,460
They like scoop it up. They,

2050
01:54:53,461 --> 01:54:55,980
they have all these rats
over like literally running

2051
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,530
[inaudible] or is it just this is
your crib either rats, they feed them.

2052
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,510
Look at this. What do you got here? Jamie?

2053
01:55:04,550 --> 01:55:08,300
Was this rat temple speed up ahead. So
you could see what it's like when the,

2054
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,040
all the rats and the
people interact. Yeah.

2055
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,310
So they put out food for the rats
and the rats. You could pick them up.

2056
01:55:14,311 --> 01:55:18,390
I mean the rats, I have zero fear
of people and in fact they're like,

2057
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,710
they get along with people.

2058
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,370
So this is like a temple that you
visited in India and fucking rats are

2059
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:26,700
everywhere and everybody
treats these rats with respect.

2060
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:31,890
Very coexisting. Yeah. So the reason
why rats are scared of people,

2061
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:34,380
they recognize that people want to
kill them because they carry diseases.

2062
01:55:34,381 --> 01:55:37,320
But in India they just got a
totally different vibe going on.

2063
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:40,500
So look like those pigeons are hanging
around those rants in New York city.

2064
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:44,550
Rats, hunt pigeons. You ever see rats,
killer pigeons and drag them away like,

2065
01:55:44,551 --> 01:55:47,310
Whoa. Have you seen the
video of the Pelican?

2066
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:51,930
That aided pigeon swallowed the whole
boom. I saw a Pelican eat a duck,

2067
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:57,990
hold jock. Just pelicans and low
key assholes, assholes, dinosaurs.

2068
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,650
Look at these fucking rats, man. They're
everywhere. That's where we're headed.

2069
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,660
Rats are pellets. We hit headed with
fucking rats in New York. You think so?

2070
01:56:06,661 --> 01:56:07,860
It's just gotta be normal. I mean,

2071
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:11,220
people are gonna try and stomp 'em out
and poison and trap and all of that.

2072
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:13,360
But at some point you just
gotta go high man have hit two.

2073
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:18,330
They're maintaining right now. All
right, you can still go to a restaurant.

2074
01:56:18,331 --> 01:56:20,580
You still go to the
movies, still go shopping.

2075
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:24,720
It's all normal and there's millions of
rants running underneath your feet under

2076
01:56:24,721 --> 01:56:29,310
the ground. What's, what's the
plan? What's de Blasio's plan?

2077
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:33,130
Yeah, for people. Definitely rats.

2078
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:37,740
Fucking plan. What kind of plan is you
have to take care of his corrupt cops.

2079
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:41,220
Take care of his, uh, all the
problems with the streets.

2080
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:45,290
Take care of all the crime. Take it.
They know rat problems and plans,

2081
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:50,190
but they had like all these studies and
EPA motherfuckers that mr money did they

2082
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:50,820
have,

2083
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:54,330
how much money is Blasio have like how
much money they have to spend on things

2084
01:56:54,331 --> 01:56:56,700
like rats. They probably
don't have any budget.

2085
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:59,490
It probably doesn't present
as much of an ominous threat.

2086
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:04,850
This crime or bridges and you know
tunnel shit and takes all you know,

2087
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:09,390
infrastructure probably it would
have to be a pandemic disease,

2088
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:12,270
which as Jamie was
saying can happen there.

2089
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:16,650
We have medieval diseases showing up
here now that particularly in trash and

2090
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:20,610
shit in Hollywood or in downtown
LA with all the homeless people.

2091
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,990
It's fucking crazy because people are
literally just shitting on the street just

2092
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:27,030
shitting everywhere. The, the,

2093
01:57:27,031 --> 01:57:30,930
the homeless situation in downtown LA
scares me more than the rat situation.

2094
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:33,113
What's the numbers?

2095
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:38,190
Oh you need to send us a thousand have
you ever driven through skid row? Yeah.

2096
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,000
Bananas, right? Yeah. Cause
it's close to fashion row.

2097
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:46,050
This are you into fashion? No,
but I was over there one day.

2098
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:52,230
There's thousands and thousands of people
just living on the street. Thousands,

2099
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:52,740
thousands. Like a,

2100
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:57,740
like a whole gigantic theater sells out
and all the people pile out onto the

2101
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:03,120
street, but that's where they live.
That's what it's like. It's like,

2102
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:06,570
like people go into the Verizon center,

2103
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:10,800
like 7,000 people you find
in a few streets and they
think the solution is some

2104
01:58:10,801 --> 01:58:14,100
sort of hostels or something that they
can start trying to do. Good luck.

2105
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:17,490
These people have accumulate, they've
like, they've become accustomed, they've,

2106
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:21,570
that's their lifestyle. Like
that's not what they want for sure,

2107
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,060
but they're accustomed to being homeless.

2108
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:27,810
Like they've acclimated to that
world and they've lived in it,

2109
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:31,290
many of them for years and years and
years and they go to places in shelters

2110
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:33,510
where they get food, they
sleep out on the street.

2111
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:35,550
They have a whole community of
people that are out in the street.

2112
01:58:35,551 --> 01:58:38,700
They're all doing drugs and most
of them are psychiatric patients.

2113
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:42,040
Half of this stuff, a
lot of them ask the thing

2114
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,310
that really fucks me up with the
homeless population in this country,

2115
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:49,180
is it half of it? And then on some
mental illness, shit, maybe some of them,

2116
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:52,090
their family just can't give
them the care they need.

2117
01:58:52,091 --> 01:58:53,290
But if they got the care they need,

2118
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:57,670
maybe they could be a little more level
enough to at least be under a roof with

2119
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:01,390
the love when a somebody that can afford
to, you know, yes. To take them in.

2120
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:01,720
Yeah,

2121
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,590
no, no, I think you're absolutely
right. And in the 1980s they,

2122
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:08,200
some of them have problems that
are solvable. Yeah. Some of them,

2123
01:59:08,201 --> 01:59:11,180
but some of them don't have anybody to
help them get through the problem. Sure.

2124
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,930
I mean, and then things
deteriorate, you know,

2125
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:15,970
they get worse and worse and
worse. And as you get older,

2126
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:18,980
you lose hope and then you say, this
is me, this is who I am now. Yeah.

2127
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:23,160
There's, there's like, there's,

2128
01:59:23,161 --> 01:59:26,630
there's like this weird thing
with the homeless as well,

2129
01:59:26,631 --> 01:59:29,230
where I feel like as a country, like we,

2130
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:34,010
we're quicker to help people in
groups like it, like in a weird way,

2131
01:59:34,011 --> 01:59:36,830
it still fucks me up and
it's gonna come out wrong.

2132
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:39,800
But if there's a natural disaster,

2133
01:59:39,801 --> 01:59:44,801
the amount of money we will pour into
relief and support for particular area

2134
01:59:45,081 --> 01:59:48,410
after the hurricane or the tornado
or whatever, and that's fine.

2135
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:53,450
That same type of outpouring happened
just once for the homeless coast to coast.

2136
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:56,570
It would change so much
fucking shit, bro. Yes,

2137
01:59:56,630 --> 02:00:01,610
but if people are fucked up in a
group at once, then it doesn't,

2138
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,260
it doesn't resonate.

2139
02:00:03,261 --> 02:00:07,610
Like when you see a single homeless person
or the news just shows you the row of

2140
02:00:07,611 --> 02:00:08,444
tents,

2141
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:12,080
you don't see the person crying with
the rubble behind them and they've lost

2142
02:00:12,081 --> 02:00:15,500
everything. It doesn't, for whatever
reason, it doesn't connect the same.

2143
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:17,700
No, you're absolutely right. We need,

2144
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,330
like if if something like Katrina
happened or a giant earthquake,

2145
02:00:21,331 --> 02:00:23,040
then we would realize
we have to do something,

2146
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:27,390
but if there was no homeless people and
then all of a sudden something terrible

2147
02:00:27,391 --> 02:00:31,140
happened and there was 20,000 almost
people wandering around downtown,

2148
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:33,960
we would immediately go, Oh,
we've got to fix this simmering,

2149
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:35,910
slow sort of effect.

2150
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:41,600
It's similar and similar how much
money we spent on other countries,

2151
02:00:41,611 --> 02:00:44,040
right? How much money we spend
on aid, how much money we spent,

2152
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:48,690
and we don't fix inner cities that have
been impoverished since the fucking 18

2153
02:00:48,691 --> 02:00:52,590
hundreds we don't ever go in
there and try to solve problems.

2154
02:00:52,591 --> 02:00:54,300
We don't look at it. I've
been saying this forever,

2155
02:00:54,301 --> 02:00:55,950
like if you want a better country,

2156
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:59,250
the best way is to ensure
there's less losers.

2157
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:03,060
And the best way to ensure there's less
losers is give people more opportunities

2158
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:06,960
and fix places where you're,
you have no chance. I mean,

2159
02:01:06,961 --> 02:01:08,250
how many people that grow up in,

2160
02:01:08,251 --> 02:01:12,840
in neighborhoods where they have no
chance get out. It's like it's a tiny,

2161
02:01:12,841 --> 02:01:15,780
tiny fraction of people that wanted
to become successful and happy.

2162
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:20,190
Most of them are trapped by
the environment that they
find themselves just by a

2163
02:01:20,191 --> 02:01:21,570
random roll the dice,

2164
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:25,350
they wind up and they're in Detroit and
they're in the worst neighborhood in

2165
02:01:25,351 --> 02:01:25,771
Detroit,

2166
02:01:25,771 --> 02:01:29,100
or they're in the South side of Chicago
or they're in Baltimore or wherever the

2167
02:01:29,101 --> 02:01:32,190
fuck it is, and then no one
does anything to fix it.

2168
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,720
No one does anything to change it.

2169
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:37,860
But if there was no place like that and
all of a sudden the disaster happened

2170
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,060
and then there was a place like,

2171
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:42,770
then there'd be an outpouring of
contributions and people would want to do

2172
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:43,790
something to try to fix it.

2173
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:44,300
Yeah.

2174
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:49,300
I just think that we live in a society
where it's just the people in power know

2175
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:53,000
that if you help the people
that you've been oppressing,

2176
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:56,720
then you run the risk of facing
their RAF once they have power.

2177
02:01:56,780 --> 02:02:00,020
Do you think that's what it is?
To some degree? Why would I,

2178
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:06,200
if I have an opportunity to make something
better and people are labeling me as

2179
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:09,200
the fault for you being in that
situation in the first place,

2180
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:15,100
then I run the risk of losing power
because those people are going to come get

2181
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:18,980
me, they're gonna vote
me out office. So it's,

2182
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,570
it's about aligning your views and choices
with the people and it's gonna keep

2183
02:02:23,571 --> 02:02:24,404
you in that office.

2184
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,980
Yeah, I guess, man,

2185
02:02:26,981 --> 02:02:31,150
I just would think that in today's day
and age people would be more forward

2186
02:02:31,151 --> 02:02:32,800
thinking and they would think, look,

2187
02:02:32,801 --> 02:02:34,450
we've got a lot of problems
with the environment.

2188
02:02:34,451 --> 02:02:37,480
We've got a lot of problems with
climate control like we've got,

2189
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:39,130
we've got real issues in this world,

2190
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,670
but we also have problems that have been
here forever that no one's done a God

2191
02:02:42,671 --> 02:02:44,740
damn thing defense. So
these new people are like,

2192
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:48,220
well the oceans rise and the oceans
rise and what are we going to do?

2193
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:52,030
Like what the, it's not going to
affect all these inner cities,

2194
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:54,820
these inner cities that have
had these same problems forever.

2195
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:58,220
If you looked at the problems like murder
problems in this country, like the,

2196
02:02:58,390 --> 02:03:02,320
the places in the inner city where you
have like gang violence and murder and

2197
02:03:02,321 --> 02:03:07,000
drug trafficking on the same fucking
problems over and over and over again year

2198
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:07,834
after year,

2199
02:03:09,570 --> 02:03:12,040
don't go, go ahead, go.
There's no no effort.

2200
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,910
What do I gain if I am,

2201
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:19,720
if I'm a politician and I'm in power,

2202
02:03:19,721 --> 02:03:22,240
what do I gain by helping those people?

2203
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:22,641
Well,

2204
02:03:22,641 --> 02:03:26,240
you get more people that do well and
you have a better economy and you have a

2205
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:30,440
safer society and people look at you
like you're a real leader. Like, wow,

2206
02:03:30,441 --> 02:03:32,780
mayor wood, look what he did. Sure.

2207
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:37,130
If they give me the credit or unless it
gets politically spun the wrong way or

2208
02:03:37,131 --> 02:03:39,330
some shit. Yeah, but I mean then I'm out.

2209
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:43,160
That's the case with every single thing
a mayor or governor does. We're just,

2210
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:46,970
I don't know. I just think where
black politics like that is concerned,

2211
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,860
we are more than

2212
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:52,180
inclined to vote and do things
that serve our own interest first.

2213
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:54,970
Politicians are more inclined to do,

2214
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:58,390
to enact policies that serve their best
interest and we're more inclined to vote

2215
02:03:58,391 --> 02:03:59,680
for things that serve our best interests.

2216
02:03:59,681 --> 02:04:02,620
So the two things work against
each other. Then for it to work,

2217
02:04:02,621 --> 02:04:03,640
for the system to work,

2218
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:05,950
you got to vote for things
that are for the greater good,

2219
02:04:05,951 --> 02:04:09,250
even if it means sacrificing
your own position in the process.

2220
02:04:09,251 --> 02:04:10,930
And that's what I think a
lot of politicians don't do

2221
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,910
in this day and age.

2222
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:18,610
Trying to help impoverish communities
when now there's an awareness of how long

2223
02:04:18,611 --> 02:04:23,350
stuff's been going on. And how do
you know who Michael Wood? Um, jr is,

2224
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:27,430
is that his name? Michael Wood jr.
yeah, he was a cop of Baltimore and um,

2225
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,600
he uh, came across um,

2226
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,910
this paper from the 1970s that
was detailing like a rap sheets,

2227
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:37,210
all the problems in the, in the
area and all the different crimes.

2228
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:40,320
And he was realizing this is in
the two thousands. He's like,

2229
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:45,350
these are all the same places with the
same crimes that we're handling now.

2230
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,610
So here we are 30 plus years later,

2231
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:54,450
the same exact crimes in
the same exact places.

2232
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,530
And you'd like the feeling of
like futility, the handling this,

2233
02:04:58,531 --> 02:05:02,610
the fact that no one gives a fuck and
that this has been this way forever and

2234
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:06,090
nothing's being done Dawn to do anything
other than just continue the process of

2235
02:05:06,091 --> 02:05:09,120
arresting people, letting
them out, arresting people,

2236
02:05:09,121 --> 02:05:12,660
letting them out and then it's just chaos.

2237
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:16,490
I'll give you a good example
of self interest. So in Newark,

2238
02:05:16,491 --> 02:05:21,491
New Jersey right now they are facing
water contamination levels that are higher

2239
02:05:21,681 --> 02:05:26,480
than Flint and there has
been cover-ups out the ass.

2240
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:30,920
That's where I was born. So
well I go get your shit checked.

2241
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:36,050
Get parents to let, it's in the past,

2242
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:39,200
I think it's like past eight
years or so. They're starting to,

2243
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:42,950
they're starting to pull it
the threads now and figure out,

2244
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:45,500
Oh what the hell was this?
What's going on with the water?

2245
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:48,560
And it's all these people getting
fucked up. The people who covered it up,

2246
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:51,560
those, the people in office who could
have made the decisions that you,

2247
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:56,360
that you're saying to not fucking let
fucked up water getting to the water

2248
02:05:56,361 --> 02:06:00,590
table. So if a corporation
says, Hey man, fuck it,

2249
02:06:00,591 --> 02:06:01,910
don't worry about that dirty water.

2250
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:05,000
Here's some money and some campaign
processing. That's what happened.

2251
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,260
I don't think so. I mean you've
got to unravel the story.

2252
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,070
We got to see how it unfolds.
But if there is a coverup,

2253
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:14,150
a cover up only happens if
someone has more selfish,

2254
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:16,490
self-serving intentions in mind.

2255
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:22,400
Like the core base of a coverup is to
fuck over somebody who doesn't deserve to

2256
02:06:22,401 --> 02:06:25,400
get fucked over. So off that alone,

2257
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:29,900
the choice you're making isn't for the
greater good of the society or the pride

2258
02:06:29,901 --> 02:06:31,310
or like the way, and it's like,

2259
02:06:31,311 --> 02:06:33,410
you know what ants do is
so dope when it's a flood,

2260
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,760
you ever seen the fire and to
make the float? That's what,

2261
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,060
that's what we have to be,

2262
02:06:38,061 --> 02:06:40,580
but we're not going to beat it cause
nobody wants to be the ant on the bottom.

2263
02:06:41,250 --> 02:06:44,060
Drown, might drown and can't
get back up to the top in time.

2264
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:47,210
We don't, we don't do that

2265
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,910
well. I think there's
also a sense of futility.

2266
02:06:49,911 --> 02:06:53,870
Like there's a lack of resources to
handle everything. So you just take,

2267
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:55,280
take what you can handle,

2268
02:06:55,281 --> 02:06:59,030
what you can and keep moving and
then just get the fuck out of Newark.

2269
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:00,890
I mean that's how people look at it.

2270
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,990
People look at those neighborhoods
like a place to escape.

2271
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:05,690
Not that it's anything that can be fixed.

2272
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,530
Yeah, that's what I,

2273
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:12,531
that's what I struggled
at lit with Birmingham and
terms of going back home and

2274
02:07:13,141 --> 02:07:17,370
trying to do things that feed
the neighborhood positively.

2275
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,430
Cause I feel like I never had
that growing up. Like, you know,

2276
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:23,850
there were a couple of people and
then you Bo Jacksons and your Charles

2277
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:28,110
Barkley's, they come around and you
know, give a high five to the kid or two.

2278
02:07:28,111 --> 02:07:32,400
But to be able to do things that
create opportunities so that,

2279
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:36,730
that feeling of hopelessness
or whatever isn't always there.

2280
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:40,840
Or if there's one thing that can be like
big Sean did something that was dope in

2281
02:07:40,841 --> 02:07:44,620
Detroit, he put $100,000
down on a recording studio.

2282
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:50,280
And to help underprivileged kids have
access to just fucking just record,

2283
02:07:50,651 --> 02:07:53,080
just to do something
that makes things better.

2284
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:57,940
So the problem is that in the
process of trying to give a fuck,

2285
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:03,600
it's stressful and there are people that
are pushing and working against you and

2286
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:08,890
you could easily just go to sleep in your
bed comfortably at night and just not

2287
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:12,340
care. But I try, I do as
much as I can back home.

2288
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:15,370
But the idea of getting the fuck out,

2289
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:20,110
I'm always torn on because
it's like I'm gone. Um,

2290
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:21,100
if nothing else,

2291
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:26,160
I can pay my bills til I die on and think
my son could go to a decent division

2292
02:08:26,201 --> 02:08:28,390
two school and be fine.

2293
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:33,670
But if I'm not using my gifts and all
these advantages to try and help him

2294
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:38,650
better other people somehow, then I
feel like I failed the city. Well,

2295
02:08:38,651 --> 02:08:40,270
I feel like I failed where I came from.

2296
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:45,520
So I'm trying to figure out how,
because I don't, I've never,

2297
02:08:45,521 --> 02:08:50,521
what I've never seen is someone that
gave back or attempted to put back into

2298
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,140
without it costing them
something in the process as well.

2299
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:57,920
Right. I see what you're saying. Like you,

2300
02:08:57,950 --> 02:09:02,240
you'd have to make a big sacrifice in
order to help and you'd have to take time

2301
02:09:02,241 --> 02:09:03,590
that you don't even have time to work out.

2302
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:07,550
So how the fuck do you have time to
go and save Birmingham? Yeah. Yeah.

2303
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:10,310
That is a problem. I mean,
you have bandwidth, right?

2304
02:09:10,311 --> 02:09:11,830
You have a certain amount
of bandwidth in your,

2305
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:16,160
in your brain and how much of it can
you dedicate to charitable things?

2306
02:09:16,161 --> 02:09:20,510
How much can you dedicate to
your career, your family, dad?

2307
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:22,490
It's the constant process.

2308
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:27,970
I mean I think it's the job of people
who are running cities and States and the

2309
02:09:30,051 --> 02:09:32,990
country, but it's about how much resource,

2310
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:37,220
how much resources they have and how
much did they delegate to fixing these

2311
02:09:37,221 --> 02:09:38,600
problems that have existed forever.

2312
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:43,210
What I've learned, man, is uh, I
learned a shit ton. We shot, um,

2313
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:47,920
you shot my comedy central pilot
in Birmingham, um, this summer,

2314
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:51,670
which was not an easy feat in
terms of the logistics of it.

2315
02:09:51,671 --> 02:09:54,120
Just cause Birmingham's
not a, it's not Atlanta,

2316
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:56,140
it's not a bunch of fucking
cameras just laying around,

2317
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:01,200
but you start seeing how
different entities of at the
state level and local 11,

2318
02:10:04,181 --> 02:10:07,360
leaving the County level all
have to get a little touch.

2319
02:10:07,361 --> 02:10:12,100
I'll have to have a hand in it somehow
so that everyone feels like they are all

2320
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:12,761
part.

2321
02:10:12,761 --> 02:10:17,761
Like you have to please too many people
at the same time to get anything to get

2322
02:10:18,641 --> 02:10:21,280
anything remotely done. I dunno, I
can't speak for the rest of the country,

2323
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:24,100
but I know in Alabama
that's generally how it is.

2324
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,360
I think that's generally
how it is with all politics.

2325
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:28,880
I mean everybody wants
a little bit of credit,

2326
02:10:28,881 --> 02:10:32,660
everybody wants a little bit of a say in
it, fine but the credit, but just help

2327
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:38,420
get you to credit but help like do
this logistical thing to help that.

2328
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:43,421
Like that's the stuff where nobody wants
to really or you're not sure if anybody

2329
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:46,670
really has genuine intentions on helping.

2330
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:50,870
Yeah, cause not everybody's
happy for you to crib.

2331
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:52,420
That's the saddest shit ever.

2332
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:56,170
When you think about
charitable organizations and
you find out how much people

2333
02:10:56,171 --> 02:10:59,650
are making to run those charitable
organizations in palace and shit. Yeah,

2334
02:10:59,651 --> 02:11:03,580
and how little the money actually
goes towards the charity. Like Jesus.

2335
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:06,460
Like I know there's going to be
some red tape and bureaucracy,

2336
02:11:06,461 --> 02:11:09,460
but it's like red cross, isn't
it? Some insane number. Like,

2337
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:14,490
how much of money from red cross
actually goes towards the actual charity

2338
02:11:14,891 --> 02:11:19,190
itself. I'm going to say 10%
that might be generous that,

2339
02:11:19,390 --> 02:11:22,520
but that is a crazy number. That night.

2340
02:11:22,770 --> 02:11:27,020
It cost 90% of all the money that
comes in just to deal with overhead

2341
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:30,630
sticks and moving stuff
around. And that's why,

2342
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,750
that's why I kind of like go fund
me, cause you can just find them.

2343
02:11:33,751 --> 02:11:36,840
I fucking be like, here, here's $100

2344
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:40,630
yeah. When there's real problems, what
do you got Jamie? What's the number?

2345
02:11:41,290 --> 02:11:44,680
Let's guess type that in. And
it's like stories come about.

2346
02:11:44,681 --> 02:11:49,681
The CEO's been serially misleading about
where the 91% of money that they says

2347
02:11:50,531 --> 02:11:51,690
goes. I dunno. Oh,

2348
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:56,700
so it's less than 10% 9% 91% there's
91% go somewhere other than the charity.

2349
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:00,130
So it's 9% no, no.

2350
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:03,750
I think they're actually
saying 91% goes to the charity.

2351
02:12:03,990 --> 02:12:07,990
We're very proud of the fact that 91
cents of every dollar that's donated goes

2352
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:12,460
to our services. The
services, the services.

2353
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:17,650
Gas. Yeah. Come on. Did you see that?

2354
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:22,651
Do the dinero Deniros suing some lady
that worked for them that watched 55

2355
02:12:22,931 --> 02:12:26,770
episodes of friends in a week. No. Yeah,

2356
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,820
she embezzled money. Uh,
allegedly embezzled money.

2357
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:35,650
Uh, took, used his miles to
fly on her own personal trips.

2358
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:38,260
She was making 300 grand a year, but the,

2359
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:40,930
the big story that clickbait title was a,

2360
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:45,040
he sued her for $6 million
after a wild friends.

2361
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:50,420
Been she watched 55 out of 55
episodes of it in four days.

2362
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:53,590
That's 2008 so that's DVDs

2363
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:58,780
in 2008. That is hilarious.

2364
02:12:58,781 --> 02:13:03,670
So they're still going after it
11 years later. Oh, she began,

2365
02:13:03,730 --> 02:13:08,470
she was his assistant in 2008
and then she, and then, okay,

2366
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:13,180
she began as denier as assistant
and she now is being sued.

2367
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:18,210
So she basically got to a place where
they're working together for 11 years and

2368
02:13:18,570 --> 02:13:19,510
11 years of employment,

2369
02:13:19,511 --> 02:13:22,750
DeNiro Robinson Rose to vice
president of production and finance.

2370
02:13:22,751 --> 02:13:26,830
According to this suit, which
lists are 2019 salary, $300,000.

2371
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:30,220
She finally left the company in April
after being suspected of corporate

2372
02:13:30,221 --> 02:13:34,890
sabotage, said the legal filing. And
she embezzled money and she went crazy.

2373
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:40,200
Oh seven hours a day. That's
14 episodes. That's doable.

2374
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:44,910
It's doable for four days. I
benched 24 in like a day and a half.

2375
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:46,800
The whole season. The whole season.

2376
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:50,550
Fucking a DVD box at day's
me was also a good show.

2377
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:53,070
It's just funny that I had all
this shit that this lady did.

2378
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:57,090
Apparently allegedly the 55 episodes
of friends are the ones that became the

2379
02:13:57,091 --> 02:13:59,850
headline that everybody had to click
on it cause that's the funniest shit.

2380
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:04,110
Watch 20 episodes of arrested
development one day and somebody shot.

2381
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:06,920
So this is you just sitting around
watching TV while she's working for,

2382
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,950
what is she supposed to be doing?
Like maybe she's doing research,

2383
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:14,460
maybe she's waiting around for something
to do. What did the real project needs?

2384
02:14:14,461 --> 02:14:17,790
Friends research, looking for cast.

2385
02:14:17,791 --> 02:14:21,060
I don't know what to Neo
projects are even around. I mean,

2386
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:24,600
well DeNiro is probably trying to figure
out where all his money's going because

2387
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:27,930
he's getting divorced right
now, so he's probably, yeah man,

2388
02:14:27,931 --> 02:14:28,770
he's getting divorced.

2389
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:32,910
There was some public spat at a
restaurant where he yelled at his wife,

2390
02:14:32,911 --> 02:14:35,580
I wouldn't have to do these shitty fucking
movies if you weren't spending all my

2391
02:14:35,581 --> 02:14:39,240
money. Ah, yeah.

2392
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:41,810
Oh, I see that.

2393
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,080
I always feel bad for people like
the Cubs second baseman bins.

2394
02:14:46,081 --> 02:14:49,410
Obras he's been like, I
don't know what the like, Oh,

2395
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:50,700
physically unable to perform.

2396
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:54,150
Like he's basically been on the disabled
list the entire season while he goes

2397
02:14:54,151 --> 02:14:58,760
through and deals with his divorce.
Oh God. Like [inaudible] serious shit.

2398
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:02,340
She going to go make millions of dollars
playing baseball. I can't right now.

2399
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:06,030
I have to go to court and count my
cash and make sure that my shit,

2400
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:10,230
so his disabled shit is just
dealing with the divorce. I forget.

2401
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:13,190
Not even a real injury. No,
it's not a real injury. Well,

2402
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,760
I guess it technically
is mental. What it is.

2403
02:15:14,761 --> 02:15:17,610
That's a girl taken
apart his puzzle. Yeah.

2404
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,760
Took apart as fast as she's doing.

2405
02:15:20,761 --> 02:15:24,810
She's taken apart the puzzle of his life
while she's forcing him to go through.

2406
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:27,900
I think it was like infidelity
or something. Somebody cheated.

2407
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:29,730
I had a buddy of mine who, uh,

2408
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:33,000
he had it paid for his wife's lawyer and
you don't even think about it that way.

2409
02:15:33,001 --> 02:15:36,630
Like if you're married, you go, well,
who's paying for her lawyer? But bitch,

2410
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:39,150
you're paying for her
lawyer. If she didn't work,

2411
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:43,920
you pay for the general of the
opposing army to try to dismantle you

2412
02:15:43,921 --> 02:15:47,400
financially. And he didn't
have a prenuptial agreement.

2413
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:50,580
So he went to a war for fucking years,

2414
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:53,490
years and years and years and
they were trying to drain him.

2415
02:15:53,491 --> 02:15:57,180
And the lawyers are smart man. They
know that the real settlement is great,

2416
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:01,080
but what the real money is in legal
fees leading up to the settlement.

2417
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:04,620
They just drag that shit out for a couple
of years, hundreds of dollars an hour.

2418
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:10,500
[inaudible] and next thing you know,
you've lost millions of dollars.

2419
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:14,640
And this guy, you know, busted
his ass 12 hours a day, forever.

2420
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:19,680
Lost almost everything still to this day.
How about this? He's been married for,

2421
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:22,710
I think he's been married
for 14 years to a new woman.

2422
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:27,890
He was with her for 12 years and he has
been paying her alimony than they were

2423
02:16:30,491 --> 02:16:32,290
married. Wow.

2424
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:35,860
He's married to a new woman and
didn't even have kids with her,

2425
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:40,690
so he's been paying her
for 14 fucking years.

2426
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,330
I'm talking six figures every
year. She doesn't do shit.

2427
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:47,800
She lives in a fat house in the
Palisades. The whole thing is bananas.

2428
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:51,730
You see Larry King is getting a divorce.
Yeah, I didn't know that. He's head.

2429
02:16:51,731 --> 02:16:55,180
This is his eighth wife. Yeah. Love
it. I hope he gets another one.

2430
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:58,950
I hope it gets another one and these
are like a skeleton and they have Jordan

2431
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:01,090
walked them out. They're
in an exoskeleton.

2432
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:05,021
I can't prove it,

2433
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:08,710
but I feel like the divorce lawyer
industry is tied to the wedding industry

2434
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:12,580
somehow. Somehow they don't
have to be tied in like legally.

2435
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:17,380
They know they both benefit from one
another. Of course. Yeah, of course.

2436
02:17:17,381 --> 02:17:19,330
Look at that perfect relationship.

2437
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:23,190
How'd it go wrong and I just want
to know what the arguments were.

2438
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:29,290
Well, apparently there was infidelity
as well, allegedly. No way.

2439
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:33,100
I can't believe she did cheat on him
on her side or his side. Her side.

2440
02:17:33,101 --> 02:17:38,101
Apparently she had a year long affair
prenup in that one and then she looked

2441
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:42,940
fucking hot 20 years ago when they
got married cause she's like 59 now.

2442
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:45,280
So when they first started shacking it up,

2443
02:17:45,310 --> 02:17:50,080
she was in her thirties probably look
and smoking. She's pretty pretty lady.

2444
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:54,040
You know, you'd think that's an addiction.
Love the same as any other drugs.

2445
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:56,500
Sure, of course. Yeah.

2446
02:17:56,530 --> 02:18:01,030
Most people lose when you're talking
about getting married seven times. Yeah.

2447
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:03,910
It gets a little wacky. Yeah.

2448
02:18:03,911 --> 02:18:06,100
He's had marriages that
lasted like less than a year.

2449
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:10,600
They'd get divorced and marry another
one. Right. I would get married

2450
02:18:12,430 --> 02:18:16,270
I think once I, if I do it,
it'd be once I know one in me,

2451
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:17,590
one I got one in me.

2452
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:20,800
I was proposed to a girl like can Oh
three those are one of the biggest

2453
02:18:20,801 --> 02:18:24,260
mistakes. Almost. Almost fucking me.
How'd you get out of it? It's funny.

2454
02:18:24,290 --> 02:18:27,070
She was cheating. Woo.
That's nice. That's a relief.

2455
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:27,680
Yeah.

2456
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:31,310
It was back in a day when you share
cell phone plans and she kept pushing us

2457
02:18:31,311 --> 02:18:34,790
over our minutes for the month. I'm
like, what the fuck are you talking to?

2458
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:38,810
So the next month I requested
the full itemized call.

2459
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:40,161
Long be like back in the day,

2460
02:18:40,161 --> 02:18:44,090
sprint would send you your
entire call log for the month.

2461
02:18:44,150 --> 02:18:48,230
And I just went through it and then I
could see the patterns of when I was sleep

2462
02:18:48,231 --> 02:18:51,890
or when I was on stage. You could just
see that when it's all in front of you,

2463
02:18:52,310 --> 02:18:54,590
it's easy to just see that. Oh yeah.

2464
02:18:54,591 --> 02:18:57,450
When I go to work at 6:00
AM you can call it this.

2465
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:04,690
Wow. Yeah. And it was real easy to
track down. Did you confront? Ah, yeah,

2466
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:07,330
I was, I was a little extra about it, but

2467
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:13,240
I was young. I was fucking
young. Yeah. I called 'em, uh,

2468
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:18,190
call sprint and the, the, I basically
turned my phone into her phone.

2469
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:23,800
Oh shit. And then I started
texting the dudes. Oh, her phone.

2470
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:28,250
How many guys? Those two guys.
Oh. And so I tell both guys

2471
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,720
to come over at the same time.
To now, so that those two guys,

2472
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:37,660
which is so catty and me, and of
course they show up, she calls me,

2473
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:40,790
curses me out, and boom,
bam relationship to, Oh,

2474
02:19:40,791 --> 02:19:44,060
so you told them to come over
while she was at home. Correct.

2475
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:47,980
But you weren't there. Correct.
Ooh, I like it. No, that's D's.

2476
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:50,450
But in like in the
bigger scheme of things,

2477
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:54,170
if one as it came over and hit
her or done anything stupid,

2478
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:58,750
I'm liable and that, yeah.
Hell yeah. No, come on.

2479
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:00,260
You're not liable for someone calling me.

2480
02:20:00,261 --> 02:20:04,040
I'll charge you with murder for
somebody. They shot days. There are laws,

2481
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:08,990
not that I deceive to men, that the
showing up to the fucking house,

2482
02:20:09,290 --> 02:20:12,140
he gotta remember my brain is going,
don't go back to jail ever again.

2483
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:15,740
So in my brain, I'm going,
there's something that could have,

2484
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:18,290
that could have gone South somehow.

2485
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:20,630
I don't think you would've got
in trouble for that either way.

2486
02:20:20,631 --> 02:20:21,890
I wouldn't want that. I
see what you're saying.

2487
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:25,580
Teamed up by some psycho dude who's
jealous or whatever. I didn't want that.

2488
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:29,150
I was jealous that he's the
other one who's cheating on yeah,

2489
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:32,320
and I have my little $700
engagement ring from the Zales.

2490
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:38,510
I took it back and this is what I learned
that if you returned an engagement

2491
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:42,000
ring, the sales person
loses the commission. Oh,

2492
02:20:42,110 --> 02:20:43,880
they take the commission
back out or the next check.

2493
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:46,250
Cause it had been a problem.
He got upset. He wasn't upset,

2494
02:20:46,251 --> 02:20:49,600
but he spent like an hour trying to talk
me out of return. Real. Yeah. He said,

2495
02:20:49,730 --> 02:20:51,650
man, just go. Think about
it, man. Go think about it.

2496
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:54,860
Did you tell him just walking around
the mall? She's fucking two other dudes.

2497
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:56,600
That's ultimately what I have to do.

2498
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:58,850
And once I told him that he
processed it with no fucking,

2499
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,360
I just took the L no pushback.
Yeah. It was a $700 ring.

2500
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:06,460
It's cut was probably only going to
be like, what? 70 $80 what's the cut?

2501
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,750
It didn't want to give up
that 80 bucks. I respect that.

2502
02:21:08,751 --> 02:21:11,960
He's fucking hustle and he's
selling jewelry in a mall. Yeah.

2503
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:14,670
You don't want to fucking lose
your fucking commission. Yeah.

2504
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:19,190
Those are bad decisions being
made. Buying jewelry in a mall.

2505
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:22,550
It's crazy though. It's more
like, it's like Joey though,

2506
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:25,520
where like she and I are like
pool now. Oh really? Yeah.

2507
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:30,860
Like she's married like it's all. Oh
wow. It's all love now. Wow. That's good.

2508
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:34,460
Look, people grow and learn. Does. That's
hilarious though that you did that.

2509
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:39,440
Yeah, that was, that wasn't my
finest hour, but like I said,

2510
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:40,221
I'm not a fighter.

2511
02:21:40,221 --> 02:21:43,850
I figured out a way to die by luckily
construct a situation that tears down your

2512
02:21:43,851 --> 02:21:46,670
entire fucking operation.
Yeah. That was a good move.

2513
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,910
That's a learning process too, for
hurts like, damn. How could I be so odd?

2514
02:21:51,911 --> 02:21:52,310
I mean,

2515
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:54,860
because what I'm going to do drive over
and cuss you out and guru and cheating

2516
02:21:54,861 --> 02:21:58,260
them. No, no. We don't all
know about each other. Yeah.

2517
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:02,780
It's time for us all to meet. So Hey
man, come on over to the house. Hey man,

2518
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:07,280
you come on over to the house.
Meet me at 11 don't come too soon.

2519
02:22:07,310 --> 02:22:11,480
Come exactly at Alem. Wow. Call sweet.

2520
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:13,580
Want to be there? No.

2521
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:20,060
Some explosions. You just got
to walk away from, no, man,

2522
02:22:20,061 --> 02:22:24,970
I don't want to be there for that one.
Nah, that's where it goes. I have never,

2523
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:29,970
that's something I've
never lived down like,

2524
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:32,190
and then it just, it was just ugly.

2525
02:22:32,191 --> 02:22:34,020
It was just one of those things
where you just go, you know what?

2526
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:38,520
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
Her mom's calling me the next day.

2527
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:43,070
Well you just talk to her, talk
to the baby. Oh boy. No man,

2528
02:22:43,071 --> 02:22:45,540
I can't like it was did.
It was full blown, bro.

2529
02:22:45,541 --> 02:22:50,460
I'm sending pictures of the fucking
ring and all types of stuff. Like, Oh,

2530
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:55,140
you got an extra. Yeah, it was, it
was not, it's not my finest hour,

2531
02:22:56,680 --> 02:23:00,610
but don't you think that like those
brutal breakups and all the chaos of

2532
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:03,040
infidelity and all that kind of nonsense,

2533
02:23:03,070 --> 02:23:08,020
like it gives you a better understanding
of relationships when they go, well,

2534
02:23:08,490 --> 02:23:12,160
it gives you, it's all luck, life
lessons. Like you don't get to be,

2535
02:23:13,060 --> 02:23:16,690
you don't get to be a seasoned grown up
human being without getting your heart

2536
02:23:16,691 --> 02:23:20,470
broken a few times without having a
bunch of things going on. Disappointing.

2537
02:23:20,471 --> 02:23:25,471
In your work life and then then you become
a person with an understanding of all

2538
02:23:25,991 --> 02:23:28,270
the variabilities that
you're dealing with in life.

2539
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,770
I think the problem though,

2540
02:23:30,430 --> 02:23:35,430
you know with love is that it also can
be corroding in a sense where if you've

2541
02:23:37,601 --> 02:23:42,190
really been invested and you've really
tried to love and then it didn't work.

2542
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:46,030
I think like I feel like if
you've been in love a couple of,

2543
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:48,520
I also feel like people
get married sooner.

2544
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:51,850
There's something more pure about
it, but people get married later.

2545
02:23:51,970 --> 02:23:54,780
It's more honest. Yeah.

2546
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:59,500
Like it's like this blind love and love.
We never been done dirt. Oh my God,

2547
02:23:59,501 --> 02:24:03,760
the sky is falling versus you're a
grizzled vet. You've been cheated on,

2548
02:24:03,790 --> 02:24:07,930
you've cheated. So you know both sides
of that coin. So you know how it feels.

2549
02:24:08,110 --> 02:24:10,870
It like, you know, both sides of that.
So when you enter into a relationship,

2550
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:15,580
it's more pure. But because you have these
battle wounds and these battle scars,

2551
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:17,920
I don't know if you love
the same as the couple.

2552
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:20,830
They got married in their
twenties it's still love

2553
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:23,050
is on who you're with and
how much you appreciate them.

2554
02:24:23,051 --> 02:24:26,800
It also depends on where you're at in
your life. Like if you got married now,

2555
02:24:26,801 --> 02:24:30,550
you're a successful man. I mean you
did all the grinding and the hustling,

2556
02:24:30,551 --> 02:24:34,990
but someone would be entering into your
life now while you're already made it,

2557
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:37,960
you're successful. You're established.

2558
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:42,310
The hustle of getting to there as now,
it's just about about maintaining,

2559
02:24:42,550 --> 02:24:43,930
which although difficult,

2560
02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:47,830
you have the confidence that it's going
to happen that you don't have in the

2561
02:24:47,831 --> 02:24:51,190
beginning, that early days hustling
when you were taking those odd jobs.

2562
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:54,280
Who the fuck knew where
your life was going?

2563
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:56,080
That's one of the
beautiful things about it.

2564
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,080
There was gigs I was headed to.

2565
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:00,870
I didn't have gas money to get home and
the gig I was going to was the gas money

2566
02:25:00,930 --> 02:25:04,140
to get home. So please don't
cancel and please don't pull some,

2567
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:08,520
some black promoters shit and don't pay
me like I literally need those $40 I

2568
02:25:08,521 --> 02:25:10,650
have no way to get home. Wow.

2569
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:12,960
And sometimes you don't get paid and
if you don't get paid on the way home,

2570
02:25:12,961 --> 02:25:17,961
you stop at a daily work spot and
you do some yard work or whatever.

2571
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:21,600
Yeah, you go do some daily work real
quick for the day. You miss a day,

2572
02:25:21,630 --> 02:25:24,430
you miss a shift at the radio
station, a radio station. Hey man,

2573
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:28,660
I got car trouble in Kentucky. I can't
get home. I'm a mr morning show. Sorry.

2574
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:32,950
I mean you go do some day job,
get your $40 and get home.

2575
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:38,750
But that's a real life experience
that you just can't pay for.

2576
02:25:39,181 --> 02:25:42,030
That's so valuable. The
fact that you did do it,

2577
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:45,960
even though it was horrible when it
happened, like the resolve that you did,

2578
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:49,650
did you develop from being that person
who figures your way through all those

2579
02:25:49,651 --> 02:25:52,650
problems? So like if so
if you got married now,

2580
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:55,960
like you're a different
person like you, you could,

2581
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:57,580
you'll figure shit out better now.

2582
02:25:57,650 --> 02:26:00,530
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. You also,

2583
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:04,340
you also learn how to communicate better
so that it doesn't devolve to a point

2584
02:26:04,341 --> 02:26:07,280
where either you were being
malicious to each other. Yes,

2585
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:10,310
me and my goes way better communication
than any of that I could have imagined

2586
02:26:10,311 --> 02:26:14,900
with anyone in my twenties yeah. Because
of those experiences and learning.

2587
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:19,560
Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the part
where you try to fucking correct within.

2588
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:24,300
There's always a piece of you.
It's like, do you ever find that,

2589
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:26,570
I guess I can't ask you
this as a married man,

2590
02:26:26,571 --> 02:26:31,571
but you find yourself sometimes looking
at past relationships like jokes where

2591
02:26:33,650 --> 02:26:38,350
you go, Oh, I know how I could've
fixed that. Oh yeah. For sure.

2592
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:39,790
Yeah, please. Sure.

2593
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:44,750
What the knowledge you have now
of relationships and love. Yes.

2594
02:26:44,900 --> 02:26:48,680
I can look back on stuff that I fucked
up and go, all I had to do was this,

2595
02:26:48,681 --> 02:26:53,210
this boom, and that joke woulda
hit. Yup. That would've been damn.

2596
02:26:53,490 --> 02:26:55,560
Yeah. So that eats like the way,

2597
02:26:55,561 --> 02:26:58,770
like when you do a TV set and
you forget one part, the joke,

2598
02:26:58,771 --> 02:27:02,820
and now for the rest of your life,
that's the set. That's who you are.

2599
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:07,050
If there's a piece of you that's going,
fuck, I should have done that, man.

2600
02:27:07,051 --> 02:27:08,820
Yeah, but that's

2601
02:27:10,270 --> 02:27:11,103
of growth.

2602
02:27:11,810 --> 02:27:15,340
It's like you have to leave behind
these poorly finished projects to,

2603
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:18,110
to appreciate the one that
you're gonna put out next.

2604
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:21,320
That's going to be the best version of
it. I look at every fucking special.

2605
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:24,350
Every did go. Even if there
was successful, I just go,

2606
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:27,770
I don't have nothing to do with
them. I can't watch them. I've,

2607
02:27:27,771 --> 02:27:29,180
I fucking get disgusted.

2608
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:32,470
My first two special should be
combined into one. I'm like,

2609
02:27:32,471 --> 02:27:35,010
I can literally look at the material
go, Oh, that's segues with that.

2610
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:38,370
Yeah. Cut that out. Put
this in there. Yeah. Yeah.

2611
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:40,110
And then there's old
specials that I said, Ooh,

2612
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:43,470
I'd like to have another crack at those
ideas because those are good ideas.

2613
02:27:43,471 --> 02:27:48,300
I just didn't implement them
correctly. So move on. Kinda move on.

2614
02:27:48,460 --> 02:27:51,640
Yeah. If the idea is still valid
and working in insult. Yeah.

2615
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:56,520
You get trapped, you trapped in old
ideas. It's out there. It's done new shit.

2616
02:27:56,850 --> 02:28:00,280
Find something new that resonates
just as well in the future as,

2617
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:03,270
as this stuff does to you when
you're looking at the past.

2618
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:04,180
I dunno,

2619
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:08,860
I feel like I have some unfinished
thoughts from the last special of course,

2620
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:12,250
but that, that desire and that hunger
is what makes you a great comic.

2621
02:28:12,251 --> 02:28:15,980
Like that. That's not done.
Oh, I've got gotta do more. Oh,

2622
02:28:15,981 --> 02:28:17,440
this is gotta be better next time.

2623
02:28:17,441 --> 02:28:21,710
Or I may make it tighter and make this
better. More punchlines, less less fat.

2624
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:22,310
All that's

2625
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,790
what that discomfort an adjunct
is. What makes you an artist.

2626
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:29,800
That's why I like trying to do stuff
that has some teeth or some edge or some

2627
02:28:29,801 --> 02:28:31,830
opinion to it. You know,

2628
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:36,340
trading and stuff that I don't
know if you should go with it. No,

2629
02:28:36,341 --> 02:28:40,090
let's go there. Let's figure it out.
There's, there's a joke in there. Somehow

2630
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:43,800
when you can navigate those waters
successfully, it's like, fuck man.

2631
02:28:43,801 --> 02:28:46,260
You get on the other end
with a big laugh. Ooh,

2632
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:51,360
whitewater rafting. It's, and there's
just rocks coming and you're going left.

2633
02:28:51,630 --> 02:28:52,463
Right?

2634
02:28:53,650 --> 02:28:57,150
Like does the guy calling out how to do
the joke and you're just navigating your

2635
02:28:57,151 --> 02:29:01,470
way down the rocks and if you
make it, it is the most rewarding.

2636
02:29:01,471 --> 02:29:06,471
Dismounts that for me is
better than just some in more,

2637
02:29:06,870 --> 02:29:09,180
but yeah, something more mundane
I had just, I can't do it.

2638
02:29:09,370 --> 02:29:10,390
Yeah. Yeah.

2639
02:29:10,391 --> 02:29:13,180
When you see people that do in the same
mundane shit over and over and over

2640
02:29:13,181 --> 02:29:16,510
again, you, they don't know what it's
like to have that thrilled. They're,

2641
02:29:16,511 --> 02:29:19,540
they're basically getting on
a fucking Seesaw every day,

2642
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:23,910
the same Seesaw over and over. And
there's no thrill in that. No, no.

2643
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:26,610
You're not four anymore. There's this

2644
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:30,420
too many good thoughts out there. That's
why I love talking with Neil Brennan.

2645
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:35,790
Like Neil Brennan is like one of those
perfect comics that I can like go,

2646
02:29:35,881 --> 02:29:37,320
Hey man, what do you think about this?

2647
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:41,790
And he'll tag it darker and take it
to a place that I wouldn't have even

2648
02:29:41,791 --> 02:29:45,780
considered. And you know, like you
start noticing like there's only,

2649
02:29:45,781 --> 02:29:47,580
so even if you have a
bunch of comedian friends,

2650
02:29:47,850 --> 02:29:51,600
there's only certain France and understand
how or which way you're trying to go

2651
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:52,710
with a bit.

2652
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:55,500
Cause someone else might give you a tag
that drifts off into easy land and I

2653
02:29:55,501 --> 02:29:55,860
don't want it.

2654
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:59,850
Right, right, right. Yeah. No.
Neil's a great joke writer and his,

2655
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:04,860
his shit like I like his, I like watching
him workout premises cause you know,

2656
02:30:04,861 --> 02:30:09,240
you can tell him like he's put some real
thought into those ideas. Yeah, it's,

2657
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:12,350
it's an, it's a thesis statement.
It just happens to be fun.

2658
02:30:12,351 --> 02:30:14,280
Like he's really breaking shit down. Yeah.

2659
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:18,030
I liked the ones where I know that it
was an argument that he had with a girl

2660
02:30:20,310 --> 02:30:23,220
that he's bringing it to the stage and
try to work it out and make it funny.

2661
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:26,460
Cause if you have an argument with a
girl and then she comes to see you at a

2662
02:30:26,461 --> 02:30:30,390
comedy club like a month later and that
argument gets relayed to the audience

2663
02:30:30,391 --> 02:30:34,080
and it's fucking hysterical.
Oh you win. That's how you win.

2664
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:39,030
You win and you fucking slam dunk.
That is a fucking grand slam.

2665
02:30:39,031 --> 02:30:43,050
That's shatters windows in the parking
lot. I've never had the courage to do it.

2666
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:48,880
I never had the courage to
perform material in front
in front of somebody I was

2667
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:53,520
dating. Never done it.
No, it's hard. You gotta,

2668
02:30:53,521 --> 02:30:56,520
you gotta take a chance and them being
really mad at you when you get off stage.

2669
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:57,441
I'll give you an example.

2670
02:30:57,441 --> 02:31:02,120
Like Wilson events is another guy that I
like talking to out in New York and the

2671
02:31:02,121 --> 02:31:02,954
premise,

2672
02:31:02,990 --> 02:31:07,400
the joke premise is that there are
no hit video games sit in Vietnam.

2673
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:11,900
Like that's how much we don't want
to. That's true. Explore Vietnam,

2674
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:15,320
world war II and middle
East is just the hits.

2675
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:20,200
We only want to discuss the hits
where we won. That's a good point.

2676
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:22,710
There've been games envy of course
there's some video games in Vienna,

2677
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:27,290
but as far as hit popular
Twitch level Ninja shit, right?

2678
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:28,740
None in Vietnam.

2679
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,180
And then we'll submit a told Willis event
supremacy and he goes that and he says

2680
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:36,360
that's because if you plan
a game based in Vietnam,

2681
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:39,090
you can't win even if you want to.

2682
02:31:39,630 --> 02:31:41,850
Even when you win you still lose.

2683
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:46,020
And it's taking that thought and
figuring out how to weave that.

2684
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:50,640
But like that's what I mean where a
friend can help me work through an idea.

2685
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:51,870
But then somewhere come,

2686
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:55,890
the trick is to come around the backside
of that and make sure that you're

2687
02:31:55,891 --> 02:31:59,490
reinforcing and uplifting the people that
chose to fight and like I'm trying to,

2688
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:02,400
yeah, it's a whole world that
I'm just obsessed with. I dunno.

2689
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:06,720
And it all boils back to the whole Trump
draft Dodger thing and the hypocrisy

2690
02:32:06,721 --> 02:32:11,721
that if we agree that the troops are
fucked and they're treated horribly,

2691
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:18,480
then how is draft dodging
bad and that being the,

2692
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:21,630
the thought and [inaudible]
for Vietnam, correct war,

2693
02:32:21,631 --> 02:32:23,250
we all agree was a terrible war.

2694
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:26,520
We didn't know it at the time
and some people chose to go,

2695
02:32:26,521 --> 02:32:29,220
but a lot of people were threatened
with jail that they didn't go.

2696
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:33,840
So if you did not go based
on revisionist history,

2697
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:38,430
was that not a solid decision
in terms of avoiding?

2698
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:42,810
And so it's about getting that thought
through without disrespecting the heroism

2699
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:47,190
of what happened. So tricky
waters, this fallen tree,

2700
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:51,390
white water rafting baby rocks. So
I haven't figured it. Those are the,

2701
02:32:51,420 --> 02:32:55,920
those are the basic Lego blocks and I
have to figure out how to get down the

2702
02:32:55,921 --> 02:33:00,540
river without fucking hitting a jacket.
Do you write in like essay form?

2703
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:03,880
Do you write things out like with
a computer? Do you, do you write,

2704
02:33:04,030 --> 02:33:08,460
once I have the ideas together,
I'd just go loose on stage. Um,

2705
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:13,860
I'll go, I'll just run a bit a couple
times on stage without any structure,

2706
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:15,840
without any real structure.
Just bullet points here.

2707
02:33:15,841 --> 02:33:20,400
The four points I want to make. Do
that for a week. Listen to the audio,

2708
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:22,170
the stuff that's hot transcribed.

2709
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:26,730
And then from that transcription start
filling in the blanks of how to flesh out

2710
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:31,170
the thought and the point a
little bit more like I like,

2711
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:34,230
but then some stuff requires
research. There's a bit,

2712
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:37,890
that is a bit that I'm
working on now about how,

2713
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:41,040
how the most important person,

2714
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:45,450
the most important character in a civil
rights movie is the white person is the

2715
02:33:45,451 --> 02:33:46,440
evil white actor.

2716
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:51,120
You cannot have a powerful civil rights
movie without a white person being evil.

2717
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:54,540
So these actors are never honored.

2718
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:59,570
They're never nominated for shit like
civil rights movies only as powerful as

2719
02:33:59,671 --> 02:34:00,240
the white actor.

2720
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:04,290
He is evil because that captures what
was fucking happening back in that day.

2721
02:34:04,470 --> 02:34:04,920
Right?

2722
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,920
So I need to like sit and physically go
to box office mojo and look at the last

2723
02:34:10,741 --> 02:34:15,450
10 years of civil rights movies versus
civil rights movies versus white savior

2724
02:34:15,451 --> 02:34:19,240
movies and pull actors and pull examples
and then look at their and then go to

2725
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:24,250
their eye MDB and look at their trajectory
post civil rights movie to establish

2726
02:34:24,371 --> 02:34:27,970
a pattern of if you're a white
person, you do evil, your risk.

2727
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,130
Cause my arguments that
you're risking your career.

2728
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:33,490
If you're not an alias
actor and you plan a racist,

2729
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,600
you may not do shit else at the, because
for black people, if you say n***a,

2730
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:38,560
it's too real.

2731
02:34:39,090 --> 02:34:44,090
So we can't see you as a fucking Romulan
in a star Trek movie years later we're

2732
02:34:44,291 --> 02:34:47,920
unable to process. So, so that joke,

2733
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:50,860
I have that idea and I'll just work
that thought a couple of times.

2734
02:34:50,861 --> 02:34:53,500
But now before I put it on
stage again, I need movies.

2735
02:34:53,501 --> 02:34:55,690
I need examples to back
the thesis statement.

2736
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:59,200
So that's what I'll start writing and
really start looking at all of these

2737
02:34:59,201 --> 02:35:03,040
examples. And I also have like,

2738
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:08,070
it's in the same ballpark of that is
about how like people call it like green

2739
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:08,321
Greenblatt,

2740
02:35:08,321 --> 02:35:13,321
like a white savior movie and how this
movie is about white people doing a D D

2741
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:15,700
for black people back in the day.

2742
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:18,070
And black people don't like white
savior movies because you know,

2743
02:35:18,071 --> 02:35:21,640
it avoids the pain and the
struggle and all that shit.

2744
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,720
And I feel like white savory movies
are just reactionary to powerful civil

2745
02:35:27,761 --> 02:35:30,430
rights movies cause nobody wants
to be portrayed negatively.

2746
02:35:31,210 --> 02:35:34,840
So if there are enough civil rights
movies that play white people as evil,

2747
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:38,080
it's inevitable that a white person
is going to write a movie about.

2748
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:40,480
Remember at a time we drove
you around to play the piano,

2749
02:35:41,950 --> 02:35:46,250
that it's inevitable. We, we
fit your chicken when we drove.

2750
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:49,540
So don't just say all that. Don't just
show all those evil things we did.

2751
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:52,930
Let's also acknowledge the
time we drove you around.

2752
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:56,980
And I think if I go back and I looked
through the history of the box office over

2753
02:35:56,981 --> 02:35:57,761
the last 20 years,

2754
02:35:57,761 --> 02:36:01,600
I guarantee you I'll be able to find
an oscillation between powerful civil

2755
02:36:01,601 --> 02:36:03,670
rights movie and white savior movie.

2756
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:06,490
And when you write that out and you're
just going to write bullet points and

2757
02:36:06,491 --> 02:36:07,990
then just run it on stage right

2758
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:08,903
now we'll,

2759
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:13,020
we'll do bullet points of all the movies
and then so the next stage is I'll do,

2760
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:16,170
I'll write all those movies out and
I'll go on stage and do half of those

2761
02:36:16,171 --> 02:36:16,890
movies. One set,

2762
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:19,950
the next set I'll do the other half of
movies and see which ones resonate the

2763
02:36:19,951 --> 02:36:22,950
quickest with the audience because
they're not all going to be timeless

2764
02:36:22,951 --> 02:36:25,530
classics. Some of them are
going to be deep in the woods,

2765
02:36:25,531 --> 02:36:29,700
but like Mississippi burning or like
Malcolm X and driving miss Daisy.

2766
02:36:30,150 --> 02:36:34,050
Those are two perfect examples of
conflicting films in the same year.

2767
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:38,760
So I need iconic examples like that
where everybody knows the movie. Correct.

2768
02:36:38,970 --> 02:36:42,060
What? I haven't even seen it.
Yes. So that's trial and error.

2769
02:36:42,061 --> 02:36:45,360
So that just has to go on stage a couple
of times and then once I know what the

2770
02:36:45,361 --> 02:36:46,860
movies are, then we write it.

2771
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:49,740
Then you verbatim that shit
it really fucking get it work.

2772
02:36:49,770 --> 02:36:54,700
That's black belt level comedy. That's
black belt level. It's like you have to,

2773
02:36:54,701 --> 02:36:58,000
you have to have like this is not
something that's obvious in front of you.

2774
02:36:58,210 --> 02:37:01,930
You have like a scaffolding and you're
trying to construct this and figure out a

2775
02:37:01,931 --> 02:37:05,320
way that it squeeze the most
juice out of it. That's,

2776
02:37:05,350 --> 02:37:06,610
that's that whitewater rafting.

2777
02:37:06,611 --> 02:37:10,780
That's it's so it's so rewarding
when that gets pulled off.

2778
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:15,440
I just feel like if you look at every
genre and it's not to defend a white

2779
02:37:15,441 --> 02:37:18,670
savior movie as much as it is to just
show why the fuck it happened. Yeah.

2780
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:23,860
This is about black people in the nineties
like boys into it in the 90s that was

2781
02:37:24,261 --> 02:37:26,390
the era of shoot 'em up bang,

2782
02:37:26,391 --> 02:37:31,391
bang hood classics and somewhere around
95 96 black cinema became much more

2783
02:37:32,421 --> 02:37:37,421
positive and reinforcing and it was
waiting to exhale and poetic justice and

2784
02:37:37,821 --> 02:37:41,090
above, not above the realm.
What's the other one? Um,

2785
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:43,430
loved Jones and love and basketball.

2786
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:47,600
Like there were all these more positive
black centers that was indirect reaction

2787
02:37:47,601 --> 02:37:52,250
to not wanting to be perceived and
portrayed constantly in a negative light.

2788
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:57,310
So I could probably go deep into the
fucking weeds race by race on sentiment.

2789
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:04,180
Like I could do all the Asian movies
and end with crazy rich Asians as the

2790
02:38:04,341 --> 02:38:08,420
counter to that. But it's not necessarily
Asian savior. Like there's no way,

2791
02:38:08,421 --> 02:38:10,090
I don't know how to connect that.

2792
02:38:10,091 --> 02:38:14,720
But I believe there is a way with all
of these cinematic movies to connect it

2793
02:38:14,721 --> 02:38:15,554
all together.

2794
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:20,420
And at that point you probably got a
25 minute bit that you know needs to be

2795
02:38:20,421 --> 02:38:24,760
chopped down to 10 to 10 but
that's how you build all that.

2796
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:27,410
You build the whole house and
then you just start chopping off.

2797
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:30,250
And when you do that are
you writing it out? Do you,

2798
02:38:30,251 --> 02:38:33,010
do you ever write things out? Was
while I was asking as a forum,

2799
02:38:33,160 --> 02:38:36,010
cause one of the things that I've found
that has a great benefit as I write

2800
02:38:36,011 --> 02:38:37,540
things out, not trying to be funny,

2801
02:38:37,930 --> 02:38:41,620
instead of just writing it out in
a way where I'm trying to be funny,

2802
02:38:41,621 --> 02:38:43,360
I just write it out. Like
I'm writing an essay,

2803
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:47,400
like I'm writing an article for a
magazine and then in doing that I'll,

2804
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:52,180
I'll extract chunks that are funny because
I find that when I'm trying to write

2805
02:38:52,181 --> 02:38:56,140
as a comic, I'm trying to write,
set up punchline. It's too defining,

2806
02:38:56,170 --> 02:39:00,370
it's too limiting. But when
I write in an open form,

2807
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:05,110
then funny ideas are in there and
I just come out and pull them.

2808
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:06,290
Do you think,

2809
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:10,250
do you think part of that is having the
advantage of the audience being with you

2810
02:39:11,070 --> 02:39:13,160
immediate? Like when
you have your audience,

2811
02:39:13,850 --> 02:39:15,470
you're afforded that opportunity to,

2812
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:18,470
cause it's weird because the
way we build material now,

2813
02:39:18,471 --> 02:39:21,830
I don't think that's how you
did it when you first started.

2814
02:39:21,831 --> 02:39:24,470
Was it more about just the
joke, the joke, the joke?

2815
02:39:24,570 --> 02:39:27,330
Yeah. You had to be, you had to
gain their confidence, right.

2816
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:29,850
That was the thing is like
you have to start strong.

2817
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:32,520
You have to have a good opening bit.
You couldn't fuck around two months.

2818
02:39:32,521 --> 02:39:34,190
They had have confidence
in you. Like this guy,

2819
02:39:34,191 --> 02:39:36,200
this guy kind of waste my
fucking time. You know, they,

2820
02:39:36,201 --> 02:39:39,990
they just see if you're on a show, when
you're in a, when you're an amateur,

2821
02:39:39,991 --> 02:39:43,560
I mean fucking 10 other people
before you, you have to grab them,

2822
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:44,763
you got to grab them,

2823
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:46,740
you've got to grab them and show
them that you have something. Yeah.

2824
02:39:46,830 --> 02:39:49,230
But then once you become
an established comedian,

2825
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:52,370
the other problem is you're working with
a bunch of other established comedians

2826
02:39:52,390 --> 02:39:56,340
like say if I'm working with you and
then there's Joey Diaz and you know all

2827
02:39:56,341 --> 02:39:59,460
these other fucking people that are going
on that are murdering and then you go

2828
02:39:59,461 --> 02:40:02,550
up with some bullshit new stuff
like that stuff has to be ready.

2829
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:07,580
Like having an established audience is
great for a couple minutes and then you

2830
02:40:08,971 --> 02:40:13,200
better have some shit. You know? It's
almost like they have, there's more.

2831
02:40:14,030 --> 02:40:18,000
So things have to be more tight,
but some people don't do that.

2832
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:21,810
Some people don't do clubs anymore where
they're working with a bunch of people.

2833
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:24,360
They don't do like the store or the improv
where they're working with a bunch of

2834
02:40:24,361 --> 02:40:26,280
people. Instead they do their own shows,

2835
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:30,210
they do their own shows only they have
the same opening act all the time and

2836
02:40:30,211 --> 02:40:32,490
then people there to see
them and it's a low bar.

2837
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:35,940
They don't have to worry about it as
much. I think that's, that's a mistake.

2838
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:40,830
But I think the essay form, I started
figuring that out maybe 10 years ago.

2839
02:40:40,831 --> 02:40:45,030
I started writing things in essay form.
I originally just do it as blog posts.

2840
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:48,510
I would write blog posts and I'd take
those blog posts and I was extract ideas

2841
02:40:48,511 --> 02:40:50,310
from them and then make it into comedy.

2842
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:55,110
But I feel like the writing without the
limitations of it needing to be funny is

2843
02:40:55,111 --> 02:40:56,700
where I'd get the most ideas.

2844
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,230
Yeah. And then you also have
the most truth in theirs.

2845
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:02,210
Yes. Cause I'm not just trying
to bullshit people for a laugh.

2846
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:03,410
I'm trying to find out,

2847
02:41:03,411 --> 02:41:07,340
like what is it like if that
premise of the white savior movie,

2848
02:41:07,341 --> 02:41:10,520
like what is it about why
people making these moves?

2849
02:41:10,521 --> 02:41:13,550
Like what are they trying to, are
they trying to defend something?

2850
02:41:13,700 --> 02:41:16,040
Are they trying to exonerate themselves?

2851
02:41:16,041 --> 02:41:17,690
Like what are they trying to
do when they make that movie?

2852
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:19,040
Has it just a feel good?

2853
02:41:19,070 --> 02:41:23,000
Is it their distorted idea of
how to bring everybody together?

2854
02:41:23,001 --> 02:41:25,250
Is it show that some white people
were really good back then? Yeah.

2855
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:29,990
Even in the bad times. Look, great
movie. Hey, good job Michael.

2856
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:33,230
You know, good job. Well like everybody
did a great job in this movie.

2857
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:37,580
Like what, what is it that, that's the,
the motivation you could find, you know,

2858
02:41:37,581 --> 02:41:41,390
you find those, those gems of
humor, those roots of humor in that,

2859
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:45,410
yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I'll,
I'll, I'll try that. I'll try writing,

2860
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:48,410
writing and out more before putting it off

2861
02:41:49,140 --> 02:41:52,150
writing that way. Cause I don't have
to do anything. There's no expectation.

2862
02:41:52,570 --> 02:41:53,950
Like it just, it just thoughts.

2863
02:41:53,951 --> 02:41:57,280
Just spill the dots out and then
you get absorbed in the writing.

2864
02:41:57,580 --> 02:42:00,040
And then in that absorption
you're, I mean you're a funny guy.

2865
02:42:00,041 --> 02:42:01,840
You're always going to
think funny thoughts.

2866
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:04,770
Those funny thoughts are going to come
out when you're talking about something

2867
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:06,730
like and what the fuck
was this guy thinking?

2868
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:10,450
And then you go on this whole rant about
this thing that maybe if you didn't

2869
02:42:10,451 --> 02:42:13,600
give yourself the opportunity to sit in
front of a computer and just stare at

2870
02:42:13,601 --> 02:42:15,430
the screen and stare at those keyboard,

2871
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,950
you probably wouldn't have
come up with that premise.

2872
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:23,030
Also. Um, once I have the
joke in a decent shape,

2873
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:24,560
even if it's kind of loose,

2874
02:42:25,010 --> 02:42:30,010
I start watching myself on mute performed
like I go from audio to wants to joke

2875
02:42:31,740 --> 02:42:36,740
as structure to video and
then just watching myself
on mute and just seeing body

2876
02:42:37,461 --> 02:42:41,240
language and just seeing
does this look funny?

2877
02:42:41,570 --> 02:42:45,580
Does this look? That's interesting.
I've never feel for, and,

2878
02:42:45,950 --> 02:42:49,580
and I think you just had it once once
identify where my comedic trends where

2879
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:54,230
it's quick, spastic movements,
but not a lot of stage talking.

2880
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:56,840
Walking the stage doesn't work
for me. I'm not Chris rock,

2881
02:42:56,900 --> 02:43:01,900
so operate in like a three foot box to
either side of center stage and if it's

2882
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:06,080
quit in hit, but nobody, if I,

2883
02:43:06,470 --> 02:43:09,800
if I take my head one way then bring my
shoulders instead of bringing my head

2884
02:43:09,801 --> 02:43:13,690
and shoulders at the same time on
a turn is if I'm caught while I'm

2885
02:43:13,691 --> 02:43:14,740
contemplating a point.

2886
02:43:15,490 --> 02:43:20,490
Something as simple as that for me helps
jokes and then I can go back and listen

2887
02:43:21,131 --> 02:43:22,870
to the audio at the back on,

2888
02:43:22,871 --> 02:43:26,020
watch the video and see where I'm getting
laughs just off movement and I haven't

2889
02:43:26,021 --> 02:43:30,820
said a word yet and for me it's quick
movements and facial expressions.

2890
02:43:30,821 --> 02:43:34,240
Those are the extra little I caught at
the extra season and that's the shit

2891
02:43:34,241 --> 02:43:37,240
that, you know, once you kind
of get the joke in a good place,

2892
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:40,630
where can we add a little season
and is it a vocal inflection?

2893
02:43:40,631 --> 02:43:43,810
Is it coming down on this
part? Is it looking this way?

2894
02:43:43,811 --> 02:43:48,310
Then look in that way for the like,
like almost borderline performative,

2895
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:49,600
like on some acting shit,

2896
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:54,460
but just looking and finding places
where the emotions can change and not

2897
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:58,570
necessarily on this line I do
this thing, but it's just, Oh,

2898
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:02,410
this part is funnier if
I'm not as excited here.

2899
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:06,220
That Foxworthy says some
shit I was watching and bring
the funny and he told one

2900
02:44:06,221 --> 02:44:08,130
of the contestants, eh,

2901
02:44:08,140 --> 02:44:12,340
if you started at 10 it's when the
competition comedy show the new show,

2902
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:16,030
it's last comic standing. But with
sketch comics mixed in there as well.

2903
02:44:16,031 --> 02:44:19,180
So it's not, it's not strictly stand up,

2904
02:44:19,210 --> 02:44:23,530
it's sketch and variety acts
and all of that type of shit.

2905
02:44:23,531 --> 02:44:25,570
But the same shit you go out
in front of three judges,

2906
02:44:25,571 --> 02:44:29,380
somebody crushes your dreams and then
you talk shit about it behind the bags

2907
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:32,750
once she kicked off the show. Uh,

2908
02:44:33,250 --> 02:44:36,790
but he tells somebody wants you started
at 10 you have nowhere else to go.

2909
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:42,630
So I tried to keep that in mind in terms
of just not being too big too soon with

2910
02:44:42,641 --> 02:44:44,170
the material. Just shifting gears.

2911
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:46,970
It's, it's a fascinating process.

2912
02:44:46,971 --> 02:44:50,750
And we discussed this on the show many
times before that there's no books that

2913
02:44:50,751 --> 02:44:52,880
can tell you how to do it.
The only way you get liked,

2914
02:44:52,910 --> 02:44:55,970
one of the things that's really cool
about this conversation is young guys

2915
02:44:55,971 --> 02:44:58,700
coming up, young girls coming up,
they want to learn how to do comedy,

2916
02:44:58,701 --> 02:45:03,020
can listen to your process and
they'll get an idea of the map ahead.

2917
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:05,690
They'll get an idea of the
road because there's real,

2918
02:45:05,691 --> 02:45:08,270
there's no courses you can take
that are ever going to prepare you.

2919
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:12,140
You have to find established comedians
and listen to them talk about how they do

2920
02:45:12,141 --> 02:45:17,141
it and in a sense what we're doing is
we're laying down like a sort of a a

2921
02:45:17,871 --> 02:45:19,460
course for,

2922
02:45:19,490 --> 02:45:24,490
for the up and coming class for the people
that are starting out now that don't

2923
02:45:24,531 --> 02:45:26,930
really have anyone to
show them how to do it.

2924
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:31,550
They can cut a lot of time
out by listening to a guy
like you who is explaining

2925
02:45:31,551 --> 02:45:35,210
the mistakes that he made and then the
good choices that you made and then your

2926
02:45:35,211 --> 02:45:35,860
process.

2927
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:36,693
I tried,

2928
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:41,350
one of the tricks that I had early on was
to just avoid topics that anybody else

2929
02:45:41,351 --> 02:45:44,200
was talking about. And then even
if the joke wasn't the funniest,

2930
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:45,800
I got credit for being original.

2931
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:48,080
And I don't know if this
will work for every comment,

2932
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:53,100
but I know coming up early two thousands
in the back half at a Def jam era to be

2933
02:45:53,441 --> 02:45:54,250
a black comic,

2934
02:45:54,250 --> 02:45:57,970
there wasn't talking about fucking and
sucking and weed and you have the been so

2935
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:00,430
Brogan, like I just, I didn't
touch none of that shit.

2936
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,300
So to a mainstream Booker
it was just, Oh wow.

2937
02:46:04,301 --> 02:46:08,840
He did a joke about suicide.
Okay, well let's look.

2938
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:09,950
Yeah, look Kim,

2939
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:13,940
well there's such a triplet jokes
that it was just weird off-brand shit,

2940
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,810
but still finding funny in that this such

2941
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:21,870
to pick on tried and Truven tried and
proven subjects because you know that

2942
02:46:21,871 --> 02:46:24,820
work, you know, and you're
scared in the beginning, right?

2943
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:26,570
Yeah. You start, you see,

2944
02:46:26,740 --> 02:46:30,990
I feel like you start as a
weird image. Like my early,

2945
02:46:30,991 --> 02:46:35,400
my first few years of comedy was
this weird Martin Lawrence, Doug,

2946
02:46:35,401 --> 02:46:39,450
Stan hope hybrid child. Like, I dunno,

2947
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:42,360
it was terrible. It's very terrible.

2948
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:46,760
But I started noticing that when Blake,

2949
02:46:46,830 --> 02:46:50,550
the first thing I needed to do with the
first objective when I got on was to,

2950
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:53,440
all right, all the road bookers
say you got to get a TV critic,

2951
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:56,640
you get to get a TV credit and
then I can pay you more. All right.

2952
02:46:56,641 --> 02:46:59,070
Well the only thing that was booking
people on irregular was comic view.

2953
02:46:59,460 --> 02:47:01,710
So BTS comic view became the path,

2954
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:05,100
but then I didn't get comic view like two,

2955
02:47:05,101 --> 02:47:07,650
three years in a row and
I looked at the material,

2956
02:47:07,651 --> 02:47:09,620
I submit it versus the material
that was being performed.

2957
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:14,430
It was guys doing better versions of
the same topics as me. So all right.

2958
02:47:14,460 --> 02:47:18,060
This year we're going to try doing
different topics from everybody.

2959
02:47:18,061 --> 02:47:19,500
So I watched comic view for a whole year,

2960
02:47:19,501 --> 02:47:24,501
kept a log of every topic that was touched
on for every episode and just never

2961
02:47:24,511 --> 02:47:27,990
did jumps about those topics. Wow.
So you actually wrote it out. Yeah.

2962
02:47:28,390 --> 02:47:30,030
Every week. Come of you
came on every night though.

2963
02:47:30,190 --> 02:47:33,570
I remember back in like 2000 2001 come of,

2964
02:47:33,571 --> 02:47:37,770
you came on Monday through Friday
and it was six comics and episode,

2965
02:47:38,490 --> 02:47:41,910
so every week you had a cross section
of what 40 motherfuckers were talking

2966
02:47:41,911 --> 02:47:45,120
about. Wow. For 12 weeks. And
that's a shit ton of comedy.

2967
02:47:45,270 --> 02:47:46,940
That's a shit ton of topics
and you'd be surprised.

2968
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:48,420
There's a lot of repetition and overlap.

2969
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:51,330
So by simply not talking about that shit,

2970
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,380
it's enough to get you a little bit right.

2971
02:47:54,390 --> 02:47:56,340
It's no different than what's
happening now with the alt scene.

2972
02:47:56,370 --> 02:47:58,380
You're just a different delivery.
You're a different cadence.

2973
02:47:58,950 --> 02:47:59,783
You have a different look.

2974
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:04,210
Being different is almost as
important as being funny now. Yes.

2975
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:07,080
I don't think that one, I don't
think they'd be in different,

2976
02:48:07,081 --> 02:48:09,810
should we prioritize over being funny?

2977
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:11,970
But if you're different and you're
fucking hilarious, then you,

2978
02:48:12,690 --> 02:48:16,950
yeah. People appreciate it for sure.
Just like any other John rhe of art,

2979
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:20,700
whether it's music or cinema, anything
being different is, is rewarding.

2980
02:48:20,730 --> 02:48:23,660
That's why I've always liked
emo Phillips, man. Really? Yeah,

2981
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:27,200
that's what I came on. Well,
I just wanted to do the,

2982
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:30,590
and the cadence was never

2983
02:48:32,020 --> 02:48:35,320
typical. Right. That shit
just, I'll say, all right.

2984
02:48:35,321 --> 02:48:39,140
That's at minimum it's different.
So he's challenging himself,

2985
02:48:39,141 --> 02:48:42,890
so I'm going to try that feels long. Yeah.

2986
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:48,070
Dio Vaughn's got Theo comedy, like
Theo complex. You can't imitate that.

2987
02:48:48,071 --> 02:48:50,890
Like the only way that shit works
is if it comes out of Theo's mouth.

2988
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:52,900
It doesn't even make sense
coming out to someone else.

2989
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:54,570
CEO gets a laugh on,

2990
02:48:55,530 --> 02:49:00,530
he gets a laugh on the setup and he gets
a laugh on the pause and the pause is

2991
02:49:01,201 --> 02:49:03,580
that anticipatory gate
like you already know.

2992
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:06,030
They already know what's going to be
good and they should go out there to get

2993
02:49:06,031 --> 02:49:08,250
the ah, yeah. Like he's,

2994
02:49:08,310 --> 02:49:10,320
he's good man. Yeah, he's real good.

2995
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:13,650
And I watched that guy turned a
corner man about two, three years ago.

2996
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:18,210
He just hit his groove and he went full
mullet. Wow. He had a mullet before,

2997
02:49:18,211 --> 02:49:21,720
but it was, he just found that groove,

2998
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:24,870
like whatever it is that made
him, he found what it is.

2999
02:49:24,871 --> 02:49:28,140
They found the frequency and then
he just hit into it. And very, very,

3000
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:29,130
very original.

3001
02:49:29,530 --> 02:49:33,270
You'd never hear him talking about like
stuff that other people have talked

3002
02:49:33,271 --> 02:49:36,720
about. There's a New York guy like that,
Martin Norman. Martin Norman has a way.

3003
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:40,170
Sure. A lock. Love Mark.
Norman pivot is coming on soon.

3004
02:49:40,530 --> 02:49:42,720
He's up as on here a couple
of weeks. He's great.

3005
02:49:42,721 --> 02:49:45,690
Norman just knows how to pivot in a way
you think is going this way and it's

3006
02:49:45,691 --> 02:49:50,640
just a basketball crossover. Very good
writer. Very good writer. Well, listen,

3007
02:49:50,641 --> 02:49:53,580
man, I've got to wrap this up, but uh,
this is awesome. I really appreciate it.

3008
02:49:53,581 --> 02:49:55,860
I'm glad we finally did it. Thank
you so much. It was awesome.

3009
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:58,080
Thank you Joe robe. Enjoyed
your work for a long time.

3010
02:49:58,240 --> 02:49:59,890
So glad to have you on
here, man. You know,

3011
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:03,330
when the Vietnam joke gets worked
out, let it know. Let us know.

3012
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:06,120
All right. Bye buddy.
