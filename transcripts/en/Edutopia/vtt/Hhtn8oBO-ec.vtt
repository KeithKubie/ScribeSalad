00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:08.146
&gt;&gt;I'm Justin.

00:00:08.146 --> 00:00:12.136
I'm sixteen years old and I use
technology because it allows me

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.866
to express myself like,
to the fullest extent.

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:20.816
Maybe six or seven I got my Game
Boy, where I had the original Pokemon

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.496
and yeah, that was
the beginning for me.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.926
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: He was introduced
to technology fairly early.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:33.476
Because I was consulting in
technology, I had my own computer,

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:35.986
so the home computer
became his computer.

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:39.016
So he was a second and third
grader with his own computer

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:41.576
and I think that helped a lot.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.706
&gt;&gt;Justin: If it's an A day,
I have two tech classes.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.746
So I'll do programming and
my interactive media class,

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:50.896
three D modeling animation.

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.426
&gt;&gt;Christopher: This class is about
using Maya to create the assets

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:59.326
for video game simulations
and informative pieces.

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:00.306
&gt;&gt;Computer voice: You're
on my side of the arm rest.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:03.316
We're not gonna have
problems, are we?

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.976
&gt;&gt;Christopher: He's actually
one of my best students.

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:09.716
He has a very deep understanding
of how things physically interact,

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:13.486
but not only that, characters,
dialog, story creation.

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:14.596
He does very well.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.166
&gt;&gt;Justin: One of the interesting
things about animation is

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.846
that it's not just animation.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.216
You need to know a lot of
different things, like biology,

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.846
to see how things move so you
can make them move correctly.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.216
So he's trying to sneak.

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.076
I still have the little
kinks in it, but...

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.506
So, you know, timing is essential.

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:34.246
This is what actually controls
pretty much all the animation.

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:36.846
So I have my timeline and,
you know, all this right here,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.116
all these little circles and the
arrows and these, they're controls

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:42.056
that you use to animate him.

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:47.676
&gt;&gt;Gideon: First things first, I want
you to take out a piece of paper.

00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:49.426
I want you to answer this question.

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:52.766
&gt;&gt;What do you see as the greatest
divide between East and West?

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:55.596
&gt;&gt;Justin: I love history, 'cause
it's almost just like a storybook.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.826
&gt;&gt;There are important people
and heroes and bad guys and,

00:01:58.826 --> 00:01:59.956
you know, all that good stuff.

00:02:00.226 --> 00:02:04.926
&gt;&gt;Gideon: Okay, I want you
to go to www.NationMaster.com

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:05.636
&gt;&gt;Justin: Nation Master.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:09.546
&gt;&gt;Gideon: The great thing is
that the students have an acumen

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:11.976
for technology, if it's tapped into.

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:15.176
Luckily, our students here have the
opportunity and some of the resources

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:19.206
at their fingertips in this school
to really work with the technology.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.116
&gt;&gt;And what I want you to do is click
on the tab that says statistics.

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:23.066
I think it's the second--

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:26.006
&gt;&gt;David: Bill Gates once said,
"It's difficult to prepare kids

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:29.276
for the next five years jobs, because
they haven't been invented yet."

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:31.126
&gt;&gt;And so what we said
in our vision was,

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:33.766
we want to become the highest
performing school in the nation,

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:38.056
through the use of STEM technology
education, science, technology,

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:40.956
engineering and math,
innovative master teaching,

00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:45.426
and then obviously a curriculum
that changes to prepare kids

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:46.726
for the competitive global market.

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:50.986
&gt;&gt;Gideon: I think if we don't
tap into the technology resources

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.536
and skills that the students have,
we're missing the boat as teachers.

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:55.726
So I try to foster it
as much as possible.

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:59.346
Giving them opportunities
to do projects

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:03.686
that use their technology skills,
such as putting together videos

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:04.786
and then uploading them to YouTube.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.976
&gt;&gt;This place is where we
come to make a difference.

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:11.146
&gt;&gt;Gideon: I like trying new things.

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:15.266
It stretches me as a teacher and
it really does provide the students

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:16.666
with a different kind of experience.

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:19.876
&gt;&gt;Ready?

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:26.096
&gt;&gt;Justin: You know, we just
kinda pick a place, we just spar.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:32.796
&gt;&gt;Sometimes you need to let out
a little anger or frustration.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:35.926
&gt;&gt;Much bigger than me.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.616
&gt;&gt;It's fun, 'cause
I just love proving

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:40.866
that I'm better than these two.

00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:43.126
&gt;&gt;Justin: Hello, family.

00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:44.186
What are you making?

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:44.536
&gt;&gt;Cookies.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.236
&gt;&gt;Justin: So, this game.

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:49.806
This is a great way to just
kind of blow off steam,

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:51.916
but it's not something you
would really obsess over.

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.836
Not like World of Warcraft.

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:58.956
&gt;&gt;I played it because I've just
heard so many good things about it,

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:01.346
and everyone's like, "Oh my
god, this game is wonderful."

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:04.166
&gt;&gt;And I was thinking, "You know,
maybe I'll just try it out."

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:05.126
&gt;&gt;You know, I've kind of--

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:07.066
&gt;&gt;I'm kind of into
the whole MMO thing.

00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:10.756
&gt;&gt;But the reason definitely why I
quit is 'cause I got nothing done.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.626
I didn't write scripts.

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:13.836
&gt;&gt;I didn't read.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.316
I didn't do anything.

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:17.926
I'd just get home have to do
my homework, just jump on this

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:21.936
and just play it till
I had to go to sleep.

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.666
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: Pretty much,
I just talked to him

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:28.156
about how important it was to not
spend six hours and eight hours

00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:32.036
and I think I talked to him
about that kid somewhere in Asia

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:35.466
that played forty eight
hours straight and then died.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:36.176
&gt;&gt;It's tough.

00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:41.146
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: So we talked about, "You
don't wanna go too over focused.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.336
You don't wanna be too extreme."

00:04:42.546 --> 00:04:44.546
And he'd go, "Mom, you know,
I really have this balance.

00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:45.806
I got everything covered."

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.966
So and I do feel that he has that.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:51.236
&gt;&gt;Justin: This is Spore,
and in this game,

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:54.246
you model your own little alien
creature and you kinda live

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.316
through the stage of civilization.

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:57.586
&gt;&gt;So this is my creature right here.

00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:00.536
I can manipulate him
as much as I want.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:04.886
I can grab hold of his
spine, move his arms

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:06.506
and do all sorts of things with him.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:10.486
It really is a good way to kinda
teach the very basics of modeling.

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:15.046
&gt;&gt;Clareice: You try to get a balance
between, how much are you, you know,

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:17.336
micromanaging their lives?

00:05:18.396 --> 00:05:19.836
&gt;&gt;Especially since they
don't want you there.

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:21.346
You know, when they start
hitting seventeen, eighteen.

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:22.016
&gt;&gt;Justin: This is Michael.

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:23.726
&gt;&gt;To the dungeon.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.636
&gt;&gt;Michael: Ah, bang.

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.306
&gt;&gt;Clareice: I think as a parent,
you still have to make sure,

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:32.456
because the digital opens the world.

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:35.466
It is just so all encompassing

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:39.116
that if you stand back too
far, you-- they'll get lost.

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:42.136
&gt;&gt;Justin: Well, that's crap.

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:46.366
&gt;&gt;My Xbox is definitely
the most important part.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:51.486
It's where I play the games that
I film for my machinima purposes.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:56.556
&gt;&gt;The secret is turning pure game
play into something that looks kind

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.386
of like a movie and, you
know, you'll have shots.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:03.756
&gt;&gt;You'll have music, you'll have,
you know, dialog, actual dialog.

00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:05.686
I've written scripts for
these sort of things.

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:09.846
&gt;&gt;What I have right here, it's
a camera, kind of a camera,

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:13.246
and through this I can view
everything that we just recorded.

00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:18.666
And I can pause the action and
I can rewind it and whatever.

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:21.106
I edit it, you know,
mix it all together,

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:22.866
add special effects,
add the sound effects.

00:06:23.226 --> 00:06:27.846
&gt;&gt;You know, anything I need to
amplify the cinematic experience.

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:35.796
I can upload it and people will
look at my stuff and you know,

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:38.766
there are actually some decent
film critics and I think of myself

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:41.106
as one too, so I can look at
my work and be like, "You know,

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.116
that cut right there, that
wasn't a really good one.

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:44.736
Maybe if I'd gotten
it from an angle."

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:48.306
But I feel that I do
improve over time

00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:51.986
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: I do feel that,
especially for Justin,

00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:53.526
technology is a good thing.

00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:57.676
I think it helps him to find
something he can be passionate about,

00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:01.466
something that potentially
see him in a career in.

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:05.596
And so I do feel that as long
as you've got some oversight

00:07:05.596 --> 00:07:08.526
and you're not allowing them
to be totally kids and get

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:11.306
into dangerous areas, that it's
one of the most wonderful things

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:14.636
for them, because this is the
direction that the world is going in.

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.896
&gt;&gt;Michael: This is RPG Maker XP.

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:25.106
It's a program that lets
you build your own RPG.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:26.746
&gt;&gt;Justin: An RPG is
a role playing game.

00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:30.206
so it kind of gives you like
the standard kind of setup.

00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:33.496
And you can add in your own
sprites or sound effects.

00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:35.766
He customized this and
made it really unique.

00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:40.956
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah, so you just pour
all your dreams out right here.

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:41.966
It's mainly for us.

00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:42.956
&gt;&gt;Justin: For us, yeah.

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:45.696
There isn't really a crowd
of people out there waiting

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:48.036
for us to-- give us our masterpiece.

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:49.696
&gt;&gt;Michael: I mean, this
is a little community.

00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:51.396
&gt;&gt;Justin: I mean, it's
enjoyable to just do this

00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:52.146
and then kinda play through.

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:53.706
It's like, you know, "I made this"

00:07:55.106 --> 00:07:58.886
&gt;&gt;Justin: It's just a good feeling.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:04.956
