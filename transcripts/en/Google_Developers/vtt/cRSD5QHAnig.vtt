00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:09.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello
and welcome to I/O Live.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.058
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I'm standing here

00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:13.190
with Tim Sneath, a product
manager on Flutter.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.870
Hi, Tim.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.420
TIM SNEATH: Hi, Timothy.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.000
How are you doing?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm doing
very well, thank you.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.820
Let's talk about Flutter.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760
For those few developers
out there that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.830
don't know what Flutter
is yet, what is it?

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.413
TIM SNEATH: Yeah,
so Flutter is a tool

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:26.370
kit for building native mobile
apps, for iOS or Android,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.530
from the same code base.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.160
It's open.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.570
It's open source.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.730
And today at I/O,
we're announcing

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.989
a new version of Flutter.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, yeah, so
that was my next question.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.260
What's new this week?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.176
There's a new version.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:37.720
What else?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.790
TIM SNEATH: Yeah, so this
week we're announcing Beta 3.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.130
Obviously, it's the third
beta of our product.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.620
We shipped the first beta
at Mobile World Congress

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.820
a couple of months ago.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.990
And now we're starting
to get to the point

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.850
where we really feel like it's
ready for a lot of production

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.250
use.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.916
And so we're encouraging
people to start

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.020
taking a look at Flutter.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.103
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, you've
worked with developers

00:00:55.103 --> 00:00:55.940
using Flutter a lot.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.710
What would you say they're
most excited about when

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.850
they start using Flutter?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.990
TIM SNEATH: Yeah, so I think
there are three things,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.300
primarily, that make Flutter
a great platform for building

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.870
apps.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.560
Number one, we have
native performance.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.090
We compile everything that
you write to ARM code.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.090
We're powered by the Dart
programming language,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.290
and that enables this
really fast performance.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.010
The second thing is we have
this unrivaled productivity.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.840
With Flutter you can use
this thing called hot reload.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.420
So you can write your code.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.440
You can continue to work with
it and see exactly the changes

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.910
that you're making in
real time on the device.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.660
And then thirdly, Flutter has
this high-velocity graphics

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.800
engine that lets your
dreams come true--

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.860
lets designers choose
what they want to build,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.020
and developers put
them into production.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Awesome, and there's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.330
a lot of people
using Flutter today.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.371
What are some of your
highlights of the apps that

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.270
are out and live?

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.644
TIM SNEATH: Yeah,
so again, we've

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.350
only just got into beta over
the last couple of months.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.090
We had a few great
applications that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.770
have come out, both internally
at Google and externally.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.780
Internally, we power
some things like ads.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.730
If you have ever
created an ad campaign,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.150
you're using a Google
app built with Flutter.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.740
Externally, probably
the most famous one

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580
that was shipped at the backend
of last year was Hamilton.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.015
You know, the Broadway musical.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:08.580
They shipped a
companion app using

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.610
Flutter that has had
millions of downloads--

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.140
a really great application.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.690
And then this week we're talking
about some other new apps.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.074
Alibaba, the big
Chinese online retailer,

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.740
they have just shipped
an app in Flutter

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.260
that they're now rolling out
to millions of customers.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.980
Groupon have an app
that they're working on.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.520
We have just different
kinds of apps

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.910
from different industries--
wine, retail, finance.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.070
Loads of different people
are coming out with apps.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.170
And in fact, we've just
seen several hundred apps,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.110
just since we shipped beta,
go live on the Play Store.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If you want
to get started with Flutter,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.372
what's your first step?

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:40.580
TIM SNEATH: Well, there's
one simple place you can go

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.020
and that's flutter.io.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.850
And there you can find sessions.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.960
You can find codelabs.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.750
We're obviously live-streaming
six different sessions here

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.856
at Google this week.

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:50.480
There's a whole bunch
of documentation.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.481
And of course, you can
download the Flutter SDK.

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.355
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's all at flutter.io.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:55.490
TIM SNEATH: Flutter.io.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you, Tim.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.690
TIM SNEATH: Of course,
it's a pleasure.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.065
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm Timothy
Jordan, and this is I/O Live.

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:04.590
