00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Which of the following could be simplified or removed without changing the result]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[function platos_republic(a,b) {]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go through the lines 1 at a time. A times 1.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the same as A=A because anything times 1 is just itself.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So this assigns the new value of A

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to be equal to the old value of A.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So this is actually equal to just doing nothing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So I could totally remove this line

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
without changing the result of Plato's Republic.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
B gets B+0. This is the same sort of theory.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This reduces to B gets B

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because adding 0 to something doesn't change its value.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So I could just drop this statement entirely.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A=A+B. That looks like something important might be going on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's hold on to that for a bit.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, let's go down here and see.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Eventually we're returning A.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I can't remove this line

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because we actually need to return A to have the same value.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And if I'm going to return A, then I need to keep this line--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A gets A+B--so that I know what the right value of A is supposed to be.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But--and this is the potentially tricky bit--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I can remove B=B+2.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Even though there's no arithmetic simplification that I can perform,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I just don't need the line!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
B isn't part of the return value.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
No one else can ever see it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We throw it away after this point.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Formally in computer science we call this "dead code".

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It has no effect on the rest of the program.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I could drop these 3 lines,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and all that Plato's Republic is really doing

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is summing its 2 variables together, returning the result.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Plato's Republic is a dialogue written in about 380 BCE

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that talks about the definition of justice.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The phrase "who watches the watchers"

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
often comes up in discussions or criticisms of Plato's Republic.
