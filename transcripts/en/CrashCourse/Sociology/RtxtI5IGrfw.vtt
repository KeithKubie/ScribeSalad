00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
If you asked a medieval peasant whether they
liked working two days a week for their lord,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.430
while they barely made enough food for themselves,
they’d probably say no.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.100
And if you ask a factory worker today whether they
like making a tiny fraction of what their company’s
CEO makes, they’d probably have a similar answer.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.600
But, even though huge numbers of people
don’t want inequality, it still exists, and it has
for a long time.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
And the systems of stratification that we talked
about last week don’t really help explain this:

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.940
They can tell us about how this inequality
happens, but they can’t tell us why.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.840
If we want to answer that question, we'll
have to return, once again, to our old friends
the three sociological paradigms:

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.160
structural functionalism, social conflict theory,
and symbolic-interactionism.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:51.340
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600
Let’s start with clarifying something
pretty important about how sociologists
understand inequality:

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.160
Even if the peasant and the factory worker
both dislike the inequality in their lives,
they might still believe that it’s fair.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.920
The peasant might say that it’s simply their place in
the world to toil for their lord, and the factory worker
might say that the CEO surely deserves his wealth.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.700
And this happens because of their
societies’ ideology.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.800
For our purposes, an ideology is a set of
cultural beliefs and values that justify a
particular way of organizing society.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.980
Ideology also includes strongly held beliefs
about a society’s patterns of inequality.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.500
Ideology can help explain why inequality never
goes away, but it doesn’t on its own explain why
we have unequal societies in the first place.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.759
For that, we have to turn to our three paradigms.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.940
From a structural functionalist perspective,
we have social stratification because...

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.020
well, you know the basic story of structural
functionalism by now, so say it along with me:

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.300
We have stratification because it's
functional for society.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.620
This is the basic argument of what’s known
as the Davis-Moore Thesis.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.740
Put forward in 1945 by Kingsley Davis
and Wilbert Moore,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.840
it argues that society assigns greater
economic and social rewards to those jobs
that are more important to society.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.400
This guarantees that difficult jobs will be
filled, the thinking goes, and will draw people
away from easier and less important work.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.320
So, the more important a job is for the proper
functioning of society, the more a society rewards it,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.620
which promotes the effective functioning of that
society – and also a system of social stratification.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.000
Davis and Moore basically argue that, without unequal rewards, few people would want the jobs that require the years of training or personal sacrifice that typically come with long work hours.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.320
Think medical doctor.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.120
Without the unequal rewards to motivate people,
we’d have a lot of lifeguards sunning themselves
on the beach and not very many ER docs.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.280
But there are some serious problems with this
idea.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.570
To begin with, Davis and Moore don't talk
about how their thesis actually works in society:

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.070
They only talk about why inequality might
be functionally useful.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.820
And this leads to another problem: Not all
jobs that are important are necessarily hard
to learn, or come with high pay.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.120
Garbage collecting, for instance, is extremely
important for the smooth functioning of society.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.190
But it's not a particularly high-paid, socially
valued job.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.080
And this mismatch works the other way, too:
Not all highly paid jobs are functionally important.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.440
For instance, ask yourself who is more functional
for society: a high school teacher or a famous actor?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.100
Now think about who gets paid more.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.100
Finally, Davis and Moore also ignore the fact
that not all paths are equally open to all people.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.000
If inequality is functional for society because
it motivates hard work, then society should
reflect this by being meritocratic –

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.860
a society in which everyone can work hard
and get ahead.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.300
But as we’ve already seen, this is not the
social reality.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:31.120
The structural nature of inequality, or the ways in which a society is organized to the advantage some groups over others, can be a cause of individual success or failure, no matter how hard a person works.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.260
Now, while Davis and Moore don’t really
deal with the impact of inequality, social-conflict
theory very much does.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.040
For Karl Marx, stratification is based on
different relations to the means of production.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.660
At the simplest level, one class controls the means
of production, which allows them to extract labor from
the other class, which controls only their own labor.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.420
Marx believed that, as capitalism progressed,
the inequality between the bourgeoisie and
the proletariat would get worse until,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.320
eventually, the proletariat would unite and
overthrow the bourgeoisie.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.870
And in doing that, he thought, they’d
ultimately derail the whole capitalist system
and all the inequality that came with it.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.480
But one of the central criticisms of the social-conflict understanding of stratification is that the proletariat revolution never happened in Western Europe, or the United States.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.760
If inequality was so bad for workers, why
did the revolution not happen?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.340
Well, German sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf argued
that Marx wasn’t wrong about conflict per se,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.680
but he saw that the conflict that Marx
observed had changed in several ways that
prevented revolution from happening.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.700
First, Dahrendorf said, the capitalist class
in Europe has been too fragmented to serve
as a single target for revolutionaries.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.520
Rather than having just a few capitalists
against an ever increasing proletariat, we actually
have more capitalists, of different kinds:

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.720
business owners, and executives, and
people who own stocks.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.200
More and more people are invested in capitalism
as an economic system.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.350
And a fragmented capitalist class makes it
difficult for workers to focus their revolutionary
energies on any one group.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.560
In addition, he argued, greater worker organization,
in the form of unions, has allowed workers

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.090
to fight for better working conditions, higher
pay, and greater control over their labor,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.260
resulting in an increased standard of living.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.980
Greater legal protections for workers, like
workers' compensation, unemployment insurance,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.500
and Social Security have also worked to prevent
the revolution that Marx predicted.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.020
All of these structural changes, in turn, helped
lead to greater job stability, which makes workers
less likely to push for revolutionary change.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.480
But Dahrendorf saw that the ideology of
capitalism plays a role here as well.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.940
Just as more people are financially invested in
capitalism, people are also ideologically invested in it.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.260
But this isn't just a matter of whether
people like the system or not:

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.100
ideology determines what people see as
available to struggle over.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.480
Fighting for higher wages seems reasonable,
but abolishing wage labor does not.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.510
There are more criticisms of Marx than just an
absent revolution, and one of the more fundamental
ones was made by none other than Max Weber.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.920
Specifically, Weber argued that Marx's focus
on economic stratification was too simplistic:

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.640
Weber pointed out that there are other kinds
of conflict to consider.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.320
Weber argued that stratification actually
occurs along three dimensions:

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.580
economic class, social status,
and social power, or what sociologists
refer to as socioeconomic status.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.980
This view adds more complexity and
nuance to the matter of stratification,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.440
but as with the structural functionalist approach,
it’s focused only on the macro perspective.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.620
Marx’s theory, for example, is all about
the long historical arc of class conflict,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.710
but it doesn’t really tell us what that
looks like in everyday life.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.940
For a more micro- or individual-level view
of inequality, sociologists turn to symbolic-interactionism.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.720
When we first defined social stratification, we said
that it involved putting people into categories.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.700
Symbolic-interactionism lets us understand how this actually works because, sure, what class you're in might come down to how much money you make.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.800
But how can other people tell what class that
is in everyday interaction?

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.960
It’s not like people walk around with signs.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.820
Except that they kind of do, in the form of
conspicuous consumption.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.460
This is when the products that you buy make
statements about your social position.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.260
Buying a really nice bottle of wine for a
dinner party or wearing designer sunglasses
isn’t just about the thing itself,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.600
it’s also about sending a message to
anyone who sees it, a message that says
"I'm in the upper class."

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.980
The objects act as sign vehicles, carrying
meaning just like a written word.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.920
To some degree, all consumption is
conspicuous consumption:

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:13.460
Your tastes are shaped by your social position,
and you use them to define yourself just as others
read your tastes to judge you and your position.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.860
To see how this works, let’s go to
the Thought Bubble.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.560
Imagine you’re driving in your car with an
acquaintance, and you want to put on some music.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.140
The music you choose tells them something
about you.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
Let’s say you put on some really esoteric
classical music.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.000
Obviously, this tells your friend that you like
it and hopefully that you think they’ll like it too.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.600
But it also tells them that you are the kind
of person who likes esoteric classical music.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.940
Now, if it’s not obvious what this has to do with
stratification, think about the assumptions that your
acquaintance is gonna make about you:

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.860
that you come from a particular background,
one that’s allowed you to have access to certain
kind of education and upbringing,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.800
or that you’ve had years of music lessons.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.650
They might readily assume that you’re the
kind of person whose class standing allows
them to develop these musical tastes.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.920
To be clear, I’m not saying that these
judgements are true.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.220
Lots of people who like classical music are
not, say, wealthy or well-educated.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.470
I’m saying that assumptions like these tend
to be widely held, and recognized.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.700
So when you put on your music, your friend
might recognize you as a person like them,
if they share your tastes.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.880
Or maybe they don’t recognize you as being
like them, so they judge you for being pretentious.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.860
And this isn’t because classical music
is special somehow:

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:25.820
it’s true regardless of what kind of music you put
on, and applies just as much to the clothes you wear,
the books you read, and all of your other tastes.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.960
These are all ways in which people categorize
you in the hierarchy of stratification.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.160
They’re the signs you carry around that
tell people where you fit in society and how
to interact with you.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.320
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.280
This kind of judgement and mutual recognition
isn’t a minor thing.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.710
It’s a powerful force for stratification.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.880
For instance, it can be extremely important
in getting a job.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.960
Hiring can often be an exercise in this kind of judgement, as managers look for people who “fit the culture” and will get along well with the rest of the team.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.220
And it’s not just about what you like, it’s
also about how you like it.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.960
If you decide to start telling people that you
like opera because you want to seem upper class,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.500
but then you show up to a performance
in a T-Shirt and flip-flops, you’re probably
not gonna get anywhere.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.040
There’s a ton of background knowledge and
understanding behind tastes and preferences
that you can’t just conjure out of nowhere,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.180
and the difficulty of acquiring this
knowledge helps maintain stratification.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.200
So these three perspectives, structural-functionalism,
social-conflict, and symbolic-interactionism

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.120
can help us better understand not just how
stratification works, but why we have it.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.680
Today we learned about different theories
of stratification.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.400
We talked about ideology and how it helps
stratification reproduce itself.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.670
We discussed structural-functionalism: the
Davis-Moore thesis and its problems.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.380
We talked about Marx's understanding of classes
and Weber's criticisms.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.360
And we saw how symbolic-interactionism helps
explain stratification in everyday life.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.100
