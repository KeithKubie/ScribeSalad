00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.150
As Bertolt Brecht said, “Grub first, then
ethics.”

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:16.420
A lot of people have an expectation that society
ought to work in uniform harmony and affluence,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.680
and any deviation from that is an outrage
that requires identifying which bad people

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000
made it possible.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.130
And when I began Enlightenment Now I wanted
to really orient the reader in a very different

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.390
mindset about the human condition.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.710
Namely, as we find ourselves in the universe
nothing is expected to work in our favor,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.140
beginning with what many scientists consider
one of the most fundamental of scientific

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.350
discoveries, namely the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
or the law of entropy.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.460
Namely, that in a closed system—one that
isn’t receiving inputs of energy or information—disorder

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.989
naturally increases.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.320
The ability to do useful work/life-enabling
structure.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.030
Just because there are astronomically so many
more ways for things to go wrong than things

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.670
to go right by any definition of things going
right.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.490
So right from the start we don’t have any
right to expect that the universe is going

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.359
to be particularly kind to us.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.090
Indeed, the universe is not out to get us,
but it just doesn’t care about us, and there’s

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.640
a lot of ways for things to go wrong unless
we deploy energy and information to carve

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.700
out local zones of beneficial order that keep
us alive and healthy and happy.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.609
That’s a different way of just thinking
about the human predicament, namely we constantly

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:48.249
have to expend effort, intelligence, knowledge
in order to make things work, and our background

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.909
expectation should be that things fall apart.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.130
It’s advances in energy capture that lead
to the beneficial complexity of life.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.880
Perhaps back to the axial age, the period
of about 800 years in the first millennium

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.540
B.C. which saw the emergence of a number of
moralistic philosophies arising in different

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.720
parts of the world around the same time.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.170
The age of classical Greek philosophy, the
age of the Hebrew prophets, of Confucius,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.480
of Buddha, a kind of uncanny coincidence seemingly
of movements that went from merely propitiating

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.379
gods and making sacrifices and begging him
for victory and better weather and relief

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:44.690
from misfortunes to a more universal system
of human betterment, human flourishing.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.790
So what led to this development seemingly
in different parts of the world at the same

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.790
time?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.680
According to one hypothesis by a team of scholars
including Ian Morris and Pascal Boyer and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.659
Nicolette Molnar, there were gains in energy
capture in the ability to use the products

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:14.269
of agriculture – oil and fiber and calories
from food to allow for a priestly cast separate

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.799
from the people who actually have to scratch
out a living from the ground.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.459
And also, once people’s minds are elevated
from just putting a roof over their head—or

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.250
to keeping the wolf at the door, where their
next meal is coming from—they have the cognitive

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.829
luxury to think about, “What’s it all
about?

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.829
Why are we here?

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.830
What do we strive for?”

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.280
And according to this theory it was something
as mundane—but really not mundane—as energy

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.560
capture: Not mundane given that the second
law of thermodynamics determines our fate

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.940
unless we can push it back.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.389
And so perhaps it’s not such a homely pedestrian
explanation for how so many civilizations

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.669
made this leap to further moral horizons.
