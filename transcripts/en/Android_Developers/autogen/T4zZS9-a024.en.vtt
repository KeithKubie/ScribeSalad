let's start with a question by raise of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
let's start with a question by raise of
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.650
let's start with a question by raise of
hands who wants to make more money from

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
hands who wants to make more money from
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529
hands who wants to make more money from
their games raise your hands yeah that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
their games raise your hands yeah that
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.710
their games raise your hands yeah that
makes sense because you're here today

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720
makes sense because you're here today
 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.720
makes sense because you're here today
and the obvious follow-up question

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
and the obvious follow-up question
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.279
and the obvious follow-up question
should be how can you make more money

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
should be how can you make more money
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.310
should be how can you make more money
from your games

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320

strategy in your games and what can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
strategy in your games and what can
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679

gonna talk about why diversify

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

then I'm going to discuss different

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
then I'm going to discuss different
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.300
then I'm going to discuss different
trends on this topic and then we're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
trends on this topic and then we're
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830
trends on this topic and then we're
going to finish with gram gains on on

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
going to finish with gram gains on on
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450
going to finish with gram gains on on
stage we're going to share with us the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
stage we're going to share with us the
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.399
stage we're going to share with us the
journey of revenue diversification so

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409
journey of revenue diversification so
 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.940
journey of revenue diversification so
why diversify as Markowitz earn by

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
why diversify as Markowitz earn by
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.319
why diversify as Markowitz earn by
diversifying revenue streams you're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
diversifying revenue streams you're
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.580
diversifying revenue streams you're
actually decreasing the risk you have in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
actually decreasing the risk you have in
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770
actually decreasing the risk you have in
games but more than that you have more

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
games but more than that you have more
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780
games but more than that you have more
options to monetize your audience which

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
options to monetize your audience which
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.840
options to monetize your audience which
can create an uplift in revenue and now

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
can create an uplift in revenue and now
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760
can create an uplift in revenue and now
the reason is based on a Google Play

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
the reason is based on a Google Play
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.350
the reason is based on a Google Play
data and it's actually the first time we

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
data and it's actually the first time we
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420
data and it's actually the first time we
are showing that on stage so let's take

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
are showing that on stage so let's take
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910
are showing that on stage so let's take
a look what you see in the graph in the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
a look what you see in the graph in the
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.399
a look what you see in the graph in the
x-axis is the percentage of revenue

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
x-axis is the percentage of revenue
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649
x-axis is the percentage of revenue
coming from top 5% of spenders in the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
coming from top 5% of spenders in the
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.920
coming from top 5% of spenders in the
game what you see in the y-axis is the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
game what you see in the y-axis is the
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.529
game what you see in the y-axis is the
reactivation rate of trend buyers or how

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
reactivation rate of trend buyers or how
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.059
reactivation rate of trend buyers or how
likely is the game to get back churn

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
likely is the game to get back churn
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.730
likely is the game to get back churn
buyers

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
 
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.670
 
a picture that's a good one and what we

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
a picture that's a good one and what we
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440
a picture that's a good one and what we
found out in our data that we actually

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
found out in our data that we actually
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.820
found out in our data that we actually
have a correlation between the two

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
have a correlation between the two
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860
have a correlation between the two
things so if you look at the bottom

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
things so if you look at the bottom
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.900
things so if you look at the bottom
right corner you see that games that re

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
right corner you see that games that re
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.880
right corner you see that games that re
concentrating on revenue from a top 5%

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
concentrating on revenue from a top 5%
 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.400
concentrating on revenue from a top 5%
of spenders they have actually less

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
of spenders they have actually less
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.220
of spenders they have actually less
likely to get back to on buyers on the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
likely to get back to on buyers on the
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.810
likely to get back to on buyers on the
other hand if you look at the top left

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
other hand if you look at the top left
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.330
other hand if you look at the top left
corner on the star sign you see that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
corner on the star sign you see that
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.320
corner on the star sign you see that
games that are really good at getting

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
games that are really good at getting
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.660
games that are really good at getting
back to on buyers are less dependent on

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
back to on buyers are less dependent on
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.950
back to on buyers are less dependent on
the top 5% of spenders they have so what

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
the top 5% of spenders they have so what
 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.870
the top 5% of spenders they have so what
that means is that try to get one dollar

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
that means is that try to get one dollar
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.030
that means is that try to get one dollar
from a larger audience is actually most

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
from a larger audience is actually most
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
from a larger audience is actually most
of them when trying to get $100 from a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
of them when trying to get $100 from a
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.140
of them when trying to get $100 from a
high-value user so what trends do we see

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
high-value user so what trends do we see
 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.160
high-value user so what trends do we see
around monetization diversification

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170
around monetization diversification
 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.310
around monetization diversification

reason why we wanted to switch and we
 

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:50.799
reason why we wanted to switch and we
have reused unmerged mechanic that we

so that people actually have items that

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:03.589
so that people actually have items that
 

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:07.269
so that people actually have items that
they merged up and items that they

they merged up and items that they
 

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.879
they merged up and items that they
actually wanted to keep so this is then

turned into a higher retention higher

00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:12.499
turned into a higher retention higher
 

00:16:12.499 --> 00:16:15.269
turned into a higher retention higher
engagement higher our pool game

00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279
engagement higher our pool game
 

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:19.479
engagement higher our pool game
eventually and when did it happen the

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:19.489
eventually and when did it happen the
 

00:16:19.489 --> 00:16:22.269
eventually and when did it happen the
decision so this was around early last

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279
decision so this was around early last
 

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:25.769
decision so this was around early last
year this was around actually end of

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:25.779
year this was around actually end of
 

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:27.099
year this was around actually end of
2016

00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:27.109
2016
 

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:29.529
2016
probably so at that point we had three

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:29.539
probably so at that point we had three
 

00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.659
probably so at that point we had three
hyper casual games and we had realized

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:31.669
hyper casual games and we had realized
 

00:16:31.669 --> 00:16:33.369
hyper casual games and we had realized
that every new game actually boosted

00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:33.379
that every new game actually boosted
 

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:35.529
that every new game actually boosted
your revenue but the exponential growth

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:35.539
your revenue but the exponential growth
 

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:37.979
your revenue but the exponential growth
was not there it was almost more linear

00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:37.989
was not there it was almost more linear
 

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:40.389
was not there it was almost more linear
so what happened was we said to go to

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399
so what happened was we said to go to
 

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.460
so what happened was we said to go to
the next stage - we need to have a game

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.470
the next stage - we need to have a game
 

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.889
the next stage - we need to have a game
on top grossing charge we need to have a

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:44.899
on top grossing charge we need to have a
 

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:47.590
on top grossing charge we need to have a
game that has stable number of DEA you

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600
game that has stable number of DEA you
 

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.539
game that has stable number of DEA you
people that you acquire stick with you

00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:49.549
people that you acquire stick with you
 

00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:51.519
people that you acquire stick with you
it's not like the leaky bucket example

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:51.529
it's not like the leaky bucket example
 

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:52.779
it's not like the leaky bucket example
like people actually go air and then

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:52.789
like people actually go air and then
 

00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:53.439
like people actually go air and then
they leave

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:53.449
they leave
 

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:55.299
they leave
if we wanted the more longer-term

00:16:55.299 --> 00:16:55.309
if we wanted the more longer-term
 

00:16:55.309 --> 00:17:00.090
if we wanted the more longer-term
engagement with them and then we have

rewarded video what we did was we kept a

00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399
rewarded video what we did was we kept a
 

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:48.669
rewarded video what we did was we kept a
number of videos that people can watch

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679
number of videos that people can watch
 

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:51.789
number of videos that people can watch
and only kept it I think at to four

00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799
and only kept it I think at to four
 

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:54.820
and only kept it I think at to four
players that's why for us and we could

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:54.830
players that's why for us and we could
 

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.230
players that's why for us and we could
see the revenues and it actually added

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240
see the revenues and it actually added
 

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.149
see the revenues and it actually added
like an incremental benefit to the time

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159
like an incremental benefit to the time
 

00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.850
like an incremental benefit to the time
where we had videos to the time we did

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:00.860
where we had videos to the time we did
 

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.879
where we had videos to the time we did
not have versus the time where we had

00:27:02.879 --> 00:27:02.889
not have versus the time where we had
 

00:27:02.889 --> 00:27:06.490
not have versus the time where we had
and I think it's a choice really like it

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:06.500
and I think it's a choice really like it
 

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.990

collect extensive information from our
 

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.919
collect extensive information from our
players but based on I think where we

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:08.929
players but based on I think where we
 

00:28:08.929 --> 00:28:10.899

female
 

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:21.549
female
it's and we don't do anything specific

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559
it's and we don't do anything specific
 

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:24.220
it's and we don't do anything specific
about this like I think based on our

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.230
about this like I think based on our
 

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.840
about this like I think based on our
current marketing and currently

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:25.850
current marketing and currently
 

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.600
current marketing and currently
optimized what we think is optimized

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.610
optimized what we think is optimized
 

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.760
optimized what we think is optimized
marketing that this is the audience that

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:30.770
marketing that this is the audience that
 

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.399
marketing that this is the audience that
we ended up with so it's accused female

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:32.409
we ended up with so it's accused female
 

00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:34.899
we ended up with so it's accused female
and the second question was I think how

00:28:34.899 --> 00:28:34.909
and the second question was I think how
 

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:39.100
and the second question was I think how
do we choose how we split like how do we

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.110
do we choose how we split like how do we
 

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.880
do we choose how we split like how do we
see as versus IPs how do you see the

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:42.890
see as versus IPs how do you see the
 

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.919
see as versus IPs how do you see the
impact of change in the game yeah yeah

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:44.929
impact of change in the game yeah yeah
 

00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:47.980
impact of change in the game yeah yeah
so it's when we generally add the new

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:47.990
so it's when we generally add the new
 

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.110
so it's when we generally add the new
feature we leave around like a month or

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120
feature we leave around like a month or
 

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.860
feature we leave around like a month or
long longer testing periods it's harder

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:53.870
long longer testing periods it's harder
 

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.080
long longer testing periods it's harder
to do they beat estimates because ads

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.090
to do they beat estimates because ads
 

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.909
to do they beat estimates because ads
again like many things change and it's

00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919
again like many things change and it's
 

00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:00.130
again like many things change and it's
I'd like what we're lucky with is that

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.140
I'd like what we're lucky with is that
 

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.470
I'd like what we're lucky with is that
we have eight other ad based games so we

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480
we have eight other ad based games so we
 

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.570
we have eight other ad based games so we
can also compare the ad revenue to CPMs

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580
can also compare the ad revenue to CPMs
 

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.220
can also compare the ad revenue to CPMs
between those games and this game like

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:06.230
between those games and this game like
 

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.070
between those games and this game like
is it really change when we change

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080
is it really change when we change

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.220
generally easier to see like at a per
 

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.890
generally easier to see like at a per
player where they're at in the game you

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:17.900
player where they're at in the game you
 

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.730
player where they're at in the game you
could see like if it's something

increases or decreases you can track it

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:21.350
increases or decreases you can track it
 

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.960

more effectively but ads you have to

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:22.970
more effectively but ads you have to
 

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:28.060
more effectively but ads you have to
