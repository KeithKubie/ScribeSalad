00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:04.102
- [Voiceover] "On circle O
below", so this is circle O,

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:06.227
"segment SE is a diameter."

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.392
So this is SE, let me color that in.

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:12.757
So this is a diameter, that's
what they're telling us.

00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:14.175
And they say, "What is the measure of

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.423
"angle ISE?"

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:19.151
So what we care about, the measure of

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.521
angle ISE.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.889
I, S, E.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.107
So we're trying to figure out this angle

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:26.163
right over there.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:27.870
Now like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.551
and see if you can work
through it yourself.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.629
So there's a bunch of
ways that we can actually

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.707
tackle this problem.

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:37.122
The first one that jumps out at me is

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.165
there's a bunch of
triangles here, and we can

00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:42.787
use the fact that the
angles, interior angles

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.283
of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:48.267
So we could look at this
triangle right over here.

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.263
And so we know one of the angles already.

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:53.688
We know this angle has a
measurement of 27 degrees.

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:56.207
If we could figure out
this angle right over here,

00:00:56.207 --> 00:01:00.526
this would be angle
SIE, then if we know two

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:03.012
interior angles of a triangle, we can

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:04.649
figure out the third.

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.178
And this one, SIE, we can figure it out

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:12.300
because it's supplementary
to this 61-degree angle.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.922
So this angle right over
here is just going to be

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.058
this angle plus the 61-degree angle

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.925
is going to be equal to 180 degrees,

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:23.038
because they are supplementary.

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:25.197
Or we could say that this angle over here

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.856
is going to be 180 minus 61.

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:29.342
So what is that going to be?

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.164
180 minus 60 would be 120,

00:01:31.164 --> 00:01:34.217
and then minus one gives us 119.

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:37.040
119 degrees.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.593
And so this angle that we
are trying to figure out,

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:43.657
this angle plus the 119 degrees, plus

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:45.573
the 27 degrees, is going to be equal to

00:01:45.573 --> 00:01:47.233
180 degrees.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.694
Or we could say this angle is going to be

00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:53.397
180 minus 119,

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:55.475
minus 27.

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:57.797
Which is going to be equal to,

00:01:57.797 --> 00:02:01.489
so let's see, 180 minus 119

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.239
is 61.

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.116
And then 61 minus 27

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.250
is going to be 34.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.307
So there you have it.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:17.591
The measure of angle ISE is 34 degrees.

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.390
Now I mentioned that
there is multiple ways

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.353
that we could figure this out.

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:21.793
Let me do it one more way.

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.708
So let me unwind everything that I

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.428
just wrote.

00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:25.496
We already figured out the answer,

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:26.471
but I want to show you that there's

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:30.372
multiple ways that we can tackle this.

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:31.986
So ISE is still the thing that we

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:32.833
want to figure out.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.307
Another way that we could approach it

00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:38.034
is we know we have some angles

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:40.274
inscribed angles on this circle,

00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:42.585
and we know that if an inscribed angle

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:45.533
intercepts a diameter,
then it's going to be

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.306
a right angle.

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:48.267
It's going to be a 90 degree angle.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.868
So this angle right over here is

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.499
a 90 degree angle.

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.960
And we can use that information to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.038
figure out this angle,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:58.907
and we can also use that information

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:03.005
if we look at this triangle,

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.802
we could use 90 plus 61 plus this angle

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:09.878
is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.385
So this angle right over here, another way

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:15.915
to think about it, it's
going to be 180 minus 90

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:17.621
minus 61.

00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:21.301
Which is equal to, 180 minus 90 is 90,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.459
minus 61 is 29 degrees.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.538
So this one right over here is 29 degrees.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:32.751
And then we could look
at this larger triangle.

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:38.069
To figure out this entire angle.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:41.940
If we know this entire
angle, you subtract 29

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.738
then you figure out angle ISE.

00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:47.861
And so this large, or what I've depicted,

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.506
this kind of magenta
measure right over here

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:54.559
of that angle, plus 90 degrees,

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.647
plus 27 degrees, is
going to be equal to 180

00:03:57.647 --> 00:04:02.024
because they're the interior
angles of triangle SLE.

00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:05.518
So this angle right
over here is going to be

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:09.302
180 minus 61

00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:11.543
minus 27.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.675
Sorry, not minus 61, minus 90.

00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:19.508
It's 180 minus 90, minus 27

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:21.168
is going to give us this
angle right over here

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:23.572
because the three angles add up to 180.

00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:27.588
So minus 90, minus 27.

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:31.326
Which is equal to, so 180 minus 90 is 90.

00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:34.056
90 minus 27

00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:37.753
is 63.

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.448
63 degrees.

00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:43.569
So this large one over here is 63 degrees,

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.926
and then the smaller one is 29 degrees.

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:49.594
And so angle ISE, which
we set out to figure out,

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:53.380
is going to be 63 degrees
minus the 29 degrees.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.163
So 63 minus 29 is once again

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.554
equal to 34 degrees.

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:03.027
So the way I did it just
now, a little bit harder.

00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:05.023
It really depends what jumps out at you.

00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:07.833
The first way I tackled it,
it does seem a little bit

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.354
easier, a little bit clearer.

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:10.747
But it's good to see
these different things.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:13.243
And at least here, we used this idea

00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:17.108
of an inscribed angle that
intercepts a diameter.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.664
And if you say, "Hey, how do we know?"

00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:20.429
Well, we've proven in other videos,

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.577
but it comes straight out of the idea that

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:26.305
the measure of an inscribed angle

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:29.357
is going to be half of
the measure of the arc

00:05:29.357 --> 00:05:30.727
that it intercepts.

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:33.525
And notice, it's intercepting an arc

00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:36.485
that has a measure of 180 degrees.

00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:38.389
It's intercepting an arc that has

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.304
a measure of 180 degrees.

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:42.220
And so this angle's
going to be half of that

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.203
since it's an inscribed
angle, not a central angle.

00:05:45.203 --> 00:05:47.497
So it's going to be a 90 degree angle.
