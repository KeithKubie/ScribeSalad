00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.180
We’ve been talking a lot about the science
of how things move -- you throw a ball in the air,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.000
and there are ways to predict exactly how it will fall.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.630
But there’s something we’ve been leaving
out: forces, and why they make things accelerate.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.560
And for that, we’re going to turn to a physicist
you’ve probably heard of: Isaac Newton.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.860
With his three laws, published in 1687 in his book
Principia, Newton outlined his understanding of motion

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.020
-- and a lot of his ideas were
totally new.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.190
Today, more than 300 years later, if you’re
trying to describe the effects of forces on

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.059
just about any everyday object -- a box on
the ground, a reindeer pulling a sleigh, or

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.159
an elevator taking you up to your apartment
-- then you’re going to want to use Newton’s Laws.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.340
And yes. I’ll explain the reindeer thing
in a minute.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:54.060
[Theme Music]

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.679
Newton’s first law is all about inertia,
which is basically an object’s tendency

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.199
to keep doing what it’s doing.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.720
It’s often stated as: “An object in motion
will remain in motion, and an object at rest

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.549
will remain at rest, unless acted upon by
a force.”

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.799
Which is just another way of saying that,
to change the way something moves -- to give

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.860
it ACCELERATION -- you need a net force.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.360
So, how do we measure inertia?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.610
Well, the most important thing to know is
mass. Say you have two balls that are the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.579
same size, but one is an inflatable beach
ball and the other is a bowling ball.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.820
The bowling ball is going to be harder to
move, and harder to stop once it’s moving.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.579
It has more inertia because it has more mass.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.310
Makes sense, right? More mass means more STUFF,
with a tendency to keep doing what it was

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.119
doing before your force came along, and interrupted
it.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.950
And this idea connects nicely to Newton’s
second law: net force is equal to mass x acceleration.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.520
Or, as an equation, F(net) = ma.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.579
It’s important to remember that we’re
talking about NET force here -- the amount

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.099
of force left over, once you’ve added together
all the forces that might cancel each other out.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.200
Let's say you have a hockey puck sitting on a perfectly
frictionless ice rink. And I know ice isn’t

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.359
perfectly frictionless but stick with it.
If you’re pushing the puck along with

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.319
a stick, that’s a force on it - that
isn’t being canceled out by anything else.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.639
So the puck is experiencing acceleration.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.540
But when the puck is just sitting still, or
even when it’s sliding across the ice after

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.180
you’ve pushed it, then all the forces are
balanced out.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.930
That’s what’s known as equilibrium.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.010
An object that’s in equilibrium can still be MOVING, like the sliding puck, but its VELOCITY won’t be changing.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.120
It’s when the forces get UNbalanced, that
you start to see the exciting stuff happen.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.080
And probably the most common case of a net
force making something move is the gravitational force.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.909
Say you throw a 5 kg ball straight up in the
air -- and then, yknow, get out of the way,

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.400
because that could really hurt if it hits
you...

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.840
But the force of gravity is pulling down on the ball, which is accelerating downward at a rate of 9.81 m/s^2.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.300
So the net force is equal to m a, but the
only force acting here is gravity.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.440
This means that, if we could measure the acceleration of the ball, we’d be able to calculate the force of gravity.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.280
And we CAN measure the acceleration -- it’s
9.81 m/s^2, the value we’ve been calling small g.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.420
So the force of gravity on the ball must be 5 kg,
which is the mass of the ball… times small g

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.100
which comes to 49.05 kilograms
times meters per second squared!

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.690
We use this equation for gravity so much
that it’s often just written as F(g) = mg.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.170
That’s how you determine the force of
gravity, otherwise known as weight.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.900
Now, those units can be a bit of a mouthful,
so we just call them Newtons.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.940
That’s right! We measure weight in Newtons,
in honor of Sir Isaac, and NOT kilograms!

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.820
Kilograms are a measure of mass!

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.330
But gravity often isn’t the only force
acting on the object.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.240
So when we’re trying to calculate a NET force, we usually have to take into account more than just gravity.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.000
This is where we get into one of the forces that tends to show up a lot, which is explained by Newton’s third law.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.299
You probably know this law as “for every
action, there’s an equal but opposite reaction.”

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.659
Which just means that if you exert a force
on an object, it exerts an equal force back on you.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.629
And that’s what we call the normal force.

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.840
“Normal” in this instance means “perpendicular”,
and the normal force is always perpendicular

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.260
to whatever surface your object is resting
on.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.340
At least, it is when you're pushing on something
big, and macroscopic, like a table.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.920
If you put a book down on a table, the normal
force is pushing -- and therefore pointing -- up.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.800
But if you put it on a ramp, then the normal
force is pointing perpendicular to the ramp.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.940
Now, the normal force isn’t like most other forces.
It’s special, because it changes its magnitude.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320
Say you have a piece of aluminum foil stretched
tightly across the top of a bowl, and then

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.790
you put one lonely grape on top of it.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.210
Because of gravity, that grape is exerting
a little bit of force on the foil, and the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.030
normal force pushes right back, with the same
amount.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.750
But then you add another grape, which doubles the force on the foil -- in that case, the normal force doubles too.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.020
That’ll keep happening until eventually
you add enough grapes that they break through the foil.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.270
That’s what happens when the normal force
can’t match the force pushing against it.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.330
But, what does Newton’s famous third law
really mean, though?

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.650
When I push on this desk with my finger
right now, I’m applying a force to it.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.000
And it’s applying an equal force right back on my finger
-- one that I can actually feel.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.970
But if that’s true -- and it is -- then
why are we able to move things?

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.810
How can I pick up this mug?
Or how can a reindeer pull a sleigh?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.080
Basically, things can move because there’s
more going on, than just the action and reaction forces.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.720
For example, when a reindeer pulls on a sleigh,
Newton’s third law tells us that the sleigh

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.890
is pulling back on it with equal force.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.070
But the reindeer can still move the sleigh
forward, because it’s standing on the ground.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.480
When it takes a step, it’s pushing backward on the ground with its foot -- &amp; the ground is pushing it forward.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.520
Meanwhile, the reindeer is also pulling on
the sleigh, while the sleigh is pulling right back.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.820
But the force from the GROUND PUSHING
the reindeer forward is STRONGER than the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.140
force from the sleigh pulling it back. So
the animal accelerates forward, and so does the sleigh.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.830
So, one takeaway here is that: there would
be no Christmas without physics!

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.880
But, now that we have an idea of some of the
forces we might encounter, let’s describe

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.130
what’s happening when a box is sitting on
the ground.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.430
The first thing to do -- which is the first
thing you should ALWAYS do when you’re solving

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.890
a problem like this -- is draw what’s known
as a free body diagram.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.910
Basically, you draw a rough outline of the
object, put a dot in the middle, and then

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.070
draw and label arrows, to represent all the
forces.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.920
We also have to decide which direction is
positive -- in this case, we’ll choose up to be positive.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.150
For our box, the free body diagram is pretty
simple. There’s an arrow pointing down,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.160
representing the force of gravity, and an
arrow pointing up, representing the force

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.050
of the ground pushing back on the box.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.450
Since the box is staying still, we know that
it’s not accelerating, which tells us that

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.760
those forces are equal, so the net force is
equal to 0.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.670
But what if you attach a rope to the top of
the box, then connect it to the ceiling so

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.230
the box is suspended in the air?

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.570
Your net force is still 0, because there’s
no acceleration on the box. And gravity is

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.940
still pulling down in the same way it was
before.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.900
But now, the counteracting upward force comes from the rope acting on the box, in what we call the tension force.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.340
To make our examples simpler, we almost always
assume that ropes have no mass and are completely

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.360
unbreakable -- no matter how much you pull
on them, they’ll pull right back.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.190
Which means that the tension force isn’t
fixed. If the box weighs 5 Newtons, then the

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.250
tension in the rope is also 5 Newtons. But
if we add another 5 Newtons of weight, the

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.390
tension in the rope will become 10 Newtons.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.800
Kind of like how the normal force changes,
with the grapes on the foil. But in this case,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.670
it's in response to a pulling force instead
of a push.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.000
The key is that no matter what, you can add
the forces together to give you a particular

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
net force -- even though that net force might
NOT always be 0. Like, in an elevator.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.450
So let’s say you’re in an elevator -- or
as I call them, a lift.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.880
The total mass of the lift, including you,
is 1000 kg. And its movement is controlled

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.990
by a counterweight, attached to a pulley.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:52.090
The plan is to set up a counterweight of 850kg,
and then let the lift go. Once you let go,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.090
the lift is going to start accelerating downward
- because it’s HEAVIER than the counterweight.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.780
And the hope is that the counterweight will
keep it from accelerating TOO much.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.370
But how will we know if it’s safe? How quickly
is the lift going to accelerate downward?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:10.240
To find out, first let’s draw a free body
diagram for the lift, making UP the positive direction.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.180
The force of gravity on the lift is pulling it down, and it’s equal to the mass of the lift x small g --

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.000
9810 Newtons of force, in
the negative direction.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.180
And the force of tension is pulling the lift UP, in the positive direction.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.640
Which means that for the lift, the net force is equal to the tension force, minus the mass of the lift x small g.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.250
Now! Since Newton’s first law tells us that
F(net) = ma, we can set all of that to be

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:43.440
equal to the lift’s mass, times some downward
acceleration, -a. That’s what we’re trying to solve for.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.720
So, let’s do the same thing for the counterweight.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:52.840
Gravity is pulling it down with 8338.5 N
of force in the negative direction.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.480
And again, the force of tension is pulling
it up, so that the net force is equal to the

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.620
tension force, minus the mass of the counterweight
times small g.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.790
And again, because of Newton’s second law,
we know that all of that is equal to the mass

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.950
of the counterweight, times that same acceleration,
“a” -- which is positive this time since

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.860
the counterweight is moving upward.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.820
So! Putting that all together, we end up with
two equations -- and two unknowns.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.840
We don’t have a value for the tension force,
and we don’t have a value for acceleration.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.180
But what we’re trying to solve for is the
acceleration. So we use algebra to do that.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.700
When you have a system of equations like this,
you can add or subtract all the terms on each

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.760
side of the equals sign, to turn them into
one equation.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.710
For example, if you know that 1 + 2 = 3 and
that 4 + 2 = 6, you can subtract the first

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.560
equation from the second to get 3 = 3.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.080
And in our case, with the lift, subtracting
the first equation from the second gets rid

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.230
of the term that represents the tension force.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:56.450
We now just have to solve for acceleration -- meaning, we need to rearrange the equation to set everything equal to “a.”

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.300
We end up with an equation that really just
says that “a” is equal to the difference

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.250
between the weights -- or the net force on
the system -- divided by the total mass.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.190
Essentially, this is just a fancier version of F(net) = ma.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.780
And we can solve that for “a”,
which turns out to be 0.795 m/s^2.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.940
Which is not that much acceleration at all!

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.840
So, as long as you aren’t dropping too far
down, you should be fine.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.500
Even if the landing is a little bumpy.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.780
In this episode, you learned about Newton’s
three laws of motion: how inertia works, that

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.770
net force is equal to mass x acceleration,
how physicists define equilibrium, and all

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.070
about the “normal” force and the “tension”
force.
