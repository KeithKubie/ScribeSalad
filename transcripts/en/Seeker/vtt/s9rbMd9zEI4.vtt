00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.799
Everyone’s talking about this crazy new
hoverboard that looks too good to be true.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.000
And it sort of is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.470
But trust me, the truth is super cool!

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.470
That was a pun.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.610
You’ll get it once I explain how- y’know
what, just roll the intro.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.440
Hey McFly guys and girls, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.780
It’s 2015, the year Marty went re-back to
the future, and Lexus has teased us all with

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.360
a short video of a functioning hoverboard
being ridden around a skatepark.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.360
Is it real?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360
Is it possible?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.590
Yes and qualified yes.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.590
I’ll explain:

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.449
What’s not shown in the video is the hidden
magnetic track Lexus installed in the Barcelona

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:37.449
skate park.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.489
That may seem like cheating, but it’s more
complicated than just using magnets.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.170
If you’ve ever played with magnets and tried
to levitate one above the other, you know

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.170
it’s not easy.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.829
As soon as you let go, the magnet will just
flip around and get sucked to the other one

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.270
and that’s really the opposite of what you
want.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.789
But that problem doesn’t exist with some
superconductors.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.160
A superconductor is a material that, when
cooled past a critical temperature, lets electrons

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.019
move freely within it with zero resistance.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.010
Obviously this makes them great for high current
wires, but the freely moving electrons do

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.260
something else too.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.290
They create currents on the surface that screen
the superconductor from magnetic fields.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.260
As you cool a superconductor past its critical
temperature it expels magnetic fields, and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.800
this is called the Meissner effect.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.610
If you put a superconductor by a magnet, it
will repel it.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.650
Put one above the other, and it’ll levitate.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.740
This is called Quantum Levitation.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890
But not all superconductors are created equal.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.970
Some, called Type-II superconductors, actually
have little vortices of current and the center

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.400
of each vortex is like an eye of a storm.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.700
In the middle, the material behaves normally
and lets some magnetic field lines, or flux,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
pass through.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.620
When I say “some” I should note it’s
still quite a lot.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.390
A 3 inch disk can have as many as 100 billion
flux lines passing through it.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
The superconductor will actually pin the flux
lines and will appear to lock itself in place

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.360
levitating above a normal magnet.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080
So they don’t just exhibit Quantum Levitation,
but Quantum Locking too.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.640
No, not like the weeping angels, Whovians.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.301
Anyway, you can move the magnet around, even
put the superconductor underneath it, and

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:03.570
it will still stay locked where it was.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.319
Plus with all those flux lines pinned down,
a 3 inch disk just half a micron thick can

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.510
support 70 thousand times its own weight.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.800
So it locks in place above a normal magnet,
but if the superconductor is above a circular

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.739
magnet, it can rotate around the axis of the
magnet.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.200
You can expand that circular magnet to a track
any size and shape you want and, say, hide

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.239
it under a skate park.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.769
Put a Type-II superconductor above it, give
it a little push, and it can happily zoom

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.590
around the track no problem.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.840
Mind you, there are limitations.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.540
The superconductor has to be cold.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.799
Like, really really cold.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.629
Even so-called “High Temperature” superconductors
need to be at least -135 degrees celsius.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.319
To hit those temperatures you need to use
liquid nitrogen, which explains the thin wisps

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.989
of smoke and frost coming from Lexus’ hoverboard.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.439
The superconductor also has to be thin, because
the thinner it is the stronger the flux-pinning

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.439
effect.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.290
And the magnetic field can’t be too dense.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.569
Too much flux per meter squared and the vortexes
overwhelm the material, turning it back into

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.180
a not-so-superconductor.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.529
By the way, the unit for magnetic flux density
is the Tesla.

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.379
that’s right, Tesla has his own unit of
measurement.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.330
I thought you’d like that, internet.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.640
Type-II superconductors were discovered in
1935, 20 years before the first Back to the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.109
Future took place.

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.870
But Robert Zemeckis wasn’t around then to
show us the way, and now in 2015 his vision

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.310
is finally realized.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.700
So long as you keep your super thin superconductor
supercooled, you too can have a hoverboard.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.890
Provided you don’t mind going around in
circles on a magnetic track.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.150
Which would still be really cool, but wouldn’t
help you if you’re trying to get away from

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.890
Biff’s larcenous grandson.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.750
Magnetic levitation can be scaled up too and
because the only friction is from air, that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.169
means you can get going pretty fast.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:58.250
Trace talks about maglev trains here.
