00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.910
Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.100
Welcome to our session.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.350
We're going to go
ahead and get started.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.940
Please go ahead and find a seat.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.840
We're going to be spending much
of our hour in small groups.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.670
And that's why the tables
have numbers on them.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.780
So we have a pretty
packed hour ahead of us.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.550
So a key challenge
for the three of us

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
that are presenting this session
is to stick to our script,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.910
and to manage, not only
our time, but your time.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.751
So please note that the
session is being recorded.

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.500
And that's why we're
using the microphones

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.380
even though we don't really need
them for a room of this size.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.010
So we're very
excited that you've

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.910
joined us to learn a
little bit about what's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.110
happening beyond Harvard.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.770
I'm going to kick us off with
introductions and a session

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.940
outline.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.570
Allison is going to lead the
small group analysis of models

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.660
from other colleges
and universities.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
I'll facilitate the reports
back from each small group.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.930
And then Kris will provide
some concluding remarks.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.690
First, some introductions.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
Kris Markman is Director
of Digital Learning

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.710
and User Experience at
the Harvard Library.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.830
In addition to the details
in the conference program,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.560
I wanted to mention her
teaching experiences

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.190
at the University of Memphis and
the University of Texas-Austin.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.210
Allison Pingree is Director
of Professional Pedagogy

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.100
at the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.950
She has provided pedagogical
support to faculty

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.660
there for several years.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.470
Her connections across
the national POD network

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.250
were essential for our
preparation for this session.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.480
I'm Anu Vedantham.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.880
I'm the Director of Learning
and Teaching Services

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.980
for the FAS Libraries.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.990
I joined Harvard a year ago.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.350
And my work for a decade each at
the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.650
and Stockton University have
informed my contributions

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.340
to this session.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.690
So the HILT Conference explores
many exciting activities

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.730
across the Harvard landscape.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.370
Our session looks
outside Harvard,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.110
which is a very big place.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.470
And trying to summarize it in
an hour will be interesting.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.810
So we examine the
question, how do

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.130
other universities and colleges
handle teaching evaluations?

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.490
We noted that the instruments
in use across the nation

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.420
can be very blunt, or they
can be overly complex.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.800
Some practices include homegrown
surveys, national instruments

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.680
such as the IDEA, focus groups,
interviews, peer observation,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.850
faculty self-evaluation,
inter-faculty sharing,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.170
narrative analysis, and
student-led crowdsourcing.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.810
So what are some good
practices happening elsewhere

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.760
that could inform our work here?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.810
I'll start by noting that the
topic of teaching evaluations

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.180
is universally
fraught with anxiety.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.140
So we corresponded with
colleagues at several levels

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.420
in a variety of institutions.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.510
In our conversations
we heard frustration.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.420
We heard nervousness
about numbers.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.430
And several
institutions discussed

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.090
how they have recently changed
their measurement instruments.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.030
So evaluations of
teaching are not static.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.130
And institutions
continuously review

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.650
and adjust the
instruments that they use,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.140
and also how they
interpret the results.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.850
What you are hearing today is
an analysis for September 2017.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.200
And next year there
will be changes ahead.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.370
So just to say that this
is as a moment in time.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.580
In addition to the
formative impact where

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.550
teaching evaluations data
informs changes in teaching

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.210
practice, we also heard
about summative consequences

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.600
for re-appointment, for
tenure, and for promotion.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.020
We also heard about the
consequences of evaluated data

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.230
for students making course
selection decisions.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.980
And this was a topic that
caused anxiety and controversy,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.390
and one where the
perspectives of faculty,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.060
academic administrators, and
students were pretty divergent.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.020
We heard concerns about who
has access to what data at what

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.420
time, and how
misunderstanding of data

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.520
can really lead to
some bad decisions.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.010
So we'll start by
noting that there

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.740
is a vast amount of
literature in the education

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.329
field on this topic.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.209
There is debate about the
validity, the utility,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.140
and the advisability of various
teaching evaluation mechanisms

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.360
that are used for
summative purposes.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.090
The end-of-course student
ratings of instruction

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.700
are especially a
point of contention.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.370
We will not engage explicitly
with this literature,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.060
because we do not have the
time to do it justice here.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.160
We welcome you to
follow up with us

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.000
if this topic is of interest.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.440
And we can provide some
annotated bibliographies.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.040
Because there
really is a lot that

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.720
has been written on the topic.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.700
Today, instead, we
are going to ask

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.780
you to engage in close reading
of a few selected instruments.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.030
We're not endorsing
these instruments.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.160
We offer them to
you as raw material

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.260
for your own reflection.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.680
These are examples and artifacts
that may inform our work here

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.550
at Harvard.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.150
A few common questions did
emerge from our conversations

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.520
with colleagues of the
different institutions.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.710
Who gets to see the data?

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.750
Do administrators see that data?

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.290
Do they compare numbers across
faculty, across disciplines,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.240
and across institutions?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.540
Do students get to analyze
the data to make course choice

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.530
decisions?

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.620
And how do stakeholders
express frustration

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.600
with the instruments?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.980
So just some questions
to keep in mind.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.562
I'm going to hand
it over to Allison

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:33.520
who's going to guide us
through our small group

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.680
analysis of specific
instruments.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.180
Great.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.920
Thank you, Anu.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.690
Wonderful to see you all.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.110
At your tables, you have
two sets of documents.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.750
You have a worksheet
in a paper clip.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.780
If you'll take that paper
clip off and pass around

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.382
the worksheets to
everyone, one copy

00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:53.590
for each person at the table.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050
As you can see from
that worksheet,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.500
we're going to be spending
time looking closely, as Anu

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.440
mentioned, at some artifacts.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.710
Each table has a
different institution

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.340
from whose collection
of materials

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.820
we have shared with
you a few bits of--

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.660
a few artifacts related
to evaluation of teaching

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.950
for summative purposes.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.050
So clarification
about our focus here.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.220
We're not diving into
teaching evaluation

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.170
for formative purposes.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.920
This is higher stakes, decisions
about promotion and tenure,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.060
student course selection.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.180
There's a lot to be said
about formative feedback.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.940
That's not our focus.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.090
What we're going to invite you
to do in a moment is to open

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.430
the envelope that's
at your table,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:53.150
and to take a look at-- before
you do, look with me at the--

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.380
I shouldn't have said that.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.610
That's just baiting you.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.490
So looking at the
worksheet, you'll

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.050
see there are four
questions there

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.340
for individual reflection.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.070
So we're going to ask you
to take five minutes each.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.920
Take five minutes to look
at what's in the envelope.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.510
And think about those
four questions, about--

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.500
with this artifact,
with this instrument

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.480
or with this approach,
what kind of information,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.620
what kind of data, from whom,
is this approach engaging?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.020
What kinds of things does
this model or approach

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.690
assume that good
teaching looks like?

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.977
What kinds of institutional
values or assumptions

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:31.810
are being made here?

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.870
And what questions does
this model or approach

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.320
raise for you?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.970
Then, in groups, you'll
talk about, in general,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.780
the pros and cons of
this instrument or model.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.480
Please appoint a note
taker and a reporter,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.850
so that when we have
our lightning round

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.670
report-outs of two
minutes each, someone

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.220
is prepared to stand
up and say, here's

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.030
what we saw as the pros and
cons of this model or approach.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.720
As each table is talking
about their approach or model,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.550
Kris will be showing those
models on the document camera

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.250
up on the screen.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.330
We also have put together the
complete collection of models

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.460
as a PDF at a Bitly link.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.370
And that way all
of you have access

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.660
to all the materials that
we got for this session,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.970
rather than making copies
of every instrument

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.350
for every person to look at.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.420
Not a good use of paper.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.930
So essentially your task now
is five minutes of individual

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.600
reading, and
thinking, and writing,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.620
15 minutes of
discussion at table

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.480
to prepare for
two-minute report-outs

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.450
on the questions
on the worksheet.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.500
Any questions from
you at this point?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.510
You'll see in your envelopes
what your objects of study are.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.420
Go ahead and open.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.710
On your marks, get set, go.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.640
OK.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.890
Because time is
tight, we're going

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.160
to encourage you as
provisionally as you've

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.830
been able to glance
at the documents

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.219
and start to make
sense of them--

00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:13.510
there's a lot more you could
do with that individually.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.050
But let's encourage you, now, to
start to talk as a group about,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.104
in general, what
did you notice here?

00:09:20.104 --> 00:09:21.520
What are the things
that you think

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.324
are particularly strong or
useful about this approach?

00:09:25.324 --> 00:09:26.740
What are the things
that you think

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.620
are drawbacks, or questions,
puzzlements that you have?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.120
So kind of pro-con.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.520
And again, if you'll
appoint someone

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.540
to take notes and be
prepared to report out,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.010
you can see the strengths and
drawbacks area of the worksheet

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.150
now to be focusing on.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.470
So go ahead and start
talking as a group.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.140
We're going to wrap up
the group conversations.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.000
Finish whatever
thought you're on.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.200
Please raise your hand if you
are the designated reporter.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.950
You're going to be
prepared to speak.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.400
Just raise your hand so we
make sure everybody knows

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.870
what's happening.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.640
Who's going to
report out over here?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.230
Over here?

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.100
Yeah.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.850
Got it.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.990
Great.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.900
We are so eager to hear what
you guys have come up with.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.570
And I'm sure you're eager to
hear about the other tables

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.650
and models.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.270
As I said, all of the models
are available on the Bitly link

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.360
that we've projected,
and we'll project again.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.290
For the time that we'll be
analyzing a specific model,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.234
Kris is going to show a portion
of it on the document camera.

00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:34.650
But there's a lot
more information

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.480
that we won't be able
to show at a glance.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.690
So you'll be able to look
at that later in the Bitly.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.040
OK, lightning round.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.737
I'm going to be timing.

00:10:42.737 --> 00:10:44.070
Anu is going to be facilitating.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.720
So I'm going to
come table to table.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.830
Two minutes per table.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.320
So we're going to
go ahead and start.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.370
We have a very strict timeline.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.520
So in addition to
managing my own time,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.140
I get to manage yours.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.690
So we're going to start
with table one, which

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.340
is in the far back.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.970
As we take on each instrument,
Kris will pull the instrument

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.766
up on the document camera.

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:10.140
And just to note that you have
full access to all of them

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.120
later, in case you
really want to geek out

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.340
on different types of surveys.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.780
Allison is going
to use an iPhone

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.490
timer set at two minutes.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.360
So when it makes a loud sound,
then that is time to wrap up.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.670
Our first model is
Stanford University,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.560
table one in the far back.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.757
Tamara is our spokesperson.

00:11:27.757 --> 00:11:29.340
OK, so the first
thing to know on this

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.940
is that the first question is
a customizable question based

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.200
on learning goals.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.640
And we both thought
that this is fantastic.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.300
It emphasizes what
the instructor

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.530
thinks is most important.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.395
And it indicates a strong
commitment to student learning.

00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:46.020
And that commitment
to student learning

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.699
is echoed in multiple questions.

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:51.240
However, we also felt that there
are some potential drawbacks

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.400
to both starting with
the learning goals

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.770
and having this be
open-ended, in that,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.770
what if the learning goals
aren't well designed?

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.600
What if an instructor
puts in learning

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.974
goals that are just easy to
reach for the sake of getting

00:12:02.974 --> 00:12:03.690
good feedback?

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.630
So we had a lot of questions
about how that actually works.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.852
We think it's fantastic
that this survey has a lot

00:12:10.852 --> 00:12:13.650
of customizable questions,
realizing that there's not just

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.969
one-size-fits-all for
teaching and learning.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.510
And it also seemed
like the interface

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.190
would be easy to use on the
side of the faculty member who

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.970
needs to do that customizing.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.690
There are a number of
formative questions

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.300
that will give the instructor
some feedback about how

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.130
they can improve their course.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.400
But on that note, we
thought that there

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.210
could be more specific
open-ended questions about ways

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.010
to improve.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.590
We noted that there
was no feedback

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.294
about individual instructors.

00:12:47.294 --> 00:12:50.229
Let's see.

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:51.270
There were some kind of--

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.440
there was clearly an emphasis
on online education here.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.120
And that there is
a question about,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.610
what percentage of the class
meetings do you attend online?

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.026
But we thought
that question could

00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:04.520
be challenging to interpret.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:11.090
And we would appreciate a
question about prior knowledge.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.740
What did students
bring into the class?

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.000
And also how did this motivate
them to take further courses

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.230
in this discipline?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.150
Thank you, table one.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.700
You've set a very good model
for the other tables to follow.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.670
Table two had North
Carolina State.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.770
Please just share
your name, also, just

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.221
before you give your wrap-up.

00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:36.720
OK.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.670
Hi, my name is David Jennings.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.250
And yeah, like you said, we
had North Carolina State.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:47.280
And this is a very comprehensive
and prescriptive method

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.700
of evaluation,
that we thought may

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.800
be the case because it
is a state school and not

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.420
a private school.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.840
But some strengths of it were
that it was comprehensive,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.960
like I said.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.290
There's opportunities
for students to rate,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.580
peers to rate, instructors
to discuss and self-rate

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.840
themselves.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.170
And also administrators to give
a final review of a portfolio.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.760
So that 360 approach
we thought was good.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.200
There's evaluation of the
syllabus by both students

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.210
and peers.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.120
And they seem to be very
interested in the goals

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.190
and objectives of the syllabus.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.980
There was some vague terms.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.010
Like, they used the word
"appropriate" a lot.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.480
I think it's on the next page.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.730
And so they never
really operationalized

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.960
the term, appropriate.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.740
So we saw some room for maybe
some political interference

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.910
in some of this process.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.690
We also thought that,
well it's a pro that it

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.270
is prescriptive
and measurable, it

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.210
may be too rigid for
academic freedom.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.060
And so we maybe
had some concerns

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.087
about how this would work at
a liberal arts institution.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.830
So some things that we
could adopt, possibly.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.080
We liked the idea of
syllabus standards

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.120
at the department level.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.940
We also liked the
idea of peer review

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.290
among the department of goals
and objectives in the syllabus,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.600
and potentially a peer review
committee as well as some--

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.900
even cross-departmental
collaboration.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.940
Like people who are maybe
in a different school

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.382
but are teaching a
similar discipline.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.280
There's our timer.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.140
But I think we've covered a lot.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.470
And this particular
document was also very long.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.750
So your table gets
extra credit for having

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.840
to do a lot of reading.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.360
Our third table is table
three, taking on the University

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.590
of Pennsylvania.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.050
And if the person
speaking could quickly

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.450
give their name and start.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.130
Hi, I'm Julia King.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.330
This was an interesting one.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.360
Because if you
flip the page over,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.250
the way the students saw
the rankings of a course

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.350
was almost like
RateMyProfessors.com

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.540
when they're picking
their courses.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.210
And these numbers--
we're not sure

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.120
exactly how, but they
came from the survey that

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.030
was on the other side.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.651
We thought the
strengths were that it

00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:29.775
would take very little time
to fill out the survey.

00:16:32.598 --> 00:16:34.800
There's no survey
fatigue, because it

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.090
was very simple to answer.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.430
This could be a
strength or a weakness.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.160
The first question was asking
the quality of the course.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.280
So it kind of gave
someone an opportunity

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.442
to just instinctively
choose what they thought

00:16:51.442 --> 00:16:53.400
the quality was right
off the bat without being

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.170
asked some further questions.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.480
A few interesting
things about this one

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.510
is that, in the
description it says

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.520
that questions 6 through
10 were recently added.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.280
And the survey used to be just
one, two, three, four, five,

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.040
and then 10, 11.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.240
And the original survey
was very much based

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.990
on quality, difficulty, and
if you like the professor.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.150
And then the second
set of questions

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.651
that were added were much
more about critical thinking,

00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:22.609
and what you thought you
gained from the class,

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.880
did it help you.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.240
And we thought those
questions were interesting.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.600
Because it kind of informed what
they meant the other questions

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.606
to ask, but they asked
them more specifically.

00:17:36.606 --> 00:17:37.985
Let me look at my notes.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.000
There was a comment that it
looks like a marketing tool

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.725
to put this on a
website for students,

00:17:48.725 --> 00:17:51.100
instead of being something
that actually professors could

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.290
use to improve their course.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.736
Because they didn't have any
direct feedback or comments

00:17:57.736 --> 00:17:59.235
from the students
on how to do that.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.600
Perfect timing.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.580
Thank you so much.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.190
I think of all the
different tables,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.120
this is the one
that has quite a lot

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.170
of student-created
representations of the data

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.520
that's collected.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.030
Our fourth table took on
the University of Notre Dame

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.060
over there.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.610
Please introduce yourself.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.600
My name's Annika.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.660
And so these other
schools, they've

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.390
been looking at
the specific survey

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.220
instrument that was used.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.930
This is kind of how professors
are evaluated overall

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.430
for their teaching
in consideration

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.640
for tenure and advancement.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.260
And so we liked that they
took a balanced approach.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.510
So feedback from students.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.179
You can see this course
instructor feedback.

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:50.470
We didn't have that instrument.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.580
But we think that's kind of a
standardized survey of student

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.790
perceptions.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:00.860
And that's balanced with
feedback from peers.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.570
Because they acknowledge
that students-- it says

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.914
the CIF ratings are incapable
of revealing certain things

00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:09.330
about the quality
of the teaching.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.610
Maybe the students
don't at this point

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.250
understand, exactly, what the
purpose of the course was,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.490
or why a teacher did
things the way they did.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:23.730
And so we like that they balance
peer faculty review with that.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.350
Some things that were drawbacks.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.800
We thought-- we didn't have
all the details of this survey.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.340
So we don't know exactly
what was asked there.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.850
Some of the implementation of
how this review takes place

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.950
was unclear to us.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.400
And related to that,
some of these things

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.900
might be a little
unclear to faculty

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.170
how this is actually
taking place.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.030
But we did like
that it is flexible,

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.130
dependent on departments,
and things like that.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.770
Because each department
teaching area

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.300
may have different values
in a different environment.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.750
So it's customizable to that.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.460
I think this is another
one that has a lot of text.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.890
And it's also a
fairly complex system.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.630
And all of the documents
are in the Bitly.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.084
Because there is quite a lot
to read on this particular one.

00:20:22.084 --> 00:20:23.875
Thank you so much, to
the Notre Dame table.

00:20:23.875 --> 00:20:26.380
So we're halfway through
our report-backs.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.610
We have four more.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.260
Table five had the
University of Texas.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.220
Please go ahead.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:31.720
Hi, there.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.190
I'm Holly Gooding
from the Med School.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.564
And we had a great
representation

00:20:34.564 --> 00:20:36.550
from a lot of the
Harvard schools here.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.250
So in some ways, I feel
like we had the kind

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.862
of classic end-of-course eval.

00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:42.570
Which if you look up
there, you will see.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.279
It's from the University
of Texas at Austin.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:46.820
Some of the strengths
are that, right

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.240
in the beginning in the very
fine print that we suspect

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.020
students may not read, it
communicates the high stakes

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.481
of this for faculty.

00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:56.480
It's really interesting.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.521
People laugh, but I find
when I talk to students,

00:20:58.521 --> 00:21:00.910
they often don't know that
their evaluation makes

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.410
a difference for promotion
and whether people

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.118
are invited back.

00:21:03.118 --> 00:21:06.220
So it clearly communicates that
to the student, which is good.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.100
It focuses on what
we thought were

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.030
some basic, but very important
things, like the organization,

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.670
and the clarity, and
fairness of the instructor.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.977
So that's a strength.

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.810
Because you have to
have those things to get

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.060
to some of these higher level
things around curiosity,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.420
and engagement, and motivation.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.470
But that leads us to some
of the downsides, which

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.480
is that there's very
little about learning.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.580
It's all about how the
instructor essentially

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.080
organized and
presented the material.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.140
It's also overly long.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.450
We were quite concerned
that students would tire out

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.020
and just put all fives,
all twos, all threes.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.750
In terms of just
basic survey design,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.002
in addition to its length,
there was no reverse coding.

00:21:47.002 --> 00:21:48.460
So to make sure
students are really

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.918
reading, as opposed
to, again, just

00:21:49.918 --> 00:21:52.410
doing all one or the other.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:57.380
And yeah, just a lot of
concerns about the over

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.190
focus on the instructor's
organization,

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.610
and the length, and
concern about the validity

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.837
and reliability that
would come from that.

00:22:06.837 --> 00:22:07.920
Well, thank you very much.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.410
That issue of people
just marking all fives

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.710
came up in a couple
of our conversations.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.360
Three more to look at.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.460
The next one, the instrument
itself is the IDEA instrument.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.960
And the example was
Stockton University's use

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.900
of this national instrument.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.400
Hi.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.890
I'm Daniel Jamous from academic
technology for the FAS.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:34.240
So this is only the first page,
by the way, of the survey.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.430
So it was really interesting.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:42.000
We had a discussion about-- so
one of the drawbacks right off

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.040
the bat is the
comprehensiveness,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.630
which is also a
strength you could say.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.270
And the format.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.020
It's a little
daunting to see this.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.890
And again, there's a back page.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.420
Lot of multiple choice.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.680
But at the end, there are
a few open-ended questions.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.600
However, when you
actually start to look

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.340
at the questions
and the content,

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.920
we felt for the most
part that it seemed

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.100
to hit all the right points.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.690
Motivation of the students.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.760
How the instructor
organized the class.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:20.550
Emphasis on best practices,
teaching technique,

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.140
collaborative group, hands-on
teaching, use of technology.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.980
And also focus on the personal
development of the student.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.160
What was your motivation
for taking this class?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.260
Did you reach your goal?

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.240
So our sense was that if you can
kind of overcome the initial,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.150
maybe, fear of seeing this
SAT-like questionnaire,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.930
then maybe you can actually get
some valuable information out

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.540
of it.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.040
Wonderful.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.660
Thank you so much.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.620
Two more to go.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.110
Table seven had the
University of Minnesota.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.180
Hi.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.069
So the form that we had
was a peer evaluation form.

00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:06.610
We're assuming they also have
some sort of student evaluation

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.240
that takes place, right.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.240
And Matt-- we had a
researcher on our team, too.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.281
Matt kindly looked
up how this is used.

00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:14.530
So it looks like it's part
of the tenure and promotion

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:15.130
process.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.500
And they have this
evaluation that

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.540
happens pretty much
every year as part

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.460
of the evaluation of faculty.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.739
So we thought that something
that really stood out

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:27.280
was that this
instrument really looks

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.530
like it measures-- so this is
the more quantitative part.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.863
There are also two pages in
the beginning that are based

00:24:31.863 --> 00:24:35.350
on a classroom observation.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.980
And we thought that it was
a little bit concerning

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.840
that it's not really
set up in a way

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.069
to pair objective
evaluations of teaching along

00:24:44.069 --> 00:24:45.985
with the interpretations
of those evaluations.

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:48.124
And that could lead to some--

00:24:48.124 --> 00:24:49.540
what is it, political
interference

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.310
that someone brought
up earlier, possibly?

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.800
Or vague interpretations
of what the terms actually

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.500
mean being translated
into a positive

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.710
or a negative evaluation
that may not be justified.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:03.430
We thought that the other
kind of problematic thing

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.090
about this instrument is that
it judges whether the faculty

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.730
member is following their
procedures or their protocols.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.100
And it doesn't really
allow room for innovation

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.140
or for taking advantage
of something that might

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.525
be pedagogically very useful.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.450
It's also not clear
whether this is

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.899
entirely respectful of faculty.

00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:25.940
That was one of the concerns
that was brought up.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.120
And how this is really used
in the tenure and promotion

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.540
process.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.860
There really isn't
a lot of context

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.810
guiding this document
on the document itself.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.685
Although there's a lot
of information online.

00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:36.210
So maybe it is clear to
faculty who participation.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.220
And yeah.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.390
Overall, I think
our major concern

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.340
was that this seems much more
to evaluate process, rather

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.810
than actual learning outcomes.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.110
And we'd ideally-- we think that
there are a lot of strengths.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.264
But that was one of
our big concerns.

00:25:52.264 --> 00:25:53.180
So that's interesting.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.070
We're talking about improvising
versus being organized.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.270
Right.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.380
So our last table had
Dartmouth College.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.840
And I think it was related
to specifically chemistry.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.120
Some of these instruments
were for smaller subsets.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.040
We should mention
that real quick.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.820
Thanks.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.892
So I'm Adam Beaver
from the Bok Center.

00:26:13.892 --> 00:26:14.600
We had Dartmouth.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.810
This evaluation is,
as you mentioned,

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.094
from a chemistry course.

00:26:18.094 --> 00:26:19.510
I don't know if
it's more general.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.330
It's also from a summer
course and from 2006.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.160
So I don't know
if that remains--

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.775
if it remains the standard.

00:26:25.775 --> 00:26:26.650
So things we noticed.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.542
This is very close to Harvard's
Q Guide in a lot of ways.

00:26:29.542 --> 00:26:31.750
I don't know whether that's
a strength or a drawback.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.246
You can decide.

00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:34.870
There were a few
things that we thought

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.090
were kind of pure
unalloyed strengths.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.040
Most things, actually,
we put in both columns.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.780
So for example, this is a
form that values very highly,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.790
puts a strong emphasis
on student feedback

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.561
on the effectiveness
of teaching.

00:26:47.561 --> 00:26:49.810
This gets at that question
of whether these things are

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.300
more like dining reviews,
in which everyone

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.450
is, by definition, an authority
on whether they enjoyed

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:55.956
their meal.

00:26:55.956 --> 00:26:58.330
Or whether it's like a review
of a surgeon, in which case

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.986
you might not be an expert on
whether they are good surgeons.

00:27:01.986 --> 00:27:04.360
So it's a strength and weakness
that it's asking students

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.000
not only about their experience,
but about whether they

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.312
think the teaching was
effective for them.

00:27:09.312 --> 00:27:11.020
That's something that's
hard for students

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.826
to judge in the short term.

00:27:12.826 --> 00:27:14.200
We liked very much
that it called

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.420
for a lot of critical
and qualitative feedback.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.360
It's not all just
a Likert scale.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.990
We liked question 10 that
compels students to do some--

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.210
perform some metacognition.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.920
It's a question about--

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.850
sorry, I'm trying to
find it here on the form.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.080
How did you contribute to
your own learning experience?

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.150
And the whole survey
actually starts with that.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.920
It puts students back
into the experience

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.378
of their own learning
and asks them

00:27:37.378 --> 00:27:38.764
what they brought to the course.

00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:40.930
We think there could have
been more of that, though.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.600
So that was a little bit in
the weakness category, too.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.030
We thought there's a lot of
apples to oranges comparison

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.510
on the Likert scale.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.070
So what would it mean, for
example, in question four,

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.310
I think it is there, to say,
I was engaged with the course

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.970
material.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.296
I give it a three.

00:27:56.296 --> 00:27:58.420
Doesn't that mean that
you're not actually engaged?

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.190
It's hard to measure that way.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.300
It was hard to see--

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.100
there was a real jumble
of questions here

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.419
that might be of interest
to institutional research,

00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:07.210
that you can imagine
the institution using,

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.684
and compiling, and analyzing.

00:28:08.684 --> 00:28:10.600
But then a lot of questions
that seemed almost

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.320
to be aimed at the students'
ongoing metacognition, right.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.980
Down the road, did you learn
anything from this course?

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.070
Thank you so much,
everybody, for playing along

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.750
with our two-minute limits.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.820
I'm going to go
ahead and hand over

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.290
the microphone to
Kris, who's going

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.330
to walk us through the wrap-up.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.200
Thank you, Anu.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.540
So what we'd like you
to do now in our last

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.690
around 10, 12 minutes, is to
look at your worksheet again.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:40.010
And just think for a minute
about the last two questions

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.380
now that you've had a
chance to listen and see

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.570
what everybody in the room did.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.390
And just think about
what, if anything,

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.130
that you heard or
saw today might

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.550
be useful to bring or
adapt for use at Harvard?

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.604
And then what would
be some next steps?

00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:56.270
And so we'll give you
a minute to think.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.363
And then we're going to open it
up for our general discussion.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.180
OK.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.850
So we'd like to go ahead
and open up the floor.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:13.064
If you have-- so what might
we do with this information

00:29:13.064 --> 00:29:13.730
here at Harvard?

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.050
If you want to share,
just raise your hand

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.490
so Allison can bring you the
microphone for the videotape

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.360
for posterity.

00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:26.380
Hi.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.340
Deane Eastwood from the
School of Public Health.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.320
We really like this exercise.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.620
So we congratulate
you on the exercise.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.170
It was very easy to take
someone else's instrument

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.190
and critique it.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.060
And I think we're in the
process at the School of Public

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.820
Health-- and I know others are
looking at their instruments

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.740
and looking at the platforms.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.440
So I think this is a
nice starting point,

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.000
that we could
critique a few others

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.760
and then take a look
at our own instruments.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.750
And we might get
more out of that.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.970
The process itself.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.170
That was a tool to use.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:57.670
Great.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.830
Yeah, I thought the Minnesota
thing was pretty interesting.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.800
I know that they've been
spending years there

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.230
figuring out how the faculty
help each other teach.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.669
And I actually
understand that you

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:15.960
might think it's disrespectful.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.970
But what if it had worked?

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.450
Then it would be amazing.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.890
I guess the business
school does that already.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.473
Is that right?

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:26.170
Yeah.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.730
So I think, actually,
that's what we should do.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.730
Because all these other things
look exactly like the Q Guide.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.510
We could add a few
things here or there.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.324
Nothing's very different.

00:30:33.324 --> 00:30:36.880
Well, nothing's 20% different.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.380
Deena.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.320
So two points.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.520
First one, based on the Stanford
instrument that we examined,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.790
I found it refreshing to
be able to offer faculty

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.790
the opportunity
to have some input

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.310
and customize the questionnaire.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.110
I feel like it has
a lot of benefits,

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.180
not without their drawbacks.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.660
And the second, which
relates to the Minnesota

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.020
evaluation and the
North Carolina State,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.090
is the notion that--

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.630
have a clear articulation
for which stakeholders

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.590
have which input into
the process of evaluating

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.000
teaching and learning.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.610
I'm not sure that I, myself,
have thought as much about this

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.880
as I think it deserves
to be thought.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.140
And I love the analogy of the
surgeon reviews and the dining

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.770
reviews.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.330
So thank you.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.480
I had a reaction to this.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.990
I'm the Dean of the
Extension School.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.710
And it came from,
what will we actually

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.870
do with the information?

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.620
And my reaction was, I really
like the Stanford instrument.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.790
Because it's simple.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.612
And you're likely to
get honest feedback.

00:31:59.612 --> 00:32:01.570
And it'll probably be
directionally corrective.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.640
And you can parse that.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.010
And where you have
problems, you can

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.080
take that small
subset of students,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.580
know who was in the class, and
do a more comprehensive survey.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.330
Or maybe you give them
some more incentive

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.970
to get you detail to truly
diagnose the challenges

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.060
and come up with a repair.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.300
So I was putting that
practical overlay.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.540
I would love to have all the
information Texas at Austin

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.320
said.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.490
We counted like 175 questions.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.300
It isn't going to happen.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.144
Not with human beings taking it.

00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:33.310
But that's why I kind of
like the Stanford approach.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.430
A simple entry and then
a plan to follow up when

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.067
you saw something interesting.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.720
Yeah, so I really enjoyed seeing
the Minnesota, the 360 feedback

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.607
models that have
ways that we could

00:32:50.607 --> 00:32:52.190
create kind of
communities of practice

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.220
among faculty and
other instructors.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.175
On the question of how
we could do this here,

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.550
Harvard is the
kind of place that

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:03.260
often avoids experimentation
and iteration

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.770
if it can't rollout the
perfect 100% solution, I think.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.980
Probably all large
institutions are like that.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.480
It would be nice
to think about ways

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.700
that you could pilot
some of these initiatives

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.960
on a small scale.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.332
To take something like a
portion of the curriculum,

00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:19.040
maybe the Gen Ed
curriculum or something,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.110
and think about
ways that, at least

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.030
in that subdivision
of the university,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.940
we could try doing some things
like creating these community

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.880
360 evaluations,
even if we don't yet

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.060
know if it's the right thing to
do for thousands upon thousands

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.430
of students and courses.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.310
Thank you.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.000
So that kind of next
step part of it.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.930
One of the things that
several people have commented,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.330
and I completely agree,
that having the opportunity

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.390
to change or insert things
into some of the questions,

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.940
as was the case at
Stanford, is great.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.560
I'd like to see whatever
appropriate level--

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.750
could be a department,
could be a school--

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.659
a discussion of what
those questions might be.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.370
Because I think
many of the faculty

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.750
might have actually rather
radically different examples,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.670
even if they're teaching
multiple sections

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.199
of same course.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.900
And that discussion
by itself can

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.340
be quite helpful
in getting people

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.860
to reflect on their teaching.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.630
Same table we have.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.179
I might just add to that before
passing it over to Dustin,

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:36.679
that we've included as many URLs
as we could in this material.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:41.210
And it definitely is worth
browsing around in those.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:46.670
Because especially Stanford
has an incredibly robust set

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.790
of tools and resources
around the design

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:53.060
of learning outcomes, and the
flexibility and the creativity

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.850
involved in that.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.440
So each of these schools--

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.290
this is kind of the
tip of an iceberg

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.400
resting on top of a lot
of institutional work

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.250
that bears further look.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.270
Hi.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.800
Dustin Tingley.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.960
This was very helpful.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.240
Thank you.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.630
I was kind of surprised-- and
maybe you found this in some

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.670
of your research in this space--

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.850
about the lack of emphasis
on longitudinal data.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:23.660
So for example, a systematic
university-wide mid-term

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.370
evaluation of courses.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:30.140
It doesn't have to be as long
or as complicated or anything.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.494
Because otherwise
we're sort of-- you're

00:35:32.494 --> 00:35:34.160
getting the averages,
but you don't know

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.660
what you were starting with.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.960
And so a midterm evaluation is
at least one way to do that.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.290
And there are further
good pedagogic reasons

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.910
to do that anyways.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.730
But I guess I'm not aware of any
school that is systematically

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.350
doing that across
all its classes.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.960
And I've got to wonder why.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.440
Our teaching and
learning centers

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.490
tell us we should be doing that.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.864
We get templates
on how to do it.

00:35:53.864 --> 00:35:56.270
But we don't have a systematic
investment to do it.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.280
And so I'm just kind of curious.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.630
That raises a similar
thing that just came up.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.780
You know, I found out--

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.290
I guess it's an HBS question.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.711
But actually eliciting prior
knowledge from students.

00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:09.960
Like, you know, how much
prior knowledge did you have?

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.600
It has that similar
flavor of you're

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.940
trying to have something
about the longitudinal sort

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.701
of direction of a student.

00:36:15.701 --> 00:36:17.700
So anyways, I think that,
at the end of the day,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.350
that's where the investment
might very well be.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.840
Yeah, I mean, I
think my experience

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.673
teaching a number of
different institutions,

00:36:24.673 --> 00:36:26.920
I've never had any sort of
formalized, systematized

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.510
mid-term evaluations.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.200
They encourage you to
do things like that.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.742
And I don't think
we covered anything

00:36:32.742 --> 00:36:34.158
like that in any
of the documents?

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:34.750
Do you--

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.460
We weren't looking-- because
we were looking at summative--

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.200
you know, to be used for
promotion and tenure than--

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.960
I think the one advantage
of the national instruments

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.600
is that they have that
kind of a data set.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.500
So with the IDEA,
you can look semester

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.180
by semester at a
department's courses.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.950
And because it's a
national data set,

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:02.320
you can also see comparisons
across peer institutions.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.200
So I think that's the
trade-off between a homegrown

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.810
and a national instrument.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.990
The national instrument gives
you that larger infrastructure.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.930
They also tend to be the ones
with many, many questions,

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.350
probably for the same reason.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.380
So one of the things
that was a little

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.570
controversial at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.690
is that they had--

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.500
the students had done
a longitudinal analysis

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.300
by professor over a decade.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.840
So the danger of having
the data accessible

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.720
is all the different ways
you could slice and dice it.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.190
So we are pretty close to time.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.456
And we don't want to run over.

00:37:37.456 --> 00:37:38.830
So first of all,
I would like to,

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.580
on behalf of my
co-facilitators, thank you

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.590
all very much for coming,
for doing the work

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.260
that you didn't know you
were signing up for when

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.240
you signed up for this session.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.250
We're glad to hear that
you found it valuable.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.550
Again, we do have all of the
materials and more online.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:59.730
So please feel free to download,
peruse, pick at, dissect,

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:00.675
adapt.

00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:03.300
We were very fortunate in being
able to find a lot of materials

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.300
from these institutions.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.675
And the last thing
that we wanted

00:38:05.675 --> 00:38:07.284
to leave you with
and take with you

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:08.700
is, on the back
of your worksheet,

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.310
you'll notice a
set of principles,

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.620
again from Stanford,
that we thought

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.930
would be a nice way of
just, as a parting thought

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.570
and to tie in with
the theme of the rest

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.070
of the HILT conference of--

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:24.030
what are the-- are there
underlying principles

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.400
at Harvard that
we could all agree

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.570
on that would help
us guide our teaching

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.060
evaluation, in whatever
form that might be,

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.260
in whichever schools and
departments we're in?

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.906
So we just wanted to sort
of leave you with this idea.

00:38:37.906 --> 00:38:39.780
And I think it echoes
what a lot of you said,

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.870
that while we clearly
think evaluating teaching

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:47.760
is important, that no one
method offers a complete view

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.780
of that quality.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.590
And so how can we arrive
at a set of methods

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.310
and a set of principles that
help us measure what we believe

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.570
is important to us?

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.160
So we want to let you get
on to your next session.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.890
Thank you all very much
for your participation.
