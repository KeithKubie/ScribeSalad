00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.059
Let's fix the issue of determining when
we should transition to the second

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.430
view controller.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.170
We can do this by changing the segue
to only be called from code, and

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.540
not to directly by the storyboard when
we pressed the stop recording button.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.510
We know that we're recording our voice
that records sounds view controller.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.100
Once recording is finished, we need to
send that file over to the second scene.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.389
The play sounds view controller.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.970
How do we change the current segue
to be called just by code and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.450
not from a UI button?

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.189
If you look in the main
dot storyboard file here,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240
we can see the two scenes
are connected via a segue.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.040
In particular this segue's wired
up to the stop recording button,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.490
every time this button is pressed,
Storyboard will perform the segue.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.740
What we really want is to be able to
call this segue programmatically,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.190
once we know that the AV audio recorder
has finished writing out the file.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.270
This is easy to do,
let me walk you through it now.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.880
Let's start by deleting
the current segue,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.950
select the segue here in the document
outline, and press the delete key.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.390
Xcode will complain that
the second scene is unreachable

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.620
since we have no way to segue into it
from anywhere else in the storyboard.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.370
You can see that warning in the Xcode
status bar here, to fix the warning and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.710
set up a segue that we can
control programmatically.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.820
I'll hold Control key and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.330
drag from the first View Controller
to the second View Controller.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.910
The easiest way to do this is
from the document outline.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.050
I'll expand the view
controller scene here so

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.330
that I can see both view controllers.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.770
&gt;From the record sound view controller,
with the control key held down,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.215
I'll drag into the view controller and
select show segue.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.480
Now that these two scenes are connected
via segue, we can have the storyboard

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.700
perform the segue by calling
a function named perform seg.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.110
We'll set up the perform seg call
shortly, but in order to distinguish

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.750
this segue from any other one,
we need to give it a unique name.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.520
Select the segue here in
the document outline, and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.190
in the Attributes Inspector,
let's give it a unique identifier.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.964
I've given it the name stopRecording,

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:00.850
these names are case
sensitive by the way.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.055
Make sure you spell it correctly.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.538
Next we need to know when
AV Audio Recorder has finished

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:08.970
writing out the recorded voice file.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.200
To do that we need to use
a concept called delegation.
