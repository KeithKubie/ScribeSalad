00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
Conservatives vs liberals: Sure, they have
different beliefs - but do they also have

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.090
different personalities?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.599
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - and if you
live in America, then you know one of the

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.279
biggest sources of tension in our country
- is the political divide between conservatives

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.279
and liberals.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.189
You might think it’s a matter of simple
politics - but studies are now showing that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.820
fundamental psychological differences could
explain why someone leans left or right.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.880
In this month’s issue of Behavioral and
Brain Sciences, there’s an interesting discussion

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.829
surrounding a study that was done by Dr. John
Hibbing, which found that conservatives have

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.320
an implicit negativity bias that might explain
their political leanings.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.570
Over the past few years, Hibbing has been
doing experiments using eye trackers and other

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.010
devices - that can measure people’s involuntary
responses to different types of images.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.879
Specifically, threatening and aversive stimuli.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.280
In one of these studies, he showed people
photos of things that are obviously gross

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.739
- like an open wound with maggots in it, or
a spider crawling on someone’s face - and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.309
then he measured how long it took people to
respond.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
It turns out, people who are conservative
react much more rapidly to negative stimuli

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640
than liberals do.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.369
And Hibbing believes this might have to do
with our evolution.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.920
“A strong negativity bias,” he says, “was
extremely useful in the Pleistocene” - which

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.730
is the period of time ranging from 2.5 million
years ago to roughly 12,000 years ago.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.920
During that time, the ability to react quickly
to outside threats - would’ve been necessary

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.150
to our survival.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.280
That theory might seem a LITTLE far-fetched,
but when you actually think about it - it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.310
does apply to the conservative ideology.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.090
A strong military, an affinity for guns, and
a resistance to immigration - are all things

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.219
that naturally coincide with a biological
aversion to outside threats.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.479
Of course with any article like this, there’s
bound to be some naysayers - but what’s

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.310
interesting about this one, is that almost
every political scientist who had the opportunity

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.869
to comment on the study, agrees with Hibbing’s
conclusion.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.320
And the idea that conservatives and liberals
are different people on psychological, physiological,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.930
and even genetic levels, has become widely
accepted.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.439
Dr. John Jost is a social psychologist from
NYU, who was raked over the coals by Republican

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.940
analysts in 2003, for suggesting that conservatives
have a fundamental need for certainty and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.640
an intolerance for ambiguity.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.970
Back then, research like his was highly controversial
- but now, a decade later, it’s become so

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.360
widely accepted that, he says, it’s a “virtually
inescapable conclusion that the cognitive-motivational

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.940
styles of leftists and rightists are quite
different.”

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.570
Obviously, research like this has pretty big
implications for modern politics.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.890
Are we really capable of having our opinions
swayed by even the most well-presented arguments

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.890
and facts?

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.290
Or are our political beliefs hardwired into
us?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.030
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below, and as always - thank you guys for

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.380
