CHRIS BOEBEL: So anyway, I'm
Chris Boebel and, as I said,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.480
I'm the Media
Development Director

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.480
at the Office of
Digital Learning, which

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.800
is what the K-12 video
project is part of.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.700
As well as MITx, and OCW, and
a bunch of other initiatives

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.950
on campus, I also teach a
documentary video class--

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.890
a science documentary class--
here at MIT that Elizabeth

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340
took a few years ago.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.390
And what I'm going to talk
about is storytelling.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.640
And specifically,
visual storytelling,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.640
and how that can relate--
or hopefully will

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.190
relate-- to the work
you do in this class

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.780
and to online video in general.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.034
I'm going to start out
just by taking maybe-- I

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.950
don't know if it's
exception-- but just having

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.908
a slightly different
perspective than something

00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:14.080
that Elizabeth said.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.970
I would say that almost all
videos that are successful,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450
almost all viral videos,
have some element

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.920
of a story to them.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.210
Even a five second Vine video.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.130
Just about everything.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.710
And I actually was
thinking about that,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.990
and I went looking
for what is probably

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.820
one of the dumbest viral
videos to come out recently.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.970
Just a few days ago.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.380
You may have seen it.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.590
This is a fan at Ohio State
who was caught on the Jumbotron

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.590
basically scratching
her boyfriend's head

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.580
and then picking her nose.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.180
And this thing
got-- I just, it's

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.450
ridiculous how much play this
got in about a 12 hour, 20 hour

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.169
period.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:00.210
Very ephemeral, you know.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850
It's absolutely
not going to last.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.650
It's not going to
change anyone's life,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.220
but the reason it took off
is that it has a story.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.780
And the story was
created and invented

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.260
by the people who watched it.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.369
You know, it's not
really-- yeah, go ahead.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.244
AUDIENCE: I thought the
point of that video--

00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:18.714
I saw the same thing
that she was with--

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:21.256
that's like the guy she
was seeing on the side--

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:22.172
CHRIS BOEBEL: Exactly.

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:22.670
AUDIENCE: --that's
not her boyfriend.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.294
CHRIS BOEBEL: That's
actually not true.

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:26.870
That was the story that
was completely created

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.120
by people who watched it.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.750
They've been together
for a long time,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.791
and she didn't even know
she was on the Jumbotron

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.590
actually, apparently.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.910
But it just happens to be
this kind of little moment

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.280
that tells a story, and
because it told a story

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.210
that people related to, suddenly
it turned into a giant thing.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.050
One thing that's hilarious is
somebody actually reversed it,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.730
so she picks her nose
and then sort of leaves

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.327
a deposit on his neck, and
that became another story.

00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:54.910
AUDIENCE: There's
something disturbing

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.800
about her facial expression.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.560
CHRIS BOEBEL: Yeah exactly.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.470
She looks guilty.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.080
She looks guilty, and that's
why that's part of the story.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.360
Like, oh my god, I've been
caught rubbing his neck.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.560
So anyway, I think
this has got to be

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.840
the dumbest viral
video of all time,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.280
but I think it's also a story.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.080
Never think you're
not telling a story.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.960
If you forget everything else
that I say in the next 30, 40

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.652
minutes, I would remember this.

00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:22.610
There's some element of
a story in what you do.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.930
I don't care if you're
making an FDA approval

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.592
video, as one of
you mentioned you

00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.050
are interested in
doing-- something

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.707
I've actually done personally.

00:03:31.707 --> 00:03:33.540
I don't care if you're
making a 30 second TV

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.880
commercial, a 10 second TV
commercial, a 12 minute physics

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.140
demonstration.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.160
There is an element
of story to it.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.330
And it may not be the sort
of conventional, traditional,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.590
"television" story that we
would see on an HBO show.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.150
It may not be a
Hollywood movie story.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.580
But there is an
element of story,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.496
and one of the things
that you want to do here

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:57.780
is find what those elements are.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.302
Now, let's unpack
that a little bit.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:01.760
Let's talk about
what is the story,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.718
and how might it relate
to what you're actually

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:05.504
going to be doing here.

00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:06.920
And then secondly,
we'll also talk

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.430
about what are some of
the specific techniques

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.763
of visual storytelling that
you might be able to employ.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.360
So first of all,
what is a story?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.860
Full confession.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.320
I went to film
school and I worked

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.320
in that sort of ancient medium
that Elizabeth talked to,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.140
television and film.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.180
And the classic and traditional
way of talking about a story

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.430
is that it's got these things.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.960
It's got a protagonist, a hero.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.430
It's got an inciting incident.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.830
It's got something that happens
that sets everything in motion.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.229
Then there are barriers
along the way, problems

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.770
that the protagonist
has to overcome,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.700
and then there's a resolution.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.460
So you do that in a kind of
traditional, classic way,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.010
and you end up with
connections, or worse, right?

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.440
It's not going to
work, obviously,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.224
in the genre that
you're talking about.

00:04:56.224 --> 00:04:58.140
Another way of looking
at this traditional way

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.990
is that you've got act
one, which is the set up,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.960
you've got act two,
the barriers, the plot.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.050
You've got act three,
the resolution.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.430
The three-act structure is kind
of the classic screenwriter

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.450
mode that you see
over and over again.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.730
So how does that relate to
what we're actually doing?

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.210
Well, this is going
to be somewhat

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.400
repetitive to some of the
things Elizabeth talked about.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.340
First thing, clearly,
that you need

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.220
to do in this very short
form is engage your audience

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.070
immediately.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.220
I mean you've got maybe, like,
five, six seconds, maybe eight

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.160
or ten, to engage
them on some level.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.670
That's the beginning
of your story.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.890
That's the inciting incident.

00:05:39.157 --> 00:05:41.490
And then this is something
that I find very interesting,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.600
and you know when I
talk about web video,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.880
this is something
that is a paradox,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.970
that I think is
really, really true.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.450
You want to surprise
your audience, while also

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.880
showing them exactly
what they want to see.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.530
And this can be
really a challenge.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.720
Surprise your audience.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.520
In other words, you want to
take them somewhere, show them

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.997
something that's
fresh, that's new,

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:05.330
that they haven't seen before--
something Elizabeth just

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.189
mentioned.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.730
But at the same
time, you really want

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.360
to-- you need to sort of
feed into their expectations,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.290
because otherwise they're
going to shut down.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.900
And that is why a lot
of the YouTube channels,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.750
and a lot of the people who
do this work for a living,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.170
have a genre that they stick to.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.966
Smarter Every Day, ASAP, Vsauce.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:33.340
You know-- hey, I always jump
up from beneath the frame.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.470
That's my thing, you know?

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.177
So you're showing
people what they want.

00:06:37.177 --> 00:06:39.510
At the same time, you're
surprising them and taking them

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.060
somewhere they've never been.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.350
And it's kind of a
paradox, but I think

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.982
it's kind of a key paradox.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:47.940
And then the last thing
is, leave your audience

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.300
wanting more.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.780
Shortness, brevity, is a very
important thing, particularly

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.690
for this.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.360
I mean, this is a
series, Science Out Loud.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.860
The nicest thing
for Elizabeth would

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.950
be if somebody said, oh
my god, that was so great.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.294
Click, next one.

00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:07.710
Now if you think
about it, this is

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.340
very similar to a
three-act structure,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.320
it's just a really compressed
three-act structure.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.550
Engage your audience--
the inciting incident.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.684
Surprise your audience,
and also showing them

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:19.600
what they want to see.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.260
This is sort of the
development, which

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.839
might only take 30 seconds.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.380
And then, leave your
audience wanting

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.870
more-- some kind
of resolution that

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.680
takes them to the next thing.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.440
The other element of
all of this that's

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.020
very important to
just briefly mention--

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.620
and Elizabeth mentioned
this earlier--

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.430
is that in online video, just
as we saw with the Ohio State

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.160
clip, a lot of the storytelling
happens outside the frame

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.380
of your video.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.770
You want to, basically,
be able to leverage that.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.030
So people's expectations
before they see your video play

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.010
into how they perceive your
story, their experience during,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.710
and then what they do after.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.830
All of those are part
of the story, as well.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.750
So, you know, the naked
celebrity picture-- well,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.320
that's kind of a
story too, because you

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.820
have an experience of
Brad Pitt in one context,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.880
and then suddenly,
wow, is that his butt?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.160
That's a story.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.290
Not a very good one,
necessarily, but.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.450
I also want to talk a little
bit about protagonist.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.324
I started out talking
about one of the things

00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:23.520
you need is a protagonist.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.020
Well, on one level,
the protagonist

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.970
is you, if you are the
host of this video.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.210
And if you think about the sort
of videos Elizabeth showed,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.000
all of them, pretty much
on one level or another,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.039
have a protagonist.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.020
It's a very strong character,
a very strong protagonist,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.909
whether it's crazy Russian
science guy, or the Smarter

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:49.530
Every Day sort of down-home
but super-smart science guy,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.140
or Vsauce.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.740
Love him or hate him, he's
a very strong character.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.770
So having a protagonist
is really, really,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.885
really important.

00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:02.860
That protects is going to be
you in this particular instance,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.400
but there's also
another protagonist

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.829
that we should talk about,
and that's your audience.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:09.120
Because what you're doing is
taking people on a journey

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.370
through this learning, and
some of the barriers that

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.300
are going to be
thrown up are barriers

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.400
to their understanding.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.880
Think about Smarter Every
Day and the cat clip.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.980
The whole thing is structured
around, oh hey, now we know,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.690
it's the tail.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.950
Oh-- no it's not.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.692
No it's not, it's
something else.

00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:33.150
And that happens
two or three times

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.140
over the course of the clip.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.330
That is, basically, a story.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.390
That's storytelling.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.470
There's a barrier to
understanding-- oh,

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.770
we think we've solved
it-- no, we haven't.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.860
It's like a car chase.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.990
It's like breaking into a safe.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.910
It's like a lot of
things that you would

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.610
see in a conventional movie.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.580
So there are actually
kind of-- in some ways,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.070
you can think of it
as a dual protagonist.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.030
You, the trusted guide,
are taking your buddy,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.080
the audience, on this journey.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.410
On a story.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.520
To return to what
I said earlier,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.047
I think of web videos--
great web videos

00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:13.130
are like great snack food.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.430
They're very familiar,
yet they're also

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.330
sort of spicy and enticing,
and after you have one

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.575
you just want to have another.

00:10:23.575 --> 00:10:24.950
And then you have
the second one,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.470
and you just think, maybe
I should have a third.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.660
Hopefully the videos you
make won't leave people

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.360
with heartburn, which is
what happens when you eat too

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.250
many of these, but
that is, to me, kind

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.500
of an interesting analogy.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.550
And if Interstellar,
or some three hour

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.420
opus that you pay $10 to
sit in the dark to watch,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.242
is a seven course meal at
a four star restaurant,

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:51.700
you're making
something that's just

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.740
got to be really tasty and
delightful for just a moment,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.490
and leave people
wanting another one.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.686
Just exactly like that, but
somehow subtly different, too.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.715
I'm not going to show
any video, because I'm

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:08.340
going to try to just talk about
the videos you've already seen,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.200
rather than show.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.882
So let's unpack stories
just a little bit more.

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.840
I've made the case that
you're telling a story,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.520
and you should never forget
that you're telling a story when

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.820
you do this kind of work.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.410
Well, what are stories
actually built on?

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.690
There's a whole list of
things, and Elizabeth

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.060
has mentioned a couple of them.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.040
Emotion.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.480
Now, I'm not necessarily
talking about Gone With the Wind

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.170
emotion, but certainly
curiosity, identification,

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.230
humor, which is an emotion.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.380
All of those things
really are going

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.190
to play into what you do and
are very, very important.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.690
Character.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.160
We've talked about character.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.710
Conflict.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:58.000
Again, not necessarily
high drama, but there's

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.410
often some kind of conflict.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.770
The conflict may
be, oh, you thought

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:08.970
the cat was using his tail
to spin, that's not the case.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.140
But some kind of conflict,
barriers to understanding,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.180
I think are very,
very important.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.940
Spectacle.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.330
Again, you're not going
to do Interstellar,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:25.150
you're not going to spend
$100 million on CGI,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.950
you're not going
to do The Hobbit.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.410
But often-- it's another
word for taking people

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.670
a place they've never been.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.770
Maybe you can get into
the nuclear reactor here.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.800
Intellectual engagement.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.260
I think that's kind of the
obvious one, the easy one

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.254
that we can all think
about when we're talking

00:12:43.254 --> 00:12:44.295
about educational videos.

00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:49.790
In and of itself, I
don't think it's enough,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.970
but it's certainly
an important one.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.220
And there are plenty of videos
out there-- plenty of lecture

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.830
videos-- that basically
just depend on that.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.090
And then the last two are
two of my favorite ones.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.730
The unfamiliar
becoming familiar,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.000
which is kind of the
classic science video.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.130
But the familiar becoming
unfamiliar, as well.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.510
In other words, you
think you know farts,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.430
but you don't, despite
all you know about farts.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.290
And in one context, you don't
know that much, and here's why.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.160
So I think both of
those are really

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.350
interesting structures for
you to use to hang a story on.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.729
Again, the first one, obviously.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:36.020
I'm going to take this thing
that you don't understand,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.400
and I'm going to
make it completely--

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.040
I'm going to demystify it.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.030
But a lot of science
education is also

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.710
about kind of taking something
that seems really simple

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.010
and showing just how
complex, and intriguing,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.510
and unfamiliar it really is.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.190
Now let's talk a little bit
about visual storytelling,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:03.030
because that's obviously
what you want to do here.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.130
Lecture videos--
again, intellectual

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.290
engagement certainly
one way to go.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.760
If you use OCW, as a
couple of you mentioned,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.190
you know very well that lecture
videos can be effective.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.850
And in fact, lectures
can be great stories.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.730
We all have had
experiences of people

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.800
who are great lecturers,
who tell great stories.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.095
And those stories may
or may not be visual,

00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:28.720
but I think there's
certain things that

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.920
distinguish visual storytelling
that are worth talking about.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.570
And this is a
concept that I often

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.520
use to just kind of get into
to this whole idea, which

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.800
Elizabeth will
probably remember.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.080
This is what we sometimes
call the plastic elements

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.230
of video or a film.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.420
And sometimes I use film
and video indistinguishably

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.890
because-- it betrays
my age-- video is film,

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.900
film is video now,
at this point.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.500
What I mean by the
plastic elements of video

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.420
are, just simply,
all of the things

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.080
that we have control over
when we make a video.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.827
And that could be the
casting of the actors,

00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:16.660
it could be where we
put the camera-- that's

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.670
kind of the obvious
one-- the lighting,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.890
there's an endless
list of things.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.850
And, in fact, here are
just a few of them.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.550
Again, most people would
list the camera right away,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.540
since that's kind of the
"paint brush", quote unquote.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.320
The lighting, how we
choose to light something,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.190
or whether we're actually
literally using lights or just

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.700
using the sun or
existing room lights.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.140
Editing, sound, music,
characters, the actors,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.000
locations, props, costumes,
the list is really endless.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.930
It goes back to the decisions.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.530
Elizabeth mentioned
decision-making.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.120
All of these things are
things you need to think about

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.620
and you can control.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.020
And they can work for you,
or they can work against you.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.870
Think about in Smarter
Every Day, props.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.080
The cat itself, of
course, is a great prop.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.340
Think about the stuffed
cat at the beginning,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.430
which is that sort of fun
moment of, oh my god, he's

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.210
really going to drop a real cat.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.440
That was a choice.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.820
That was a choice, to
add that stuffed cat,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.160
and it sort of made a fun
little moment that brought you

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.520
in for just a second.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.250
Locations.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.360
Very, very important.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.120
I mean, the sort of lowest
common denominator location is

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.140
a chalk board or a white
board for something

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.570
like an educational video,
but there are all sorts

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.990
of other possibilities.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.570
Costumes.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.170
Again, doesn't have to be
clown costumes or silly hats,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.880
or things like that--
although it could be.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.420
But all of the other things that
you can, or might be able to,

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.610
bring to your video by
making these choices.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.570
Camera, of course,
is a crucial one,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.320
and I'm going to unpack
that just a little

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.780
bit as well, although
we could spend hours

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.180
talking about film grammar.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.130
So I'm going to just go
through a few other tips

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.579
to think about.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.915
The first one-- and this
is kind of like the bible

00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:17.670
of visual storytelling--
show, don't tell.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:24.030
And it sounds kind of obvious,
but it isn't necessarily

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.720
that easy to do.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.530
If we think about
the sleep video,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:35.077
I think one of the things that
I responded to in that video,

00:17:35.077 --> 00:17:36.660
that I thought could
have been better,

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.340
is that it's actually
not showing us much.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.430
It's telling us.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.760
Elizabeth talked about the
fact that the voiceover just

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.030
read, like, a web article.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.000
Like, a sort of "10
Facts About Sleep",

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.400
and that's basically the case.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.540
I mean, there is some
really cool animation,

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.730
and the animation is fun, and
it helps, and it definitely

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.810
supports the words,
but together,

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.690
it's really just this
thing-- you know,

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.420
I could have listened
to it on my iPod.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.630
I could have listen
to it in my car.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.944
The visuals helped a little
bit, but it didn't really

00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:13.830
add anything to it.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.890
The other way to do it, of
course, is Smarter Every Day.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.769
Which again, you may or
may not have liked that.

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:26.810
You may have thought that
it dragged on too long,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.610
and I agree with that certainly.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.310
I think there were things
that could've been improved,

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.070
but there's nothing
like dropping a cat,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:39.736
and showing it in super-slow
motion, to get my attention.

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:42.110
So I think that was a great
example of showing something.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.080
This is just something
that I wanted to mention.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.380
Having worked in
television, there

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:58.910
was a saying that
went around a lot

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.840
when people were talking about
a script, which was, "Oh, this

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.446
is kind of a wolfpack deal."

00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:04.820
And what was meant
by that-- this

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.550
was sort of an infamous
situation from, I don't know,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.380
God knows when.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.230
Somebody who's scripting
a nature documentary

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.030
had written this long,
very beautiful, kind

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.940
of flowery narration about
"the ravenous pack, lopped

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.590
across the frozen tundra
in search of its prey"--

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.290
blah blah blah.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.150
Like two pages of sort
of beautiful prose,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.480
and at some point in
the editing process,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.155
somebody was like,
because they had that.

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:42.070
They didn't need to
say all that stuff.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.840
This picture was worth
endless amounts of stuff.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.820
So avoid your pack moments.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.510
If you don't need to say
something, you can show it.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.770
There may be plenty
of things to say,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.380
and I'm not saying that
it should be all visual,

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.570
but you don't need to say
certain things if you're

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.130
already showing those things.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.800
Use your language,
use your words,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.110
which are very important
to do other things.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.950
To reinforce, to bring
your own perspective,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.000
to embellish the
story, to bring people

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.330
into your own mind,
your own character.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.650
You don't need to say
the obvious stuff.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.705
You don't need to do the
wolfpack description.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.570
So that's show, don't tell.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.760
The other thing that's just
sort of a fundamental tip

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.000
is, video loves motion.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
Moving pictures.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.210
And Josh is going to talk about
storyboarding and animation

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.940
later in the week.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.690
Clearly, animated
pictures, moving

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.930
things, things that reveal one
thing or another in animation,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.090
are really important.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.920
Same with cameras.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.370
If you look at Science Out Loud,
some of the other episodes,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.130
you'll see some really terrific
moves with the camera, dollies.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.920
All of those things
add visual interest

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.260
and improve your storytelling.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.150
Locking down a tripod can
also be very effective,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.475
but again, think of it
as a plastic element

00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:12.350
that you can control.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.760
Don't do it just because
you didn't think about it,

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.320
do it after thinking about what
you're doing by either moving

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:18.910
or not moving.

00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:23.580
So the camera loves motion.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.260
This is kind of the
corollary to that.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.490
And I don't know if people have
a lot of shooting experience

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.430
or not, and this
isn't really strictly

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.140
a class on the
production techniques,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.560
but this is something I
really wanted to mention.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.160
Motion for the sake
of motion is also not

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.630
terrific, not fantastic.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.320
Hosing down the room
is that tendency

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.900
that your uncle or
your grandfather

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.900
has when you give them a camera
to just do this all the time.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.190
And you're going, oh, hey,
I'm getting everything.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.500
I'm just getting
everything here.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.010
This is fantastic.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.170
And in fact, what you get
is absolutely nothing,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.670
because there's
no intentionality.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.920
There's no sort of
thought to what's

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.187
happening with the camera.

00:22:10.187 --> 00:22:12.020
All you're doing is
making everybody seasick

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.360
and really pissed that you're
not focusing on anything.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.600
Motion is actually--
I think a better way

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.980
to talk about it, in
story terms, is reveals.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.610
When you're moving
things, you're

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.820
revealing the next
story element.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.790
So if I pan from our
camera person over to Josh,

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.310
and Josh is looking over at the
camera person, is going like,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.240
why is he doing what he's doing?

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.530
That's a story element.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.660
Whereas if I do this, I'm
not telling a story at all.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.459
Same with animation,
and I'm sure Josh thinks

00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:50.500
about this night and day.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.977
I mean, how do you
reveal your next thing

00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:54.060
from the thing you've got?

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.300
How you go from this
idea to that idea?

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.790
How do you reveal using motion?

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.020
Because it is moving pictures.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.340
So that's maybe a
more pointed way

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.130
of talking about
motion in story terms.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.900
Revealing things.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.030
I'm going to talk
just a little tiny bit

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:23.740
about grammar, and framing, and
stuff like that, very quickly.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.750
This is just a still
from an interview

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.380
that I did a couple of
years ago here at MIT.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.420
Joel Dawson, a professor here.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.710
And just a couple of
things to just point out

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.965
about it in terms of,
sort of, just the way

00:23:40.965 --> 00:23:42.270
it's visually set up.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.050
First of all, you'll
see that the background

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.710
and the foreground
are very distinct.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.750
We shot it so that the
background is completely

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.932
out of focus, and that's so
that you know what to focus on.

00:23:56.932 --> 00:23:57.890
That's the other thing.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.530
So we talked about reveal.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.150
The other sort of
key crucial thing

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.230
to think about when you're
storyboarding, or creating

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.900
animation, or directing
is, how do you

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.460
get people to look
at what you want

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.940
them to look at in the frame?

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.610
One way is to foreground
the foreground

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.460
and let the background drop
off, either through lighting

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.930
or through the
focus, in this case.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.950
Or through art direction-- there
are all sorts of ways to do it,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.340
but doing it is
really important.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.610
The other thing is that
this is a close up.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.670
Sounds kind of simple,
sounds kind of obvious,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.340
but it's making
a choice to go in

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.520
and to find out about
this guy, this person.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.590
It's not about the lab.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.520
It's not just sort
of this wishy-washy,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.850
moving shot of him wandering
around his lab doing something.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.710
We want to hear what
this person is saying,

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.620
what he's thinking, right now.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.450
Just another quick thing
to just talk about.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:05.070
When you're shooting in this
particular format, 16x9,

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.900
there are a couple of
really powerful parts

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.760
of the frame that you can use,
whether you're doing animation

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.640
or shooting, and
they tend to be where

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.400
the thirds cross each other.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.890
So that's a very powerful
part of the frame.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.210
That's also powerful.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.100
These are powerful in
slightly different ways.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.060
And you'll see his eyes, like,
dead-on in the crosshairs.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:34.320
If we're people who read
left to right, in sort

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.130
of the Euro, European
tradition of writing,

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.880
this tends to be the
most powerful point,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.560
because we read frames left
to right, because we're

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.720
used to our eyes used
to going that way.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.700
Not saying you have
to follow this rule.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.970
You can break it, but it's just
an interesting thing for you

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.590
to know.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.564
When you're framing things,
when you're creating animations,

00:25:55.564 --> 00:25:57.980
there's a tendency when you
start to think oh, dead-center

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.530
will be really great.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.680
But it's actually not the case.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.990
A little off-center and in
sort of the thirds of the frame

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.319
is a good way to go.

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:11.110
The other thing just
to talk about quickly,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:17.170
in terms of making
choices, think about--

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.200
and this will really come up
when you do your storyboarding

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.580
exercises with Josh--
think about what

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.870
the kinds of shots
you choose are doing.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.240
Wide shots say one thing,
close-ups say other.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.240
Starting with a wide
shot and coming in,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.260
that's a reveal of something.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.140
But starting in a
close-up and going wide

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.750
could also be a reveal
of something else.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.290
I think we can imagine
what kinds of stories

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.480
might come out of
these two frames,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.980
and how the story
might be different

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.770
if we started here
and went here,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.100
and if we started
hear and came out.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.740
So make choices, and think about
what your choices are actually

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.740
going to do in
terms of the story.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.830
Another example of that.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.150
Camera angles framing.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.940
Low angles looking up, that
gives you a certain feeling,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.710
it gives you a
certain kind of power.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:20.270
A sort of master
of my domain feel.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.824
The opposite, looking
down, kind of the opposite.

00:27:23.824 --> 00:27:25.490
These are just two
examples, and I'm not

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.110
going to go on and on and on and
talk about others, although we

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:32.650
may get into it
later in the week.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.860
The point is that the camera is
one of the key plastic elements

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.380
that you have at your
disposal to tell your story.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:47.810
And the medium shot, just
kind of center frame,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.040
doing your thing, is
kind of the fall-back.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.460
You don't have to do that.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.260
There are any number of
other choices you can make.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.100
And when you start to go and
choose locations, and choose

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.840
props, and choose
elements like that,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.820
how you shoot those things and
how you shoot your characters

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.360
becomes very, very,
very important.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.574
And then the last thing that
I'm going to talk about--

00:28:14.574 --> 00:28:16.990
and I'm kind of racing through
this because I want to just

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.140
make sure we have time
for questions and stuff--

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.140
I'm just going to be a
little counter-intuitive.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.090
We've been talking about
visual storytelling,

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.040
but just don't short
change your sound.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.120
Sound is often more
important than the picture.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.380
And one of the other
things that I think--

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.860
Elizabeth talked a little bit
about production technique,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.030
and quote unquote "bad
technique" or rough videos,

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:46.170
versus slicker TV-style videos.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.060
One thing that's very,
very, very hard to overcome

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.220
is poor sound.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.190
And even if your
video is a little out

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.210
of focus and its shaky,
if it's really compelling,

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.810
that's fine, as long
as the sound is good.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.630
But as soon as the sound is
bad and hard to listen to,

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:08.000
you're going to have a really
hard time pulling people back.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.340
So even though this is mostly
about visual storytelling,

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.406
I just want to point
that out, that that

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:16.280
doesn't mean that the
sound is not important.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.060
In fact, the sound is
extraordinarily important.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.330
And it's both a technical thing
but also a plastic element

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.610
that you can use.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.860
Whether it's music,
or sound effects,

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.350
or the way you treat
dialogue, all of those things

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.380
are really important.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.800
So just to contextualize
this a little bit,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.620
I know that Elizabeth's
co-instructor, George,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.290
is going to be doing a
scripting workshop with you,

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.884
and he's going to be focusing
a lot on finding your voice.

00:29:46.884 --> 00:29:48.300
Which is really,
really important,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.720
and goes back to the
idea of character,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.110
and the protagonist,
and authenticity,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.410
and a lot of the things
Elizabeth was talking about.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.460
But as you do that, as you
do all of those things,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.880
remember that ultimately
you're telling a visual story.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:13.550
And that once you, sort of, hone
your story, hone your voice,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.740
you want to put that
in a visual context.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.630
You don't have to have the
words carry everything.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.850
And in fact, the
words may end up

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.890
doing other things than
conveying the core of what

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.030
you need to do.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.580
So that's it.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.040
I kind of tried to
race through it,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:38.260
because I didn't want to
keep people for too long.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.655
First of all, any
questions or thoughts?

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:47.876
AUDIENCE: I just had a
thought, just a question.

00:30:47.876 --> 00:30:52.806
It was interesting, you
mentioned that the-- I'm sorry,

00:30:52.806 --> 00:30:55.780
the name's escaping me-- the
whiteboard video that you were

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.870
critiquing earlier--

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.870
PROFESSOR: ASAP Science.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.791
CHRIS BOEBEL: Oh, the
ASAP Science, yeah.

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:01.457
I liked it, I didn't
mean to dump on it.

00:31:01.457 --> 00:31:03.331
AUDIENCE: No, I think
it was really important

00:31:03.331 --> 00:31:05.353
and a really interesting point.

00:31:05.353 --> 00:31:06.814
So then I was
thinking, okay, what

00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:08.275
would have been more effective?

00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:11.197
How could that have been
turned into some sort of more

00:31:11.197 --> 00:31:14.606
storytelling
exercise, or something

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.090
that was more engaging?

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:21.030
And I think it would be an
interesting question, just,

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.140
how could that be better?

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.920
And my feeling was, would
it be better to do something

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.880
where you actually
had someone not

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.150
sleep for overnight,
or for two days--

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.720
CHRIS BOEBEL: Well I think
that's-- yeah, no, go ahead,

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.330
yeah.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.986
AUDIENCE: Something
like Supersize Me,

00:31:37.986 --> 00:31:40.854
where you have someone
actually engaged in this thing,

00:31:40.854 --> 00:31:42.766
and it's more
experiential, as opposed

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:48.040
to being didactic I guess
would be the distinction there.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.400
So that was just one idea.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.607
CHRIS BOEBEL: I think
that's a really good point.

00:31:51.607 --> 00:31:53.440
I mean, that's kind of
the Smarter Every Day

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.950
approach, which I respond
to personally better.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.610
On the other hand I think
that there are graphics

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.500
that tell amazing stories.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.320
I think data visualizations
that I've seen recently,

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.655
in particular, just can be
extraordinary storytelling

00:32:12.655 --> 00:32:13.155
devices.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.450
So it's not so much that I
think that it was animated,

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.540
and somehow that was
not as effective.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:28.300
It's that I think the process
was write script, and then come

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.920
up with stuff to fill in space.

00:32:35.904 --> 00:32:37.320
So yeah, I personally
respond more

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.740
to the ones that are
more experiential, where

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.820
you have people-- that may also
be supported by animation--

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.660
but there is someone taking
you through the experience.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.740
But I do think that there
are lots and lots of ways

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.480
to tell really, really dynamic
and really interesting,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.940
good stories with animation.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.810
AUDIENCE: That's good to hear.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.140
CHRIS BOEBEL: Oh no, totally.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.370
And you know, we've
all been there.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.300
I've been there, too.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.662
You have something that you
have to make come alive.

00:33:12.662 --> 00:33:14.870
I think they did a great
job of making it come alive.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.180
I think the animation
was really effective.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.480
It's just that I
think the approach was

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.690
to write a script without
necessarily thinking

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.370
about the visual medium,
and then to take the visuals

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.755
and layer them on top as a
separate part of the process.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.006
So anybody else have
any-- I mean again, I know

00:33:40.006 --> 00:33:41.130
I kind of raced through it.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.960
How many people-- I mean, do
you have video experience?

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.397
How many people have some
kind of video experience?

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.230
That's always a really
good question to ask.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.400
No?

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.861
Nobody?

00:34:00.861 --> 00:34:01.669
Well that's cool.

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:02.210
That's great.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.950
AUDIENCE: You have bad habits.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.866
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:34:06.866 --> 00:34:08.590
Absolutely.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:13.290
I think, just to go
back a little bit,

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:18.830
I think that whole relationship
between web video and TV

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.040
is a really interesting one.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.830
It's a really interesting
one to unpack,

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.389
because again, the sort of
conventional storytelling

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:32.020
techniques that we're
used to seeing on TV

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.886
are not going to be effective
for all sorts of reasons.

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:36.719
It's also worth mentioning
that of course TV

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:40.710
has changed too, radically,
since connections.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.389
Game of Thrones
doesn't open that way,

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.639
two minutes of somebody
wandering around a house.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:53.230
But at the same time,
it is a different genre,

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.320
and really a crucial thing
is the thing that Elizabeth

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.270
alluded to, and I
mentioned at the beginning,

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.880
that I think you're
telling a story,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.434
but your story extends beyond
the bounds of your video,

00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:06.350
or can extend beyond the
bounds of your video.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:12.260
It basically can begin with
what people's preconceptions are

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.010
before they start watching,
and it continues on

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.560
after the video is done.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.860
And I think that is a
really crucial difference.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.590
One suggestion
that I would make,

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.450
whenever you write
something this week--

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.200
and you're going to
be writing treatments,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.930
and pitches, and
scripts-- think about it

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.040
in purely visual terms.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.760
One of the early exercises
that I had to do,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.930
when I was in grad
school, were silent films,

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:49.280
and films or versions of scripts
that had no dialogue, had

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.712
no sound at all.

00:35:50.712 --> 00:35:53.170
And I think that's-- I'm not
saying that you should do that

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:57.480
as a technique in
your finished piece,

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.620
but it's a way of bringing up
stuff that you can then apply

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.490
to your video later.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.080
So if you were going
to do something

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.610
that was purely visual, that
was going to convey what wanted

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.440
to convey, how would you do it?

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.816
And what might you create,
or invent, or think about,

00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:20.440
through that process,
that you can then

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.890
use to inform your script.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.990
So just a way of thinking
about what you're

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.970
going to be doing this week.
