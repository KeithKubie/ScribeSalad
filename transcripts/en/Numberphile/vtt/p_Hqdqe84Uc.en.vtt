00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.100
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
These are the famous dots.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.280
So you just have to say how
many dots there are.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.750
BRADY HARAN: Two.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:04.960
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Two.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.150
That's very good.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.560
And you're quite quick.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.916
Now the next one.

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:09.810
BRADY HARAN: Six.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.490
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: OK,
you're accurate there, but

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.510
you're a bit slower.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.950
Well, I've been particularly
interested in the last few

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.700
years in dyscalculia, which is
a congenital condition that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.130
affects somewhere between 3
and 6% of the population.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.900
And what it means is that
they're very, very bad at

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.400
learning arithmetic, at least
learning it in the normal way.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.480
And this seems to be a
lifelong condition.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.380
We've met a lot of adults who
have this condition, adults

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.440
who are very successful
in other branches--

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.500
other walks of life.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100
Walks of life that don't depend
very much on being good

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.770
with numbers.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
I mean, they could be
filmmakers, TV producers.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.930
They could even be science
journalists.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.470
They're not going to be terribly
good at doing the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.430
maths for physics.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.800
Well, it's like dyslexia in the
following way, that it's

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.870
something that you're meant to
learn at school, and that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.470
unless you have special
help, you're not going

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.620
to learn it at school.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.760
It's not exactly the same as
dyslexia, though it's often

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.890
called dyslexia for numbers,
because dyslexia is a problem

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.580
in reading.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.410
But in fact, it's really a
problem of language, dyslexia.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.830
So you have a particular problem
with analyzing the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.820
sounds of language.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.990
And that's really what prevents
you from linking

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.520
letters with sounds,
particularly for an

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.640
orthography like English
orthography, where the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.260
relationship between letters and
sounds is not particularly

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.320
consistent.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.220
BRADY HARAN: What's the
difference between someone who

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.006
has dyscalculia and someone
who's just a

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:48.770
bit rubbish at math?

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.950
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
The difference between

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.080
dyscalculia and just being
rubbish at maths is that lots

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.590
of reasons for being
rubbish at maths.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.640
My own excuse is that I didn't
have a very good

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.330
math teacher at school.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.330
And I didn't like him.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.140
I didn't get on with him.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.420
I've had to try desperately
to make up for that since.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.890
For example, you might miss
a lot of lessons.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.080
And since math is a kind of
cumulative subject, unlike

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.590
history, then if you miss a lot
of stuff, it's very hard

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.540
to catch up.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.220
Dyscalculia can occur in people
with high intelligence,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.220
good memories, who go to school
every day, have really

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.600
supportive backgrounds.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.280
And yet they're unable to do
what everybody else in their

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.500
class can do--

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.460
do simple arithmetic.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.740
So there is a difference.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.030
You can often spot a
dyscalculic-- though these

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.710
aren't formal tests--

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.170
in lots of different ways.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.710
For example, they have great
difficulty in remembering

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.540
telephone numbers.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.750
They have difficulty in
remembering any numbers.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.190
So they often are going to use
the same PIN, when they

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.480
shouldn't, for lots of
different activities.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060
They're very bad at shopping.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.100
So actually, one of the first
developmental dyscalculics we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.470
came across was in prison.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.880
And he was in prison
for shoplifting.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.260
Why did he shoplift?

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.670
Well, because he was too
embarrassed to go to the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.050
counter, because he didn't know
how much money to give.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.500
He didn't know whether he was
getting the right change.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.320
So shopping is an area which
is really difficult for

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.390
dyscalculics.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.180
They also have trouble
with time.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.150
It's not that they can't
estimate intervals.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.980
It's just that they're not very
good at the numerical

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.300
side of it-- working out, for
example, what time they have

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.160
to leave home in order to
get to somewhere at

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.500
a particular time.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.490
We know that there's a
particular part of the brain

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.590
that seems to be involved in
very simple number tasks.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.530
So for example, here in the
parietal lobes of the brain---

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.650
this is the back of the brain.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.690
This is the left parietal and
that's the right parietal.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.340
We know that these areas are
critical for just enumerating

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.270
the number of objects
in a set.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.470
One of the things that
we now know--

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.320
this is a very recent
discovery--

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.040
is that dyscalculics have
abnormalities particularly in

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.020
both of these areas, and maybe
particularly in the left in

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.740
older dyscalculics.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.550
So they have abnormal
structure.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.220
And also, the brain activates
in a different way when

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.660
they're doing number tasks.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.610
Now, why should they have
abnormal structure or abnormal

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.680
activations?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.780
Well, there are a number
of possible reasons.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.200
We don't know all of them.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.380
One of them is these
abnormalities seem to be, in

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.150
some cases, inherited.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.830
One of things we do know is
that there are particular

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.520
genetic abnormalities that seem
to affect numbers more

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.240
than other cognitive
abilities.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.020
So abnormalities in the X
chromosome seem to have an

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.640
effect on parietal lobe
development and also on

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.040
numerical abilities.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.370
So individuals with a number
of different X chromosome

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.410
conditions-- like Turner
syndrome, where you have only

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.710
one complete X chromosome, or
Fragile X syndrome-- they seem

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.055
to have a big effect on your
ability to do even very simple

00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:21.305
number tasks.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.710
BRADY HARAN: How do you
diagnosis this?

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.700
How do you make the decision,
yep, that

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.050
person's got the problem?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.460
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, in the study that we

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.160
just published, we used
two criteria.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.900
One is you've got to be
bad at arithmetic.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.290
And it's important to note that
it's got to be-- it's

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.270
timed arithmetic that's
critical here.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.820
Because there's a difference
between somebody who answers

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.820
the question, what's 5 plus 3,
with 8, and the individual who

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.340
goes, 5 plus 3--

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.340
8.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.890
So time is a very good
diagnostic here.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.670
And we also looked
at the ability to

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.680
just enumerate sets.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.950
So how many dots are there
on the screen?

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.460
Now, how good you are at this,
even in kindergarten in one of

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.770
our studies, is a very good
predictor of how much

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.752
difficulty you're going to have
in learning arithmetic.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.590
BRADY HARAN: What is it
about counting dots?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.500
Counting dots seems to--

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.970
is it just because it's a good,
easy, dependable test?

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.790
Or is there something more
to it that I'm missing?

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.700
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
It's a very dependable test.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.410
So if you're bad at it at five,
you're bad at it at six,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.860
you're bad at it at seven,
you're bad at it--

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.730
well, up until 11.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.820
In our longitudinal study,
that's as far

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.120
we've gone so far.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.170
So it's a very stable
indicator,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.810
so that's one reason.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.310
The other reason is because it
links to the kinds of things

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.550
that might be inherited, the
kinds of things that other

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.340
species are able to do.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.370
BRADY HARAN: What do
we do with someone

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.210
who's got it, then?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.760
Are there drugs they can take?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.030
Is there something
that can be done?

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.180
Or are they a basket case?

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.450
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: No,
they're not basket cases.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.310
But like dyslexia, what you
need is special kinds of

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.220
intervention.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.120
So if they're not very good at
enumerating sets, it means

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.900
they don't have a very good
sense of the number of objects

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.350
in the set.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.580
So if it's a set of five, not
very good at enumerating it

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.250
means they don't have
a very good sense of

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.560
what fiveness is.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.080
So what you have to do is you
have to have interventions

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.880
that target that particular
weakness.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.150
So you're given lots of practice
at enumerating sets,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.310
linking that enumeration with
the symbols that we use for

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.530
sets, like the word five
and the digit 5.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.230
And in fact, you can relate the
number of dots to how long

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.740
it takes you.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.510
So unsurprisingly, you might say
the more dots there are,

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.630
the longer it takes you to
give the right answer.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.780
But there's a very reliable
result, which we've known for

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.080
at least 50 years, which is that
up to about four dots,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.060
you're very accurate and
you're pretty fast.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.590
And thereafter, it takes you
about an extra quarter of a

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.840
second for each additional
dot.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.610
And this is sometimes called
the subitizing range.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.770
And that's called the counting
or estimating range.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.630
And there's a point at which you
go from one range to the

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.300
other range.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.960
And that suggests there
are actually two

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.930
processes at work here.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.100
And we know, actually, from
some recent mirror-imaging

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.020
studies that we've done, that
there are in fact--

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.880
there's a separate part of the
brain that does the subitizing

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.309
range from the estimating
range.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.960
BRADY HARAN: At how many dots
does it become reasonable for

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.430
someone to make a mistake?

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.312
Because I feel a lot of pressure
with the dots.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:49.160
And if you put up 30 or so,
that would take me a

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.300
long time to count.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.750
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Right.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.880
This is a very fair point.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.270
If you give people unlimited
time and you tell them they

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.140
have to be accurate, they'll
just count them.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.720
And they'll be pretty good
at counting them.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.120
If you give them limited amount
of time, then they can

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.250
count them up to a point.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.370
So for example, this
is from children.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.610
So it's taking them seven
seconds to get to eight dots.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.110
But if you gave them less time
to do it, then of course

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.560
they'd have to estimate.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.060
And it looks as though for big
numbers, you use a somewhat

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.750
different process than when
you're doing an exact

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.610
enumeration.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.764
BRADY HARAN: What do I
do for big numbers?

00:09:26.764 --> 00:09:29.130
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, you make an estimate

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.750
which is based on extracting
various visual properties from

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.070
the stimulus.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.290
And there's now some brilliant
work done by Marco Zorzi's lab

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.590
in Italy, where they've modeled
how this might work.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.645
But for numbers up to about 9
or 10-- for some people, it

00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:46.870
might be a bit more--

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.570
there's a way in which you kind
of can enumerate even if

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.370
you're not actually
verbally counting.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.940
BRADY HARAN: I feel like when
I'm doing it, like when you

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.290
showed me the six,
I counted three.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.280
And then I kind of made a
little split and counted

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.530
another three and added
them together.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.690
Is that a normal thing?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.760
Is everyone doing that?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.780
Or are some people counting
them one by one?

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.810
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Dyscalculics will

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.990
count one by one.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.070
This is one of the interesting
things about dyscalculics.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.350
They're very bad at doing the
estimating, using the

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.820
estimating strategy.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.830
You can do it with
three and three--

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.700
we've done some work on this--

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.600
but you won't do it
on three and four.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.390
So you won't say, well, there's
a group of three and

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.170
there's a group of four.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.710
It doesn't give you
any advantage.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.600
For reasons we don't fully
understand, having two

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.000
visually separable groups
of the same

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.540
number is an advantage.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.300
But having two visually
separable groups of different

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.510
numbers, for reasons I don't
understand, doesn't give you

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.220
any advantage.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.470
BRADY HARAN: Well, you
know more than me.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.970
I feel like with seven, I would
count three and four.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.938
Or maybe I would do
three and twos.

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:48.430
I don't know.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.860
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Well, come into the lab for

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.140
some tests and we'll see
what you really do.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.670
BRADY HARAN: There's
two there.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.310
PROFESSOR BRIAN BUTTERWORTH:
Yes.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.560
Correct.
