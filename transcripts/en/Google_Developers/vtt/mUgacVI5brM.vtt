LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.160
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.940
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.950
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.240
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.090
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.880
and why they do it, and today
we're going to do exactly that.

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:24.400
Welcome to "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm Laurence Moroney,
and today I'm

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.700
going to be chatting with
Brian Dorsey, who's a Developer

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.060
Advocate on our Cloud team.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.445
And we're going to be talking
a lot about containers.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:36.100
And if anybody's been in any
way associated with web or cloud

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.200
or anything for about
the last 18 months,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.960
containers are
this red-hot topic.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.120
And what's all the fuss?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.040
Can you tell us all about it?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.081
BRIAN DORSEY: Absolutely.

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.500
I think it's definitely
about-- fundamentally

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.021
about developer efficiency
and operations efficiency.

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:48.895
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:49.690
BRIAN DORSEY: And
there are a whole bunch

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.790
of technical things, like the
packaging and distribution

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.870
of the stuff that gets
us there, but really it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.310
just about letting
you spend more

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.660
time on building your
stuff rather than trying

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.827
to keep it happy.

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:01.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: And like
the two-minute elevator

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.327
pitch, what is a container?

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:04.160
What's all the fuss?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.230
BRIAN DORSEY: So it's
implemented on a Linux kernel

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.400
and with file system
stuff, a set of APIs

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.170
that when used
together, it makes

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.580
a nice little encapsulation
for your software.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.430
So you've got a file system
and actually process rights

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.110
carved up in a little
box, and so you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.540
can make sure that your
machine, your software,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880
always runs the same way.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.572
You've probably had
the experience of,

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:29.780
"works on my machine," right?

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.860
BRIAN DORSEY: And doesn't--

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: It doesn't
work on somebody else's, yes.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.630
BRIAN DORSEY: So at
some level, that's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.380
one of the key things
you're solving here,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.130
is that since you have
the exact same file

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.510
system, every time
you run it, it

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.570
works the same way everywhere.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.606
BRIAN DORSEY: And then with
the process level stuff,

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:46.299
you also get really
nice controls

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.715
of how much of the processor--
whose processor it can use.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:49.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.190
BRIAN DORSEY: So you
can keep it-- you know,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.773
if you've got some
Brian code running,

00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:54.852
you can keep it from
going a little crazy.

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:56.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Brian code.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.110
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.730
That's a code word for
maybe a little bit rushed.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.850
Now, it sounds
like when we start

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.530
talking about templatizing,
operating systems, and all

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.595
this kind of thing that's
for big enterprises

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.970
to be able to use, but that's
not really the case, right?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.094
BRIAN DORSEY: So this stuff
is useful at all levels

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:18.097
and, in fact, the big push
18 months to two years ago,

00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:20.180
these APIs have been around
Linux for a long time,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.305
but Docker, the company,
wrapped it up very nicely

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:24.930
in a nice UI, made
it very easy to use,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.505
and their focus was very much
on the developer experience.

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:28.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.470
BRIAN DORSEY: So
regardless of how big

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.230
the eventual end
production size is,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.427
it helps you as a developer run
your stuff more cleanly, help

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.010
you collaborate with
other developers,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.718
help you collaborate
with the test folks,

00:02:41.718 --> 00:02:43.426
so when you hand
off something, they

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:44.800
get to test the
exact same thing,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.716
and then that same thing
goes into production,

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:47.680
working the same way.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.096
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now at Google we

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:50.410
have this Kubernetes software?

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.750
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: What
is that all about?

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.110
BRIAN DORSEY: So that
comes out of-- you know,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.901
Google's been running
containers internally

00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.800
for a very long
time, and you may

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.130
have heard that the initial
kernel API work was actually

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.970
pushed into Linux
kernel, starting

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.120
from [INAUDIBLE] to Google.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.490
BRIAN DORSEY: So we've got a
bunch of experience doing that,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.419
but it's all built
up internally,

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.960
and it's all connected
to our system,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.550
so the Kubernetes Project
is an open source project

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.500
to bring those same patterns
out into the whole world.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.830
So we've got-- it's open
source, it's up on GitHub.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.480
It runs on a wide
variety of places.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.184
So you can run Kubernetes
on Compute Engine

00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:31.350
and on Google Cloud, but
you can also run it on AWS.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.892
You can run it on
your own computers.

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:34.308
You can run it all
over the place.

00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:35.970
And I haven't really
said what it is.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.600
So once you have these
units of a container,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.392
so I've got my one process,
and it runs really well.

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:43.850
What happens when
I want a thousand

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.110
of those cooperating with
dozens of some other process

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.780
and hundreds of some other
process, and all of a sudden

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.760
I've got this-- these are all
running on hundreds of hosts,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.520
maybe.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.710
So this is a big example.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.260
BRIAN DORSEY: How do you
keep track of it all?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.010
And so Kubernetes
really helps with that.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.190
That's its core mission,
using these templates

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.890
you talked about and things.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.990
But then, as an
individual developer,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.115
if you just are trying to
make a copy of production

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:09.710
that's small enough that you
can actually get it to run,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.860
but it still needs a front
end, a database, cache,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.410
various pieces.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.810
You can spin up just
one of each, small ones,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.070
and have the whole thing up
and working the same way.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.149
LAURENCE MORONEY: Are
there any good examples

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.430
of that that are out there,
maybe somebody has documented?

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.280
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.720
A little leading.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.190
But we might be thinking
of the same thing.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.080
One of the other Developer
Advocates, Julia Ferraioli,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.970
wrote a really nice post
on-- a series of posts

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.560
on using Docker and
Kubernetes to actually run

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.435
a "Minecraft" server.

00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:39.309
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.470
BRIAN DORSEY: And "Minecraft"
is this just amazing

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.660
block-oriented,
virtual world thing

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.030
with lots and lots of plug-ins.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.654
So one of the things
that's challenging

00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:49.272
is how do you make sure that
your "Minecraft" world is safe

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:51.480
when you start experimenting
with different plug-ins,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.770
and you want it to roll
forward new versions and back,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.853
and then you want it to
stay running all the time,

00:04:55.853 --> 00:04:58.230
because you don't want
to-- like all software,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.438
you don't want to be paged
in the middle of the night

00:05:00.438 --> 00:05:02.100
because your "Minecraft"
server's down.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right, and
also, from my understanding,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.820
if you want to build
a "Minecraft" server,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.650
you're not just getting Linux
and MySQL and maybe Apache.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.025
There's all these other things
that you need to install--

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:11.300
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: --and
then encapsulate that

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.270
and able to clone that
because of containers.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.061
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah.

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.860
So they've got official
Docker images of all the stuff

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.030
"Minecraft" needs to run--

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.010
BRIAN DORSEY: --and then you
can light that up and go,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.843
and then Kubernetes
gives you the management

00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:27.000
of that and networking.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.640
And one way to think
about it, I guess,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.310
is kind of like if you're
familiar with process

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.200
runners like systemd,
you get something

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.490
like systemd but spread
across a bunch of machines.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.490
BRIAN DORSEY: So
you're like, I want

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.810
to make sure 10 copies of this
are always running no matter

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.430
what.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.010
BRIAN DORSEY: And
you just hand it off

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.350
and then the system actually
keeps that happening.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.030
So instead of just-- you kind
of follow a to-do list maybe,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.406
but at the end you just
hope it keeps working.

00:05:52.406 --> 00:05:53.780
In the Kubernetes
world, you say,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.480
I want 10 of these
running always--

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.305
BRIAN DORSEY: --and if anything
happens with any of those,

00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:00.763
Kubernetes will go and then
start a new one somewhere else,

00:06:00.763 --> 00:06:02.996
you know, if a whole
host goes away.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:03.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.592
So in summary, it's
almost like the Docker

00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:08.300
and the containers
technology is allowing

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.740
me to build these easily
replicable machines,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.120
but then Kubernetes adds
on top of that to make

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.340
it really easy to manage.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.256
BRIAN DORSEY: Exactly.

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:18.040
And assembling them all
together into a real system,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.310
because all systems are
pretty complicated, right?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.810
They kind of grow--

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.153
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And they're always

00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:26.610
more complicated than you
thought they were going to be.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.055
BRIAN DORSEY: Than you
wanted them to be, right?

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.013
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.230
BRIAN DORSEY: Absolutely.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.760
Then trying to replicate
that in other environments,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.600
that's where it really
is very powerful.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.367
Now how would a developer
get started with all of this?

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.200
BRIAN DORSEY: Right.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.280
So it does run kind
of anywhere, right?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.945
So you can run on your own
machines, and run it in ABS,

00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:48.769
run it in Google Cloud.

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:50.310
Because of some of
the things it does

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.889
to make it really easy to
connect these pieces together,

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.430
setting up the
networking piece of it

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.305
can be a little bit
challenging if you're not

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:57.770
in a cloud environment.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.536
So my recommendation-- maybe
this is a little bit biased,

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:02.410
but definitely the
easiest way to get started

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.030
is to use the Google
Cloud free trial,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.565
and there's a one-click startup
for a Kubernetes cluster.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:08.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.080
BRIAN DORSEY: So you literally
go down and hit a button

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.320
and say, give me a
Kubernetes cluster.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.278
A few minutes later,
you'll have a live cluster

00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:15.660
that you can push "Minecraft"
to or your software

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.232
or whatever else
you'd like to run.

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:18.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.240
BRIAN DORSEY: Also
I think the key

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.280
there is separating getting
the cluster up and running

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.010
versus running your software on
it, because the new stuff here,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.900
in a way, is really
thinking about building

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.320
your software out
of small pieces

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.450
and then defining
how those connect

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.310
to each other in this
kind of template,

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.070
and so that's a really
easy way to play with that.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:40.990
Cool.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.830
BRIAN DORSEY: And then
when you're like, OK,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.620
I want to run it in
this specific place,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.680
you can fiddle with cluster
admin as a separate process

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.380
from--

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.380
BRIAN DORSEY: --kind
of running software

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.120
in one of these clusters.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.078
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.140
So you can really--
getting started

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.007
with one button for
Kubernetes, but then you

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.840
can really start building
stuff in the Cloud

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.725
via "Minecraft" server or
maybe some other kind of server

00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:00.600
that you want to run.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.620
I fiddled with the building
3D rendering servers,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.007
and this was precontainers--

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:05.840
BRIAN DORSEY: Right.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.630
LAURENCE MORONEY:
--so every machine

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.280
had like a thousand things
that I needed to install,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.230
and then I had to do
it again the next time,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.260
and again the next time.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.900
BRIAN DORSEY: Run a new version.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.400
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It drove me crazy.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.050
BRIAN DORSEY: And this is partly
coming from just containers,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.675
but then when you start thinking
about a whole system of these,

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:21.910
it makes upgrading your
system really easy--

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.690
BRIAN DORSEY:
--because each version

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.100
has the exact pieces it needs.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.340
But the other kind
of magic thing there

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.260
that I never achieved
personally is

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.470
that I got to where I had
automated upgrades, systems

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:32.970
working.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.705
BRIAN DORSEY: But getting it
so you could do a downgrade,

00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:38.140
so you could roll back
to a previous version--

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's tricky.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.369
BRIAN DORSEY: --that's harder,
and containers and Kubernetes

00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:43.130
together allow you to do that.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.640
It's the exact same process
to roll forward a version

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.730
as it is to roll back--

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.200
BRIAN DORSEY: --and you
have this atomic unit.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:49.880
Cool.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.650
BRIAN DORSEY: It's
really exciting.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: So developers
get started on the Google Cloud

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:53.770
Console?

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.550
BRIAN DORSEY: That's
a great place to go.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.865
The other thing to do
is check kubernetes.io.

00:08:56.865 --> 00:08:57.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.740
BRIAN DORSEY: So I'll
give you that link,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.080
and I've got a bunch
of overview information

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.940
there, and then a link
to the GitHub site,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.170
where all the active
stuff is going.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.170
And as a developer
perspective, it's really fun,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.940
because there's a huge number
of core people from Google who

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.580
built our orchestration stuff
internally, Borg and Omega,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.010
but also a bunch of folks from
Red Hat and [? CORAL-S, ?]

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.020
and a bunch of other folks
from the open source community,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.292
a lot of individuals as well.

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:24.750
And so you get to see all of
these people doing code review

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.291
and arguing over
design in public.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.540
So if you've ever wondered
how Googlers do code review

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.055
or argue, it's a really fun
place to go check it out.

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:35.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: So yeah, I
could sell tickets for that.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.742
BRIAN DORSEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.020
Well, thank you so much, Brian.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.770
And thanks, everybody, for
watching this episode of Coffee

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.430
with a Googler.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.730
I don't know about you, but I've
learned a lot about containers

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.555
and Kubernetes and
managing containers

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:48.080
and how all that works.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.630
If you want to learn
more about this,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.270
check out the links in
the description below.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.980
And if you want to see any
more content around Kubernetes

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.600
or any more cloud content,
check out the Google Developers

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.100
channel.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.930
If you have any questions for
me or any questions for Brian,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.590
just leave them in
the comments below.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.340
Thank you so much.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.609
