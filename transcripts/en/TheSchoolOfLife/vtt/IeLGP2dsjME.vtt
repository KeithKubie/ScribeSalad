00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.460
It’s easy to have a pretty negative view of drugs:

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.100
the news is always going on about police raids on drug dealers,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.100
kids tripping dangerously at raves, overdoses and rehab.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.140
It goes without saying: things can go horrifically wrong around drugs.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.920
But our intense awareness of the negatives is in danger of creating a misleadingly narrow view of the subject.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.600
Drugs are – at best – serious, dignified, noble and important, and we need more of them in our lives.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.540
The real issue is: we don’t have a correct sense of what a drug is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.940
and what the drugs might be that we in particular truly need.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.200
Essentially a drug is a thing, anything, that alters your mood,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.600
acting via either the body or the senses to make an impact upon the mind.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.620
We’ve come to associate the impact of drugs with the heightening of a particular band of emotional states:

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.020
the weird, the escapist, the hyperactive and the ecstatically relaxed.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.860
But in truth, there are far more interesting, fruitful and positive directions in which we should want our minds to be altered.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.700
We’re only at the start of understanding the possibility of drugs.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.820
The task of a drug is simply to alter moods in any positive direction compatible with fulfilling one’s highest ambitions.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.100
So we need drugs to help us be more self-analytical, more hopeful, less prone to irritability,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.820
more politically tolerant and better at listening to other people,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.100
especially partners, when they have legitimate complaints against us.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.260
Fortunately, there are a lot more things that are drugs than we ordinarily suppose.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.060
We need to move away from the idea of drugs as pills that someone gives you at a party when you’re 16,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.240
that will make you feel high, sick, possibly kill you – and make you look cool and shock your parents.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400
The word ‘drug’ happens to be sitting on a crucially important and large idea:

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.100
the generation of benign and positive states of mind through the use of external physical resources.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.120
Any properly accurate list of drugs we have available should now include the following:

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.100
Pomegranate Juice

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.800
Coffee stimulates, but in the right dosage, just-squeezed orange-juice (with a touch of lemon) briefly strengthens the will

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.540
and makes us more able to face tricky tasks.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.760
The much less well known pomegranate juice has a soothing, calming effect

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.680
which helps one be less prickly around perceived insults and slights.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.280
The Paintings of Caspar David Friedrich

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.420
This physical object, titled 'Morning in the Riesengebirge' by the German 19th-century Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.760
is a drug that hangs on a wall

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.460
and is intended to produce an expanded state of consciousness

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.220
in which the pain of immediate troubles is lessened by a euphoric recognition of the immensity of nature on the cosmos.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.280
Emmental Cheese

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.300
It’s mild, savoury taste and yielding (but not crumbly) texture quickly bring on a feeling of repleteness.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.640
Emmental is a quick anxiety reducer.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.600
Like chocolate and hot buttered toast, Emmental is an envy-suppressing drug.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.660
Mozart’s Aria: Soave sia il vento

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.100
This musical drug briefly induces a heightened state of tenderness towards strangers

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.040
and a mood of generosity towards one’s own and others’ stupidity when it comes to relationships.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.140
Of course, the precise effects of these substances will vary from one person to the next

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.560
so a key task with these and all drugs is to get good at working out what we really need to optimise our own functioning.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.240
What might be a crucial corrective for one person could be deeply unhelpful for another.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.940
In wiser societies than ours, we would have drug advisers advisors, available in hotels, shopping malls and online.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.720
People who would do a full audit of our natures

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.420
and come up with extended menus for what sort of drugs might be most suitable for our given characters.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.740
and in what doses and at what times of day we should take them.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.140
In the past, ambitious societies have looked very seriously at drugs,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.900
and the thing they did was to organize drug use into rituals.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.600
A very popular drug – tea – was employed in Buddhist ceremonies in Japan from the 13th century onwards.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.300
The drug was used to promote focus, concentration and a feeling of strong connection to other human beings.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.040
You might have to sit in a particular way taking your tea drug;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.700
wait patiently to be served and consume a very specific quantity

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.500
while contemplating the branch of a pine tree in the wind.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.440
The Ancient Greeks were also very interested in drugs.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.320
Their ritual – known as the Dionysian Mysteries –

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.700
was built around the highly structured use of red wine as part of a religious festival.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.000
Participants would drink and dance in search of a sense of collective belonging, as decreed by the God Dionysus.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.300
By making what might otherwise descend into binge drinking into a religious festival,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.940
the Greeks cleverly directed the immense power of alcohol towards the most beneficial states of mind.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.320
Instead of being a reason for getting into an argument with one’s spouse, or messing up a wedding speech,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.840
wine became an occasion for fostering trust and loyalty between citizens in the city.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040
Moods play an immense role in our lives

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.220
and yet we tend to be haphazard in the way we identify and deal with them.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.060
At present, we play around with moods with hugely clumsy and dangerous instruments

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.120
with drugs that we hardly understand and that can have a devastating impact on our well-being.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.800
We need to broaden our sense of what a drug is, allow Mozart and Emmental cheese into the mix,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.600
and then have a system that correctly directs people to what might be the right drugs for them,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.980
with their flourish been the end goal.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.800
We’re still at the dawn of learning how to take drugs properly:

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.700
we're sure to learn to be far better drug takers in the future.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.580
 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.180
 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.060
