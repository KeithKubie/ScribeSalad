00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.000
One year ago tonight,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.735
we started doing this show.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.136
(cheering and applause)

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.472
One year ago. Wow!

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.275
Man! Can you believe it?

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.078
Whew! That's right, man.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.815
It's our one-year anniversary.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.817
You know what, I have to say,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.820
we got a-a very, very thoughtful
gift.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.823
Um, Donald Trump was kind enough
to talk about religion.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.425
Mm-hmm. Very nice.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.694
Which brings us
to tonight's Unblackening.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.663
(dramatic music playing)

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.167
(humming)

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.304
Now, one of the key,
uh, constituents

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.639
that Donald Trump has to win
over are the evangelicals.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.776
Now, they make up 57%
of the caucus-goers in Iowa.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.178
And according to Trump,
he's in good standing.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.981 line:0%
I have a very great relationship
with God.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.318 line:0%
And I have a very great
relationship with evangelicals.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.057
If Trump and God have
a great relationship,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.460
it's probably because
they never see each other.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.529
That can work, right?

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:40.133
All right. So he is winning over
some of the evangelical vote,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.902
but, uh, I think
he's (bleep) about God.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.905 line:0%
I'm wondering what one or two
of your most favorite

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:48.508 line:0%
-Bible, uh, verses are and why.
-Well, I-I wouldn't want

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.443 line:0%
to get into it, because, to me,
that's very personal.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.311 line:0%
Are you an Old Testament guy
or a New Testament guy?

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.814 line:0%
Uh, probably... equal.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.685
Probably equal?

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.889
Am I the only one seeing
how transparent this is?

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.691
You've never read the Bible,
Donald Trump!

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.361
I mean, come on. If
Trump ever even touched a Bible,

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:12.198
<i> it probably sizzled.</i>

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.534
But Donald Trump's got
to convince the an...

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.470
the evangelicals that he's
as full of Jesus as they are,

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.139
so yesterday he took
his dual-testament-loving self

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:21.941
to Liberty University.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.277
Now, the first thing he did,
of course, was brag

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.711
about the crowd size.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:28.047 line:0%
We broke the record.
You know, we had the record

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.583 line:0%
for about three or four years
the last time.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:33.920 line:0%
And the first thing I said to
Jerry and Becki when I got here,

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.521 line:0%
"Did we break the record?"

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.657 line:0%
They said, "Yes, you did,
by quite a bit."

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.628 line:0%
So we'll dedicate that to
Martin Luther King, a great man.

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.030
Dr. King?

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.032
How did he get in this?

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.034
What do you mean, dedicate?

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.102
Dr. King's not
your 16-year-old girlfriend.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.505
What does that mean?
(groans)

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.374
But let me just break down that
entire statement for you guys.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:58.778
Okay, Liberty students
are required by the university

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.179
to attend these rallies.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.114
So if Trump broke a record
for attendance,

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:05.384
it's only because
Liberty enrollment is up,

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:09.522
not because every student
actually wanted to be there.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.525
So he's basically talking out
of his ass, which, by the way,

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.528
he wants to dedicate
to Dr. King.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.530
-Mm. But Tru...
-(awwing)

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.365
(laughing):
Okay.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.235
"Aw, Larry."

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.037
But Trump vowed to fight
for this religion

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.739
he so clearly
never thinks about.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:29.742 line:0%
We're going
to protect Christianity.

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:33.613 line:0%
And I can say that. I don't have
to be politically correct or...

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.949
Or correct-correct.

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:39.619
All right, Donald. You're being
a little too general.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.621
You need to be more specific,
Donald.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.557
You know, quote something.
I... You know, I got an idea.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.425
Quote something every Christian
would know--

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:47.893
or even non-Christians--
you know,

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:50.296
something
like Second Corinthians, right?

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.732
I mean, who hasn't heard
of Second Corinthians?

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.067 line:0%
I hear this is a major theme
right here,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.971 line:0%
but Two Corinthians, right?
Two Corinthians 3:17.

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.640 line:0%
That's the whole ball game.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.976 line:0%
"Where the spirit
of the Lord..." Right?

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.113 line:0%
"Where the spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty."

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.914 line:0%
And here there is
Liberty College, but...

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:11.917 line:0%
Liberty University,
but it is so true.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.420 line:0%
You know, when you think...
And that's really...

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:17.256 line:0%
Is that the one?
Is that the one you like?

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.225
(groaning)

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.832
There is so much wrong
with that.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.634
You know what I love about this?

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.303
He doesn't even know

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.973
how wrong "Two Corinthians"
sounds, right?

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.775
He's oblivious to it.
And when people laugh,

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.109
he acts like he was
the originator

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:39.445
of that mysterious joke.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:41.314
Now,
for you non-religious people,

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:42.782
let me see
if I can give you an analogy.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.317
Let's say
you're a big<i> Star Wars</i> fan,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.919
and someone comes to speak
to your<i> Star Wars</i> group.

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:50.990
Um, in this scenario,
you have no life, okay?

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.259
They say they're
a huge<i> Star Wars</i> fan,

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.328
that they have a great
relationship with<i> Star Wars,</i>

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.263
okay? Mmm.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:05:00.466
And then they say, "Okay, I want
to talk about the Farce, right?

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.902
"We're all strong
with the Farce, right?

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.771
"That's what you guys like, the
Farce. You know what I'm saying?

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:07.773
"I know. You're laughing.
'Cause we love the Farce.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.975
"Who doesn't love the Farce?
Yeah, you're still laughing

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:11.977
"'cause the Farce is awesome.
The Farce is strong

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.113
"with Luther Vandross Skywalker,
right?

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:16.782
Am I right? The Farce."

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.751
(groaning)

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:22.922
Okay.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.458
It's clear that Trump
doesn't know the Bible,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.327
but there is a book
that, uh, he knows very well.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.628 line:0%
I wrote<i> The Art of the Deal.</i>

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.097 line:0%
Who has read<i> The Art of the Deal</i>
 in this room?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.598 line:0%
Everybody.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.371
I think three people clapped.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.373
Trump says, "Everybody."

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.174
I'm sorry. But I interrupted.
You were in the middle

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.843
of some (bleep).
Please continue.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.344 line:0%
Who has read<i> The Art of the Deal</i>
 in this room?

00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:47.680 line:0%
Everybody. I always say...

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:53.018 line:0%
I always say a deep, deep second
to the Bible.

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.687 line:0%
The Bible is the best.
The Bible.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.690 line:0%
The Bible blows it away.
There's nothing like the Bi...

00:05:57.723 --> 00:06:00.493
Please stop it. Just
stop him from talking, please.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.495
I can't take it anymore.
Come on, God, what,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.764
are you out of lightning bolts?

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.566
Don't you smite anymore?

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.103
He just elevated his crappy
book,<i> The Art of the Deal,</i>

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.372
to just below the Bible.

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:16.175
Can't you see what he's trying
to do, Liberty U?

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:20.780
He's trying to close the deal
on you guys.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:24.650
He's trying to convince you
that he's just like you.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:27.153
Evangelicals,
you have to listen to me.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.355
Look, you can be forgiven for
falling in love with Ted Cruz

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.591
and Black Droopy the Dog.

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:37.630
Hmm? But you'll never
be forgiven

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.732
for falling in love
with this troll.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:42.034
You know what?

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:45.204
It's probably hard for you to
hear me when I talk like this.

00:06:45.237 --> 00:06:48.407
You know, let me say it
more evangelically, all right?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.042
(organ music playing)

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.979
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:58.083
I'm talking to you,
evangelicals.

00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:01.320
You know you make up 57%
of the caucus-goers,

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:03.289
-so you are our last hope.
-(audience shouting out)

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.091
For the bulwark
against the creep of evil ivy

00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:08.661
-that is Donald Trump.
-(audience chatter)

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:11.597
And he is growing wild!
Can I get an amen?

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.165
AUDIENCE:
Amen!

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:14.533
He is a snake in the grass,

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.735
and you must cast him out
like the devil!

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:19.305
-(audience shouting out)
-"2 Corinthians"?

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:23.242
What man of God can't name
a bible verse?

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:24.877
(audience shouting out)

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.879
How about... how about...
how about, "Jesus wept?"

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.747
(whoops and shouting)

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.549
'Cause Jesus himself is weeping

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:32.251
at how big an asshole
Donald Trump is.

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:33.853
Did I say asshole?
Yes, I did.

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.688
But God will forgive me 'cause
I'm talking about Donald Trump.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.590
I'm gonna need another "amen"
over here very quickly!

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.492
-AUDIENCE: Amen!
-All right.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.660
And who in the name
of the Almighty

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.562
doesn't know the New Testament
from the Old?

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.331
WOMAN:
You tell 'em, Preacher.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.566
The Old Testament is the one
with all the damn smiting.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.336
Some of us knows
there is a difference!

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.204
-(audience shouting)
-WOMAN: There's a difference!

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.139
What I challenge you to do,
evangelicals,

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:56.375
is to smite down
Donald Trump's campaign!

00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:57.710
MAN:
Hallelujah!

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.178
Smite it down!

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.913
Give me an amen
for the smiting down!

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.381
AUDIENCE:
Amen!

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:04.650
Smite down the Trump campaign

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:08.487
and loose ourselves of the grip
that this-this...

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.623
MAN:
Take your time now.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.625
WOMAN:
Take your time! Take your time!

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.493
-(applause)
-I can't do this.

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.562
-WOMAN: Take your time.
-I will.

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:20.466
(overlapping shouting)

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:21.634
Hold on.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.503
WOMAN:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:27.339
-That this... that this false
prophet. -(whooping)

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:29.942
This idolater has on the caucus.

00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.878
He is a<i> fever </i>
that must be broken,

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:35.147
-and the only cure is truth!
-WOMAN: Truth!

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.049
-Am I right about the truth?
-(overlapping shouting)

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:39.118
Then how did I not get an amen
for the truth?

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.619
AUDIENCE:
Amen!

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:43.222
-Y'all don't hear me this
morning! -(overlapping shouting)

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:46.058
Now let's exorcise
this demonic abomination

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.426
from our national conversation!

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:50.262
Remove this devil-uh
from the... from the...

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:52.631
-from the voting booth-uh!
-(audience voicing assent)

00:08:52.664 --> 00:08:55.701
Cast him-uh forth!
Cast him...

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:57.403
Let me hear you say
"Cast him-uh."

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.737
AUDIENCE:
Cast him-uh!

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.873
-Let me hear you say "Forth-uh!"
-AUDIENCE: Forth-uh!

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.776
-Let me hear you just say "Uh!"
-AUDIENCE: Uh!

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.911
-(laughter, overlapping shouts)
-Yeah.

00:09:05.944 --> 00:09:08.447
Yield... yield not
to the temptation of Trump,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.716
but be sure
to send along your donations

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.752
-to<i> The Nightly Show</i> ministries.
-(laughter)

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:16.755
No donation is too big or too
small in the eyes of the Lord.

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.958
Much like Jesus,
we'll be right back.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.061
-(cheers and applause)
-Can I get an amen? Uh...
