00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:03.488
(beeping)

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.519
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.640
Bipedal.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.900
Naked.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.923
Large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.863
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.893
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.790
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.220
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.483
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.087 --> 00:01:24.754
(ambient music)

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.177
(uptempo music)

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.100
- I'm gonna present some
data from a study I did

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840
to evaluate the ecology
of hominin scavenging

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.860
but I'll start by talking
a bit more broadly

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.930
about how archaeologists can use evidence

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480
from butchered animal bones

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.880
to understand prehistoric meat-eating

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480
in terms of potentially
both hunting and scavenging.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730
So, if someone who studies prehistory

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.880
I start with a totally blank canvas

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.730
when I attempt to reconstruct
the diets of ancient humans.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.190
I try to paint a picture
of the past that I know

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.740
will always be incomplete.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.830
We will never have all the pixels

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.120
but I'm dedicated to finding the filters

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.190
on the lenses through which
we can peer back in time

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.340
and try to reconstruct
something rich in detail

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
like this National Geographic illustration

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.666
of what I can only describe
as a hominin meat picnic.

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.666
(audience laughing)

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.360
One of the fun things about
studying hominin meat-eating

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.260
is there are so many
different lines of evidence

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.280
that we can use to do so.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.470
We can use chimpanzee
and human forager diets

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.370
and the talks earlier today
have addressed some of these.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.910
We can look at hominin fossils themselves,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.710
we can look at the size
and shape of teeth.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.170
The talk before mine by
Margaret addressed this a bit.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.060
We can look at jaws and skulls

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.750
and we can look at even
body size and shape.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.740
We can also look at the chemistry

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.990
which is what the talk
before mine really focused on

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.450
of those actual hominin fossils.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.030
We can look at animal fossils

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.920
particularly those with
direct evidence for butchery

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.630
and that's what I'll focus
on a little bit after this.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.750
To do that we often use
a method called actualism

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.200
where we either do experiments
or make observations

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.620
in the present.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.270
We look at bones on the present for traces

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.930
left of behavior from those
experiments or observations.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.340
We then look at fossils in the past,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220
see if we can find similar traces

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.300
and then we can infer
that similar behaviors

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.150
occurred in the past.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.220
We can also look at the
archeological record

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.710
at tools made by hominins

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.150
that were used for meat-eating

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.050
and we can even use newer methods

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.740
like looking at ancient molecules.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.580
And so less than a year half ago

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.860
a team of archeologists
announced that they found

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.580
ancient animal proteins,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.320
basically the residue of blood,
skin and flesh from animals

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.380
on the edges of 17 stone tools

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.230
from an excavation in Jordan

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.440
dating back to 250,000 years ago.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.120
It kind of blows my mind a bit

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.720
that now we have direct evidence

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.880
for even what kinds of animals
hominins were butchering

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.490
a quarter of a million years ago.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.730
In this case we're talking about camels,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.493
wild cattle, rhino, horses and duck.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.500
So I use a method called taphonomy,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.640
this is the lens that I
most often look through

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.590
to examine the diets of early humans.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.350
Taphonomy is the study of
what happens to an organism

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.400
after its death until its
discovery as a fossil.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.290
Here's a great illustration by a paper

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.370
by Nina Jablonski and
colleagues of a possible

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.310
taphonomic scenario
resulting in the accumulation

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.340
of giant panda bones in a cave in China.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.270
I'm particularly
interested in what happens

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.950
right at and after death.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.820
So that's that middle row really between

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.370
boxes number three and four.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.160
And when it comes to thinking
about hominin meat-eating

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.670
the main way to investigate this

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.990
is through the study of animal
fossils with butchery marks

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.280
including cut marks made from skinning,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.900
disarticulating and defleshing animals,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.120
as well as percussion marks
left by bashing bones open

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.100
to get at the fat and calorie-rich marrow.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.390
I also study tooth marks

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.590
and other chewing damage
left by carnivores.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.040
The lens I use is literally a hand lens,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.420
like a simple magnifying
glass that I can use

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.543
to identify these marks on fossil bones.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.300
So I'm gonna take you
on a taphonomic timeline

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.310
of what we know about
the earliest evidence

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.620
for hominin carnivory.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.560
And the bulk of the evidence
for the earliest carnivory

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.070
in human evolutionary history

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.660
really comes from three sites in Ethiopia.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.360
The oldest is a 3.3 million
year old site called Dikika

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.500
where a team led by people

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.550
including Jessica Thompson
and Shannon McPherron

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.210
discovered just a handful of bones

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.910
including those pictured on the left

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.460
with possible butchery marks on them.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.650
Two other sites from Ethiopia
called Gona and Bouri,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.620
the bones on the right
are from pictures of bones

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.290
with butchery marks from Bouri.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.390
Those date to 2.6 and 2.5
million years ago respectively.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.593
They also preserve a handful
of butchery mark fossils.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.040
While much ink has been spilled

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.190
about whether some of these marks

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.540
are actually butchery marks

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.770
and not marks made by
crocodiles, mammalian carnivores

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.350
or other butchery mark mimics
like sedimentary abrasion,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.610
the importance of these sites

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.380
is that they signal the beginning

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.570
of a dietary shift in hominin
evolution to occasionally

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.690
but apparently only occasionally,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.303
butchering and eating animals.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.620
There was a shift at two million years ago

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.310
when we have the first evidence of

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.890
both persistent carnivory and
early access to small animals

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.120
and I'll explain what that means.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.840
And the image up here is of
some butchered animal fossils

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.200
from this site called Kanjera South

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.600
in Southwestern Kenya.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.650
This is some research
that I've been involved in

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.340
led by Rick Potts and Tom Plummer

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.130
as well as Jennifer
Parkinson and Joe Ferraro

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.380
At Kanjera there's clear evidence

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.930
from hundreds of butchery mark
fossil bones, animal bones,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.070
that hominins acquired and processed

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.790
numerous relatively complete
small animal carcasses

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.180
for meat and marrow.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.310
They got to these animals
first before other predators

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.970
and butchered the meatier parts of them,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.510
so that's the early access part.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.240
The Kanjera hominins also had at least

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.100
occasional access to meat and marrow

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.630
from larger-sized animals,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.200
an important difference between
this and the earlier sites

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.500
where we do see evidence
of hominin butchery

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.460
is that there's evidence
for hominin butchery

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.460
on bones at Kanjera from
three stratigraphic intervals

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.090
that span hundreds to thousands of years.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.930
So hominins were coming back

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.140
to this place in Southwestern
Kenya over and over again

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.690
over a long period of
time to butcher animals.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.150
This is what persistent carnivory is

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.520
and this gives us a sense
that this dietary behavior

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.200
is becoming more important

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.350
or at least it's becoming
more commonplace.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.380
Just a little bit later in time

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.920
a work led by David
Braun in a place called

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.190
Koobi Fora in Northern Kenya,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.170
there's evidence for
hominin butchery marks on

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.280
turtles, crocodiles and fish.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.010
So at this time hominins
are already broadening their

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.150
butchery behavior to include both aquatic

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.640
as well as terrestrial animals.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.040
There is another shift that happened

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.520
about one and a half million years ago.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.200
From several different bone assemblages

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.690
from the sites of Olduvai Gorge

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.520
some of which date back to
about 1.8 million years ago

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.580
and Koobi Fora some of which date back

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.910
to 1.5 million years ago

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.650
led by a variety of different teams,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.460
there's evidence from the skeletal parts

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.710
that were transported and
butchered at these sites

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.130
hominins had early access
to large animal carcasses.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.630
Basically they were now able
to get to these carcasses first

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.060
and butcher the meatier
parts of large animals.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.020
The photo up here is a butchery marks

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.860
on one and a half million year
old fossil antelope leg bone

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.660
from Koobi Fora in Northern Kenya

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.750
and this is part of an
assemblage that I studied

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.903
and excavated as part of my dissertation.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.750
So, you're probably picturing hominins

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.850
striding out onto the African savanna

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.710
armed with their stone-tipped spears

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.470
getting ready to hunt these animals.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.190
Like this bronze sculpture
reconstruction of a Homo erectus

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.370
from the Hall of Human
Origins at the Smithsonian

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.563
carrying a goat-sized gazelle on her back.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.470
Well the earliest solid
evidence for hunting technology

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.690
doesn't come into the record

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.410
until half a million years ago

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.680
with the spear points from
a site called Kathu Pan

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.760
in South Africa that have what are called

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.520
diagnostic impact fractures on their tips

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.840
indicating that they were definitely used

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.590
as the ends of weapons.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.700
It's possible that hominins were hunting

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.340
with unmodified rocks or
sharpened sticks made into spears

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.350
maybe like the Fongoli chimpanzees

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.250
or other basically
archeologically invisible tools

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.440
but we haven't figured out
a way to detect this yet

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.880
in the prehistoric record.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.620
And this is particularly likely

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.200
in the case of the small
animals at Kanjera,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.940
so many of the small animals
themselves were juveniles

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.980
and very young defenseless antelopes

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.520
are often stashed in thick grass clumps

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.680
for several weeks by their mothers,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.930
and doesn't take very
sophisticated technology

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.950
to basically walk up to
those little antelopes

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.700
and bop them on the head
and then you have dinner.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.270
So what made early human carnivory

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.280
or early hominin carnivory unique

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.180
particularly compared to the possible diet

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.000
of our earliest ancestors,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.360
as well as the diets of chimpanzees?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.120
There are four things.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.260
The first is that it involved big animals.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.560
And so, animals much
larger than themselves.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.690
As you heard from the talks earlier today,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.620
chimpanzees don't hunt animals

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.720
that are larger than themselves.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.680
This is a really useful reconstruction

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.560
of an extinct elephant being butchered

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.290
by a group of Homo erectus

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.010
based on a one million
year old archeological site

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.670
I'm involved in studying from
a Smithsonian research site

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.593
in Southern Kenya called Olorgesailie.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.390
The second thing is that
it involved tool use

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.913
and rare occasions including
the Fongoli chimps aside,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.730
we don't think that our earliest ancestors

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.350
necessarily used tools when they hunted.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.290
Hominins also don't have the sharp teeth

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.540
of mammalian carnivores
to be able to get through

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.080
the skin of large animals,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.990
let alone slice meat off of their bones

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.640
and bash them open to get marrow.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.260
It also likely involves

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.670
something called deferred consumption

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.620
which is basically not
eating something right away

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.700
as soon as you find it.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.600
This is a weird thing that humans do.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.900
We don't go to the grocery store,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.120
sit down in the middle the aisles,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.040
open the packages and start eating,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.790
I guess unless we're really hungry.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.790
But in the earliest record
of hominin meat-eating

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.780
we have evidence that hominins
transported carcass parts

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.250
to central places for some
kind of communal consumption

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.220
potentially food sharing.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.050
So if early humans were
eating meat from large animals

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.220
for about two million years
before we have evidence,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.250
good solid evidence
for hunting technology,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.680
how were they getting access to them?

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.270
One suggestion is that they
were scavenging the leftovers

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.660
from large carnivore kills

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.390
and I should point out
that this is something

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.280
that is very rarely seen
in chimpanzee behavior.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.410
Chimps don't seem to look at dead things

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.840
and think of them as food,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.290
things that are already dead.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.010
So does scavenging look like
behaviorally and ecologically?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.100
There have been two
main kinds of scavenging

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.300
that have been proposed
for early hominins.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.980
The first is called confrontational

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.040
or aggressive or power scavenging.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.480
This is when hominins actively
chase carnivores off of kills

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.610
presumably getting access

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.460
to a lot of meat and
marrow in the process.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.740
There was probably a pretty
high risk of injury or predation

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.670
of the hominins themselves
when they did this.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.280
And there are a few hominins

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.900
with bite marks on them from carnivores

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.650
to indicate that this did
happen at least occasionally.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.820
The second is passive scavenging

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.470
and this is waiting until carnivores

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.170
are completely done eating a kill,

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.150
they've moved off, the scene is safe,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.720
hominins could go in
and eat the leftovers.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.100
One of the main criticisms of
the passive scavenging idea

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.000
is that there probably wouldn't
be much worth going after

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.410
when carnivores were
done eating their fill.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.040
But is this the case?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.880
I decided to try to answer this question

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.920
by simulating passive scavenging

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.940
in a modern African ecosystem

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.870
similar to those in which our earliest

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.310
meat-eating ancestors lived.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.740
And I'm very happy to leave simulating

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.439
confrontational scavenging
to somebody else.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.020
(audience laughing)

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.440
So is passive scavenging worth it?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.820
The research I'll be talking about here

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.120
was part of my dissertation

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.670
and it was published a few years ago

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.370
in the Journal of Human Evolution.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.320
In 2002 to 2003, I spent
seven months in a game reserve

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.390
in central Kenya called
Ol Pejeta Conservancy

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.940
which you can see here on
a zoomed in map of Kenya,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.530
and I simulated passive scavenging.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.250
I specifically chose this
conservancy, Ol Pejeta,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.030
because the felid, the
the carnivore community

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.560
is dominated by lions

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.910
and most models of hominin scavenging

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.260
are based on interactions
with large felids

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.943
including lions, leopards
and extinct saber tooths.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.000
There have been a few
other scavenging studies

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.430
that were done before mine

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.080
but these were done in the Serengeti

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.800
and Ngorongoro ecosystems of Tanzania,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.020
as well as the Maasai
Mara ecosystem of Kenya

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.730
that's actually all one big ecosystem

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.770
that happens to be separated
by an international border.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.610
But these ecosystems have unusually

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.260
high numbers of predators

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.500
and particularly high competition
among predator species.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.540
So I was interested in going
to a felid-dominated ecosystem

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.193
to simulate passive scavenging.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.150
Ol Pejeta is an African savanna ecosystem,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.760
it was about a hundred square
kilometers when I was there.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.680
It was called Sweetwaters
Game Reserve when I was there.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.210
Now it's been expanded to
almost four times that size.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.640
And here you see some images

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.470
of what it looked like there.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.970
It has mixed grassland
and woodland vegetation,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.490
all the photos on this slide are photos

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.010
I took in the reserve.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.290
The vegetation map on the top left

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.160
shows open grassy areas that are in black.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.020
They generally run east to
west on kind of high plateaus.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.240
The photos with the giraffe

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.330
with the zebras in the background

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.520
are a good example of what those

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.230
open grassy areas look like.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.810
There's a permanent river
called the Ewaso Ng'iro

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.350
that runs north south through the reserve.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.840
You can see that on the western side

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.630
with that green strip.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.120
That green is basically
riverine vegetation,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.110
trees particularly dominated
by yellow fever acacia

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.740
or acacia that's xanthophloea.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.300
There's a picture of
that on the top right.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.840
The dominant bush in the
ecosystem is called euclea.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.730
This is noted in the bright blue areas,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.990
you can see that on the top middle.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.820
Whistling thorn acacia
or acacia drepanolobium

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.280
are also very prevalent,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.820
those are noted in light
blue on the vegetation map.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.710
And the yellow and pink areas on that map

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.570
are areas of mixed bushland,
woodland and grassland

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.220
in kind of different proportions.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.470
The predator community
during the time of my study

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.000
was dominated by lions
as I mentioned already

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.580
and the herbivore community
was dominated by zebras

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.803
followed by warthog,
impala, buffalo and baboon.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.630
So, my study methods were pretty simple.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.320
After finding out about a carnivore kill

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.830
from a variety of sources

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.490
I would wait until the lions
were completely satiated

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.870
like this one in this photo

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.370
with a distended belly full of warthog,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.510
this was a really happy sleepy lion,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.300
and I would document what
was left on their kills.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.090
I had two advantages over
my earlier ancestors.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.540
I had a four-wheel drive vehicle

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.820
and I had an armed guard
with me at all times

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.580
lessening the likelihood of me becoming

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.437
one of my own samples.

00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:01.640
(audience laughing)

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.760
In the time that I was at Ol Pejeta

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.690
I collected 24 kill samples

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.400
from several different
species of carnivores

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.740
which you can see in the
left column of this table

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.330
but I'm gonna focus particularly
on the lion kills today

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.620
as that's my largest sample

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.560
and the most relevant for thinking about

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.640
models of hominins scavenging.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.850
I separated the prey
into two size divisions

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.060
related to how we classify
the size of animals

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.270
when we're doing archeological analysis,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.890
but here I'm just generally
calling them large or small.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.560
Larger animals are over 250 pounds,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.983
small animals less than 250 pounds.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.030
I documented the location and estimated

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.710
the amount of meat left over
after the lions had their fill

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.730
and here are some examples

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.480
of what these leftovers looked like.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.640
The top right is a
picture of a zebra ribcage

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.310
with quite a bit of meat left on it

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.120
and the bottom right is a
picture of a part of a limb

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.520
of a young Grant's gazelle
with hardly any scraps left.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.120
And I should say specifically

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.550
that I followed previous
researchers in defining

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.040
bulk flesh as masses of muscle more

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.610
at least 10% of their original size,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.410
flesh scraps were usually pieces of flesh

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.810
less than size of the palm of your hand

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.400
but over two to three centimeters

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.800
and weighing more than
about a third of a pound.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.590
So how much meat can a scavenger eat

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.750
from a large animal,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.980
something like a zebra
or a large antelope?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.910
I'm gonna walk you through
the axis of this graph

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.490
before I show you the data.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.010
So the x-axis is a
skeletal element or bone

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.940
arranged in groups from left to right

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.630
with the total sample size of each bone

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.180
listed in parentheses.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.143
The important part is the left two bones,

00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:28.970
they're bones of the hindlimb,

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.420
then bones of the forelimb,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.790
then bones of the torso

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.350
and all the way on the right
are bones of the head and neck.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.550
The y-axis is the
proportion of those bones

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.160
in all samples with three different levels

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.970
of flesh availability,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.370
and I basically colored
them like a traffic light.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.720
Green for bulk flesh,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.970
yellow for flesh scraps

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.710
and red for no flesh.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.440
So what did I find?

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.600
You see a lot of green
and yellow on there.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.070
In large kills over 50%
of bones were abandoned

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.550
with large muscle masses
still on them in green

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.590
and 95% of the bones had either bulk flesh

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.060
or flesh scraps which you see in yellow.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.510
That's from large prey.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.730
Small prey is a different story.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.380
Only a single bone on smaller lion kills

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.930
retained bulk flesh on it.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.400
About half the bone still
had some flesh scraps

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.240
and the other half were totally defleshed,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.880
you can see that in red.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.350
And one take-home from the study

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.640
is that if you're an early human

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.120
scavenging from a lion kill,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.283
the size of the prey really matters.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.960
So, how does this translate into actually

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.750
how much meat a scavenger could eat?

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.410
We can use weights of
adult wildebeest and zebra

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.090
which are pictured here.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.160
The hindlimb of wildebeest
yields about 19 pounds of meat,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.190
a zebra about 50 pounds.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.020
A defleshed hindlimb of a wildebeest

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020
would be about two pounds,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.160
defleshed zebra about five pounds.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.400
That's only a single hindlimb.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.830
A defleshed wildebeest carcass

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.360
could yield 12 pounds of meat.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.650
A defleshed a zebra
carcass could yield about

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.110
34 pounds of meat.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.920
So if we estimate a four
calories per gram of meat

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.580
this is about 2,200
calories from a wildebeest

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.350
and almost 6,100 calories from a zebra

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.633
and these are defleshed.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.870
So, translating this into
things we can understand here

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.700
that's about a little
more than five and a half

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.900
In-N-Out burgers worth of
meat from a wildebeest,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.790
a little more than 15 and a half in

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.540
burgers worth of meat from a zebra.

00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:19.800
I'm using an estimate of somewhere between

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.940
2,100 and 2,300 calories per day

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.500
required for Homo erectus.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.220
A defleshed wildebeest is pretty much

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.820
your daily caloric requirement.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.700
This is even without breaking the bones

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.400
to get at the marrow inside.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.020
So the main take-home message

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.330
is that I think scavenging

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.620
from even relatively defleshed carcasses

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.800
would have been a profitable

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.083
and worthwhile activity for hominins.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.150
I just want to acknowledge
Government of Kenya,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.070
the funding, my PhD advisor

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.310
and the people and the predators

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.750
and the prey of Ol Pejeta.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.740
Thank you.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.904
(audience applauding)

00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:53.571
(uptempo music)
