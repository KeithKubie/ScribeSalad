00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.140
(helicopter flying)

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.600
(alarm systems beeping)

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.491
- [Instructor] Ditching,
ditching, ditching.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.158
(water rushing)

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.763
- So, I'm alive.

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:24.596
(laughs)

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:25.429
All right, here's the deal.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.130
My last mission as a U.S.
government civil servant

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.760
was in a helicopter off
the coast of Hawaii.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.560
We'll learn about that
in a future episode,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.960
but this video's different.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.684
This is not like Destin's
going to go explore a thing

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:38.980
and make an internet video about it,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.019
this is an actual training scenario

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.710
that I was assigned,
and I had to go through

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040
in order to get certified
to accomplish my mission.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.830
Let's think about an
airplane crash in water.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.870
When an airplane lands on the water,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.010
you got these two long wings on the side

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.430
that kind of serve as pontoons,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.730
and they keep the airplane upright.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.220
Up is up, down is down.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.320
You usually see on the news

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.220
where people are walking
out over the wings

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.550
and they're waiting on
boats to pick them up,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.650
and stuff like that.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.360
Helicopters are different, in a helicopter

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.250
you've got these heavy engines up top,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.126
and no matter what, if you
land that engine weight

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:12.887
is going to cause the
helicopter to flip over

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:15.070
and you're going to start to sink.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.300
The point of this training
is to survive that scenario,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.230
and marines go through it all the time.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.091
People at off-shore oil
rigs, this is an important

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.590
piece of training that will save lives.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.240
This is my instructor, Corey Catlett.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060
He's trained helicopter pilots for years

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.810
supporting oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.550
but today he's training me along with

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.440
a class of young U.S. marines.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.900
Training started off dead
serious right out of the gate.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.658
They show us a fatal helicopter crash

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:40.810
and explain the
environment that the people

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.690
inside the helicopter are going through.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.730
After that, Corey explained the techniques

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.840
and equipment that you would use

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.310
to get out of a situation like this.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.090
For example, he explained this thing

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.660
called the "rodeo grip" and how you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.983
have to anchor yourself to the seat.

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.360
He explained how it's important to exhale

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.720
all the way to the surface of the water

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.355
so that your lungs don't explode

00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.840
when you're rising up and
you've got Boyle's law going on.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.970
It's a very serious environment,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.683
and you have to use
science, and knowledge,

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:07.110
and understanding to get out of it safely.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.790
We took an exam to make sure we understood

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.890
everything he was talking about,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.570
and then the next day at sunrise
we headed off to the pool.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.470
Are you guys nervous?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.566
- Oh, no we're good.

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:15.399
(marines laughing)

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.307
- [Destin] You're good?

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:17.140
- Yeah.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.420
- [Destin] I feel like
everybody's acting like

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880
you're not nervous but you're all nervous.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.960
- My philosophy is that you all
gotta die some time or later

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.558
and I guess this is the time to do it.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:25.596
(laughing)

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:26.429
- I can't swim.

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:27.262
- [Destin] You can't swim at all?

00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:29.310
Can I get a show of
hands of who can't swim?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.182
- We got somebody that can't swim?

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:33.015
(Destin laughing)

00:02:33.015 --> 00:02:34.200
You can't swim?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.033
- Not really.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.650
- [Destin] So you guys are not
allowed to be buddies, right?

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.400
Because one of you, that's awesome.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.113
So are you scared?

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:41.153
- Eh, terrified.

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:45.950
- Okay, so I'm gonna get to get in that.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.880
Which is a little
intimidating if I'm honest.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.410
Well before they strap
you into a helicopter

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.110
you first have to learn how
to be upside down underwater,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.260
and let water flood your sinuses.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.680
When you first get in this tipping device

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.350
the tasks are pretty simple.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.040
The first thing you do is grab the seat

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120
between your legs in what's
called the rodeo grip,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.861
and then you find the exit, grab it,

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.860
unbuckle your seatbelt,
and then pull yourself out.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.220
After you get good with that, they make it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.240
a little bit more
difficult by adding a hatch

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.810
that you had to break free of,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.950
and then eventually they
add the full regulator,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.410
so you're breathing before you exit.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.393
- I didn't know we were gonna do this,

00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:19.330
I thought we were actually
going to get right in.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.163
- I didn't either.

00:03:20.163 --> 00:03:21.590
- I'm kinda glad they're
actually taking steps

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.554
to actually show us how to
do all these little things

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:24.940
before we actually go to the helicopter.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.475
- Yeah it's like crawl,
walk, run isn't it?

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:27.970
I've got to be honest about this part.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.340
I have an Advanced Open
Water Scuba Certification,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.850
so I'm used to breathing off a regulator.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.820
So, while the marines were over there

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.840
learning how to breathe off a
regulator for the first time,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.520
I thought I was just gonna
walk up and flip upside down,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.610
and breathe naturally, and
it wasn't gonna be a problem.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.650
I was very wrong.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.220
Every time I've ever been scuba diving

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.220
I've had this type of mask
on that covers your nose.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.774
The problem is when you
don't have that mask on,

00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:50.430
and you flip upside down,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.480
water floods into your nose
and fills your sinuses,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.180
and the last thing your body wants to do

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.220
in that moment in time is take a breath.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.080
He was holding me down there
and encouraging me to breathe,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.410
which was challenging
because I had to overcome

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.556
my mental fear of inhaling water,

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.030
while at the same time
clearing a regulator

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.980
and taking a life-giving breath.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.770
This was the hardest part
of the training for me.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.402
(Destin coughing up water)

00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:16.115
- It sucks getting all the
water up the nose, right?

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:16.948
(Destin laughing)

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:17.781
- It's worse than I thought.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:19.120
It's the nose thing isn't it.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.190
- It is, and that's what gets people to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.360
push that panic button.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.820
- [Destin] This is the simulator.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.130
It contains every escape
hatch that's common

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.320
on Marine Corps aircraft,
and it's super intimidating.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.010
Everybody here's trying
to be tough and all,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.940
but it's a helicopter going underwater.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.073
It's pretty intimidating.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.717
- Ditching, ditching, ditching.

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:41.181
(machine whirring)

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.014
(water splashing)

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.033
- Holy cow.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.500
The first dunk is the craziest.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.480
Because everybody's freaking
out just a little bit.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.360
For example, you can see this marine

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.020
right here has lost his bearings.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.810
He's out of his seat, he's turned around,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.130
he's no longer got his reference point.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.320
Everything gets so chaotic
that the safety diver

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.730
ditches my camera to swim
in and start saving people.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.600
- Yeah only one passed on that one.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.820
They lost reference points.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.239
They ended up releasing
their seat belts first

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.545
and then trying to get their flack off,

00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:27.340
and it's just like a
loose sock in the dryer.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.640
If you don't put your butt
in the seat what happens?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.810
- You get lost, and I got lost.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.100
- Yeah, you get lost.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.200
Think about walking through your house

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.520
with everything upside down,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.697
you're not gonna know
where the doorways are,

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:39.430
you're not gonna know where anything is.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.010
- By the way, think about
what these instructors

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.540
are going through on every run.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.900
They have to look and be aware
of everything that's going on

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.686
in the midst of this crazy environment,

00:05:47.686 --> 00:05:49.750
find out the person that's in trouble,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.920
figure out how to help
them, and do it quickly.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.300
And if they don't do that somebody

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.830
could be injured or even die.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.235
This is a serious job
for these instructors.

00:05:57.235 --> 00:05:59.190
(Marines cheering)

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.191
- Calm yourselves and focus
on what we're doing here.

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.077
We're trying to keep you alive

00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:04.040
if you crash at sea, right?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.310
So focus on that.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.100
- It's a pretty serious job you have here.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.003
- Well, it's high-risk training.

00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:09.959
There's a chance of death, huh?

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.850
In high risk training.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.024
Hey the diver's are ready!

00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:14.843
- [Instructor] Ditching,
ditching, ditching.

00:06:14.843 --> 00:06:16.565
- [Yellow shirt instructor] Ditch-ing!

00:06:16.565 --> 00:06:19.565
(machines whirring)

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.200
- Because you're just
watching this on video

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.770
it's really hard to explain

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.950
how completely disorienting this is.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.750
Everything that was sinking
now seems like it's floating.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.720
Your bubbles are going
the wrong direction.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.730
Your feet are coming
up over the top of you.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.330
For example, watch this simulator reset

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.380
and watch what the seat
buckles do in the water.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.410
Your reference frame is rotating, okay.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.367
So if you watch this
you can understand it.

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.320
But imagine trying to understand that

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.270
while your blind, doing a
coordinate transformation

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.250
in your head while at the same
time you're getting a swirly

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.730
and your sinuses are filled with water.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.597
So if you can do that,
you're gonna be great.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.430
(laughing)

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.910
- You unbuckle, your body will
right itself to the surface.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.860
Your lungs are full of air.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.440
And when you do that in
an upside down aircraft,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.280
oh no now everything's upside down.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.950
It's hard to imagine on how
to get out of that thing.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.720
It's better to stay inverted with it.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.950
When you go under water,
your vision drops to 2200,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.840
or worse, muddy waters, it's dark,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.670
it's late at night,
you can't see anything.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.900
So sitting in a seat
you know where you are.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.760
If you're sitting in a seat
you know exactly where you are.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.510
And then we tell them,
"Hey don't just pop loose

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.943
and pull yourself along,

00:07:41.943 --> 00:07:44.833
stay in the seat, slide in the seat."

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:48.430
Because the aircrafts
are all set up with seats

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.490
with their backs to the wall
where the exits are, right?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.410
So if you're in a seat you
kind of know where you're at.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.430
You know of know which
way, "Oh it's to my right."

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.810
Even though it's muddy,
I can go to my right

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.370
about five seats down and I should be able

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.250
to feel on the wall and
find my exit, right?

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.190
If you leave the seat,
you'll go right side up.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.140
And then it's like, "Oh no."

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.067
Now their chairs are
hanging from the ceiling.

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:09.065
It's disorienting.

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:10.710
- [Destin] Once you lose
that frame of reference

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.170
it's hard to get it back.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.470
- It's not impossible to find your way out

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.670
if that happens, but it's harder.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.130
- [Destin] On the second
dunk people tend to be

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.180
a little bit more serious about not dying.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.760
If the first dunk is about panic,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.520
the second dunk is about staying calm

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.740
and learning to take your time and think.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.280
- [Instructor] Okay guys,
now that you've got air

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.039
it gives you a little bit of
time to get out, stay calm.

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.350
I want to see at least two breaths

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.946
of air before you start trying to get out.

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:38.580
Ditching, ditching, ditching!

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.660
- [Destin] The next few runs they give you

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.150
a bottle, which seems like it would solve

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.860
all your problems, but it doesn't.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.940
I know it's hard to remember,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.604
but your face is filled with
water up to your sinuses.

00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:48.320
This marine that you're seeing,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.450
he's having a hard time
getting that first breath

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.057
because his sinuses are
full so he does the symbol

00:08:53.057 --> 00:08:55.320
asking the instructors
to help pull him out.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.220
He puts his hands on his
head and the instructors

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.120
stop what they're doing and
pull him out of the simulator.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.050
If you have that problem
again pinch your nose

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.010
while you're still in your seatbelt,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.263
take a deep breath, and
once you let go of your nose

00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:14.300
that epiglottis will be shut,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.570
and then use your hands to
get out of that helicopter.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.710
By the third run people
are starting to understand

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.640
what's going on, the trick is
to keep your reference points,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.420
think with your brain
and make it out alive.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.260
You can see here it's way more

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.260
efficient looking than the earlier runs.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.750
When you have a situation
that goes bad pretty quick,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.410
and stuff literally hits the fan,

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.330
like the rotors start hitting the water,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.610
and life turns upside down,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.580
and you feel like you're sinking,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.710
you're in over your head,
and it's a situation

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.620
you don't know how to deal with.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.490
Some of these guys
didn't know how to swim.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.140
If you freak out in that moment,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.890
you're gonna stay in that dark place.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.080
That's literally suicide,
you cannot do that.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.370
What you have to do is
stay anchored to the truth,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.040
stay anchored to the things that you know.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.180
Keep your reference frame.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.694
For me in my life,
personally, I have things

00:10:08.694 --> 00:10:11.950
that I stay anchored to that
keep me aligned to truth.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.530
So, in that situation you do that,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.900
and then you start thinking
towards the safe exit

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.030
from the situation.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.750
If you don't react
correctly, and you don't

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.090
slow down and think, things
can go very bad in a hurry.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.120
It's very, very important not
to freak out in the chaos.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.990
Take one decision after another,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.500
slowly thinking it through,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.660
that gets you closer
and closer to the light.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.140
And eventually, once
you do that, in a series

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.320
you will make it out and you
will see the light again.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.800
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.570
It was exciting training.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.750
I felt like I learned a lot both for

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.535
my work in helicopters
and for life in general.

00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:49.300
I'm Destin, you're
getting Smarter Every Day.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.254
Have a good one, bye.

00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:53.405
(laughing)

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:56.270
(water loudly splashing)

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.103
- Help!

00:10:57.103 --> 00:10:59.353
(laughing)

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.423
- [Destin] Good job dude.

00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:06.256
- Thanks!

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:07.089
- [Destin] Yeah!

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:08.876
- All right note to
self, swimming lessons.

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:09.820
(laughing)

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.417
To do!

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:12.690
(laughing)

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.550
- [Destin] You did good, man.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.690
- Thank you.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.725
- That was way better.

00:11:15.725 --> 00:11:16.790
- You gotta make it out of
the helicopter for this one.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.180
- Hey, in the real thing...
