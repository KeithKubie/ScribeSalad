00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.170
TIMOTHY: Welcome to
Google I/O's Main Street.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm Timothy.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.210
FLORINA: I'm Florina.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.330
TODD: I'm still Todd.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.722
TIMOTHY: And we're going
to go have some fun.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.210
TODD: Fun!

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.682

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.973
TODD: How's your I/O been?

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:29.960
SPEAKER 1: Amazing.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.535
TODD: What's been your favorite
thing you've seen so far?

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:35.910
SPEAKER 1: I think
the discussion

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.834
on Artificial Intelligence
and creativity.

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:40.875
SPEAKER 2: TensorFlow.js.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.380
TensorFlow.js and Node.js,
which has been launched today.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.130
Awesome stuff.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.254
TIMOTHY: You're a JavaScript
programmer, I take it?

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:48.760
SPEAKER 2: Yes, that's correct.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.510
I actually run and
organize a meetup

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.382
in Bucharest, Bucharest JS.

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:55.090
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.200
That's cool.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.660
SPEAKER 2: So that's
super exciting for us.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.770
TIMOTHY: What about you?

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.320
SPEAKER 3: Oh, I think
the future of AI session

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.950
this morning was
very interesting.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.505
TODD: What's been your
favorite session so far?

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:09.880
SPEAKER 4: The
session on ML kit.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.664
I'm over the moon excited about
this for our product, which

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:13.830
is called the Native Script.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.150
So, building mobile
apps with JavaScript

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.030
and using ML on the device?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.647
Unbelievable.

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:20.230
SPEAKER 5: I think
the one that I just

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.310
saw with [INAUDIBLE]
starter kit on polymer.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.710
It was given by Monica.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.450
So, it was pretty cool.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.410
She had like a game
in the presentation,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.734
and you had to go up a level,
and really cool graphics.

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:37.900
SPEAKER 6: So I have been
following John [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.760
for like the longest time ever.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.390
And I had no idea--

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.620
I mean, kind of creepily--
and I had no idea

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.840
that he was going to be here.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.590
And I saw on the
schedule that he was here

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.548
and I immediately went.

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:51.760
And he talked about
designing towards inclusion,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.520
and how important
bringing technology

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.310
to the remote sectors and
having remote workers is.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.210
And It was extremely
exciting, and I

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.570
was very happy to see him here.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.486
So that was fantastic.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.080
TIMOTHY: That's why,
in Batman v. Superman,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.200
Batman is always going to win.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.179
Because brains
always beats brawn.

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.970
TODD: Is that true?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.589
TIMOTHY: I think so.

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.130
SPEAKER 1: What's
you favorite thing?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.604
TIMOTHY: My favorite thing?

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:19.270
This right here.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.230
SPEAKER 1: Why?

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.320
TIMOTHY: Because I think my
favorite thing about Google I/O

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.660
is when people from
around the world

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.300
gather in a single place
with shared interests,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.840
and get to talk
about the future.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.810
SPEAKER 5: There's a lot
of focus on diversity.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.430
I mean, even the speakers,
and the audience.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.930
Like it's a really
diverse audience.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.640
It's great.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.970
I think I never saw an audience
so diverse at the conference.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.200
So it's pretty awesome.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.658
SPEAKER 1: And I
think we all agree

00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:46.250
that it looks like a
festival with programmers.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.730
SPEAKER 2: Not necessarily a
conference, but a festival,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.300
right?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.569
TIMOTHY: What was your
favorite non-session thing?

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.735
SPEAKER 1: The arcade night.

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:56.650
SPEAKER 2: The
arcade, definitely

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.825
the arcade last night.

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:01.347
TIMOTHY: Did you see the pinball
machine made out of balloons?

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.680
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it was amazing.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.510
TIMOTHY: It was like
a balloon animal dude,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.076
and he made a pinball machine.

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:08.210
SPEAKER 2: Yeah,
that seems difficult.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.630
TIMOTHY: So what is your
favorite non-session thing

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.920
about I/O this year?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.320
SPEAKER 7: You know, it's
just hanging out with people

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.350
that we like, sitting on
the lawn and just chatting.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.842
It's the best.

00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:20.800
SPEAKER 8: So we have a
huge community of GDEs,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.060
and we had a really
unique opportunity

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.020
to see kind of a bunch
of them in one place,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.486
so it's really awesome.

00:03:25.486 --> 00:03:27.610
SPEAKER 1: The experiment
music was pretty awesome.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.710
Crazy.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.380
TIMOTHY: The future music?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.972
SPEAKER 1: Yes,
the one right here.

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:32.680
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.480
That's where I was.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.771
SPEAKER 5: But our favorite
thing was the bouncy world.

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.350
You know, the Android
suits fighting.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.480
It was hilarious.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.600
TIMOTHY: It's like
those sumo suits.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.925
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:52.524
TIMOTHY: So you all going
to come back next year?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.612
SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
hopefully, definitely.

00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:55.320
TIMOTHY: Awesome.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.250
Well, we'll see you then.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.840
Thank you so much.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.040
Well, here we are at
the end of Main Street.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040
I hope you've had as
much fun as we have.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.430
I'm Timothy, and I'm here
with my new BFFs, Todd--

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.555
TODD: Um, I'm pretty sure
it's pronounced, bffffff.

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:11.596
TIMOTHY: Now I know that.

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:12.350
And Florina.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.136
FLORINA: Hi, bestie.

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:16.010
TIMOTHY: Remember to
check out all the videos

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.218
