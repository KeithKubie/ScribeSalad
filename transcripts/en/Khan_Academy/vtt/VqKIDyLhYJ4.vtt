00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:02.532
- [Voiceover] So Emily
and I have been talking

00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:05.318
about how natural selection,

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:07.408
Darwin's theory of evolution,

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:09.149
has differed from some of the ways

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.006
that people have interpreted
evolution over time,

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.560
and specifically, was interested in

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.114
this group known as the Social Darwinists,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.156
who were mostly a group of sociologists

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.664
and other sort of public policy-makers

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:25.496
who were trying to apply Darwin's theories

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.540
to how the world should be ordered,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.535
and how races should relate to each other,

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:32.532
classes should relate to each other,

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.532
basically how this idea of evolution

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:39.191
could be used to explain
the world around them

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:40.537
in a social way.

00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:42.511
So, Emily, you were explaining to me

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.996
how natural selection actually works.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.109
- [Voiceover] So just
as like a quick recap

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.593
on whether that natural selection works

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:51.985
in biological populations, is that

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.747
there's some variation in the
population that's heritable,

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.742
meaning that it's in the organism's genes

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.120
and it can be passed on to offspring,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.627
and if that variation affects how well

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:06.786
the organism can survive and reproduce.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:09.828
So, if it affects how
many offspring it's able

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:13.009
to leave behind in the next generation,

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.176
then it's possible for certain
traits that are well-suited

00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:20.463
to the organism's immediate environment

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:21.995
to become more and more common

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.410
in the population over generations.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.034
So that's kind of the
idea of natural selection

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:28.683
in a nutshell.

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:31.293
- [Voiceover] And we also
talked about the fact that

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:33.514
there's no such thing as one race

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:38.158
or one organism being more
evolved than another organism

00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.596
because we've all been
evolving this whole time.

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.731
So what I'd like to do
now is just to talk about

00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.910
some of the ways that the
sociologists of this time

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.418
kind of mis-applied Darwin's theories,

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:53.071
and just get your opinions on how

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.974
what they were saying actually relates

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:57.110
with how Biology really works.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.539
So, Herbert Spencer was a
sociologist from England.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.142
He's actually the person
who coined the term

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:07.369
"survival of the fittest",
which I think is interesting.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.968
So it wasn't Darwin who coined this term

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:13.035
but rather, Spencer.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:16.588
And I think what was animating people

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.327
like Spencer and other Social
Darwinists in this time

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:21.510
was just to say, "Why are some people

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.088
"in a better social position than others?"

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:27.199
So, why are some people poor versus rich,

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.366
why do African-Americans or
people from colonized nations

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.419
have a worse situation in the world

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.369
than people in civilized nations,

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.024
or "civilized," kind of in air quotes,

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:40.510
from that time period?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.807
And what Spencer said was,
"Oh, this must be Darwinism."

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:47.429
Right, it must be that
people who are wealthy

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.053
are better adapted to their environment;

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:53.211
they're more evolved
than people who are poor.

00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:57.378
So I think this idea of
difference between the classes

00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:02.299
was one of the first animations behind

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.663
the idea of Social Darwinism.

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:09.472
So, is there any way that

00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:12.281
that actually relates to how Biology

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.814
explains Darwinism?

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:15.123
- [Voiceover] I mean, I
think that that's really

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.623
a case of an idea from Biology

00:03:19.056 --> 00:03:23.591
being not very accurately
applied to society.

00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.598
You know, I think that there is probably

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.747
a strong motivation for
someone in Spencer's position

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:30.976
to want to explain things in that way

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:34.761
because that would justify
inaction on his part

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:37.942
and sort of say that this is acceptable

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.859
because it's "natural".

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:45.488
And, you know, I think
that it's really not

00:03:45.488 --> 00:03:49.655
a very scientific or even an
investigative perspective.

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.949
I think that it was sort of an effort

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.944
to fit something, sort of a round peg

00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:59.684
in a square hole, so to speak.

00:03:59.684 --> 00:04:00.845
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's interesting.

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:02.773
As I've been learning more about this,

00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:05.118
I've noticed that people in general

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:07.231
seem to take up one of these explanations

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.879
for like how the universe works,

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.876
and then try to apply it to everything,

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.361
even if it might not necessarily apply.

00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.869
So I think your word "inaction" here

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:18.446
is really accurate
because one of the things

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:20.675
that Spencer is just wondering about

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:23.763
is like, "Should the
government do something

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.319
"for people who are poor,

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.269
"for people who are in a bad position?"

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:30.242
And he basically says,
"No," 'cause his idea

00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:32.796
is that if the government helps them,

00:04:32.796 --> 00:04:36.279
then you're interfering with
this survival of the fittest,

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.346
and that those sorts of people should

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:41.248
naturally be bred out of the populace

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:44.359
to make our other race more evolved.

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:46.496
So is there any truth into this idea

00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:49.584
that you could make the
human race more evolved

00:04:49.584 --> 00:04:52.069
by breeding out certain parts of it?

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.925
- [Voiceover] My tendency would be to say

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:59.174
that any program designed
to reduce variation

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.822
in a biological population

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:03.121
is probably not going to be beneficial

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.788
for that population.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.271
So that's kind of a broad statement

00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:10.438
but if you look at factors

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:14.285
that make endangered species endangered,

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.282
one of the big ones is that they have

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:19.708
very low genetic variation
in their gene pool.

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:23.377
And that means that harmful gene versions

00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:26.465
are more likely to come together
in the same individuals,

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:28.185
so it's more likely for there to be

00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:31.222
genetic defects or genetic disorders.

00:05:31.222 --> 00:05:33.737
In general, a high level of variation

00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:36.198
is an indicator of a healthy population

00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:38.149
and a low level of variation,

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:39.937
or any population where you have

00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:43.303
intensive inbreeding
of similar individuals,

00:05:43.303 --> 00:05:46.154
that's gonna be a population
that's probably less healthy.

00:05:46.154 --> 00:05:47.571
- [Voiceover] Interesting,
because there's this

00:05:47.571 --> 00:05:49.661
very popular movement in the United States

00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.843
and then moving on to places like Germany,

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:54.862
where we see this very
strongly in the Holocaust

00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:56.604
of eugenics, right?

00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:59.604
The idea that you can make your race

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.283
and your country more evolved, more fit,

00:06:05.283 --> 00:06:07.303
this survival of the fittest,

00:06:07.303 --> 00:06:09.248
by breeding out certain things

00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:11.222
that are termed "undesirable."

00:06:11.222 --> 00:06:12.987
- [Voiceover] I mean,
in terms of long-term

00:06:12.987 --> 00:06:16.354
population survival from
a biological standpoint,

00:06:16.354 --> 00:06:18.142
I don't see how that could be beneficial.

00:06:18.142 --> 00:06:19.883
I mean, you never know
what's down the road.

00:06:19.883 --> 00:06:22.414
You never know if there's
a new infectious disease

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:25.131
that's gonna show up and who's
gonna be resistant to it.

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:26.983
Somebody who has genetic variation,

00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:28.725
that doesn't matter right now,

00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:30.420
but you don't know who that's gonna be.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.206
So it's that sort of
general principle applies

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:35.226
that the reason variation is great,

00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:36.735
is it prepares a population

00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:38.569
to deal with an uncertain future.

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.311
- [Voiceover] This is so interesting to me

00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.306
because I think you see
this a lot in history,

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:45.071
because people in some ways here,

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.902
there are very much confusing
culture for Biology,

00:06:48.902 --> 00:06:52.269
because in many cases, they're saying that

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.497
traits that they see as
culturally undesirable,

00:06:55.497 --> 00:06:59.235
you know, looking through
the eyes of white supremacy

00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:02.022
and sort of this racial
and cultural supremacy

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:05.690
of people from England,
from the United States,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.455
from Western Europe, you know,

00:07:07.455 --> 00:07:09.731
they're looking around
them and they see people

00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:11.147
who are different from them,

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:15.536
and they ascribe that to a
kind of biological inferiority

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:18.113
when, in fact, it's just
a cultural difference.

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:19.572
- [Voiceover] I think that
that's a very good way

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.508
to state it; I think
that there's just a big

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.587
conflation here of
cultural and biological,

00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:27.025
and applying ideas that
might be great for one

00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:29.905
in a place where they're
not actually as well-suited.

00:07:29.905 --> 00:07:30.964
- [Voiceover] Yeah, and
I think that one thing

00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:32.570
that also interests me about this

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.128
is the way that things like eugenics

00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:37.357
are used as justifications,

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.097
and using Darwinism as a justification

00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:41.908
for not helping certain people,

00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:44.300
for saying, "Oh, you're less evolved;

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.829
"you belong at the bottom
of the social scale,

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:49.011
"and if I help you,
then I'm not helping us

00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.451
"evolve as a race,"

00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:52.727
with also kind of a flip-side of saying,

00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:54.816
"Oh, we must help certain cultures

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.465
"become more civilized."

00:07:56.465 --> 00:08:00.691
And you see that a lot in
the era of colonialism,

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:02.409
which is also big in the Gilded Age.

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:07.193
It's kind of becoming a
world event in the Gilded Age

00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:10.860
as England begins to
take colonies in India,

00:08:11.744 --> 00:08:15.180
and Africa, and other nations do the same.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.526
One of the justifications
that they're giving is

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:20.126
"These people are less civilized than us.

00:08:20.126 --> 00:08:21.450
"They're less evolved than us,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.284
"and so we have to help them.

00:08:23.284 --> 00:08:25.002
"It's the white man's burden,"

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:27.208
a phrase by Rudyard Kipling,

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:30.111
to help these other races evolve.

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.944
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's
a very definite conflation

00:08:32.944 --> 00:08:36.519
of biological and social,
I mean, teaching people

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:39.538
to behave in a different way
does not affect their biology.

00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:42.742
That was actually one of
Spencer's misconceptions.

00:08:42.742 --> 00:08:45.204
He was an adherent of Lamarckian evolution

00:08:45.204 --> 00:08:47.851
which would suggest
that if you gain a trait

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:50.730
during your lifetime,
you will biologically

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.029
and genetically pass
it on to your offspring

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:54.979
and you may pass it on to your offspring

00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:56.628
by teaching them something,

00:08:56.628 --> 00:08:58.996
but genetic traits that are
acquired during your life,

00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:00.575
you don't pass those on.

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:02.340
You actually don't generally inherit--

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.314
- [Voiceover] They are
acquired genetic traits.

00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:05.521
- [Voiceover] Yeah, exactly.

00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.356
So I think that that definitely reflects

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:10.421
the confusion in terms of
what biological evolution is

00:09:10.421 --> 00:09:12.789
and how it works mechanistically.

00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:14.554
- [Voiceover] I think if there's anything

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.667
for us to take away from this, it's that

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.453
one, there's no such thing as one person

00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:22.356
being more evolved than another person,

00:09:22.356 --> 00:09:25.049
or one race being more
evolved than another race.

00:09:25.049 --> 00:09:28.904
I think there's actually not
much of a biological basis

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.179
for the concept of race, to start with,

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:36.125
since human beings are
biologically 99.9% the same.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:38.656
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I mean,
from everything that I've seen,

00:09:38.656 --> 00:09:42.487
race is really something
that people have come up with

00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:45.593
in an effort to categorize
the world around them,

00:09:45.593 --> 00:09:48.264
but it's not actually
reflected very meaningfully

00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:49.993
in people's genetics.

00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:52.319
You know, there are
certain very superficial

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:54.548
physical traits that are inherited,

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:57.659
that we define as "race",
but if you actually

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:00.283
look at the genomes of the people who belong

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:03.975
to a particular racial group,
that is socially defined,

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:05.995
there's a huge amount of variation there,

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:08.039
and there's much more variation within

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.780
what we would consider a race,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.356
than there are differences
that separate races.

00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:14.981
Basically, it's a pretty arbitrary way

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.731
to categorize people.
