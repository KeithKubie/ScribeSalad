Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. That dad is a, a really interesting breakdown that maybe that is one of the big mistakes we're making in our culture. When people point to the problems that we have in this country. One of the problems we have is our inability to connect with each other or to recognize that a, we're all sharing this space and time together and instead wanting to uphold our own religious or ideological ideas as being the only one way to get going. Yeah. The only one way to get through. And one of the things that I've found, these psychedelic experiences, it really makes ideologies seem, uh, if not preposterous, at the very least insignificant in comparison to human experiences. Absolutely. The experience of, of comradery and friendship and, and love it. You realize like, oh, this is what's important. This is not enforcing your ideas are pushing them on other people and forcing people to behave the way you behave, but instead love,

Speaker 2:          00:58          I'm thinking about religious ideas, which caused so much division, so much chaos, so much hatred, so much fear, so much suspicion in the world today. Um, is it really what we want to do as human beings simply to accept a package of ideas that were believed in by our ancestors to accept them whole without question as absolute fact, which we regard as such a Thursday. The fact that in some cases we're willing to be deeply unpleasant to people who hold different views or perhaps even killed them. Uh, we've had this, you know, this recent event in, in, in, in Sri Lanka primarily a religiously motivated terrorist event. It happens, it happens all over the world, that people feel so convinced that the inherited package of ideas that they had nothing to do with creating and that they have never questioned. They're so convinced that those ideas are right, that in extreme cases they are actually prepared to kill other human beings who hold different ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:54          They are, they so insecure in their own, in their own beliefs that, that they're prepared to go to that level of actually murdering another human being halted. They're so threatened by the other beliefs that other human beings hold. So it's an abnegation of our responsibility as human beings. We should be questioning things. We should not be accepting packages of ideas intact, fully formed and using them to drive the way we behave towards one another. That was part of the human story, but we need to move on from that. I mean, it's a very dangerous situation in a very complex, modern world with billions of human beings on the planet to have these kinds of energy's being generated where certain groups of people are saying, we are absolutely right and you are absolutely wrong. We are superior. You are inferior. This is a very, very dangerous path that we're, that we are on and it needs to be changed.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Personally, I know this is not a comment that will go down well with many people, but I am strongly opposed to nationalism. I don't, I don't see any virtue in nationalism. It is an accident of birth, which nation you are born in. It was nothing that you did for your own merit. You didn't earn that you born by accident in, in a particular nation. Why should we automatically feel the other people who were born by accident in that particular nation has something special in common with us. And that we together are a group who are much more important than other groups of people. I've been privileged to spend my life traveling around the world, living with communities all over, over the world. And one thing that really comes across to me strongly, it's, it's, it should be a cliche and yet it's not, is that we are all one family, that humans are intimately interconnected all around the world.

Speaker 2:          03:30          That you can go to the remotest area of the Amazon jungle and find the same hopes, the same fears, the same dreams that we have in industrialized cities, shared by the hunter gatherers in the, in, in the middle of the Amazon. So our similarities as human beings and what we share in common at the emotional level and the level of love and at the level of heart are far more important than our differences that are defined by the nation or the political group in which we, in which we grew up in. And when I, when I say I'm against nationalism, I need also to make clear that does not mean, and I hope I'm not taken out of context by others who are listening to this. That does not mean I'm in favor of world government. I detest governments. That's another thing we need to grow out off.

Speaker 2:          04:14          We don't need governments anymore. If we have them, they should have a very minimal role in our society. I think it's possible for the human race to relate as one family without leaders and governments who are exploiting the worst aspects of our character, the lowest common denominator of our society. Deliberately encouraging theaters and hatreds and suspicion. What responsible leaders should be doing is encouraging love and unity and their failure to do that. In my view disqualifies them from the leadership role entirely and that's why I've often said I would not, I would like to see a situation in which no head of state can be appointed to that position unless he or she has first had 12 sessions of Iowasca. That would be the condition. Don't even bother applying for the job if you haven't done this, and we have to be there where you have it.

Speaker 2:          05:05          We have to be, we want to see that you're drinking every drop. And we wanted an experience Shumon presence, who's really going to guide you through the, through the journey. And I suspect that that would be a transformative experience for many of our political class, and that they would start to question why they do what they do, why they exploit theories in order to magnify their own position. They'd start to question that and to wonder about a different destiny for humanity. But that's a dream, I guess it's not going to happen, is very, very, very well said. Yeah.
