WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.950
Good.
Okay.
So as you remember before we ended,

2
00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:08.951
we were talking about Xoxo and how he explained everything in more detail than

3
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.540
people wanted to hear about.
Okay.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.400
And he knew exactly the story that you had chairs of cyclohexane and you had

5
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:20.510
boat and you could enter,
convert them by rotation about single bonds.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
But it was only after the Bragg's had determined the x ray structure of diamond

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.660
and more,
not equally importantly,

8
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.860
but very importantly had drawn clear pictures of it like this,

9
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.390
that people understood what Zazi had been talking about,
uh,

10
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.950
28 years earlier.
Okay.
Because if we look in the middle there,

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.210
we see that chair form of cyclohexane okay.

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.370
That we call it a chair that people like to give sort of silly trivial names to

13
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.600
things.
Scientists are probably sort of geeks actually.
But uh,

14
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.440
that's okay.
So there's a chair,
right?

15
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.270
That looks like this chair and that chair has a particular property which is you

16
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:12.080
can fold the back down and fold the legs up.
Hey,

17
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.220
but you can do the same thing to do the ring flip as we call it.

18
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:21.221
Then the chair cyclohexane by counter rotation of two parallel bonds.

19
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.810
So take these two bonds there,
rotate it that way,
and there rotate that way.

20
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.350
Counter rotation,
right?
One rotates clockwise,

21
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:34.790
the other counter clockwise and you rotate group four at the bottom right?

22
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.280
So that it goes up.

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.260
Everybody see how the rotation does that?
And I can do it with a model here,

24
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.200
right?
So I rotate it around,

25
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:50.180
this bond and this bond hold this part here and I rotate and it goes up.

26
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.163
<v 0>Now,</v>

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.180
so the product after rotating that up is a different confirmation,

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.380
uh,

30
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.240
which we call boat cyclohexane or which people called boat cyclohexane because

31
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.470
it looks a little like a boat.

32
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.830
<v 0>And people who got very imaginative named various bonds on this,</v>

34
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.850
like the bow spirit or the flag pole.

35
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.440
But in fact,

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
this isn't really a con formation at all because it's not a minimum of energy.

37
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.270
It's a maximum of energy.
You get lower energy,
this is the boat.

38
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.520
You get lower energy by twisting a little bit like that,
right?

39
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.850
So the boat is actually not a minimum of energy.

40
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.520
Usually we reserve the name Khan formation,

41
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.750
four isomers that are Minima in energy,
right?
They can vibrate,

42
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.330
but they're at a minimum of energy.
That's not true of the boat.

43
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.680
But the boat is what does oxy made his picture of it and it's easy to think

44
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.410
about.
So we often talk about the boat even if it isn't true,

45
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.570
if it really wants to twist a little bit,

46
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.260
we'll discuss that a little bit more later.
Why it wants to twist.
But anyhow,

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.183
there's a boat.

48
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.360
Now if you then did the same trick to the blue bonds on the other side,

49
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.550
that is a counter rotate.

50
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:13.540
So those go in and down rather than in and up as the,

51
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.440
as the red ones did on the left,
it goes down like that.

52
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.000
And now you see what you have is a chair where everything that was up is down

53
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.830
and everything that was down is up.
Okay?
So we started with a,

54
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.750
with a boat here,
I can flip it like that to make a capsized boat or a chair.

55
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.930
Start with a chair,
flip it to make a capsized boat.
Flip it again.

56
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.340
And I have another chair.
But notice what happened here.
All the,

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.930
all these bonds that are pointing vertical or down in vertical,
uh,

58
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.310
are black.
And the others are our silver,
right?
Everybody see that?

59
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.410
But after I do this,

60
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.490
they've changed the silver ones point up and down in the black ones.
Point out,

61
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.260
right?

62
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.260
So that's changed the environment that's interchange the environment of this one

63
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.400
and this one of the black and the,
and the,
the metal one,
right?

64
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.530
By doing that so-called ring flip.

65
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.370
Okay?
Now you,
you should learn how to draw chairs.

66
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:18.550
Cyclo hexanes that's a very popular discipline among organic chemists.

67
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.170
And it shows that you understand what's going on with the confirmation if you

68
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.310
draw it right.
And if you don't draw it right,
it shows that you don't understand.

69
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.270
So let's see how people say,
Oh,
I'm not an artist.
I can't really draw it right?

70
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.400
But if you understand that you can draw it right?

71
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.310
All the only thing you have to be capable of doing is drawing things that are

72
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.510
parallel to one another.
That's not too big a challenge.
Okay?

73
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.870
So notice that there,

74
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.900
that the carbon carbon bonds are parallel in pairs,
right?

75
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:50.410
So the redwoods are parallel,
the blue ones are parallel,

76
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.260
and the green ones are parallel,
okay?

77
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.040
Now that means when you draw the frame,
it looks like this.

78
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.590
So that opposite ones are parallel to one another.

79
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.360
And now the only challenge is to put the hydrogens on or whatever the

80
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:08.740
substituents are,
right?
And for that purpose,
it's worth knowing that,

81
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.940
noticing the symmetry of the ring,
right?
There are,

82
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.920
there's a threefold axis of symmetry vertical as a drawn it here,
right?

83
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.410
So you can rotate 120 degrees,

84
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:24.910
a third of a circle around that axis,
and you can't tell that it happened.

85
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.260
It's symmetry.
Okay?
So notice that the,

86
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.820
some of the bonds are parallel.

87
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.880
They're called axial because they're parallel at,

88
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.130
but some of them are parallel up and the intervening ones are parallel down to

89
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:44.650
keep the carbons looking tetrahedral.
Okay,

90
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:49.090
so six of the hydrogen bonds are parallel to the axis of symmetry.

91
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.890
So even if you drew the,

92
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.190
the six membered ring in some cockeyed direction so that it's playing mean plane

93
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:59.480
was like this or like this or like this or like this.

94
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.610
Still you can see where that access points and make the axial bonds parallel to

95
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.040
that access.
Okay.
Now you have the problem of drawing the,

96
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.880
the last bond which completes the tetrahedron.

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.380
Now over notice that the equatorial bonds is,
they're called,

98
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:18.170
cause it's sorta like the equator relative to the access.

99
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.590
They're not strictly horizontal,
right?

100
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:26.540
They go a little bit opposite the way the red bond went on the same carbon.

101
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.170
And notice in particular that they're parallel to the next adjacent carbon

102
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.100
carbon bonds,
which are shown in blue here.
Okay?

103
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370
So they make us sort of an n or a z with the next adjacent carbon carbon bond.

104
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.510
Okay?
Now what a clock is,

105
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.550
if we start from that carbon at the back left,

106
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.730
what direction started from the carbon?

107
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:58.731
Do I draw a line to draw the proper orientation of the hydrogen at that carbon?

108
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.030
You know,
one o'clock,
two o'clock,
three o'clock,
eight o'clock,
seven o'clock,

109
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.670
nine o'clock what?
Oh clock.

110
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.270
Think about it the second and then I'll ask you,
oh,

111
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.720
we can do it like an auction.
I'll go one,
two,
three,
four,

112
00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:15.930
five and you raise your hand when I get the right one.
Okay.
12 o'clock.

113
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.000
One o'clock.
Two o'clock.
Three o'clock.
Four o'clock.

114
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.000
Five o'clock,
six o'clock,

115
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.720
seven o'clock eight o'clock nine o'clock 10 o'clock 11 o'clock.

116
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.550
Okay.
The answer is eight o'clock right?

117
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:38.870
Well how do I know that?

118
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.350
Because it's parallel to the next adjacent cc bond there.

119
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.180
Right.
See The z.
So it's parallel to the next adjacent z.

120
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.450
The CC bond.
Okay.
Now,
how about there?
One o'clock.

121
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.000
One o'clock,
two o'clock,
three o'clock,

122
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.060
four o'clock,
five o'clock day.

123
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.110
It's about one 30 right?

124
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.150
Sorta like one o'clock because it's parallel to the next adjacent cc bonds,

125
00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:19.260
which are pointing that anti parallel,
right?
That parallel,

126
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:23.640
but in the opposite direction from their nearest carbon.
Okay.
Try here.

127
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.250
One o'clock,
two o'clock,
three o'clock,
four o'clock,

128
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.710
five o'clock.
Ah,
you're getting better,
right?
About four o'clock.

129
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.480
Three 30 maybe.
Okay.
How about here?
One o'clock,

130
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.310
two o'clock.
Three o'clock.
Okay.
Two o'clock.

131
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.260
Hey,
how bout here?
One,
two,
three.
Ah,

132
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:51.600
I've got some votes for one.

133
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.070
Now I'm going to come back and ask wrong with one o'clock bay there is what it

134
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.130
is.
It's actually seven o'clock.
How is that related to one o'clock?

135
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.970
It's anti parallel,
right?
If you did one o'clock,

136
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.090
it would have made a you with the next adjacent bond rather than an n or a z.

137
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.860
You see that?
See where the mistake was.
Okay?
So if you understand this,

138
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:21.861
if you understand that the hydrogen is Auntie to the next adjacent cc bond,

139
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.630
right,
then you won't draw it wrong.
You won't draw you,

140
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.900
which would be eclipsed,
right?
You'd draw it Auntie,

141
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.670
which is makes a z or an N.
Okay?
So if you,
if you understand that,

142
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:38.420
you'll draw it.
So it wouldn't be surprising if that were on some tests,

143
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:41.760
some time to draw a cyclohexane or something.
Okay.

144
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:46.761
Now this got interesting because in the 1940s and 50s,

145
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.230
synthetic organic chemist,

146
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:54.231
we're very interested in steroid hormones in the 30s,

147
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.790
forties and fifties right?
Uh,

148
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.780
and it turned out that you had these two alcohols,

149
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.330
which were called Beta and alpha.

150
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.470
And Beta is the one that came up toward the viewer.

151
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.370
And Alpha is the one that goes back into the paper.

152
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.090
But of course that depends on how you drew the molecule.

153
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:19.320
If you do the molecule upside down,
it'd be just the opposite.
But synthetic,

154
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.750
organic chemists who are interested in this kind of thing,

155
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.450
we weren't bothered like that about this because they always drew it the same

156
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:29.160
way,
right?
So they knew what they meant by up and down.
But that's like,

157
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.290
uh,
you know,
names that don't really tell you what the,

158
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.040
don't allow a novice to know what the structure is to call,

159
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.090
Talk Alpha and Beta people still talk about Alpha and Beta substituents,

160
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:45.810
the ones that point out of the paper and into the paper and steroids.

161
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.150
But you have to know the Lord.
You have to be,

162
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.720
you have to know how people always draw the rings in order to know what comes

163
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:54.720
out and what comes in.
So,
uh,

164
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.060
so it's like CIS and Trans a little bit not knowing what sister,

165
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.100
what hae a buyer remember said it didn't make a difference because,

166
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.880
because there was only one cyclohexane carboxylic acid,

167
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.570
right?
Because if you had axial and equatorial ones,

168
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.960
they see the rings could flip it,
they would enter converted it all be the same.

169
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.390
Right?
Uh,
so,

170
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.480
but it's interesting that the Beta and the Alpha isomers of these alcohols have

171
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:27.750
different reactivity.
They are different,
right?
They behave differently.

172
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:32.100
They don't enter,
convert.
Right.
And you can see why that would be.

173
00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:35.760
So what's the relation between the Beta and the Alpha?

174
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.280
Are they mirror images?

175
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.520
Are they eating?
Are there environments?
Identical?

176
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.770
Ian Antia topic Diastat area topic.

177
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.340
There's an easy way to recognize this.
This is,

178
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.720
they exist at a chiral center because going around one carbon and going around

179
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.950
the other are different paths.
They encounter different things as you move along,

180
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.750
right?
So it's a chiral center,

181
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.840
but there are other chiral centers in the molecule.

182
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.150
And when you have to chiral centers,

183
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.490
then changing just one doesn't give the mirror image.
It gives an EPA Mer,

184
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.020
not an [inaudible] anti tumor.

185
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:22.200
So they are die a stereo topic right now for these kinds of problems.

186
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.280
Derek HR Barton invented what was called con formational analysis in 1950 he was

187
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:34.450
interested in,
in these steroid hormones,
as many people were,
right?

188
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.070
So conventionally these six membered rings were labeled a,
B,
c,

189
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.880
and then the five membered ring d so people could know what they were talking

190
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:44.590
about,
right?

191
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.010
And Barton redrew ring a and notice that the Beta Alpha is configuration Tully

192
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.440
Daya Steria topic.
You'd have to break bonds to make the alpha in debater.

193
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.010
So it doesn't surprise us that there are different,
right?

194
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.200
But let's look at just how they're different.

195
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.740
So this is the picture from his paper in 1950 that Barton drew to show that ring

196
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.790
a and the bracket there that I've drawn in shows where it would go on to ring
be.

197
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:17.380
I've truncated his picture.
Now I want to ask you a question about,
so Beta,

198
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.710
uh,

199
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.900
goes up relative to the mean play into the ring.

200
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:27.580
And Alpha goes down
and he labeled these things,

201
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.630
e or p four equatorial.
That's what we still call it.

202
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:35.920
As I told you the one that points more or less in the play into the ring and he

203
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:40.921
called the the others p four polar as if it were a globe and headed the access

204
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.030
the pole,
but we call it now axial.
So that's changed since he invented this.

205
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.660
But I think you're probably sophisticated enough now having had this practice to

206
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:54.940
recognize an error in what he drew.

207
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.030
Do you see what's wrong with his pictures?

208
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.450
Marty,
what do you say

209
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.240
are the equatorial bonds?

210
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.050
Do they make zs with the carbon frame?
That is,

211
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:28.030
are they anti to the next adjacent carbon carbon bond take.

212
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:33.090
Take an Ecuadorian one like this one here is this carbon carbon bond anti

213
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:38.680
parallel at the correct o clock relative to this bond.

214
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.360
<v 2>Can't hear very well.
Can you speak more like</v>

215
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:45.780
<v 0>no.</v>

216
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.780
This one notices exactly horizontal and this one is exactly horizontal,

217
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.640
so they're perfectly auntie or take this one right.

218
00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.641
Here's its bond and here's the next adjacent CC bogged one to 10 and they're

219
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:04.400
exactly anti parallel.
Okay,
so that's Auntie too.

220
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.120
So the equatorial ones are fine.
How about the axial ones?

221
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.840
They look good.
Catherine,
what do you say?

222
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.100
What does axial mean?
What's axial about it?

223
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.473
Maria.

224
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.011
Okay.

225
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:35.180
What direction does that access point that you could rotate that six membered

226
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:37.070
ring around it and get the same thing?

227
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.280
What a clock does it point from the center of the ring?

228
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.180
Yeah.
By about 11 o'clock they're,
there are the,

229
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.050
the sets of three carbons that are related by that and the access goes at about

230
00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:56.640
11 o'clock.
What does that mean,
Maria,
about the,
the axial bonds,

231
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.920
they should be parallel to that axial direction.
Right?

232
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.390
So they really should be this direction,
right.

233
00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:07.950
Parallel to that axis.

234
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.280
So the very guy who invented it in the very paper in which he did the invention

235
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.640
drew them wrong.
That's not too surprising.
Right?

236
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.250
But,
but it's interesting to note.

237
00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:25.251
So you don't have to feel bad when you draw it wrong the first few times.

238
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:28.260
But the time we get to an exam,
you'll know how to draw it right.

239
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.980
Better than Barton did when he published his paper.
Okay.

240
00:16:31.981 --> 00:16:36.981
He got the Nobel Prize in 1969 for development of the concept of confirmation

241
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.510
and its applications in chemistry.

242
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.860
So he didn't get the Nobel prize for drawing the axial bonds wrong.
Right.

243
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.000
What he got the Nobel prize was for the application showing how important this

244
00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:51.810
was in chemistry,
that those axial and equatorial groups,

245
00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.980
hydrogens in this case,
but they could be other groups have different chemistry.

246
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.120
Right?
And notice the date,
1950,

247
00:17:00.121 --> 00:17:04.680
all these things about stereochemistry were happening within plus or minus a few

248
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.650
years of that,
uh,
that we've already talked about by foot.

249
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:11.670
Determining the absolute configuration of tartaric acid,
Newman,

250
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.450
figuring out how to draw his projections that show confirmation,

251
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.670
the con in gold pray log rules.

252
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.690
And as we'll see shortly the idea of molecular mechanics.

253
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.050
Okay.
Now,
uh,
what made buyers say everything was the same?

254
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.340
Although he didn't know it was that the ring would flip or converting.

255
00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:34.980
Axial and equatorial is we just look,
but can the ring,

256
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.750
if the ring can flip in this one,

257
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.040
they would also interconvert convert axial and equatorial.
But can the ring flip?

258
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.360
That's the question.

259
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.620
So let's think a little bit more about how the ring flip works.

260
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.810
Notice that during the ring flip as in the top left there,
what's axial,

261
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:54.720
what's equatorial becomes axial.
So you'll look at the top left,

262
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:58.710
there's an equatorial bond,
and in the right that becomes an act,

263
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.430
an axial bond.
We're actually,
uh,
you'd call it a what?

264
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.580
A flagpole in the boat,
right?

265
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.380
But when you do the other flip of the blue one,
that one that's purple is there,

266
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.861
right?

267
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:14.910
So the one that was equatorial in the chair on the top left after flip becomes

268
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:17.190
axial.
And we already saw that here,

269
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.280
that the ones that are equity Loreal become axial.

270
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:21.600
When you do the double ring flip.

271
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.603
<v 1>Okay?</v>

272
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.230
<v 0>Now,
and by the same token,
the ones that are axial become equatorial.</v>

273
00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:31.690
So if you start on the top left with those two green ones,

274
00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:35.030
which are anti to one another axial,
right?

275
00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.250
Notice they pointed a little to the right because the access of the of the

276
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.260
cemetery access is not straight up and down right after the first part of the

277
00:18:43.661 --> 00:18:46.810
flip to the boat looks like that.
And the second part of the flip,

278
00:18:46.811 --> 00:18:51.790
they become Ecuadorian and Gauche to one another where they were anti
originally,

279
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.683
<v 1>right?</v>

280
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.490
<v 0>So now if you have fused rings,</v>

281
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.180
that is two six membered rings that share a bond as on the bottom there.

282
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:07.180
Those two green ones can be part of the second ring Gauche to one another as all

283
00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:11.830
the carbons are around the cyclohexane ring in its chair forum.

284
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.610
So there Goshen,
that's fine.
But if you tried to flip it,

285
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.060
those two green ones with respect to the front car,

286
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.200
the front ring would become axial as on the top left.

287
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.000
And if they pointed axial,
you couldn't possibly complete the ring.

288
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.750
Right?
So here's,
here's the,
here are these,

289
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.320
here's two chairs here and here.
Now if I could,

290
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.040
if I could try to flip this one up,
I could flip this one down.

291
00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:43.150
Probably they're down,
right?
So I got it almost into a boat,

292
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.010
but I can't even make it into a boat,
let alone flip the other ring.

293
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.690
And the reason is that is that these two are tying these,

294
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.850
these two while I'm trying to flip this one.

295
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.900
These two are holding this one and we'll let it go.

296
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.450
They can't become axial to one another,

297
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.240
<v 1>right?</v>

298
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.140
<v 0>Just because the carbons can't reach.
Okay.
So in,</v>

299
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.290
in what's called Declan means deca hydro 10 hydrogens on naphthalene.

300
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:16.770
Naphthalene is like benzine except two of them,
right?

301
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.950
So this is Declan or 10 hydrogens on Napoli and this one is called Trans

302
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.310
Jacqueline,
right?
These two hydrogens are trans to one another.
And in that one,

303
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.930
I can't flip the rings.
If I had cysts Declan like this,
right?

304
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.790
Then it's possible to flip the rings,
which I could do like this.

305
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.350
Let's see.
Well,
oh,

306
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:49.570
I think I did it there.
Yeah,
I did.
Okay,
so you can flip the ring if that cyst,

307
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:53.470
but not if it's trans.
And the point is that you can't take two Ecuadorian,

308
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.460
take two Ecuadorian things and make them both axial in a ring.

309
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.660
Cause those carbons get too far apart to be bridged by the rest of the ring.

310
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.840
But if there,
if,
if they're Gauche to one another,

311
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.050
then they can be ghosted one another on the other side and it can flip.

312
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.100
It's fun to play.
You know,
we used to require people to buy models.

313
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:15.700
Now you can do things,
uh,
you know,
with computers that make it,

314
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.800
that's probably not worth your money to buy the models,

315
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:20.800
but it's still a lot of fun and you'll learn something with your hands.

316
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.671
It's like,
you know,

317
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.990
when people have trouble in elementary school with arithmetic,
the,

318
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.090
the teacher gives them toothpicks to count with and so on.

319
00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.490
It's a higher level than that,
but it's the same thing.

320
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:34.390
You learn a lot with your hands.
So it's fun to play with is in fact,

321
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.430
let me a pass around here.
A simplified models,

322
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.920
uh,
that are a chair.

323
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.280
But you can do this trick of changing one into the other by rotating and feeling

324
00:21:47.921 --> 00:21:51.970
it is fun,
right?
So,
so that you have the opportunity to feel it.

325
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:53.530
I'll pass these around.

326
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.700
<v 1>All right.</v>

327
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:11.470
<v 0>Okay.
The ring flip is impossible for trans Declan.
Okay.
And uh,</v>

328
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.120
but so Gosha because Gosha is okay within the second ring of Deckland but not

329
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:20.560
anti.
Okay.
So,
uh,
and you try with models,

330
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:23.400
if you're skeptical,
if you want to come up afterwards and fiddle with the Lens,

331
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.960
you're free.
Okay.
Now,

332
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.920
nowadays people much more often encounter these things on a,

333
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:33.190
on animations.
Uh,
but uh,

334
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:37.930
this is a nice a webpage that we have permission to use in the course.

335
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:43.040
I mean,
you could use it on your own anyhow on the net if you wanted to.
Uh,
uh,

336
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.180
but it's a cautionary tale because just because it looks nice and works doesn't

337
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.560
mean it gives the right answers.
So let me show you what I mean.
Okay.

338
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:56.110
So if you go to this website,
you can click there to get it.

339
00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.190
Then it's a nice tutorial about what,
uh,
about Khan formation.

340
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:05.020
So they show for here here for example,
ethane and if you click play,
let's see,

341
00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:06.180
I think I've got it and have it here.

342
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.510
You can step from one position to the next and see what the shape looks like,

343
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:12.700
not the FAA and is so Sylvere exciting,

344
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:17.710
but you can see it go down and up as it goes from a eclipse to to Sagard and you

345
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:21.760
can click on a point and it'll the model we'll turn to show you what it's like.

346
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:25.150
I'll give an example of this later and there's the staggered and there's the

347
00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:25.661
eclipse.

348
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:30.190
That's the barrier that goes across and you'll see that that barrier is 5.2

349
00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:34.030
kilojoules per mole because they use their modern and they use Jewel's.

350
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:37.900
Whereas American organic chemists tend to use kilocalories,
but anyhow,

351
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:41.890
if you multiply that by 0.239 you get it in kilocalories is what we've been

352
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:45.380
talking about.
Which would say that the barrier is one,
two,

353
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:49.010
four kilocalories per mole.
How big is the barrier in ethane?

354
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:52.040
Does anybody remember from before thanksgiving?
Dana?

355
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.380
It's three right?
Just because they give a fancy chart with numbers on it.

356
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.040
And just to be kind of,
because it's been calculated by some,
uh,

357
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.240
some quantum mechanical program that they got access to it and could use,

358
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:08.150
doesn't mean the numbers are going to be right and they're not,

359
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.540
they're off by a factor of more than two,
right?

360
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.340
So don't believe everything you see.

361
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:17.450
That's maybe the primary lesson that this whole unit tells you.

362
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.600
Okay.
It should be 2.9.

363
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:23.660
So let the buyer beware and situations like that.

364
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:26.780
If you don't pay anything for it,
you've probably get about that.

365
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.830
But the pictures are still very nice and the general shape is correct.

366
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.340
So here's the rotation in propane and it says the barrier is five kilocalories

367
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:39.740
from all.
And you know,
it's something like 3.4,

368
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.600
3.3 instead.
Here's butane.
And again,

369
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:46.310
you can animate that and see the,

370
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.110
the various staggered confirmations and the fully eclipse doing.

371
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.990
And we know the Gosha is supposed to be 0.9 kilocalories per mole,

372
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.480
which is not what this says.
Uh,

373
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.380
and forget the scale on the left,
the,
uh,

374
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:05.530
we can use that 0.9 to tell how much of the ghosts there should be at

375
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:10.910
equilibrium.
And W W let's rehearse this again.

376
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.800
Remember it's 10 to the three fourths delta h in kilocalories.

377
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.600
So if it's,
so three fourths of 0.9 is 0.68.

378
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.020
So it means the ratio of Gauche to Auntie should be one to 4.7 4.7 is 10 to the

379
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:31.640
0.68.
Okay,
so one to five about,

380
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.400
but it depends on what you're talking about because that Goshen is in fact

381
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:42.050
chiral.
Let's see.
Uh,
I didn't have it here.
Well,
you can,

382
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.310
you can see,
I can do it with my hands.
Okay.
So here's Auntie.
Okay,

383
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.120
here's Gauche,
right?

384
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.790
But goshes chiral it could also be this,
right?

385
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:56.510
It could be one hand or the other.
The mirror image.

386
00:25:56.511 --> 00:26:00.590
It's like a propeller of Gauche.
Right?
So when I say Gauche,

387
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.850
what do I mean?

388
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.120
Do I mean Gauche plus or do I mean gauche minus or do I mean both of them taken

389
00:26:08.961 --> 00:26:12.530
together?
Because obviously if I include,
if I,

390
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.770
if I have say Goshen mean both of them,
right.

391
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.090
Then I have to multiply this by two and the ratio is one to 2.4 instead of one

392
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:22.610
to 4.7 okay,

393
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.780
so there has to be this statistical factor taken into account as well.

394
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:29.780
When you use a collective name like Gauche.

395
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.690
Okay.
The eclipse is 3.4 kilocalories per mole.

396
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.610
That will tell how fast a anti goes to Gauche.

397
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.640
So the difference in the wells heights tells us how much goes to there is that

398
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:49.530
the equilibrium and the barrier height tells how fast you go from one to the

399
00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:53.970
other.
So how fast do you go from Auntie to ghost?
Do you remember how to do that?

400
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:56.860
<v 2>Anybody remember?</v>

401
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.000
Genu you remember how to do it?

402
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.910
<v 0>How to find out how fast something is.
If you know how big the barrier is,</v>

403
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:14.050
you have to go across.
No,
but you'll know it for the final.

404
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.370
Okay.
It's 10 to the 13th per second,
pretty fast.

405
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.940
But then slowed down by that same kind of equilibrium constant.

406
00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:25.420
10 to the minus three.
It's how big the barrier is.
Now,

407
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.440
if the barrier is 3.4,
say it was for say the barriers for,

408
00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:34.150
it's about that 10 to the three fourths of is tend to the third,
right?

409
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.760
So it's slowed down by 10 to the third.

410
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:42.460
It's 10 to the 13th per second times 10 to the minus third.
Right?

411
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.200
So it's 10 to the 10th per second.
Okay.
There it is.
Oops,
I did it wrong.

412
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.010
Uh,
uh,
there's three for us.

413
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.810
<v 2>What did I do wrong here?
Pardon me.</v>

414
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.370
<v 0>That's not the difference.
So</v>

415
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.240
I think I've got a Typo here that can happen.
Okay.

416
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:11.970
Anyhow,
it should I,
I th I think,
uh,

417
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.760
subject to the thinking while I'm not on my feet,

418
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.990
that this should be about 10 to the 10th per second.
Okay.
Any,
you see the,
uh,

419
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.960
you see how you would use it,
right?
10 to the 13th times.
Whoops.

420
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.180
Oh,
I forgot to plug you.
No,
I did play in.
Oh,
it's okay.
Okay.
So,
uh,

421
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.310
there we go.
Hey.

422
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.500
And the fully eclipse barrier is about 4.4 kilocalories per mole,

423
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.550
but that's hard to access experimentally.
Why?

424
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.020
Because experimentally you try to tell how fast one thing goes to another,

425
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.060
right?
But it's possible to get from Auntie to go,
shh.

426
00:28:51.061 --> 00:28:52.890
Without going over that barrier.

427
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.870
And it's possible to go from Gauche to Auntie without going over that barrier to

428
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.610
go from Gauche to Gauche.

429
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.320
Do you have no notice that 360 degrees is the same as zero degrees,
right?

430
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:08.940
So you can go from,
this goes to,
this goes by going over that barrier,
right?

431
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.660
So can you measure that rate and see what that barrier is?

432
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.380
No,
because there's an easier way to go.

433
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.280
Instead of going like this to get from one goes to the other,

434
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:23.610
you just go like this,
right?
So there's an easier way to do it.

435
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:26.250
So you can't measure the rate and know what that barrier is.

436
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:31.170
That barrier is more or less irrelevant experimentally.
Okay.

437
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:35.830
Or here's the ring flip in cyclohexane.
Now let me,
uh,

438
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.020
I'll use this one to animate it to show you how you can try this program

439
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:44.620
yourself.
Okay?
So here,
here we go.
On there,
there's the thing doing its ring flip.

440
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.850
And it's nice because you can grab it and rotate it around and see it from

441
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:51.640
different points of view as it does its ring flip.

442
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.840
So there's flipping one end down and then flipping the other end up right to go

443
00:29:58.661 --> 00:29:59.890
from one chair to the other.

444
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.580
So you can fiddle with this or you can get models and try them to,

445
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.060
okay.
Or as I said,
you can go,

446
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:11.080
we get stopped that and you can go over here and see what it looks like at the,

447
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.740
at the,
uh,
at the halfway point.

448
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.650
Now notice that that is a little bit like a boat,

449
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.960
but it's a twisted boat as I said,

450
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:24.190
because the actual boat is up here at the top.
In fact,

451
00:30:24.191 --> 00:30:27.760
even at the top,
it's not of an apartment.
I said the wrong thing,

452
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:32.770
it's not up at the top.
It's sort of a half chair,

453
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:35.290
half boat,
right?
This,

454
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.320
this top left carbon is still in the sort of chair like form or these five

455
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:44.350
carbons are,
but this one is halfway bent up toward a boat.

456
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.070
Okay.
Anyhow,
you can fiddle with those things.
Um,

457
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.760
let's see.
Uh,
what do I need to do here?
Go back here.

458
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.600
Okay,
so there's the chair Khan from her.

459
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:01.300
There's the flexible or twisted boat,
Khan from firmer.

460
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.600
Now that one is really fun.
I'm going to do it here.

461
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.390
And people who have this can do it.
Notice,

462
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.990
did you notice when you played with this that the chair is sort of rigid?

463
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.010
If you try to twist it,

464
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:15.040
it's hard that everybody has everybody's be it felt to feel that.

465
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.600
But if you get into the boat form like that,
then it's quite flexible.

466
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:21.610
You can do this to your heart's content.

467
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:24.940
Did you feel that after you've passed it across,

468
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:28.930
pass it back so everybody can feel how easy is great.
It's like the Orb,

469
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.000
right?
But the,
but the chair is quite rigid,
right?

470
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:38.020
And as it goes from chair to boat,
it clicks,
like

471
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.910
click,
click.
Okay.
So there's a barrier.

472
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.210
That's the point.
But in the flexible form,
there's not a barrier.

473
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.820
It just smoothly rotates.
Okay.

474
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.120
So there's that barrier of 11 kilocalories per mole.

475
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:59.470
So it takes some time to get back on forth.
Okay.
And here's the flexible one.

476
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:02.140
And you can animate that and watch it flex.
Okay,

477
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.760
so that's the twist boat form.
Okay.

478
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:10.840
Now we're going to talk about the shape,
strain,
energy,

479
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:14.650
and molecular mechanics.
The point is to talk about molecular mechanics.

480
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:16.060
How do you get these energies,

481
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:21.270
that particular animation use the quantum mechanical calculation that didn't do

482
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:24.880
a very good job on the energies as we just showed.

483
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.230
But is there an easier way to get these energies in that areas?

484
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.070
And it's called molecular mechanics.
Essentially,
it's just using Hooke's law,

485
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.000
uh,
for the model to calculate strain energies.

486
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.500
So we already saw the tortional energy of ethane at three kilocalories per mole,

487
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.860
a threefold barrier,
three minima as you go across,

488
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.270
and the confirmational energy of mutate.
And it's fun to remember those numbers.

489
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.200
Point nine for,
for Auntie to Gauche,

490
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.280
3.4 barrier between them.
And then maybe 4.4 but who knows for the other one?

491
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.780
Okay?
Now remember,
1950 is when all of these things were happening.

492
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:07.990
So in 1946 there was a paper by Frank Westheimer and Joseph mayor from the

493
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.940
University of Chicago about using mechanics to calculate the energies of

494
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:14.780
confirmations.

495
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:18.590
The particular thing they were interested in is when you have to benzene rings,

496
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:22.130
Hook together so that they can rotate like this,
right?

497
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.960
They can't rotate freely if you have things here that are sticking out that

498
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:30.290
would run into one another as you try to rotate,
right?

499
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.850
So you could get one that's twisted this way and one that's twisted this way in

500
00:33:34.851 --> 00:33:39.800
a substituted by fennel and you can resolve them and get optically active
forums.

501
00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:42.230
One that's twisted to the right,
one that's twisted to the left,

502
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.740
even though you don't have a carbon that has four different things on it because

503
00:33:45.741 --> 00:33:47.450
it can't rotate,
right?

504
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.590
But the question is how big should that Barry or B and Westheimer was intro

505
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:56.150
Westheimer in fact,
as you're,
uh,
uh,
great uncle,

506
00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.520
right?
Cause he also studied with Conant and Kohler at Harvard,

507
00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:05.000
the same as my teacher Bartlett did.
Okay.

508
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.170
So he was interested in physical,
organic chemistry and did this incidentally,

509
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:14.171
he's also the guy that figured out which hydrogen you pull off on on ethanol,

510
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.720
you know,
that enzyme spent,
uh,

511
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.600
choose between the pro are and the pro se hydrogens.
So Anyhow,

512
00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.370
Westheimer did this in 1946 and figured if he,
that the,

513
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.940
if you have a bromine here in a bromine here,
that when it's flat and a Chiral,

514
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.960
that's the transition state between being twisted one way and being twisted.

515
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:37.730
The other that,
whoops,
sorry,
that these two things would run into one another,

516
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.630
but that would mean the bonds might bend back a little bit or something.

517
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.340
How much energy would that cost?

518
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.340
So he tried to do it by what's called molecular mechanics.

519
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.560
So these programs calculate the energy and they can minimize that by adjusting

520
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:54.590
angles to get the minimum energy,
uh,

521
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.920
by treating these molecules as if they were mechanical.

522
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.050
And to achieve useful precision.

523
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:04.430
They require a very large set of empirical force constants.

524
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.100
That is how strong are the various springs.

525
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:12.370
And you adjust these arbitrarily on some test molecules in order to get the best

526
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:15.230
values and then try to apply it to something else.

527
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.140
You can also do it nowadays by reliable,

528
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:21.860
unlike the ones that we just talked about,
quantum mechanical calculations.

529
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.230
But I want to show you how many parameters there are when you do molecular

530
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:31.700
mechanics.
Okay.
So this is so called m m two.

531
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:36.110
That's a particular molecular mechanics scheme.
And these are parameters.

532
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:39.270
So there are 66 different Adam types,

533
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:44.520
14 different types of carbon depending on what it's bonded to.

534
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.170
Okay.
So here are,
here are some of the,
here are the 14 different types of carbon,

535
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.500
the carbon and the alkane in an alkene in the now kind,

536
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:55.440
the carbon and the carbon cad I and the carbon and the carbon eel group,

537
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:57.780
the carbonated carb,
oxalate and so on.

538
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.510
And these have different van der Walls Radii I,

539
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:05.310
which is one of the things you have to put in.
Okay.
Uh,
now,

540
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.990
then you have these various kinds of Adam's hooked together and you have a

541
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:12.590
certain strength for stretching the spring.
Oh,

542
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.380
that is to say you need what the you need,

543
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:18.620
what the equilibrium bond distances,

544
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:23.330
the minimum energy bond distance and how strong the uh,

545
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.220
forest constant is for stretching that spring.

546
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.840
So notice there are 138 different bond stretching's.

547
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.000
These are just the ones that involve where the first Adam is of type one.
Okay.

548
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.920
So you need to find out what all those forced constants are.
Okay.

549
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.100
Then you can bend bonds and there are 624 different strengths of springs for

550
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:49.050
bending different types of bonds.

551
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:53.550
41 shown here involve alkane carbon,

552
00:36:53.551 --> 00:36:57.210
alkane carbon,
and then some other group.
It could be another alkane carbon.

553
00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:01.290
That's the very top one.
One one one is three Alkane carbons.

554
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.620
So that's the forced constant for bending the bond and,

555
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.640
but then there are different equilibrium bond angles all close to 109 and a

556
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:15.620
half.
Remember that's the tetrahedral angle,
but a little bit different.

557
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.740
It according to whether that particular carbon has two other our groups on it or

558
00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:25.110
an our group in an age or two H's in addition to the other two groups you're

559
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:28.080
talking about.
Actually bending the bond.
So you get,

560
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.110
so there are a s so then,

561
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.690
then of course you can twist bonds also.

562
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.090
That's what confirmation involves after all.

563
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.290
And there are 1,494 different bond twisting.

564
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:44.580
And for each bond twisting you have three parameters here.

565
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.901
For example,

566
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:50.901
V3 also V to v one for each of those 1500 whatever number it was of bonds.

567
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:54.000
Now let's show you what that means.

568
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:59.280
V3 means a threefold barrier and it says its height as 0.0 a nine three

569
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.740
kilocalories per or uh,
yeah,

570
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:08.260
kilocalories per mole.
So here it is,
right?
It's,

571
00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:11.550
it's maximum when it's a clips,
it's minimum when it staggered,

572
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:16.320
maximum eclipse minimum staggered.
So that's a threefold barrier for rotating.

573
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.610
But there's also for a particular kind of set of three bonds,

574
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:25.800
there's a twofold barrier which looks like that,
right?
And that one,

575
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:30.801
you see his 0.27 kilocalories high and there's also a one fold barrier

576
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.840
like that,
right?
Which is for that particular one,

577
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:41.240
Al k and l,
K and l,
K and L K and 0.2 kilo calories high.

578
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.440
Now you add all these together and that is the torsional contribution to the

579
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:51.370
energy and butane or anything where you have car al k,
now,
k,
now l,
k now cane.

580
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.880
Right now we know what it really looks like and butane,

581
00:38:54.881 --> 00:38:57.610
it looks like that the scale is much bigger.

582
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.640
So this is a rather minor contribution.
Now,

583
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:05.641
why is it that the ante is the most stable according to this scheme?

584
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.880
It's because it's in the Vander walls.

585
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:14.380
Repulsion is least when these two carbons are as far apart from one another

586
00:39:14.381 --> 00:39:18.100
rather than being eclipsed with one another.
Right?
Uh,

587
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.900
but that then is by it.
You calculate that Vander walls repulsion,

588
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:27.130
which depends on the radio.
I have various things,
right?
And,

589
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.930
and you then tweak it by adding this to it all,
uh,

590
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.400
as well.
Right?
So you can see that these are pretty complicated for a computer.

591
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.270
It's not a problem.

592
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:41.020
It's a lot easier than quantum mechanics finding all these curvatures and stuff.

593
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:41.950
But,

594
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.210
but it's still a pretty intricate thing and an enormous number of parameters.

595
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.880
After simplification,
there's so-called mm,

596
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.930
three scheme has more than 2000 arbitrarily adjustable parameters that you have

597
00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:59.770
to fill out by knowing a lot of different experimental results.

598
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.290
And what would I have to make the numbers to make that right?

599
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:04.630
And then it has to be also right with this one,
this one,
this one.

600
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.840
So obviously you need at least 2000 different molecules to determine 2000

601
00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:12.460
parameters are 2000 different measurements at least.

602
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.060
So it's a very highly parameterized system.

603
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:20.290
Contrast that with quantum mechanics where there are no arbitrary parameters.

604
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:24.640
All you have is the particle masses,
their charges and plunks constant,

605
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.680
right?
So there's nothing fundamentally correct about molecular mechanics.

606
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:33.640
It's just a very complicated scheme that's been tweaked to try to give good

607
00:40:33.641 --> 00:40:37.690
results for the molecules that it's tweaked on the basis of.

608
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.170
But that doesn't necessarily mean that it'll work for anything else.
Uh,

609
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.640
but it does work pretty well.

610
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.300
And the Nice thing about it is by looking at the calculations,

611
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:49.270
you can figure out why things happen the way I do with,
for example,

612
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:52.180
here's ideal cyclohexane and the way that we've been drawing it.

613
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.050
And we can look at the various kinds of strain that there are in that first,

614
00:40:56.051 --> 00:41:00.550
we take an ideal cyclohexane,
which means it has ideal bond lengths,

615
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.840
bond angles,
and is staggered like this.
Okay.

616
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:05.913
And there's no,

617
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:11.100
no strain of court for stretch bend or what's called stretch band.

618
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.770
Why is there a term called stretch bend?

619
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.410
Because when you stretch a bond,

620
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.150
it might be easier to bend or conceivably harder to bend when it stretched.

621
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.560
So you have to put another term in for that.
Okay.

622
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:31.090
But there is tortional energy because they're Gauche interactions here.

623
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.490
Uh,
like that one.
But there are six of them as you go around the ring.

624
00:41:35.491 --> 00:41:36.500
So they're not anti.

625
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:41.501
So there's tortional energy and then there's what's called non one for van der

626
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.360
walls energy,
which in fact is favorable.
It's attractive.
Okay.

627
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.660
And here you see at example,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

628
00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:55.190
those Adam's Adam one and Adam five,
there are five atoms apart,
right?

629
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.800
So it's non one four,
it's one five.

630
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.400
And they're at a distance where their interaction is attractive according to

631
00:42:01.401 --> 00:42:02.540
Vander walls energy.

632
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.030
But you can have one for Vander walls energy,
uh,
as,

633
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.750
uh,
here,
there's one,
two,
three,
four,

634
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.720
and that you see is costs you,

635
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.490
it's it's strain of 6.3 kilocalories per mole.
Not that particular one,

636
00:42:19.491 --> 00:42:23.030
but some of them all up.
Okay?
There's a very bad one here.

637
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:25.490
You can see between one and eight.
Those are very,

638
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.190
those are rather close together.
Okay?

639
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.560
So there's this much strain in that.

640
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:35.060
Now what a molecular mechanics program can do is adjust the geometry,

641
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:39.320
twist bond,
stretch them,
bend them,
and so on to minimize the energy.

642
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.050
Okay?
And here's what happens.

643
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.320
Where's the total strain energy before a diff defamation is almost eight

644
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:51.380
kilocalories from wall after.
Let's see,

645
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:55.880
what did I do after you've minimized it?
Those are the energies.

646
00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:58.280
It falls by to 6.5600000000000005.

647
00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:02.240
So he gets a kilo calorie 0.3 better.
Okay.

648
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.750
Now notice what happened.
It stretched the bonds a little bit.

649
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.440
It bent the bonds a little bit,
right?

650
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.520
Let's see exactly what it did by looking at the model.
So there's the,

651
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.920
it's going to stretch and flatten the rings slightly to reduce that bad Vander

652
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:20.630
walls repulsion.

653
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:25.280
Notice the van or the one for Vander walls before was 6.32 and it's cut down to

654
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:28.220
4.68.
So watch what happens.
So this is,

655
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.390
did you see it?
Let's back up.

656
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:37.780
See it flattens and stretches just the bit to get the reduced those Vander walls

657
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.820
repulsions so that's this.

658
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:45.821
So this way I told you to draw a cyclohexane to get at the same way more did is

659
00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:50.060
the way organic chemists do it,
but it's not quite right.
Actually.

660
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:54.260
The rings flatten a little bit and the things that are should be axial spread

661
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:59.020
out just a little bit.
Okay.
Um,
fine.

662
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.070
So some things get better,
some things get worse.

663
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.950
Overall it gets a little better and it would be very hard to do that in your

664
00:44:03.951 --> 00:44:08.180
head.
Right?
The molecular mechanics is good to do that.
Okay.

665
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.450
Now there you notice is a gauche butane within the cyclohexane and we know how

666
00:44:14.991 --> 00:44:18.050
much gauche butane costs compared to anti butane.

667
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:22.580
How much strain is there and Gauche butane,
do you remember Gauche versus Auntie?

668
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.100
I said that was worth remembering.

669
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:30.980
It's 0.9 kilocalories per mole.
Okay.
But in fact,
in the whole,

670
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.020
there are six Gauche butanes cause every bond is part of a Gauche.

671
00:44:35.021 --> 00:44:39.030
Butte is the central bond to negotiate butane.
So if you,

672
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.790
if you ted six Gauche butanes,

673
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
that would be a strain of six times 0.9 5.4 kilocalories per mole.

674
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

675
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.970
<v 0>And in fact that's rather close to 6.5600000000000005 so that actually is way</v>

676
00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:57.180
over simplified.
So,

677
00:44:57.181 --> 00:45:00.990
but it's a good mnemonic device for remembering how big it is.

678
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:02.790
It's about six Gauche butanes.

679
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:08.280
Or suppose you had axial methyl cyclohexane.

680
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.020
Now you have much,
much worse Vander walls interactions,
right?

681
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.190
Six and eight kilocalories per mole of strain.

682
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.880
But what's going to happen if I let it relax,

683
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:23.520
if I run like a mechanics and let it minimize its energy?

684
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:27.150
Can you guess what's going to happen?
How will the Structure Change

685
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.453
<v 2>Virginia?</v>

686
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.380
<v 0>Yeah.
That methyl group on the top is really in trouble,
right?
Because of those,</v>

687
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.620
those non one for Vander walls repulsion.

688
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:44.580
But if you bend it back to the right a little bit,
you'll real reduce that.

689
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.550
So here's what happens.
It relaxes like that.

690
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:52.850
And now notice that the non one for Vander walls went from being bad by six

691
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:56.820
kilocalories per mole to being good by 1.3 overall.

692
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:58.890
Some of them all up right?

693
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:04.190
So it went from 16 kilocalories of strain to only not hire from 17 denied.

694
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.630
Okay?
And notice that here,

695
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:13.300
there are two more Gauche butanes in the,

696
00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.310
in axial methyl cyclohexane.

697
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.350
There were already six in the cyclohexane ring.
Now there are two more.

698
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:25.150
So you'd guess,
uh,
you'd guess,
whoops,
I went too fast.
You'd guess.

699
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:30.070
Uh,
uh,
eight times 0.9 7.2.
It's 8.6.

700
00:46:30.071 --> 00:46:31.210
It's in the right ballpark.

701
00:46:31.211 --> 00:46:35.800
So it's roughly what you would expect for eight Gauche butanes.
Okay.

702
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.010
Now if you go from axial to equity Loreal,

703
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:44.310
then it turns out that energy difference is 1.8 kilocalories per mole equatorial

704
00:46:45.071 --> 00:46:48.700
is 1.8 better than axial?
Does that surprise you?

705
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:56.620
That is 1.8 could you have guessed that it would be 1.8 notice what it was

706
00:46:56.621 --> 00:47:00.220
axial.
There were two Gauche butane interactions.

707
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:01.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

708
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.210
<v 0>When it's equatorial,
those two Gauche butanes become anti butanes.</v>

709
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.530
And a Gauche to Auntie is 0.9.
There are two of them.

710
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.210
So 1.8 right?
Two goshes become two aunties.

711
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.530
So that's axial to equatorial.
And in fact,
you could put other groups,

712
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:22.320
they're like,
instead of a methyl group,

713
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:25.650
it could be chlorine or bromine or ethyl or something like that.

714
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.590
And for any of these,
if you can measure the amount of aquatory,

715
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.980
equatorial and axial,

716
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.140
you can get a major of how big that group is,
right?

717
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.870
So that these so called a values,
