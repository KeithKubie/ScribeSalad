00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.650
Find the volume of a sphere with
a diameter of 14 centimeters.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.520
So if I have a sphere-- so
this isn't just a circle,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.460
this is a sphere.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.350
You could view it as
a globe of some kind.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.183
So I'm going to shade
it a little bit so you

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.830
can tell that it's
three-dimensional.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.320
They're giving us the diameter.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.120
So if we go from one
side of the sphere

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.890
straight through
the center of it.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.430
So we're imagining that we
can see through the sphere.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.180
And we go straight
through the centimeter,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.960
that distance right over
there is 14 centimeters.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.810
Now, to find the volume of a
sphere-- and we've proved this,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.200
or you will see a proof for this
later when you learn calculus.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.480
But the formula for
the volume of a sphere

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.880
is volume is equal
to 4/3 pi r cubed,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.411
where r is the
radius of the sphere.

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.785
So they've given
us the diameter.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:54.280
And just like for circles,
the radius of the sphere

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.020
is half of the diameter.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.440
So in this example, our radius
is going to be 7 centimeters.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.650
And in fact, the sphere
itself is the set

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.670
of all points in three
dimensions that is exactly

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.704
the radius away from the center.

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.370
But with that out of
the way, let's just

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.950
apply this radius being 7
centimeters to this formula

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.140
right over here.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.540
So we're going to
have a volume is

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.920
equal to 4/3 pi times 7
centimeters to the third power.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
So I'll do that in
that pink color.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.090
So times 7 centimeters
to the third power.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.430
And since it
already involves pi,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.880
and you could
approximate pi with 3.14.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.184
Some people even
approximate it with 22/7.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.100
But we'll actually just
get the calculator out

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.590
to get the exact
value for this volume.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.870
So this is going to
be-- so my volume is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.940
going to be 4 divided by 3.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.900
And then I don't want
to just put a pi there,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.640
because that might interpret
it as 4 divided by 3 pi.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.420
So 4 divided by 3 times pi,
times 7 to the third power.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.370
In order of operations,
it'll do the exponent

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.786
before it does the
multiplication,

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:12.680
so this should work out.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.650
And the units are going to be
in centimeters cubed or cubic

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.410
centimeters.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.340
So we get 1,436.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.010
They don't tell us
what to round it to.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.590
So I'll just round it to
the nearest 10th-- 1,436.8.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.750
So this is equal to
1,436.8 centimeters cubed.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.580
And we're done.
