00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
Breasts. They provide nourishment for our
babies, they are one of the few organs not

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.400
fully developed at birth, and of course are
a major obsession in western culture. Yet

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960
there is so much about breasts that isn’t
discussed or is deemed taboob, sorry “taboo”.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.570
So, what does science say about breasts?

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.349
Forget water into wine - what about blood
into milk? Proteins, sugars, and fat are pulled

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.230
from a mother's blood supply to make milk,
and it is this action that has made mammals

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.689
so successful. Unlike birds or reptiles, whose
young are dependent on parents to bring them

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.090
outside food such as insects, mammals, from
the word mammary, access their nutrition at

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.010
a young age from the secretion of a mother's
milk.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.870
Breasts come in all shapes and sizes and though
there is a positive correlation between breast

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.440
size and weight, genes also play a crucial
role in the size of boobs. 50% of the time

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.969
one breast is larger than the other, most
commonly the left boob, known as breast asymmetry.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.199
This asymmetry is normal and though scientists
aren’t entirely clear why, a possible contributor

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.309
is the hormonal changes that happen during
puberty. On top of this, the size of your

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.969
breasts vary from week to week! Yup, the production
of estrogen and progesterone throughout the

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.159
menstrual cycle changes the size of your breasts.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.390
Both men and women have nipples and mammary
glands, but usually only women have them develop

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.840
at puberty. This characteristic is uniquely
human as other mammals breasts only enlarge

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.450
during nursing. The ring of pigmented skin
surrounding the nipple is called the areola

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.960
which is covered in little bumps called Montgomery's
Gland. While lactating, the glands make oily

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.030
secretions that keep the nipple lubricated
and may also release compounds to make the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.750
nipple seem yummy for a baby.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.369
The nipple isn’t composed of a single orifice
but has many tiny holes you cannot see with

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.570
the naked eye. After having a baby, receptors
in the nipple detect when the baby begins

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.450
to suckle, sending messages to the mother's
brain, causing a release of oxytocin and continued

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.640
production of prolactin. Oxytocin causes cells
that line the mammary glands to contract and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.719
is also known as the cuddle hormone, as it
enhances the bonding experience between mother

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.600
and child. The hormone prolactin is essential
in making milk. This whole hormonal process

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.270
can be triggered after only hearing a baby
cry, even if it isn’t your baby!

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.979
Babies love breasts, but so do people. Research
has found that people spend more time observing

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.410
large breasts with a certain hip to width
ratio - potentially explaining why breast

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.350
augmentation surgeries are the most prevalent
form of plastic surgery, with 300,000 surgeries

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.530
being performed in 2014...in America alone.
However, the same research shows that people

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.050
prefer breasts of all different shapes and
sizes, and medium sized breasts were actually

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.970
rated as statistically most attractive. Breasts
don’t only create joy for others, but also

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.110
for oneself. Studies show that stimulation
of nipples enhanced sexual arousal in 82%

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.580
of women and 52% of men. Interestingly an
fMRI scan that mapped the brain's response

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.080
to clitoral and vaginal self-stimulation,
found that the same areas lit up when a woman

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.510
stimulated her nipples.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.950
Despite being an amazing source of both nutrition
and pleasure, breasts are incredibly vulnerable.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.840
Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of
cancer in North America. Cells that divide

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.620
often are at a higher risk of mutations than
cells that don’t divide - and because breasts

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.980
change and grow over the course of our lives,
these cells are frequently dividing. The hormone

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.310
estrogen also stimulates breast cell division,
and there are environmental chemicals found

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.840
in pesticides, industrial products, and even
our food that mimic estrogen and can influence

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.560
cell growth, increasing the risk of breast
cancer. Research is discovering new risk factors

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.230
of breast cancer such as breast density, age
of first pregnancy, and genetic predisposition

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.480
to breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.
This scientific knowledge can help increase

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.480
prevention.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.060
Although they are vulnerable, they are incredible,
and regardless of shapes and sizes they are

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.840
an essential aspect of sustaining human life
and defining us as a species. Thank you boobs.
