00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:02.590
Most modern web applications
have elegant URLs.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.038
This helps people remember links which
then can be easily bookmarked or

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.081
shared with others.

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:11.354
As we saw in previous videos, the route
decorator is used to bind a function to

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.339
a URL, but there is more to
it than just static paths.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.702
We can make certain paths
of the URL dynamic and

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.649
attach multiple rules to a function.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:24.285
To add variables to a URL, I can specify
a rule with type: variable_name,

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:28.522
where type can be an integer,
string, or another path.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.151
I will make a new route for
my menu app as so, and

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.401
use the restaurant id to specify
which menu I want to see.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.128
Note that it's handy to leave
in this trailing slash, and

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:40.202
Flask will render the page,
even when it's not there in the URL.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:43.449
I will now save my changes and
visit localhost port

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.488
5000/restaurants/1/menu and
see my first restaurant menu there.

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:50.765
If I change the integer
after restaurants,

00:00:50.765 --> 00:00:53.420
I can see other restaurants
in my database as well.
