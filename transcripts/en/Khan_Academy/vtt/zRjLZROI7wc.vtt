00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.720
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.150
is get some practice comparing fractions

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.200
with different denominators.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.190
So, let's say I wanted to
compare two over four, or 2/4,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.170
and I want to compare that
to five over 12, or 5/12.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.190
And I encourage you to
pause the video if you

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.011
could figure out which one
is greater, 2/4 or 5/12,

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:23.896
or maybe they are equal.

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:25.650
So, let's think about this a little bit.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
When I just look at it, it's
not obvious which one is larger

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.206
and there's several ways
that we can look at this.

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:35.320
One way is we can try to
have the same denominator.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.010
We can rewrite these so that we

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.545
can have the same denominator.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:39.950
So one way to think about it, can I write

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.428
two over four as something over 12?

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.495
Well, let's think about it.

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:52.670
If instead of having fourths,
if you have twelfths,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.286
you now have three times as many sections

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:58.135
that you've divided something into.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:00:59.943
So, two pieces would then turn

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:02.308
into three times as many pieces.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.420
So, you multiply the
numerator by three, as well.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.290
If you multiply the denominator by three,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.869
you multiply the numerator
by three, as well.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.424
So, 2/4 is the same thing as 6/12.

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:14.110
Another way to think about it is

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.750
two is half of four, six is half of 12.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.987
Now, can we compare 6/12 to 5/12?

00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:28.541
Well, I have more twelfths here.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:31.399
I have six of them versus 5/12.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.288
Now, I can make the comparison.

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:34.893
And I can say, look if
I have six of something,

00:01:34.893 --> 00:01:37.839
in this case, this thing
I have six of is twelfths,

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.622
that's going to be more than
having five of the twelfths.

00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.650
So, 6/12 is greater than 5/12,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.087
and I always think of
the greater than sign,

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:48.180
you're always going to be opening

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.684
to whichever one is larger.

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:51.105
So, this is the greater than sign.

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:53.381
So if 6/12 is greater than 5/12,

00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:55.779
then 2/4 is greater than 5/12,

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:59.375
because 2/4 and 6/12 are
the exact same thing.

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.793
Now, let's tackle another one.

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:04.475
This one might be a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:07.350
Let's say we want to compare

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.650
three over five and we want to compare

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.490
that to 2/3, two over three.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.790
And like always, pause the video

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.985
and see if you can figure this out.

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:21.013
And I'll give you a
hint, try to rewrite both

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:24.121
of these so that they
have the same denominator.

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:25.847
So, let's try to do that.

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:29.282
So, five isn't a multiple of three,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.582
three isn't a multiple of five,

00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:33.203
so we need to find a common denominator.

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:35.028
Well, a common denominator
would be something

00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:38.424
that is divisible by both five and three.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.815
So the easiest thing I can think of is 15,

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.110
which is five times three.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.839
So, let's write 3/5 as something over 15,

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.768
and let's write 2/3 as something over 15.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.135
So, 2/3 I'm going to write
as something over 15.

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:59.581
Well, to go from five to
15, I multiply it by three.

00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:01.938
So, I multiplied by three.

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:03.655
So, if I multiply the
denominator by three,

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.378
I need to multiply the numerator by three.

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:07.372
So, multiply by three.

00:03:07.372 --> 00:03:11.640
So, 3/5 is going to be
the same thing as 9/15.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.286
I multiplied the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:16.250
both by the same number, which
doesn't change its value.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.950
I'm just rewriting it, so 3/5
is the same thing as 9/15.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.644
And now, let's look at 2/3.

00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:25.943
To go from three to 15,
you multiply by five.

00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:27.893
So, you do the same
thing with the numerator.

00:03:27.893 --> 00:03:30.820
We need to multiply the numerator by five.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.820
Two times five is 10, so 2/3
is the same thing as 10/15.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.168
And now, we can make a comparsion

00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:39.853
because we have a certain
number of fifteenths

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:42.183
compared to another number of fifteenths.

00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:46.409
So what's larger, 9/15 or 10/15?

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.320
Well 10, if you have 10 of
something, it's going to be more.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.490
So, 10/15 is larger than 9/15.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.551
So, I've put the symbol that
opens to the larger one.

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:57.509
And so this one is the less than symbol.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.285
9/15 is less than 10/15,

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:03.088
but since 9/15 is the same thing as 3/5

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:06.318
and 10/15 is just another
way of rewriting 2/3,

00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:08.655
we can also put the
less than symbol there.

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:13.655
3/5 is less than 2/3.
