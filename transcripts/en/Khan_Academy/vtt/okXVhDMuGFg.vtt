00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:02.221
- [Voiceover] What I have
attempted to draw here

00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:04.504
in yellow is a parabola,

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.470
and as we've already
seen in previous videos,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.903
a parabola can be defined
as the set of all points

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:13.821
that are equidistant
to a point and a line,

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.338
and the point is called
the focus of the parabola,

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:21.071
and the line is called the
directrix of the parabola.

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:22.188
What I want to do in this video,

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.207
it's gonna get a little
bit of hairy algebra,

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:25.953
but given that definition,

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:26.670
I want to see,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.837
and given that definition,
and given a focus

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:31.737
at the point x equals a, y equals b,

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:35.189
and a line, a directrix, at y equals k,

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.238
to figure out what is the equation

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.787
of that parabola actually going to be,

00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:43.053
and it's going to be based
on a's, b's, and k's,

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:44.989
so let's do that.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.969
So let's take a arbitrary
point on the parabola.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.021
Let's say we take this
point right over here,

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.288
and its x-coordinate is x,
and its y-coordinate is y,

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.771
and by definition, in order
for this to be a parabola,

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.221
it has to be equidistant to
its focus and its directrix,

00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.288
so what does that mean?

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:04.756
That means that the
distance to the directrix,

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.272
which I'm drawing here in blue,

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:10.671
has to be the same as the
distance to the focus,

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.497
which I am drawing in magenta,

00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:14.321
and when we take the
distance to the directrix,

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.037
we literally just drop a perpendicular,

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:17.787
I guess you could say say,

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:19.354
that is, that's going to be

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:22.436
the shortest distance to that line,

00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:25.651
but the distance to the focus,

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.367
well we see that's at a bit of an angle,

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.348
and we might have to use
the distance formula,

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:32.333
which is really just
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.117
So let's do that.

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:36.033
This distance has to be
the same as that distance.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:37.984
So, what's this blue distance?

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:40.483
Well, that's just gonna
be our change in y.

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.999
It's going to be this y, minus k.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.749
It's just this distance.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.984
So it's going to be y minus k.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:50.901
Now we have to be careful.

00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.116
The way I've just drawn it,

00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:55.283
yes, y is greater than k,

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:56.900
so this is going to give
us a positive value,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.432
and you need a non-negative value

00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:00.437
if you're talking about distances,

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:03.166
but you can definitely
have a parabola where

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.799
the y-coordinate of the focus is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.316
lower than the y-coordinate
of the directrix,

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:09.066
in which case this would be negative.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.700
So what we really want is
the absolute value of this,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.616
or, we could square it,

00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:17.284
and then we could take the square root,

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:19.067
the principle root,
which would be equivalent

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:22.283
to taking the absolute value of y minus k.

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.367
So that's this distance right over here,

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.568
and by the definition of a parabola,

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.416
in order for (x,y) to be
sitting on the parabola,

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.549
that distance needs to be
the same as the distance

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.235
from (x,y) to (a,b), to the focus.

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:36.774
So what's that going to be?

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:38.748
Well, we just apply the distance formula,

00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:40.834
or really, just the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.900
It's gonna be our change in x,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.483
so, x minus a, squared,

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.283
plus the change in y,

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:51.116
y minus b, squared,

00:02:51.116 --> 00:02:53.509
and the square root of that whole thing,

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.817
the square root of all of that business.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:03:00.901
Now, this right over here is
an equation of a parabola.

00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:02.784
It doesn't look like it,
it looks really hairy,

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.916
but it IS the equation of a parabola,

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:06.933
and to show you that, we
just have to simplify this,

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.083
and if you get inspired,

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:10.485
I encourage you to try to
simplify this on your own,

00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:11.849
it's just gonna be a little
bit of hairy algebra,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.333
but it really is not too bad.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.934
You're gonna get an
equation for a parabola

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:16.084
that you might recognize,

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:19.567
and it's gonna be in terms
of a general focus, (a,b),

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:22.048
and a gerneral directrix, y equals k,

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:23.415
so let's do that.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:25.599
So the simplest thing to start here,

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.967
is let's just square both sides,

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:28.499
so we get rid of the radicals.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.450
So if you square both sides,
on the left-hand side,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.644
you're gonna get y minus k, squared

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.470
is equal to

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:44.049
x minus a, squared,

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.646
plus y minus b, squared.

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:49.839
Fair enough?

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.009
Now what I want to do
is, I just want to end up

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.980
with just a y on the left-hand side,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.671
and just x's, ab's, and
k's on the right-hand side,

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.138
so the first thing I might want to do,

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.366
is let's expand each of these expressions

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.222
that involve with y,

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.987
so this blue one on the left-hand side,

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.159
that is going to be

00:04:07.683 --> 00:04:11.384
y squared minus 2yk,

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.871
plus k squared,

00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:15.466
and that is going to be equal to,

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:17.815
I'm gonna keep this first one the same,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:21.248
so it's gonna be x minus a, squared,

00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:23.461
and now let me expand,

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.603
I'm gonna find a color,

00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:28.256
expand this in green,

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:32.956
so plus y squared, minus
2yb, plus b squared.

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:35.990
All I did, is I multiplied
y minus b, times y minus b.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.123
Now let's see if we can simplify things.

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:39.572
So, I have a y squared on the left,

00:04:39.572 --> 00:04:40.943
I have a y squared on the right,

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:44.291
well, if I subtract y
squared from both sides,

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.322
so I can do that.

00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:47.290
Well, that simplified things a little bit,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.270
and now I can,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.784
let's see what I can do.

00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:53.335
Well let's get the k squared on this side,

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.368
so let's subtract k
squared from both sides,

00:04:56.368 --> 00:05:00.452
so, subtract k squared from both sides,

00:05:00.452 --> 00:05:02.900
so that's gonna get rid of
it on the left-hand side,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.484
and now let's add 2yb to both sides,

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:08.201
so we have all the y's
on the left-hand side,

00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.752
so, plus 2yb,

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:14.135
that's gonna give us a
2yb on the left-hand side,

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:17.267
plus 2yb.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.551
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:20.767
And I'm starting to run into my graph,

00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:22.201
so let me give myself

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.300
a little bit more real estate over here.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.335
So on the left-hand side,

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:27.994
what am I going to have?

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:31.560
This is the same thing as 2yb minus 2yk,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.585
which is the same thing,

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:33.992
actually let me just write that down.

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:36.474
That's going to be 2y--

00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:40.690
Do it in green, actually,
well, yeah, why not green?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.824
That's going to be--

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:43.324
Actually, let me start
a new color. (chuckles)

00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:46.800
That's going to be 2yb

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.016
minus 2yk.

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.174
You can factor out a 2y,

00:05:51.174 --> 00:05:53.908
and it's gonna be 2y times, b minus k.

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:54.903
So let's do that.

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:56.114
So we could write this as

00:05:56.114 --> 00:06:00.683
2 times, b minus k, y

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:03.574
if you factor out a 2 and a y,

00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:05.124
so that's the left-hand side,

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:06.574
so that's that piece right over there.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.824
These things cancel out.

00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:10.873
Now, on our right-hand side,

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:12.742
I promised you a little
bit of hairy algebra,

00:06:12.742 --> 00:06:15.408
so hopefully you see that I'm
delivering on that promise.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.923
On the right-hand side,

00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:20.708
you have x minus a, squared,

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:24.056
and then, let's see, these
characters cancel out,

00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:27.980
and you're left with b
squared minus k squared,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.291
so these two are gonna be
b squared minus k squared,

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.908
plus b squared minus k squared.

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:37.407
Now, I said all I want is
a y on the left-hand side,

00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:41.834
so let's divide everything
by two times, b minus k.

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.308
So, let's divide everything,

00:06:43.308 --> 00:06:45.715
two times, b minus k,

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.082
so, two times, b minus k.

00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:49.936
And I'm actually gonna
divide this whole thing by

00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:52.698
two times, b minus k.

00:06:52.698 --> 00:06:54.898
Now, obviously on the left-hand side,

00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:57.615
this all cancels out,
you're left with just a y,

00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:00.049
and then it's going to be y equals,

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:02.650
y is equal to one over,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.635
two times, b minus k,

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:07.116
and notice, b minus k is the difference

00:07:07.116 --> 00:07:09.732
between the y-coordinate of the focus,

00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:11.768
and the y-coordinate,
I guess you could say,

00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:13.498
of the line, y equals k,

00:07:13.498 --> 00:07:16.565
so it's one over, two times that,

00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:19.699
times x minus a, squared.

00:07:21.192 --> 00:07:24.288
So if you knew what b minus k was,

00:07:24.288 --> 00:07:26.179
this would just simplify to some number,

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:27.545
some number that's being multiplied

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:29.429
times x minus a, squared,

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:32.344
so hopefully this is starting
to look like the parabolas

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:35.121
that you remember from
your childhood, (chuckles)

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.544
if you do remember parabolas
from your childhood.

00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:39.344
Alright, so then let's see if we could

00:07:39.344 --> 00:07:42.012
simplify this thing on the right,

00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:44.527
and you might recognize,
b squared minus k squared,

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:46.060
that's a difference of squares,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.541
that's the same thing as

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:53.835
b plus k, times b minus k,

00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:00.832
so the b minus k's cancel out,

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:03.000
and we are just left with,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.961
and we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll,

00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:05.799
we are just left with

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:10.606
1/2 times, b plus k.

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:11.832
So, there you go.

00:08:11.832 --> 00:08:15.715
Given a focus at a point (a,b),

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:19.666
and a directrix at y equals k,

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.649
we now know what the
formula of the parabola

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:25.848
is actually going to be.

00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:28.132
So, for example,

00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:33.730
if I had a focus at the point,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.450
I don't know, let's say the point (1,2),

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.083
and I had a directrix at

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:45.150
y is equal to,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.048
I don't know, let's make it

00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:47.999
y is equal to -1,

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:51.566
what would the equation
of this parabola be?

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:55.699
Well, it would be y is equal to one over,

00:08:55.699 --> 00:09:00.023
two times, b minus k, so two minus -1,

00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:01.683
that's the same thing as two plus one,

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:03.798
so that's just three,

00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:06.363
two minus -1 is three,

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:11.018
times x minus one,

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:17.129
squared,

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:20.630
plus 1/2 times, b plus k.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.511
Two plus -1 is one,

00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.914
so one,

00:09:25.914 --> 00:09:27.429
and so what is this going to be?

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:29.562
You're gonna get y is equal to

00:09:29.562 --> 00:09:33.520
1/6, x minus one,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.006
squared, plus 1/2.

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:38.296
There you go.

00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:40.024
That is the parabola

00:09:40.024 --> 00:09:41.863
with a focus at (1,2)

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:45.348
and a directrix at y equals -1.

00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:47.148
Fascinating.
