00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.680
tablet so we can get the nice high
resolution graphics and see what it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
resolution graphics and see what it
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.850
resolution graphics and see what it
looks like alright so the first thing

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860
looks like alright so the first thing
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.500
looks like alright so the first thing
that I think we noticed when we started

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510
that I think we noticed when we started
 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.900
that I think we noticed when we started
this up is that it takes an age to load

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910
this up is that it takes an age to load
 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.760
this up is that it takes an age to load
now transformer prime is actually a

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770
now transformer prime is actually a
 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.560
now transformer prime is actually a
pretty powerful piece of hardware and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570
pretty powerful piece of hardware and
 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.570
pretty powerful piece of hardware and
that still took like three or four

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580
that still took like three or four
 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:45.120
that still took like three or four
seconds I was a little freaky yeah I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130
seconds I was a little freaky yeah I
 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.710
seconds I was a little freaky yeah I
think we may need too much power he's

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720
think we may need too much power he's
 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.300
think we may need too much power he's
too quickly yeah so even the load time

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
too quickly yeah so even the load time
 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.490
too quickly yeah so even the load time
that we noticed just now I think that

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500
that we noticed just now I think that
 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.870
that we noticed just now I think that
this was probably a little bit quicker

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880
this was probably a little bit quicker
 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.640
this was probably a little bit quicker
than the first launch was that we tried

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650
than the first launch was that we tried
 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.020
than the first launch was that we tried
earlier there's more sex show me show me

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
earlier there's more sex show me show me
 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.760
earlier there's more sex show me show me
yeah see if we can bring up the the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770
yeah see if we can bring up the the
 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.350
yeah see if we can bring up the the
phone cam and we'll see I see how long

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360
phone cam and we'll see I see how long
 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.699
phone cam and we'll see I see how long
it takes on that one

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.650
starting now yeah two three four so

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660
starting now yeah two three four so
 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.300
starting now yeah two three four so
again that was probably quicker than the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
again that was probably quicker than the
 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.890
again that was probably quicker than the
very first time we load it up but that's

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900
very first time we load it up but that's
 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.050
very first time we load it up but that's
still a good sort of for second load to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060
still a good sort of for second load to
 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.719
still a good sort of for second load to
to bring the first graphics up now that

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729
to bring the first graphics up now that
 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.189
to bring the first graphics up now that

free version that's very possible so
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.260
free version that's very possible so
that's something to keep in mind is that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
that's something to keep in mind is that
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.760
that's something to keep in mind is that
you really want to have that initial

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770
you really want to have that initial
 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.980
you really want to have that initial

the developers so that I should say

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759
the developers so that I should say
 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.879
the developers so that I should say

that's that that's kind of a killer

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690
that's that that's kind of a killer
 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.460
that's that that's kind of a killer
killer move right away so okay so let's

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470
killer move right away so okay so let's
 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.930
killer move right away so okay so let's
let's start have a bit of a navigation

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
let's start have a bit of a navigation
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.640
let's start have a bit of a navigation
so I think the first place you want to

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650
so I think the first place you want to
 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.860
so I think the first place you want to
go is my music right so let's see how

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
go is my music right so let's see how
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.310
go is my music right so let's see how
that looks so we can see the the in

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320
that looks so we can see the the in
 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.560
that looks so we can see the the in
terms of a tablet layout and this part

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570
terms of a tablet layout and this part
 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.089
terms of a tablet layout and this part
hasn't been particularly optimized we

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099
hasn't been particularly optimized we
 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.070
hasn't been particularly optimized we
have that sort of telltale really wide

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
have that sort of telltale really wide
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.870

ListView sort of effect you know which

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880
ListView sort of effect you know which
 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.490
ListView sort of effect you know which
can be okay it can be a little bit

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500
can be okay it can be a little bit
 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.870
can be okay it can be a little bit
off-putting I think if you've got lots

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880
off-putting I think if you've got lots
 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.790
off-putting I think if you've got lots
of black screen space or white screen

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800
of black screen space or white screen
 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.379
of black screen space or white screen
real estate that can be a bit of a

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389
real estate that can be a bit of a
 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.029
real estate that can be a bit of a
negative but generally speaking I think

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039
negative but generally speaking I think
 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.279
negative but generally speaking I think
it kind of works

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289

it's mostly that nice in this case it's

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460
it's mostly that nice in this case it's
 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.160
it's mostly that nice in this case it's
mostly a matter of sort of visually

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170
mostly a matter of sort of visually
 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.180
mostly a matter of sort of visually
measuring against some of the other

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190
measuring against some of the other
 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.680
measuring against some of the other
elements on the screen but the real

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690
elements on the screen but the real
 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.930
elements on the screen but the real
telltale thing in this UI in particular

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940
telltale thing in this UI in particular
 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.340
telltale thing in this UI in particular
is if you check the size of the touch

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350
is if you check the size of the touch
 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.350
is if you check the size of the touch
highlight that sits there you notice

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360
highlight that sits there you notice
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.720
highlight that sits there you notice
that the button itself that touch target

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730
that the button itself that touch target
 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.130
that the button itself that touch target
is slightly smaller than the full bar

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140
is slightly smaller than the full bar
 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.170
is slightly smaller than the full bar
now that's not a bad thing on its own

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180
now that's not a bad thing on its own
 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.700
now that's not a bad thing on its own
but it does sort of reveal the

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710
but it does sort of reveal the
 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.600
but it does sort of reveal the
difference here yeah okay so that's nice

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610
difference here yeah okay so that's nice
 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.120
difference here yeah okay so that's nice
I mean while we're looking at the at the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130
I mean while we're looking at the at the
 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.159
I mean while we're looking at the at the
action bar as well I'd point out you've

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169
action bar as well I'd point out you've
 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.659
action bar as well I'd point out you've
kind of got the Settings menu here as

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669
kind of got the Settings menu here as
 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.090
kind of got the Settings menu here as
well which again isn't a standard

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100
well which again isn't a standard
 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.920
well which again isn't a standard
preference to screen you can tell from

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930
preference to screen you can tell from
 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.020
preference to screen you can tell from
these right carrots or Chevron's which

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.030
these right carrots or Chevron's which
 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.310
these right carrots or Chevron's which
are non-standard

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.320
are non-standard
 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.140
are non-standard
so that that's obviously custom it it

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150
so that that's obviously custom it it
 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.560
so that that's obviously custom it it
looks relatively standard so it's not

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570
looks relatively standard so it's not
 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.909
looks relatively standard so it's not
too bad but it would be kind of nice

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919
too bad but it would be kind of nice
 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.350
too bad but it would be kind of nice
there's no real reason not to go with

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360
there's no real reason not to go with
 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.820
there's no real reason not to go with
the standard no preferences screen here

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830
the standard no preferences screen here
 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.280
the standard no preferences screen here
so it'd be kind of nice if you guys did

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.290
so it'd be kind of nice if you guys did
 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.659
so it'd be kind of nice if you guys did
if we go back and can you can you touch

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669
if we go back and can you can you touch
 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.340
if we go back and can you can you touch
one of those I'm really curious why

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350
one of those I'm really curious why
 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.370
one of those I'm really curious why
people use the the right carrot I have

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380
people use the the right carrot I have
 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.650
people use the the right carrot I have
my own theories but usually it's just to

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:38.660
my own theories but usually it's just to
 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.659
my own theories but usually it's just to
indicate that there's another screen

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669
indicate that there's another screen
 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.130
indicate that there's another screen
underneath it that's going to take you

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.140
underneath it that's going to take you
 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.510
underneath it that's going to take you
someplace different I think I think

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520
someplace different I think I think
 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.640
someplace different I think I think
that's true but why in particular the

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650
that's true but why in particular the
 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.220
that's true but why in particular the
right carrot because the the the action

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.230
right carrot because the the the action
 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.710
right carrot because the the the action
for going to another screen has nothing

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720
for going to another screen has nothing
 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.990
for going to another screen has nothing
to do with anything to the right of what

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000
to do with anything to the right of what
 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.909
to do with anything to the right of what
you see right so and I and I guess what

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919
you see right so and I and I guess what
 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.680
you see right so and I and I guess what
I'm implying is that maybe that's a

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690
I'm implying is that maybe that's a
 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.350
I'm implying is that maybe that's a
carryover from you know some other type

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360
carryover from you know some other type
 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.630
carryover from you know some other type
of system that we're where the animation

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:07.640
of system that we're where the animation
 

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.640
of system that we're where the animation
is different yeah it feels that way like

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.650
is different yeah it feels that way like
 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.200
is different yeah it feels that way like
is there maybe the developers who have

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.210
is there maybe the developers who have
 

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.969
is there maybe the developers who have
used a different operating system which

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:12.979
used a different operating system which
 

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:14.860
used a different operating system which
perhaps when you hit right everything

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:14.870
perhaps when you hit right everything
 

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.170

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:18.760

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.790
canceling system like Gingerbread
possibly possibly a different operating

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800
possibly possibly a different operating
 

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.279
possibly possibly a different operating
system like do like gingerbread so one

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:24.289
system like do like gingerbread so one
 

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:27.100
system like do like gingerbread so one
of the other ones here as well is the

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.110
of the other ones here as well is the
 

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.420
of the other ones here as well is the
design guide I believe it explicitly

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.430
design guide I believe it explicitly
 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.890
design guide I believe it explicitly
calls out the case of settings is

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:29.900
calls out the case of settings is
 

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.199
calls out the case of settings is
something that shouldn't be either

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:32.209
something that shouldn't be either
 

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:34.860
something that shouldn't be either
frequent important or typical so

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:34.870
frequent important or typical so
 

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.550
frequent important or typical so
realistically that should be in an

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560
realistically that should be in an
 

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.320
realistically that should be in an
overflow but it's exactly understandable

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.330
overflow but it's exactly understandable
 

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.390
overflow but it's exactly understandable
in a case like this where if that's the

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.400
in a case like this where if that's the
 

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.589
in a case like this where if that's the
only option that would be in the

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599
only option that would be in the
 

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:42.310
only option that would be in the
overflow

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.190

then there's sort of a simple judgment

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200
then there's sort of a simple judgment
 

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.260
then there's sort of a simple judgment
call to be made there yeah I agree I

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:47.270
call to be made there yeah I agree I
 

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.910
call to be made there yeah I agree I
think in this case though I mean what

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920
think in this case though I mean what
 

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.470
think in this case though I mean what
you've got here is you know if nothing

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480
you've got here is you know if nothing
 

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.420
you've got here is you know if nothing
else is just taking up more screen real

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:52.430
else is just taking up more screen real
 

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.829

see a cog in your like what is the cog

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560
see a cog in your like what is the cog
 

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.380

mean which means you need to press it to

mean which means you need to press it to
 

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.600
mean which means you need to press it to
find out and I think just having that

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:01.610
find out and I think just having that
 

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.340

overflow menu is kind of where users are

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.350

to be so it makes it sort of cognitively

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
to be so it makes it sort of cognitively
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.550
to be so it makes it sort of cognitively
easier to understand what you're

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560
easier to understand what you're

is something that I tend to go on a bit

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920
is something that I tend to go on a bit
 

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.070
is something that I tend to go on a bit
at length but it's creating that magical

the app you should be doing whatever it

the app you should be doing whatever it
is that the app is designed to do

is that the app is designed to do
 

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.390
is that the app is designed to do
straight away so you shouldn't have to

straight away so you shouldn't have to
 

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.920
straight away so you shouldn't have to
spend time exploring the app and

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:23.930
spend time exploring the app and
 

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.420
spend time exploring the app and
figuring out how it all works and in

figuring out how it all works and in
 

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.860
figuring out how it all works and in

but what you need to watch out for as

but what you need to watch out for as
well and I think that what

stuff front and center right so if we
and if in fact if we go in we can see

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:10.940
and if in fact if we go in we can see
 

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.699

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:02.329
entirely too much of my life before
 

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:05.440
entirely too much of my life before
joining Android writing applications in

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.450
joining Android writing applications in
 

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.750
joining Android writing applications in

organizations so I've seen far too many

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:09.770
organizations so I've seen far too many
 

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.069
organizations so I've seen far too many
of these screens which are just ranges

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079
of these screens which are just ranges
 

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:13.930
of these screens which are just ranges
of gray buttons on why the gray

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:13.940
of gray buttons on why the gray
 

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.240
of gray buttons on why the gray
backgrounds so you know maybe it's just

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.250
backgrounds so you know maybe it's just
 

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.780
backgrounds so you know maybe it's just
a hindbrain thing that just sets me off

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:19.790
a hindbrain thing that just sets me off
 

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.880
a hindbrain thing that just sets me off
but that's entirely fair yeah I'd like

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:21.890
but that's entirely fair yeah I'd like
 

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.690
but that's entirely fair yeah I'd like
it to look a little bit prettier

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700
it to look a little bit prettier
 

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.280
it to look a little bit prettier
particularly considering that the rest

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.290
particularly considering that the rest
 

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.780
particularly considering that the rest
of the app is is styled like you've

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:25.790
of the app is is styled like you've
 

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.060
of the app is is styled like you've
obviously got a designer here creating

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.070
obviously got a designer here creating
 

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.199
obviously got a designer here creating
these you know very strong visual

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:29.209
these you know very strong visual
 

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.550
these you know very strong visual
graphics and so it'd be great to see

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560
graphics and so it'd be great to see
 

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.990
graphics and so it'd be great to see
that sort of promoted throughout the

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000
that sort of promoted throughout the
 

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.840
that sort of promoted throughout the
entire app do we wanna have a look to

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:34.850
entire app do we wanna have a look to
 

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.980
entire app do we wanna have a look to
see if plays any music

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:36.990
see if plays any music
 

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.930

we ready for a little bit daring I I

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940
we ready for a little bit daring I I
 

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.670
we ready for a little bit daring I I
know but at some point we're gonna have

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680
know but at some point we're gonna have
 

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.200
know but at some point we're gonna have
to run these apps really through their

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.210
to run these apps really through their
 

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.670
to run these apps really through their
paces let's give it a shot let's have a

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680
paces let's give it a shot let's have a
 

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.550
paces let's give it a shot let's have a
look so let's take a look at our music

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560
look so let's take a look at our music
 

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.950
look so let's take a look at our music
so we jump into what's at this point a

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:48.960
so we jump into what's at this point a
 

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.430
so we jump into what's at this point a
fairly standard list of tracks we

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440
fairly standard list of tracks we
 

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.270
fairly standard list of tracks we
noticed that again the viewpager title

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.280
noticed that again the viewpager title
 

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.550
noticed that again the viewpager title
indicator gives us simple indication of

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560
indicator gives us simple indication of
 

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
indicator gives us simple indication of
some of the other functions that exist

00:13:59.920 --> 00:13:59.930
some of the other functions that exist
 

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.830
some of the other functions that exist
just off screen we have a streaming

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:03.840
just off screen we have a streaming
 

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.480
just off screen we have a streaming
radio built in via shoutcast

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:05.490
radio built in via shoutcast
 

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.530
radio built in via shoutcast
this is really nice and this is

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540
this is really nice and this is
 

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.570
this is really nice and this is
something that Manian actually called

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:08.580
something that Manian actually called
 

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.550
something that Manian actually called
out for podcast players that we would

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560
out for podcast players that we would
 

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.440
out for podcast players that we would
like to see a media player which has

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.450
like to see a media player which has
 

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.370
like to see a media player which has
both live you know our own audio that we

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380
both live you know our own audio that we
 

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.020
both live you know our own audio that we
can listen to and also having sort of

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.030
can listen to and also having sort of
 

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.760
can listen to and also having sort of
live streaming radio type functionality

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:19.770
live streaming radio type functionality
 

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.770
live streaming radio type functionality
so this is a big plus for me it sort of

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:21.780
so this is a big plus for me it sort of
 

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.300
so this is a big plus for me it sort of
takes account to different kinds of app

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:23.310
takes account to different kinds of app
 

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.280
takes account to different kinds of app
in one place absolutely I have to say

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:25.290
in one place absolutely I have to say
 

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.420
in one place absolutely I have to say
though I found it a little bit hidden

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:26.430
though I found it a little bit hidden
 

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.370
though I found it a little bit hidden
because if we go back to the main menu

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380
because if we go back to the main menu
 

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.710
because if we go back to the main menu
it's my music right so I'm expecting

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720
it's my music right so I'm expecting
 

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.300
it's my music right so I'm expecting
this is where I go to listen to things

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:32.310
this is where I go to listen to things
 

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.490
this is where I go to listen to things
that are already in my library and it's

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500
that are already in my library and it's
 

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.570
that are already in my library and it's
not until this my computer yeah 90s feel

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:38.580
not until this my computer yeah 90s feel
 

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.310
not until this my computer yeah 90s feel
to it in that case exactly and really

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320
to it in that case exactly and really
 

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.350
to it in that case exactly and really
what we're just saying is music so it

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360
what we're just saying is music so it
 

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.850
what we're just saying is music so it
would be much nicer there and being able

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860
would be much nicer there and being able
 

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.290
would be much nicer there and being able
to have the sort of the streaming stuff

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300
to have the sort of the streaming stuff
 

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.910
to have the sort of the streaming stuff
more readily available and readily

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920
more readily available and readily
 

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.290
more readily available and readily
apparent I think would be a real plus

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300
apparent I think would be a real plus
 

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.970
apparent I think would be a real plus
right so next we get into some of the

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980
right so next we get into some of the
 

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.010
right so next we get into some of the
things on the library screen here the

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.020
things on the library screen here the
 

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.170
things on the library screen here the
shuffle all show all songs and show all

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180
shuffle all show all songs and show all
 

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.120
shuffle all show all songs and show all
albums elements here are some really

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.130
albums elements here are some really
 

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.010
albums elements here are some really
tiny touch targets hmm I mean these

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.020
tiny touch targets hmm I mean these
 

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.110
tiny touch targets hmm I mean these
things are probably under 40 dip tall

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120
things are probably under 40 dip tall
 

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.170
things are probably under 40 dip tall
generally we try and go at least 48 in

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180
generally we try and go at least 48 in
 

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.920
generally we try and go at least 48 in
both dimensions to get a nice happy

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:09.930
both dimensions to get a nice happy
 

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.770
both dimensions to get a nice happy
touch target absolutely yeah so it'd be

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:12.780
touch target absolutely yeah so it'd be
 

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.120
touch target absolutely yeah so it'd be
nice if those were a little bit bigger I

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.130
nice if those were a little bit bigger I
 

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.980
nice if those were a little bit bigger I
definitely see wanting to break it up

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:15.990
definitely see wanting to break it up
 

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.260
definitely see wanting to break it up
and still show a little bit more of the

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.270
and still show a little bit more of the
 

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.810
and still show a little bit more of the
content mmm still separated out from the

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820
content mmm still separated out from the
 

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.760
content mmm still separated out from the
songs themselves a little bit yeah but I

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:22.770
songs themselves a little bit yeah but I
 

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.260
songs themselves a little bit yeah but I
think that the icons and some other

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:24.270
think that the icons and some other
 

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.820
think that the icons and some other
styling could be used to help with that

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:25.830
styling could be used to help with that
 

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.320
styling could be used to help with that
as well yeah absolutely I mean this is a

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.330
as well yeah absolutely I mean this is a
 

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.820
as well yeah absolutely I mean this is a
few options you've got here personally

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:28.830
few options you've got here personally
 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.800
few options you've got here personally
I'd like to see this is sort of you know

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:30.810
I'd like to see this is sort of you know
 

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.420
I'd like to see this is sort of you know
three touch targets all a bit bigger

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:32.430
three touch targets all a bit bigger
 

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.640
three touch targets all a bit bigger
with sort of icons with text underneath

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:34.650
with sort of icons with text underneath
 

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.740
with sort of icons with text underneath
or something along those lines but

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:36.750
or something along those lines but
 

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.000
or something along those lines but
something certainly easier to touch

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.010
something certainly easier to touch
 

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.350
something certainly easier to touch
every time someone tries to touch

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360
every time someone tries to touch
 

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.460
every time someone tries to touch
something and feels like they're going

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.470
something and feels like they're going
 

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.810
something and feels like they're going
to miss or it touches the wrong thing

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820
to miss or it touches the wrong thing
 

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.670
to miss or it touches the wrong thing
it's kind of a bad experience for your

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680
it's kind of a bad experience for your
 

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.500
it's kind of a bad experience for your
users so you want to you know avoid that

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:45.510

something that stood out as we were
 

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.610
something that stood out as we were
testing as well we have the secondary

these are all a little bit small
 

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.930
these are all a little bit small
particularly when you get to things like

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:42.940
particularly when you get to things like
 

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.299

keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily
matter how large the icon is it matters

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:52.659
matter how large the icon is it matters
 

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.390

how large the touch target itself is how

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400

easy is it to really miss mmm so as you

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:56.530
easy is it to really miss mmm so as you
 

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.500
easy is it to really miss mmm so as you
can see as we go into press this once

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:58.510
can see as we go into press this once
 

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.270

again this is actually fairly small but

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280
again this is actually fairly small but
 

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.100

it is separated out from the ad as well

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.110
it is separated out from the ad as well
 

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.320
it is separated out from the ad as well
so I think that in terms of being close

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.330
so I think that in terms of being close
 

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.640
so I think that in terms of being close
to the ad that's not too much of a

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:05.650
to the ad that's not too much of a
 

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.390

that there's a few overarching
 

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.369
that there's a few overarching
guidelines that that tend to dominate

00:25:19.369 --> 00:25:19.379
guidelines that that tend to dominate
 

00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:22.259
guidelines that that tend to dominate
cool well it so as we go through some of

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:22.269
cool well it so as we go through some of
 

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:23.219
cool well it so as we go through some of
these other wraps we'll see whether

00:25:23.219 --> 00:25:23.229
these other wraps we'll see whether
 

00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:24.839
these other wraps we'll see whether
there's an opportunity because you're

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:24.849
there's an opportunity because you're
 

00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:26.339
there's an opportunity because you're
absolutely right we should we should

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:26.349
absolutely right we should we should
 

00:25:26.349 --> 00:25:27.989
absolutely right we should we should
move on right and in the interest of

00:25:27.989 --> 00:25:27.999
move on right and in the interest of
 

00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:30.209
move on right and in the interest of
time as well I know that we we're going

00:25:30.209 --> 00:25:30.219
time as well I know that we we're going
 

00:25:30.219 --> 00:25:31.649
time as well I know that we we're going
to take a look at the tablet UI on some

00:25:31.649 --> 00:25:31.659
to take a look at the tablet UI on some
 

00:25:31.659 --> 00:25:33.569
to take a look at the tablet UI on some
of these yes but by and large I think

00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:33.579
of these yes but by and large I think
 

00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:35.159
of these yes but by and large I think
that music apps are really the sort of

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:35.169
that music apps are really the sort of
 

00:25:35.169 --> 00:25:40.109
that music apps are really the sort of
app that it used to replace a pocket mp3

00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:40.119
app that it used to replace a pocket mp3
 

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.819
app that it used to replace a pocket mp3
player in many cases I mean it's

00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:41.829
player in many cases I mean it's
 

00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:44.940
player in many cases I mean it's
entirely reasonable to to really focus

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:44.950
entirely reasonable to to really focus
 

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.009
entirely reasonable to to really focus
on the experience on a phone for a music

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:47.019
on the experience on a phone for a music
 

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:50.519
on the experience on a phone for a music
app so yeah we'll go ahead and call out

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:50.529
app so yeah we'll go ahead and call out
 

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:53.129
app so yeah we'll go ahead and call out
when an application did a particularly

00:25:53.129 --> 00:25:53.139
when an application did a particularly
 

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:54.959
when an application did a particularly
good job of providing a tablet UI in

00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:54.969
good job of providing a tablet UI in
 

00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:55.919
good job of providing a tablet UI in
addition to the phone experience

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:55.929
addition to the phone experience
 

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:57.629
addition to the phone experience
absolutely in the interest of time maybe

00:25:57.629 --> 00:25:57.639
absolutely in the interest of time maybe
 

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:58.949
absolutely in the interest of time maybe
we should we should we should move on

00:25:58.949 --> 00:25:58.959
we should we should we should move on
 

00:25:58.959 --> 00:26:00.810
we should we should we should move on
now let's have a look at actually let's

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:00.820
now let's have a look at actually let's
 

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.069
now let's have a look at actually let's
have a look at a few of these together

00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:02.079
have a look at a few of these together
 

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:03.839
have a look at a few of these together
we'll check out xenoamp xenoamp and

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:03.849
we'll check out xenoamp xenoamp and
 

00:26:03.849 --> 00:26:05.099
we'll check out xenoamp xenoamp and
probably xenoamp

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:05.109
probably xenoamp
 

00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:07.229
probably xenoamp
at the same time okay I think that makes

00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:07.239
at the same time okay I think that makes
 

00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:09.119
at the same time okay I think that makes
sense right there okay cool

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:09.129
sense right there okay cool
 

00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:11.099
sense right there okay cool
so let's let's switch to the phone where

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:11.109
so let's let's switch to the phone where
 

00:26:11.109 --> 00:26:12.839
so let's let's switch to the phone where
we've cleared data so we can start from

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:12.849
we've cleared data so we can start from
 

00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:15.569
we've cleared data so we can start from
scratch all right perfect

00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:15.579
scratch all right perfect
 

00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:17.159
scratch all right perfect
so first off I think that we might have

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:17.169
so first off I think that we might have
 

00:26:17.169 --> 00:26:19.469
so first off I think that we might have
a bit of a trademark issue on this it

00:26:19.469 --> 00:26:19.479
a bit of a trademark issue on this it
 

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:21.749
a bit of a trademark issue on this it
looks like the xenoamp has used the

00:26:21.749 --> 00:26:21.759
looks like the xenoamp has used the
 

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:27.690
looks like the xenoamp has used the

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:30.429
that so maybe choose a different logo
 

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:32.759
that so maybe choose a different logo

I don't know that that's the first thing

00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:45.249
I don't know that that's the first thing
 

00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:46.769
I don't know that that's the first thing

you know we're gonna go right off the

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120
you know we're gonna go right off the
 

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.910
you know we're gonna go right off the
bat and point out this is clearly an

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:04.920
bat and point out this is clearly an
 

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.680
bat and point out this is clearly an
earlier version so we're gonna you know

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:06.690
earlier version so we're gonna you know
 

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.330
earlier version so we're gonna you know
it it's definitely some we're going to

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340
it it's definitely some we're going to
 

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.790
it it's definitely some we're going to
look at but you know in line with the

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:10.800
look at but you know in line with the
 

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.410
look at but you know in line with the
the playful attitude of the developers

the playful attitude of the developers
 

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.790
the playful attitude of the developers
we're going to take a similar attitude I

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:13.800
we're going to take a similar attitude I
 

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.590
we're going to take a similar attitude I
think of looking at this happen and

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600
think of looking at this happen and
 

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.540
think of looking at this happen and
hopefully you guys will take it in the

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:17.550
hopefully you guys will take it in the
 

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.900
hopefully you guys will take it in the
spirit it was intended so this is where

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:20.910
spirit it was intended so this is where
 

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.860
spirit it was intended so this is where
we start with militant authentication

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:24.870
we start with militant authentication
 

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.410
we start with militant authentication
failure touch me here stopped so I touch

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:27.420
failure touch me here stopped so I touch
 

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.200
failure touch me here stopped so I touch
here and nothing happens

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.210
here and nothing happens
 

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.730
here and nothing happens
little things lighting up there and I

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740
little things lighting up there and I
 

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.380
little things lighting up there and I
can see okay there is there was

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:33.390
can see okay there is there was
 

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.510
can see okay there is there was
something we touch and hold here okay

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520
something we touch and hold here okay
 

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.190
something we touch and hold here okay
now we've got something that starts to

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200
now we've got something that starts to
 

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.320
now we've got something that starts to
resemble any UI all right so let go so

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:39.330
resemble any UI all right so let go so
 

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.690
resemble any UI all right so let go so
we can see what else depressed hmm no

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700
we can see what else depressed hmm no
 

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.060
we can see what else depressed hmm no
its fading away anyway so the first

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.070
its fading away anyway so the first
 

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.980
its fading away anyway so the first
thing that I noticed with this app but

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:45.990
thing that I noticed with this app but
 

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.860
thing that I noticed with this app but
not only do they hide the status bar

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:47.870
not only do they hide the status bar
 

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.170
not only do they hide the status bar
then they create their own so you know

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:51.180
then they create their own so you know
 

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.050
then they create their own so you know
I've has its own clock and its title

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.060
I've has its own clock and its title
 

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.880

occupying the space where notifications

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:55.890
occupying the space where notifications
 

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.590
occupying the space where notifications
would normally be along with what looks

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600
would normally be along with what looks
 

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.840
would normally be along with what looks
to be a battery readout yeah and so okay

00:27:59.840 --> 00:27:59.850
to be a battery readout yeah and so okay
 

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.730
to be a battery readout yeah and so okay
so to be clear so we spend a lot of time

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740
so to be clear so we spend a lot of time
 

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.530
so to be clear so we spend a lot of time
and I think I in particular spent some

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:03.540
and I think I in particular spent some
 

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.020
and I think I in particular spent some
time online talking about how I hate it

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.030
time online talking about how I hate it
 

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.820
time online talking about how I hate it
when apps hide the status bar because

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:07.830
when apps hide the status bar because
 

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.740
when apps hide the status bar because
you know I use the status bar to see

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:09.750
you know I use the status bar to see
 

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.090
you know I use the status bar to see
what time it is see how much battery

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100
what time it is see how much battery
 

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.850
what time it is see how much battery
I've got left the solution I was looking

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860
I've got left the solution I was looking
 

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.040
I've got left the solution I was looking
for was not to just put the time in the

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.050
for was not to just put the time in the
 

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.280

battery into your own fake status bar I
was kind of just using those as examples

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:20.780
was kind of just using those as examples
 

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.270
was kind of just using those as examples

this app like like it could become my
favorite music player partly just

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760
favorite music player partly just
 

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.610
favorite music player partly just
because I think what they're doing now I

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:49.620
because I think what they're doing now I
 

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.900
because I think what they're doing now I
could be wrong but I think what they're

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:50.910
could be wrong but I think what they're
 

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.690
could be wrong but I think what they're
doing with the UI is making it easy to

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700
doing with the UI is making it easy to
 

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.760
doing with the UI is making it easy to
operate without really looking at it you

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:55.770
operate without really looking at it you
 

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.010
operate without really looking at it you
know I'm just going to I'm gonna touch

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020
know I'm just going to I'm gonna touch
 

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.380
know I'm just going to I'm gonna touch
it a really predictable place in the

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.390
it a really predictable place in the
 

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.910
it a really predictable place in the
middle of the screen on a target this is

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920
middle of the screen on a target this is
 

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.920
middle of the screen on a target this is
a tag antic and then I'm just going to

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:03.930
a tag antic and then I'm just going to
 

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.420
a tag antic and then I'm just going to
slide my finger one way or the other

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:05.430
slide my finger one way or the other
 

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.480
slide my finger one way or the other
right not right now because it's not

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:08.490
right not right now because it's not
 

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.040
right not right now because it's not
working but it seemed like you might be

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.050
working but it seemed like you might be
 

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.690
working but it seemed like you might be
able to yeah and this is part of the

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700
able to yeah and this is part of the
 

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.870
able to yeah and this is part of the
navigation issue that we see now now the

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880
navigation issue that we see now now the
 

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.100
navigation issue that we see now now the
various things come up and so I guess

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:16.110
various things come up and so I guess
 

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.240
various things come up and so I guess
that's really it it's just it's like

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:17.250
that's really it it's just it's like
 

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.460
that's really it it's just it's like
perhaps we're running into bugs at that

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:19.470
perhaps we're running into bugs at that
 

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.870
perhaps we're running into bugs at that
point it could well be you know and I

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880
point it could well be you know and I
 

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.250
point it could well be you know and I
think you know if that's what you guys

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260
think you know if that's what you guys
 

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.450
think you know if that's what you guys
are trying to do I think that's that's

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460
are trying to do I think that's that's
 

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.800
are trying to do I think that's that's
great like and maybe you're just

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:24.810
great like and maybe you're just
 

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.660
great like and maybe you're just
suffering from that 80/20 rule where

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:26.670
suffering from that 80/20 rule where
 

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.970
suffering from that 80/20 rule where
it's 80% of the way there you've got all

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980
it's 80% of the way there you've got all
 

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.140
it's 80% of the way there you've got all
the functionality you've got all the

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.150
the functionality you've got all the
 

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.870
the functionality you've got all the
navigation but the 20% that remains to

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880
navigation but the 20% that remains to
 

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.100
navigation but the 20% that remains to
be done is the bit which makes it

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.110
be done is the bit which makes it
 

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.050
be done is the bit which makes it
actually impossible to navigate if you

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060
actually impossible to navigate if you
 

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.820
actually impossible to navigate if you
don't know the magic things to press

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:37.830
don't know the magic things to press
 

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.570
don't know the magic things to press
that's right

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:38.580
that's right
 

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.890
that's right
and that's why it's really important

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900
and that's why it's really important
 

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.420
and that's why it's really important
that you get people to be to test your

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:41.430
that you get people to be to test your
 

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.190
that you get people to be to test your
apps and really watch to see how they

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200
apps and really watch to see how they
 

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.420
apps and really watch to see how they
use them because I'm sure if the

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.430
use them because I'm sure if the
 

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.710
use them because I'm sure if the
developer for this app was standing

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720
developer for this app was standing
 

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.540
developer for this app was standing
behind us you'd be like no no no no you

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:47.550
behind us you'd be like no no no no you
 

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.340
behind us you'd be like no no no no you
just you just have to press here and

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:49.350
just you just have to press here and
 

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.600
just you just have to press here and
then here why are you pressing over

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:50.610
then here why are you pressing over
 

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.950
then here why are you pressing over
there why are you dragging that why are

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960
there why are you dragging that why are
 

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.930
there why are you dragging that why are
you pressing the back button and that's

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940
you pressing the back button and that's
 

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.460
you pressing the back button and that's
our testing is really an illuminating

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:55.470
our testing is really an illuminating
 

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.880
our testing is really an illuminating
experience it really behind glass where

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:58.890
experience it really behind glass where
 

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.920
experience it really behind glass where
they found under glass y-yeah and this

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:03.930
they found under glass y-yeah and this
 

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.600
they found under glass y-yeah and this
is why test is a really valuable

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:05.610
is why test is a really valuable
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.430
is why test is a really valuable
you know us engineering folks we have

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440
you know us engineering folks we have
 

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.670
you know us engineering folks we have
this tendency to know

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680
this tendency to know
 

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.440
this tendency to know
it works and then do it the right way

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:11.450
it works and then do it the right way
 

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.910
it works and then do it the right way
and then you put it in front of testers

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920
and then you put it in front of testers
 

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.410
and then you put it in front of testers
and they're like trying to press two

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:14.420
and they're like trying to press two
 

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.930
and they're like trying to press two
buttons at the same time why are you

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:16.940
buttons at the same time why are you
 

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.910
buttons at the same time why are you
pressing ok and cancel at the same why

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920
pressing ok and cancel at the same why
 

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.920
pressing ok and cancel at the same why
are you pressing ok like 10 times in a

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:20.930
are you pressing ok like 10 times in a
 

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.020
are you pressing ok like 10 times in a
row real quick all these little bits and

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.030
row real quick all these little bits and
 

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.520
row real quick all these little bits and
pieces when you see people actually

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:24.530
pieces when you see people actually
 

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.410
pieces when you see people actually
using your app or testing them trying to

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:26.420
using your app or testing them trying to
 

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.329
using your app or testing them trying to
break them is how you really get that

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:28.339
break them is how you really get that
 

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:30.010
break them is how you really get that
next stage polished to something which

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.020
next stage polished to something which
 

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.569
next stage polished to something which
people really love and they're excited

00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:31.579
people really love and they're excited
 

00:36:31.579 --> 00:36:33.280
people really love and they're excited
about that's right so this app doesn't

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.290
about that's right so this app doesn't
 

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.650
about that's right so this app doesn't
claim to be more than a beta at this

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:35.660
claim to be more than a beta at this
 

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.049
claim to be more than a beta at this
point and I think that at this point I

00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:38.059
point and I think that at this point I
 

00:36:38.059 --> 00:36:39.430
point and I think that at this point I
think it's really more of an alpha at

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440
think it's really more of an alpha at
 

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.020
think it's really more of an alpha at
this stage just given that it's it's

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.030
this stage just given that it's it's
 

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.760
this stage just given that it's it's
just a little too hard to use it's a

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:42.770
just a little too hard to use it's a
 

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.890
just a little too hard to use it's a
little too frustrating I want to see you

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:44.900
little too frustrating I want to see you
 

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.470
little too frustrating I want to see you
guys maybe spend a little bit more time

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480
guys maybe spend a little bit more time
 

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.460
guys maybe spend a little bit more time
you know building something that's a

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:48.470
you know building something that's a
 

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.589
you know building something that's a
little bit more predictable before you

00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599
little bit more predictable before you
 

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:51.970
little bit more predictable before you
spend you know too much more effort

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:51.980
spend you know too much more effort
 

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.780
spend you know too much more effort
getting it out there or at least start

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:54.790
getting it out there or at least start
 

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.040
getting it out there or at least start
start guiding the user through the first

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.050
start guiding the user through the first
 

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.710
start guiding the user through the first
a little bit more alright let's let's

00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720
a little bit more alright let's let's
 

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.839
a little bit more alright let's let's
move on to the next app no I don't have

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:01.849
move on to the next app no I don't have
 

00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:03.849
move on to the next app no I don't have
a none of us have a Spotify account set

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:03.859
a none of us have a Spotify account set
 

00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:05.829
a none of us have a Spotify account set
up right now yeah we tested this on some

00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839
up right now yeah we tested this on some
 

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:07.630
up right now yeah we tested this on some
other devices previously yeah and

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640
other devices previously yeah and
 

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.220
other devices previously yeah and
Spotify in general given that we were

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.230
Spotify in general given that we were
 

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.510
Spotify in general given that we were
running out of time a little bit here I

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520
running out of time a little bit here I
 

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.190
running out of time a little bit here I
think it's probably a reasonable one to

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200
think it's probably a reasonable one to
 

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.870
think it's probably a reasonable one to
skip it's grayed out fantastic

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880
skip it's grayed out fantastic
 

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.150
skip it's grayed out fantastic
functionality in a pretty decent UI and

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160
functionality in a pretty decent UI and
 

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.859
functionality in a pretty decent UI and
they've actually worked pretty well in

00:37:17.859 --> 00:37:17.869
they've actually worked pretty well in
 

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.210
they've actually worked pretty well in
terms of getting some of the newest

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:19.220
terms of getting some of the newest
 

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.160
terms of getting some of the newest
features integrated things like widgets

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:21.170

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.490
features integrated things like widgets
and Universal Search they were building

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:24.500
and Universal Search they were building
 

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.630
and Universal Search they were building
those sorts of things straight in off

the bat so do check out Spotify it's

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:27.799
the bat so do check out Spotify it's

it's pretty cool but we're gonna we're

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359
it's pretty cool but we're gonna we're
 

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:30.609
it's pretty cool but we're gonna we're
gonna skip past that one of the other

00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:30.619
gonna skip past that one of the other
 

00:37:30.619 --> 00:37:31.660
gonna skip past that one of the other
things that we would want to highlight

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:31.670

a much better metaphor but if they are
sort of liking it as in promoting it to

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:52.580
sort of liking it as in promoting it to
 

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.710
sort of liking it as in promoting it to
their friends or something which they

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720
their friends or something which they
 

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.620
their friends or something which they
are enjoying then heart it kind of

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:56.630
are enjoying then heart it kind of
 

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.600
are enjoying then heart it kind of
almost makes more sense by the way I

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:58.610
almost makes more sense by the way I
 

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.190
almost makes more sense by the way I
noticed that when we're doing this top

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200
noticed that when we're doing this top
 

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.350
noticed that when we're doing this top
to bottom thing and it totally doesn't

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:02.360
to bottom thing and it totally doesn't
 

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.060
to bottom thing and it totally doesn't
work to have us looking left to right I

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.070
work to have us looking left to right I
 

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.010
work to have us looking left to right I
think well yeah what we want is to be

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.020
think well yeah what we want is to be
 

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.750
think well yeah what we want is to be
like this like Brady Bunch style what do

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760
like this like Brady Bunch style what do
 

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.190
like this like Brady Bunch style what do
you think right now how's it going this

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200
you think right now how's it going this
 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.950
you think right now how's it going this
is weird hey nice love it yeah I'm just

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960
is weird hey nice love it yeah I'm just
 

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.960
is weird hey nice love it yeah I'm just
saying that you know you don't get to

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:16.970
saying that you know you don't get to
 

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.630
saying that you know you don't get to
pick your favorite you know Lucky Charms

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640
pick your favorite you know Lucky Charms
 

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.790
pick your favorite you know Lucky Charms
metaphor too you know there's a there's

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800
metaphor too you know there's a there's
 

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.490
metaphor too you know there's a there's
a star for for making something your

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:24.500
a star for for making something your
 

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.040
a star for for making something your
favorite and the heart means you know

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.050
favorite and the heart means you know
 

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.750
favorite and the heart means you know
kind of nothing to the average Android

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760
kind of nothing to the average Android
 

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.050
kind of nothing to the average Android
user sure so something for something

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.060
user sure so something for something
 

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.910
user sure so something for something
that ties into an existing service if

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920
that ties into an existing service if
 

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.529
that ties into an existing service if
you already have a metaphor for doing

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:36.539
you already have a metaphor for doing
 

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:37.849
you already have a metaphor for doing
perform an action like this then

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859
perform an action like this then
 

00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:39.169
perform an action like this then
sometimes it makes sense to stay

00:41:39.169 --> 00:41:39.179
sometimes it makes sense to stay
 

00:41:39.179 --> 00:41:40.279
sometimes it makes sense to stay
consistent with the rest of that

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:40.289
consistent with the rest of that
 

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:41.569
consistent with the rest of that
services that is a really good point

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579
services that is a really good point
 

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:44.120
services that is a really good point
yeah so we see that in this screen we

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:44.130
yeah so we see that in this screen we
 

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.189
yeah so we see that in this screen we
actually have a menu button a shame

00:41:46.189 --> 00:41:46.199
actually have a menu button a shame
 

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:48.019
actually have a menu button a shame
is there it does nothing just

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:48.029
is there it does nothing just
 

00:41:48.029 --> 00:41:49.279
is there it does nothing just
particularly weird because we've kind of

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:49.289
particularly weird because we've kind of
 

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:51.709
particularly weird because we've kind of
got this action bar type our metaphor

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:51.719
got this action bar type our metaphor
 

00:41:51.719 --> 00:41:53.659
got this action bar type our metaphor
and while we're here we'll also we'll

00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:53.669
and while we're here we'll also we'll
 

00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:54.769
and while we're here we'll also we'll
see what happens when we hit the share

00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:54.779
see what happens when we hit the share
 

00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:56.539
see what happens when we hit the share
button that we get the sharing apps

00:41:56.539 --> 00:41:56.549
button that we get the sharing apps
 

00:41:56.549 --> 00:41:58.969
button that we get the sharing apps
which is nice so that's happy making now

00:41:58.969 --> 00:41:58.979
which is nice so that's happy making now
 

00:41:58.979 --> 00:42:01.039
which is nice so that's happy making now
what's a little bit weirder is this icon

00:42:01.039 --> 00:42:01.049
what's a little bit weirder is this icon
 

00:42:01.049 --> 00:42:02.630
what's a little bit weirder is this icon
here which I have no idea what that

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640
here which I have no idea what that
 

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.159
here which I have no idea what that
means sort of filter but no it's it's an

00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:06.169
means sort of filter but no it's it's an
 

00:42:06.169 --> 00:42:10.939
means sort of filter but no it's it's an
overflow you would normally expect yes

00:42:10.939 --> 00:42:10.949
overflow you would normally expect yes
 

00:42:10.949 --> 00:42:12.589
overflow you would normally expect yes
it's kind of a right-to-left overflow

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599
it's kind of a right-to-left overflow
 

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:14.479
it's kind of a right-to-left overflow
now it's it's weird because if we've got

00:42:14.479 --> 00:42:14.489
now it's it's weird because if we've got
 

00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:15.799
now it's it's weird because if we've got
an overflow that what we don't need the

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:15.809
an overflow that what we don't need the
 

00:42:15.809 --> 00:42:17.569
an overflow that what we don't need the
menu button on the bottom right and if

00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579
menu button on the bottom right and if
 

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:20.059
menu button on the bottom right and if
we goes also another example of non

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:20.069
we goes also another example of non
 

00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:21.559
we goes also another example of non
standard action bar yet as well

00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:21.569
standard action bar yet as well
 

00:42:21.569 --> 00:42:23.449
standard action bar yet as well
absolutely using just a little bit of a

00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:23.459
absolutely using just a little bit of a
 

00:42:23.459 --> 00:42:25.009
absolutely using just a little bit of a
different size for everything a little

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:25.019
different size for everything a little
 

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:26.659
different size for everything a little
bit different metrics yeah that stands

00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:26.669
bit different metrics yeah that stands
 

00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:29.089
bit different metrics yeah that stands
out and if we go back to the to the main

00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099
out and if we go back to the to the main
 

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.739
out and if we go back to the to the main
menu then we find out that here the menu

00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:30.749
menu then we find out that here the menu
 

00:42:30.749 --> 00:42:32.870
menu then we find out that here the menu
button isn't a button of shame but it is

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880
button isn't a button of shame but it is
 

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.239
button isn't a button of shame but it is
confusing because everything in this is

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:35.249
confusing because everything in this is
 

00:42:35.249 --> 00:42:36.829
confusing because everything in this is
just as appropriate when you listening

00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839
just as appropriate when you listening
 

00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:37.880
just as appropriate when you listening
to a track as it is when you're

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:37.890
to a track as it is when you're
 

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.989
to a track as it is when you're
listening to when you're looking at a

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:38.999
listening to when you're looking at a
 

00:42:38.999 --> 00:42:40.400
listening to when you're looking at a
list of tracks and we do have one of

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:40.410
list of tracks and we do have one of
 

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.189
list of tracks and we do have one of
your favourite actions exit button yay

00:42:43.189 --> 00:42:43.199
your favourite actions exit button yay
 

00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:45.709
your favourite actions exit button yay
no there's no need for an exit button

00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:45.719
no there's no need for an exit button
 

00:42:45.719 --> 00:42:47.569
no there's no need for an exit button
for a music playing app as soon as you

00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579
for a music playing app as soon as you
 

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:49.009
for a music playing app as soon as you
were paused that should be the

00:42:49.009 --> 00:42:49.019
were paused that should be the
 

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:51.079
were paused that should be the
equivalent of everything stopped you

00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:51.089
equivalent of everything stopped you
 

00:42:51.089 --> 00:42:52.189
equivalent of everything stopped you
shouldn't have any services running

00:42:52.189 --> 00:42:52.199
shouldn't have any services running
 

00:42:52.199 --> 00:42:53.870
shouldn't have any services running
there shouldn't be any difference at

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880
there shouldn't be any difference at
 

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.779
there shouldn't be any difference at
that point for between hitting exit or

00:42:56.779 --> 00:42:56.789
that point for between hitting exit or
 

00:42:56.789 --> 00:42:58.669
that point for between hitting exit or
just hitting back that should be

00:42:58.669 --> 00:42:58.679
just hitting back that should be
 

00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:00.019
just hitting back that should be
equivalent and so then there's no need

00:43:00.019 --> 00:43:00.029
equivalent and so then there's no need
 

00:43:00.029 --> 00:43:01.549
equivalent and so then there's no need
to put it in there because again as soon

00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559
to put it in there because again as soon
 

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:03.769
to put it in there because again as soon
as you have an exit button I understand

00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:03.779
as you have an exit button I understand
 

00:43:03.779 --> 00:43:05.929
as you have an exit button I understand
that some users like an exit button and

00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:05.939
that some users like an exit button and
 

00:43:05.939 --> 00:43:07.640
that some users like an exit button and
that it's a nice thing to put in there

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:07.650
that it's a nice thing to put in there
 

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.589
that it's a nice thing to put in there
but it's totally ambiguous it's

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599
but it's totally ambiguous it's
 

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:11.149
but it's totally ambiguous it's
meaningless you don't no one actually

00:43:11.149 --> 00:43:11.159
meaningless you don't no one actually
 

00:43:11.159 --> 00:43:12.829
meaningless you don't no one actually
knows what that exit button is going to

00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839
knows what that exit button is going to
 

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:15.380
knows what that exit button is going to
do so putting it there is just runs the

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:15.390
do so putting it there is just runs the
 

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:16.939
do so putting it there is just runs the
risk of frustrating your users and

00:43:16.939 --> 00:43:16.949
risk of frustrating your users and
 

00:43:16.949 --> 00:43:19.339
risk of frustrating your users and
annoying the hell out of me let's go

00:43:19.339 --> 00:43:19.349
annoying the hell out of me let's go
 

00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:21.919
annoying the hell out of me let's go
back in here yeah a splash screen every

00:43:21.919 --> 00:43:21.929
back in here yeah a splash screen every
 

00:43:21.929 --> 00:43:24.109
back in here yeah a splash screen every
time we start up again is that really

00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119
time we start up again is that really
 

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:26.509
time we start up again is that really
necessary like we're not reticulating

00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:26.519
necessary like we're not reticulating
 

00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:28.519
necessary like we're not reticulating
splines here you should just be able to

00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:28.529
splines here you should just be able to
 

00:43:28.529 --> 00:43:29.959
splines here you should just be able to
start off and have these things cached

00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:29.969
start off and have these things cached
 

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:32.059
start off and have these things cached
so that we get a nice clean quick start

00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:32.069
so that we get a nice clean quick start
 

00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:33.769
so that we get a nice clean quick start
up every time although I do have to say

00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:33.779
up every time although I do have to say
 

00:43:33.779 --> 00:43:35.419
up every time although I do have to say
that if you are loading something for

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:35.429
that if you are loading something for
 

00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:36.829
that if you are loading something for
the first time showing something a

00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839
the first time showing something a
 

00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:37.909
the first time showing something a
little bit more attractive than a

00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:37.919
little bit more attractive than a
 

00:43:37.919 --> 00:43:40.309
little bit more attractive than a
loading spinner I think yeah I think so

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319
loading spinner I think yeah I think so
 

00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:42.019
loading spinner I think yeah I think so
I think the first time you load you want

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:42.029
I think the first time you load you want
 

00:43:42.029 --> 00:43:44.299
I think the first time you load you want
to have something and we have sort of

00:43:44.299 --> 00:43:44.309
to have something and we have sort of
 

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:45.679
to have something and we have sort of
preferences around how much time you

00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:45.689
preferences around how much time you
 

00:43:45.689 --> 00:43:47.630
preferences around how much time you
should be showing a blank screen I

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640
should be showing a blank screen I
 

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.670
should be showing a blank screen I
no time so definitely having a splash

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680
no time so definitely having a splash
 

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.050
no time so definitely having a splash

by default but the fact that it is there
 

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.330
