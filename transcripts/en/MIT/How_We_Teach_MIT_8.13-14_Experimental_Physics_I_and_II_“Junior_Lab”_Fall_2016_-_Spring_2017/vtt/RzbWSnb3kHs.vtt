SEAN ROBINSON:
There's an exercise

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.800
we do very early in the
semester, where we hand out

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.980
to the students a bunch
of small aluminum cuboids.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.450
They're long rectangles, a
few centimeters on each side.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.930
And then we hand them a
very cheap plastic ruler,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.210
a $0.16 ruler from an
office supply store.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.350
The cubes are machined
to very high precision

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.570
to be identical to each other.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.659
The rulers are very inexpensive.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.400
And we have them--
we say, go measure

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.970
the length, width, and
height of this cuboid.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.280
Don't tell anybody
what you measured.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.290
But just write down
your best measurement,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.210
and your best estimate
of the uncertainty

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.269
on that measurement,
and along with that,

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.810
come up with a
measure of the volume.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.510
Maybe, you measure
the volume, say,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.690
by multiplying x times y
times z, and an estimate

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.526
of the uncertainty on that.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.650
And everybody thinks this
is a very silly exercise.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.570
It's so easy.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.300
This is something you would
do in elementary school.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.700
Here we are in our third year
as physics majors at MIT.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.220
Why are we wasting
our time on this?

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.610
But if it's so easy, then when
we flip around the white board

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.910
and show everybody all
each other's answers,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.701
if it's so easy, why
are the answers all so

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.210
different from each other?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.480
That is a big moment
of cognitive dissonance

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.850
for the students.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.420
And then we spend the next,
say, 15 to 45 minutes,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.590
really, just having a very
active discussion about, what

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.660
did these error bars
that you reported

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.800
to us as your uncertainty
on the volume,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.380
what does that really mean?

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.210
Why is this person's
error bar so small?

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.580
Why is this person's so large?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.370
Let's look at the spread between
all of the different people's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.404
numbers and compare it to what
you reported as uncertainty.

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:50.570
Are these things consistent?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.849
Are these inconsistent?

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.890
For the instructor who's
leading that discussion,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.681
that's somewhat of a
challenge because he's

00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:59.750
about to see some numbers,
and lead a discussion on it,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.180
which he's never seen before.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.200
Inevitably, all of our
instructors get up to the plate

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.850
and do a good job at that.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.470
But it's remarkable, how much
comes from this very simple

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.790
little exercise.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.616
The students learn a lot
about random errors, which

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:17.990
are statistical
errors, which are

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.890
something you can learn from a
mathematics book on statistics.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.470
You learn a lot about
systematic errors, which

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.450
are very, very difficult,
and no one really

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.000
has a good understanding of.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.210
But it all comes up in
this very simple exercise

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.915
that everybody
learns a lot from.

00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:41.060
In general, it's
always a challenge

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.804
for a teacher to run
a group discussion

00:02:45.804 --> 00:02:48.470
and get the students to actually
participate in that discussion,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.142
right?

00:02:49.142 --> 00:02:50.600
In general, that's
always something

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.424
that's tricky as a teacher.

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:54.590
People want to sit back,
and be quiet, and just hear

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.839
what other people have to say.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.960
It's always a challenge.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.590
For this exercise,
which is usually

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.480
done at the end of
a three hour session

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.370
where they've been
measuring other things,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.320
and then you flip
around the board

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.460
and show them the list of
numbers, people are surprised.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.830
This is something-- this is
numbers they just measured.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.500
And they're surprised what they
see that everybody else did.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.620
It is not hard at all
to get people talking

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.390
and really get them
all participating

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.810
in that conversation.
