00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.910
Hey, I'm here with Jesse Toth,
a backend Ruby developer at GitHub.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.030
So Jesse, when I was first reading
through the Ruby documentation when I

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.610
was learning to code,
I felt pretty discouraged.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.960
And I'm glad that I didn't give up then,
though, because

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.080
otherwise I wouldn't have ended up with
this awesome career in technology.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.839
So, could you share with us a time or
a moment that you felt discouraged or

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.578
that maybe you weren't cut out for this?

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:26.695
And how do get through that?

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:27.878
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:30.348
I mean, looking at the Ruby docs
myself there's a lot there.

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.978
And there's no way to
learn all of it at once.

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.667
There are definitely times
where I've been struggling for

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.728
almost a whole day to try and
figure out something, that in the end,

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:41.684
it seemed really simple but
I didn't understand it at the time But

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:44.288
I had to struggle through it and
learn different things.

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:47.358
And along the way, I learned
about not just that problem, but

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:49.730
what was underneath that problem.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.810
&gt;&gt; So, when you encounter a problem,
you see it more so

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.970
as a challenge to overcome rather
than as a, I messed up, right?

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.788
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:01.801
It can be frustrating to get stuck and
to feel like you don't know, but

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.599
once you get pass that then
you've learned something.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.638
And you've added a new
tool to your toolbelt.

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:07.320
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.978
We've all got our own personal obstacles
or concerns when learning something new.

00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:12.910
What are some of yours?
