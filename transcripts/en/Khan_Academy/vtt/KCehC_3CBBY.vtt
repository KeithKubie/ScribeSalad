00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.240
Gina had 2/3 cups of
laundry detergent.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.180
She used half of the
detergent on Friday

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.690
to wash all of her sheets.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.910
How much detergent
does she have left?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.630
So we're essentially going to
take half of 2/3, or 1/2 times

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.860
2/3.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.970
So let's see which of
these choices match up.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.820
So we should be
taking 1/2 times 2/3.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.550
Well, here they're
taking 2/3 minus 1/2,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.290
so this isn't going to be right.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.530
Here they're going to
be taking-- let's see,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.290
1/3, because 2/3 times 1/2, this
is exactly what we want to do.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.280
We want to take half of 2/3.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.870
And we multiply the
numerators, 2 times 1 is 2.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.810
Multiply the denominators,
3 times 2 is 6.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.470
You have 2/6.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.340
You could say the 2/6 has either
been used up or 2/6 is left.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.740
And 2/6 is the exact
same thing as 1/3.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.640
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430
so this looks right.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.320
And so here 1/6 cup, well,
we know it's not 1/6 cup.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.860
We know it's 1/3 cup.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.950
So here, 1/3 cup, because
2/3 is equal to 1/3 plus 1/3,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.770
that's right.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.840
So half of 2/3 must be 1/3.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.610
This is exactly right as well.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.470
These are both completely
reasonable ways

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200
to getting to the
right answer that Gina

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
has 1/3-- she used 1/3 of
a cup of laundry detergent,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.350
and she has 1/3 left.
