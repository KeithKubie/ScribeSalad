00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.735
So going back to our mani-core challenges. Now

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.824
we have seen that the issue of power

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:07.704
budget splitting among cores is solved by using

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:10.512
a turbo frequency when using only one core, so

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:14.328
that a single-threaded program doesn't suffer just because

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:18.800
it's running in a multi-core system. Pretty much then

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920
one core gets to use all the power

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.060
of the chip, with some limitations because of cooling.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.180
And the final issue that we will look at

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.350
is the confusion that all of this brings to the

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.265
operating system. Keep in mind that it has to deal

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:37.880
with multi-threading, where each core can really execute several threads

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.450
in hardware. Then you have cores that can share

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.678
caches. Then if you have a larger system, you can

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.716
have multiple chips, each with its own large caches, and

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:49.980
you can have all of these at the same time.
