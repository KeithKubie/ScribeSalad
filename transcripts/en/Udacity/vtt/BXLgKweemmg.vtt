00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.510
In humans lactase persistent is characterized by the continued expression

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.880
of lactase into adulthood, there are two sequence positions in

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.550
humans that correlate with lactase persistence phenotypes, we have letters

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.118
at position minus 13910 based pairs in front of the

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:19.764
transcription

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:21.850
start site. And we have another position a

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.320
minus 22,018 base pairs or a letters in front

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.460
of the transcription start site. Now a G and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.770
a C at this positions will result in low

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.240
or completely non lactase persistence so, as you

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.380
get older, you don't keep expressing lactase where as

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010
an A and a T, this position do correlate

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.610
with lactase persistence into adulthood. Therefore, which position combination,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.230
the top combination the G and the C of these positions or the A and the T at the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.430
bottom positions, would you most likely expect to be

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.380
associated with lactose intolerance? Remember, you need to think about

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.140
what the trait of lactase persistence is. How it

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.060
relates to lactose intolerance. And which of these scenarios, right?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.370
Which of these letter combinations. Is going to give you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.640
or be associated with lactose intolerance. Go ahead and select

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.470
one of them now.
