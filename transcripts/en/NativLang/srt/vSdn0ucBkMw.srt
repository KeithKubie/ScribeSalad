[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,450
tourist, a word, a bucket list item,
and on the southeast coast of Mexico,

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,890
big business life here revolves
around the tourist town,

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,950
whether man, woman, or beast
there aren't mailed to restock.

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,150
It's also what they call
that feeling in your gut.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,830
You get after you ingest too much of
the local water. I arrived as a tourist,

7
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,070
I headed to Cozumel or
as the straight face.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,190
Send your order selling
information upon arrival,

9
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:40,310
put it [inaudible] a slice Doria.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,570
That history goes back to the Yuca Tech.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,580
Maya as their civilization expanded
some Mayans packed up their language and

12
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,500
architecture and traveled the route de
Maya up to this wide flat peninsula that

13
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:56,900
you got done. So the ruins
here are a bit younger,

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,930
which doesn't stop the duty stats to
generate size about 10 times as popular as

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,230
fabled decal. That's all
history like the men said,

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,500
but it's not all in the
distant past. Until recently,

17
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,680
the Caribbean coast of Mexico
was pretty undeveloped,

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,510
not small houses with a few open lots,
kind of undeveloped but fresh jungle,

19
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,890
kind of undeveloped, savage, solid back.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,110
The very salvage k, very flat,

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,140
very Mayan [inaudible] became one of
Mexico's two newest states in 1974

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,310
some local still speak. You get tech.

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,850
I'm told you can even practice
the language if you get
the right person to open

24
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,740
up. I didn't have much luck.

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,900
Might have something to do with my
mind being limited to shock and Balaam,

26
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,540
but much like you and me,

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,380
most of these smiling faces around
here flock to these beach towns.

28
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,300
Thanks to big booty, small snorkel tours,
dive tours, tours to the ruins. Oh,

29
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,370
and don't forget your tee
shirt and Wigley Turtle.

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah.

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,530
Have Fun. Be Safe and bring
your pesos. Fellow Trista

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:13,520
[inaudible].
