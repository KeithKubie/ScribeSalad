00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.445
We are asked to
graph the function y

00:00:03.445 --> 00:00:07.940
is equal to negative
2.5 cosine of 1/3

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.150
x on the interval, 0 to 6
pi, including the endpoints.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.610
So let me do my best
attempt at graphing that.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.890
And to start off, I'm going
to graph with the simplest

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.390
function, or the
simplest version of this,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.690
or the root of this,
which is just cosine of x.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.290
So let me just graph,
and eventually you

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.760
can kind of-- let me
just graph cosine of x.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.880
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.130
And I want to have some space
here so I can eventually

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.380
graph this entire thing.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.710
So let's say that this is
negative 1, this is negative 2.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.970
This is positive 1,
this is positive 2.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.740
And let's say that this
right over here is 2 pi.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.587
And then of course that
could be pi right over there.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.170
Now, the first thing
I'm going to do--

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.340
let me copy this because
I could use it later

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.720
to graph the whole thing.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.920
So let's start off.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.400
So I'm just going to graph
y is equal to cosine of x.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.500
So when x is equal
to 0-- and I'm just

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.590
going to do it between
the interval 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.964
Obvious it's a
periodic function,

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:20.620
it'll keep going in the negative
and the positive directions.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.630
So what happens when
x is equal to 0?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.320
What is cosine of x?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.760
Well cosine of 0 is 1.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.270
What about when
x is equal to pi?

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.632
What is cosine of pi?

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:39.790
Well cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.850
And then what's cosine of 2 pi?

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.050
Well that's 1 again.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.510
We get back-- we've
completed a period,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.740
or we've completed
an entire cycle.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.580
And 2 pi is the
period of cosine of x.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.260
So this is one cycle
right over here.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.070
I could keep going if I wanted
to, but the whole point,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.140
I just wanted to graph this
one cycle between 0 and 2 pi.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.580
Now what I want to think about
is, what happens to this graph?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.620
Instead of graphing
y equals cosine

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.260
of x-- let me draw
some graph paper again.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.640
Instead of drawing y is
equal to cosine of x,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.047
I'm going to draw y is
equal to cosine of 1/3 x.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:26.880
So the only difference
between that and that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.470
is now I'm multiplying
the x by 1/3.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.240
What's going to happen
to the graph over here?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.410
How is this going to change
instead of being an x,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.460
if it's a 1/3 x?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.845
What's going to
happen over here?

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:40.970
And now I'm going to do it
over the entire interval

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.840
between zero and six pi.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.715
So let me just make sure
I have enough space.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:49.370
So that's 3 pi, 4
pi, 5 pi, and 6 pi.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.660
What's going to
happen to this graph?

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.740
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.350
The easiest might
just be to say, well

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.704
to complete an entire cycle,
we're going to go 1/3 as fast.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:04.370
Or we're going to go
three times slower.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.980
Or if you just want to
think about the period here,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.090
what's the period
of cosine of 1/3 x?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.860
Well the period is
going to be 2 pi divided

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.540
by the absolute value of this
coefficient right over here.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.610
So it's the absolute value
of 1/3, which is just 1/3.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.280
So the period is 2
pi over 1/3, which

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.140
is the same thing as 2 pi
times 3, which is 6 pi.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.780
Which gels with the intuition.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.160
That's going to take
three times as much

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.370
time to get whatever we input
into the cosine function

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.525
to get back to 2 pi.

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:41.150
Because whatever we take
x, we're taking 1/3 of it.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.440
So to get to 2 pi, you can't
just have x equals 2 pi.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.740
x now has to equal 6
pi to get 2 pi inputted

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.290
into the cosine function.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.590
So the period is now 6 pi.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.410
At x is equal to 0, 1/3 times 0
is 0, and the cosine of 0 is 1.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.990
When x is equal to 6 pi, you
have 6 pi divided by 3 is 2 pi.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.540
Cosine of 2 pi is equal to 1.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.120
And if you want to go
in between, over here

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.520
to go in between, we tried pi.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.410
But over here, we
could try 3 pi.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.420
When x is 3 pi, you
have cosine of 1/3

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.550
of 3 pi, that's cosine of pi.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.210
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.140
So when x is equal to 3 pi,
we have cosine of 1/3 times

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.350
3 pi is negative 1.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.335
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.170
Trying my best attempt.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.020
to draw it.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.690
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.750
So you see, to go from y
equals cosine of x to y

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.210
equals cosine of 1/3 x, it
essentially stretched out

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.190
to this function
by a factor of 3.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.050
You can see this period
is three times longer.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.520
The period here was 2 pi.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.830
All right, well there's
only one more transformation

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.980
we need in order to
get to the function

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.190
that they're asking us about.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.830
We just have to, instead of
having a cosine of 1/3 x,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.530
we just have to negative
2.5 cosine of 1/3 x.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.710
So let's try to draw that.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.260
So let me put my
axis here again.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.700
And let me label it.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:43.050
So that's 2 pi, 3 pi,
4 pi, 5 pi, and 6 pi.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.760
And our goal now is to draw
the graph of y is equal to--

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.106
and we're just doing it over
between 0 and 6 pi here.

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:52.730
We only did it between
0 and 2 pi here.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.460
Obviously they're all periodic,
they all keep going on and on.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.410
But now we want to graph y is
equal to negative 2.5 times

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.290
cosine of 1/3 x.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.360
So given this change, we're now
multiplying by negative 2.5,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.040
what is going to
be-- well actually,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.350
let's think about a few things.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.150
What was the amplitude
in the first two graphs

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.010
right over here?

00:06:26.824 --> 00:06:28.490
Well there's two ways
to think about it.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.940
You could say the amplitude
is half the difference

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.090
between the minimum
and the maximum points.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.350
In either of these case,
the minimum is negative 1,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.940
maximum is 1.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.910
The difference is 2,
half of that is 1.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.040
Or you could just say
it's the absolute value

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.620
of the coefficient here,
which is implicitly a 1.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.130
And the absolute value
of 1 is, once again, 1.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.810
What's going to be the amplitude
for this thing right over here?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.520
Well the amplitude is going to
be the absolute value of what's

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.540
multiplying the cosine function.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.500
So the amplitude in this
case, do it in green,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.710
the amplitude is going to be
equal to the absolute value

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.150
of negative 2.5,
which is equal to 2.5.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.620
So given that, how is
multiplying by negative 2.5

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.990
going to transform this
graph right over here?

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.200
Well let's think about it.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.700
If it was multiplying
by just a positive 2.5,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.140
you would stretch it out.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.020
At each point it would go
up by a factor of 2 and 1/2.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.565
But it's a negative
2.5, so at each point,

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:41.190
you're going to
stretch it out and then

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.580
you're going to flip
it over the x-axis.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.860
So let's do that.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.900
So when x was 0, you
got 1 in this case.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.550
But now we're going to
multiply that by negative 2.5,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.180
which means you're going
to get to negative 2.5.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.080
So let me draw negative
2.5 right over there.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.280
So that's negative 2.5.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.090
That'd be negative--
let me make it clear.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.460
This would be negative
3 right over here,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.310
this would be positive 3.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.291
So that number right over
there is negative 2.5.

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.790
And let me draw a
dotted line there.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.390
It could serve to be useful.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:21.226
Now when cosine
of 1/3 x is 0, it

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:22.850
doesn't matter what
you multiply it by,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.020
you're still going to
get 0 right over here.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.530
Now, when cosine of
1/3 x was negative 1,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.980
which was the case when x
is equal to 3 pi, what's

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.030
going to happen over here?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.020
Well cosine of 1/3 x,
we see, is negative 1.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.330
Negative 1 times negative
2.5 is positive 2.5.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.300
So we're going to get to
positive 2.5, which is right--

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.030
let me draw a dotted
line over here.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.340
We're going to get to positive
2.5, which is right over there.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.580
And then when cosine
of 1/3 x is equal to 0,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.700
doesn't matter what we
multiply it by, we get to 0.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.940
And then finally, when x
is at 6 pi, cosine of 1/3 x

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.090
is equal to 1.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.460
What's that going to be when
you multiply it by negative 2.5?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.520
Well it's going to
be negative 2.5.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.720
So we're going to
get back over here.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.560
So we're ready to
draw our graph.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.320
It looks something-- let
me do that in magenta color

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.620
since that's what the
color I wrote this in.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.800
It will look like this.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.640
I can draw it as a solid line.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.740
So it will look like that.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.050
So you saw what happened.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.930
By putting this 1/3 here,
it stretched out the graph.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.540
It increased the period
by a factor of 3.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.760
And then multiplying
it by negative 2.5--

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.290
if you just multiply
it by 2.5, you

00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:00.640
would just multiply
that out a little bit.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.140
But now it's a
negative, so not only

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.690
do you increase the amplitude,
but you flip it over.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.290
So it is, indeed, the case
that the amplitude here is 2.5.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.437
We vary 2.5 from
our middle position.

00:10:11.437 --> 00:10:13.770
Or you could say that the
difference between the minimum

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.890
and the maximum is 5,
so half of that is 2.5.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.515
But it isn't just multiplying
this graph by 2.5.

00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:21.620
If you multiply
this graph by 2.5,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.770
you'd get something-- let
me be a little neater.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:32.160
You would get something that
looked something like that.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.460
But because we
had a negative, we

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.480
had to flip it over the x-axis.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.370
And we got this here.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.810
So this amplitude
is 2.5, but it's

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.440
a flipped over
version of this graph.
