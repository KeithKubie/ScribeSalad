In today's video,

00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.649
we're going to try freezing Lego
to cryogenic temperatures,

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.350
and throwing it
in a blender to see

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.720
if we can turn it into a powder.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.820
[Music]

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.900
Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.879
I'm Calli, and today we
have a pile of Lego bricks,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.262
some liquid nitrogen,

00:00:19.262 --> 00:00:22.960
and a Blendtec
and a Lego Bugatti,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.880
because it's beautiful,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.100
and we're going to see what we
can do with all these things.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.660
The goal here is to try
and make powderized Lego.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.540
We want to see
if we can take these bricks,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.280
and turn them into dust.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.079
We thought a good powerful
blender might do that,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.600
but it would
probably work better

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.850
if we can drop them down to
cryogenically cold temperatures

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.310
before we throw them in.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.583
Lego bricks are made from
what's called ABS plastic,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:48.050
and it starts to melt at around
200 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.550
but gets to a really
runnier thinner consistency used

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.917
for injection molding at around
400 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.514
All right.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.000
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.150
We are going to be taking

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.700
some Lego pieces, dipping them
into liquid nitrogen,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.065
and pulverizing them

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:05.113
in a Blendtec to see
if we can powderize them.

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:07.803
If we can, we may try
melting them down.

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:10.700
Guys, I just really
like destroying things.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.860
One Lego brick.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.300
Ready?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.420
Sure.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.420
[Music]

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.080
Yes, this is very effective.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.860
I'm gonna try--

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.940
It has a higher speed setting it gets to.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:44.000
[Music]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm going to go ahead and say
if you stepped on that,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.860
it would be a lot
less painful than normal.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.380
Yeah, we've just made
like Lego sand here, I think.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.398
No, this is Lego gravel.

00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:54.462
We're not to the sand point yet.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.240
Wait, is it?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940
It's kind of a slight
burning plastic smell.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.300
Yeah.
It's like...

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.640
Have you ever left
like a cutting board

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.550
on your stove accidentally?

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.936
Kind of smells like that.

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:07.484
All right.

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:09.129
So here's what we've got left.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.500
Let's just pour this out.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.281
So this was a Lego brick,

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:15.700
and now, it's Lego gravel,
as Calli has called it.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.755
Looks like Fruity Pebbles.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760
Look at this.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.620
We can try the
Fruity Pebbles colors.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.420
Yes. No. Yes.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.400
[Music]

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.280
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.920
It's really hot.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.920
I think the process of blending
it has actually heated it up.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.140
So the friction and
the kinetic energy is really,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.040
it's really playing
a lot into that.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.900
So we have tried pulverizing
just regular Lego in the blendtec,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.820
and as you saw,
it didn't really work.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.040
We kind of got a Fruity Pebbles.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.760
It's blended, but I
wouldn't call it powderized.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.800
So to try and get
this a little bit more powdery,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.700
we're going to see

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.610
what happens if we freeze
the Lego bricks first,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.400
and for that,
we've got some liquid nitrogen.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.450
We're just going to take

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.200
these down to several
hundred degrees below zero,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.140
and see what happens when we
throw them in the blender.

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:19.495
Calli is freezing a brick.

00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:21.050
I will take a different brick.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.200
This is normal
unfrozen brick, pliers.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.350
It's ruined, but that like...

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.720
It just got kind of crushed,
little bit of smooshing.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.240
Let's see what happens
if we do it with a frozen brick.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.000
&gt;&gt; All gone.
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.800
Let's try freezing a few bricks,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.240
and throwing them
in the blender.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.855
Pour in our liquid nitrogen
into this pot,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.280
because we've got
this cool little frying thing.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.020
We're going to use that to dip
the Lego pieces down in.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.614
That looks like a good mix.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:52.400
Yeah.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.982
Go go go.

00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:07.800
[Music]

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.020
I suspected this point,
it is now warmed up.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.200
So let's take a look at this.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.494
That went much faster,

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:15.428
and we have
no large pieces left.

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:17.780
I'm not sure if I
would call this a powder,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.780
but I think we are
definitely to a sand state.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.420
Did you inhale it?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.360
I think some got
in my mouth something.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.720
As you can see,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.620
the frozen Lego
definitely breaks up

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:31.050
into much smaller bits.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.400
We've got our little Lego figure
of Grant here and...

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.400
He's not going to make it.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.232
We want to see what happens
if we blend up Lego Grant,

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:43.022
so we're going to
blend up Lego Grant.

00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:43.940
Sorry Grant.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.160
No!

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.660
Ow.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.620
I'm melting--

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.120
Nope.

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.332
Freezing.
I'm freezing.

00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:56.762
Sorry Grant.

00:04:56.762 --> 00:05:03.340
[Music]

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.860
Goodbye, Grant.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:16.280
[Music]

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.180
And he's gone.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.600
Oh, he dead.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.740
Well, we've got black element.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.031
We've got blue element.

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.650
We have yellow element,
and some orange element.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.986
Also, the little hose
to his blowtorch,

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:28.751
just like completely survived.

00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:30.450
Wait, is that
different material?

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.084
I don't know.

00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:32.362
I think it was just so thin

00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:33.962
that it warmed
up really quickly.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.680
But it does make
me wonder though,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.700
different types of materials.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.040
Legos have cars.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.100
Cars have tires.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.100
Tires are rubber.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.000
What does that do?

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.176
Let's find out.

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:49.879
Goodbye, Grant.

00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:52.241
Lego tire, squishy rubber.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.220
Fun fact: Lego is the biggest
tire manufacturer in the world.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.720
As long as you count
that as a full size tire.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.800
[Music]

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
Good and frozen, lets blend it.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.020
[Music]

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.340
Mmm, yum.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.600
Oh no, tire.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.180
[Music]

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.800
I think we should try
blending up a whole car.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.900
Not that car.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.060
That won't fit in our blender.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.800
Pulverize Bugatti?

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.060
I don't want to do that.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.940
How about this one?

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.620
Perfect.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:44.380
[Music]

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.700
People like putting
Lego pieces together.

00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:49.455
So we just need to put
this back together.

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:52.102
This would be a beginner
level Lego assembly.

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:53.944
One to six months.

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:59.100
[Music]

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.360
That's a car.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.160
There is a cup full of car.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.540
I think that the larger pieces
do a better job of blending up,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.020
because there's more like weight
holding it down near the blades.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.372
So I do want to try
like a larger batch of Lego.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:26.620
[Music]

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.080
Wow!

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.160
[Music]

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.790
&gt;&gt; That looks really fine.
&gt;&gt; It looks like sand.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.250
Yeah, all the
colors mixed together.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.240
And as fine as it got
with the larger volume.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.020
Oh, looks less like sand.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.960
It looks like sand mixed with--

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.500
Oh, but that.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.622
That dust.

00:07:51.322 --> 00:07:52.132
Nice.

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.402
Now, we still have some pretty
darn large chunks in there,

00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:59.292
but this is the finest
we've gotten so far.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.900
[Music]

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.160
Now, we're going to grab several
different individual colors,

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.680
and blend those separately, so we
get different colors of powder.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:25.080
[Music]

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.280
We've got a couple
of these glass trays,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.240
and we're going to take
our Lego powder, sand, dust

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.220
whatever you want to call it,
and we're going to pour it in.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.340
In one tray,

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.252
we're going to take
our just mixed up

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.940
assorted rainbow colors.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.940
We're just going to kind of put

00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.770
that in along with the other
cups we've blended,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.626
except the car because
that has rubber tires,

00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:43.050
and we wouldn't want to do that.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.019
The other one,

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:46.726
I've cut out this Lego
man shaped stencil,

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:50.050
and we're going to try and pour
in the different colors,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.773
and get kind of
a Lego man shape out of it.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.200
Will it actually work?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.040
We'll see, but it's...

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.900
Might be abstract art.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:13.220
[Music]

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.400
Yeah, let's throw these
in an oven at 400 degrees,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.140
and see how they handle it.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:35.142
[Music]

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:36.953
This has been in
here for a while.

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:37.894
I really thought

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:40.541
that things were going
to start puddling down,

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:43.872
but it looks like we're getting
some burning and some smoke.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.800
Clearly, that has burned.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.320
That looks kind of like...

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.500
Well, now we've got
dark Fruity Pebbles.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.760
Okay, weird.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.140
Do you see this?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.940
It's really not
conductive, is it?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.900
No, the surface, I can touch.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.100
Like it's very warm.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.680
Yeah.

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:03.200
But if I'm only
touching it lightly,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.960
it doesn't [inaudible].

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.600
If I start to squish it,
then it burns.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
Don't do this at home kids.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But look at this.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.461
This is like, you see how gooey.

00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:15.340
[Music]

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.292
So it's...

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:18.600
It's definitely all congealed.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.400
Oh, wait!

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.620
As soon as I took it out though,
now it's--

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.360
Now, it's gone brittle.

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:26.077
Oh, not even brittle.

00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:27.154
That's strong.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:34.760
[Music]

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.800
Not conductive.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.650
Super hot.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.060
But as soon as
that comes off the pan,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.300
I'm touching that.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:48.200
[Music]

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.380
Well, okay.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.360
So here's...

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.600
Here's the real question.

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:53.912
We want this to come
out in one piece.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.440
But all it takes is me
just sort of scraping this,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.180
and you can see it's leaving
this horrid residue.

00:11:01.282 --> 00:11:04.982
So I don't know if that's going to
come out once we cool it down.

00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:07.020
Just curious how this is a...

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.162
That's cool.

00:11:08.562 --> 00:11:09.402
What?

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.550
That's like the
colors we wanted.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.042
Although you can see there's

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:15.940
like little bits of the burned
color coming through.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.260
That side's hot.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.400
Don't touch that side.

00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:20.192
And then like, it's spilled.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.340
These are now cool down
and it's stuck.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.860
It's very stuck to the bottom.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.700
So that's in there forever.

00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:31.912
If it was an abstract,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.140
and you sort of cross
your eyes a little bit...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.280
Modern Art.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.050
You could probably find

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.032
that in a museum
in New York somewhere.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:42.342
This is for sale
for 1.9 million dollars.

00:11:42.612 --> 00:11:43.992
Contact me.

[Music]

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.920
Guys, that's it for today,
but the fun doesn't end here.

00:11:53.931 --> 00:11:55.041
We've got more for you see.

00:11:55.041 --> 00:11:57.571
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:11:57.571 --> 00:11:58.488
You should check that out.

00:11:58.488 --> 00:11:59.443
The other box will show you

00:11:59.443 --> 00:12:01.208
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.413
And this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe to the channel.

00:12:03.413 --> 00:12:04.901
That way, you never miss
out on the fun.

00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.700
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you on the next one.
