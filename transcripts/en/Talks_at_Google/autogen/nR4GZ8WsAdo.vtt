[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.200
Hello.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.160
SPEAKER: How you doing?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.017
How you doing?

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:09.600
How you doing?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.520
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.000
Guys, have a seat.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.220
Let's chat.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.880
AMANDLA STENBERG: I know this
is Google because we're miked.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.239
SPEAKER: Right?

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.050
GEORGE TILLMAN: Right.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.730
SPEAKER: You're miked.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.850
All this tech is here.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.130
The cameras are all set up.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.020
It's, you know, a Googly place.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.570
[LAUGHING]

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.260
So, first of all, welcome
to Google Chicago.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.430
We are so excited to
have you guys here.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.792
This movie is incredible.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.250
Um, I guess I really shouldn't
be saying welcome to Chicago

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.387
for you, because you are
kind of a Chicago guy.

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:35.220
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yep.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.757
I lived here 11 years.

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:37.590
SPEAKER: Incredible.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.950
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yep.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.241
SPEAKER: And you loved it here.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.640
I mean, obviously, you've
done some amazing work

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.147
around Chicago stories, right?

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:43.980
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.110
SPEAKER: "Soul
Food," "Barbershop."

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.400
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yep.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.390
"Row Bounce."

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.270
SPEAKER: Right?

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.478
GEORGE TILLMAN: I did about--

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:50.371
at least about six,
seven movies here.

00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:52.620
Actually, one thing I'm very
proud of with my business

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.370
partner, Bob Teitel
when Obama was here,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.030
you know, he actually greenlit
the tax incentive for film.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.540
So we were one of
the first major guys

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.160
to allow movies to come to
Chicago, with a nice discount

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.010
for a filmmaker.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.260
So I was really proud of that.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.120
SPEAKER: How wild is that?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.244
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:13.890
SPEAKER: That's just
incredible to me.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.130
And so one of the things that
I see as a consistent theme

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.750
through some of your
films is the fact

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.450
that you have a penchant
for telling stories

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.727
about the culture.

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:24.060
All sides of the culture, right?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.430
You know, you get your sadness.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.388
You get your happiness.

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:27.210
You get the joy.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.610
And that's a lot of what we
get in "The Hate U Give."

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.780
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620
SPEAKER: So tell me what about
this book and this screenplay

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.510
drew you to it.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.670
Why did you want to tell
this story specifically?

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.330
GEORGE TILLMAN:
Yeah, what I really

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.370
love about it was
it was specifically

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.639
about the culture, about this
young girl and her family.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.680
You know, the ideal of
navigating between the two

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.670
worlds.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
So the ideal of her
struggling, and then

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.080
that being a compromised
when she witnessed

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.320
the shooting of her
best friend, I just

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.990
thought that was an
interesting character arc.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.230
But what I love is how the
family's always center.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.890
And no matter tough
things get, no matter

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.390
how people in the neighborhood
tell her not to say anything

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.060
about this shooting,
or how much pressure

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.280
she feels from the
police department,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.430
and how much pressure she
feels from her white friends,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.340
her white private
school, she just pushes,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.360
and it makes the film
has this emotional roller

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.990
coaster, where you're going
through all these emotions.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.494
That's what I really
imagined, envisioned

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:26.910
for the movie when I talked
to Angie, because her book was

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.110
very amazing.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.120
But what I really love is how--

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.990
which I find really
significant--

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.260
is that you can tell a movie
about this specific culture,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.859
but it could be for everyone.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.650
And you can do it in
a way where you're not

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.675
compromising who we are.

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:43.800
And I think that's the key.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.610
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.470
And that's one of the things
that was the most beautiful

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.980
about it.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.540
I mean, it's the
kind of movie that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.640
can speak to a
range of audiences

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.770
and really welcomes them
in with open arms, which

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.710
is so incredible and
hard to do, I think.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.340
So Amandla, for you, what
brought you to this movie?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.350
So I hear that
you signed on even

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.700
before the book was published.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.042
You were all in, ready to go.

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:05.750
This was for you.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.269
[LAUGHING]

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.560
How did you make that decision?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.881
What connected you
to Starr's story?

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.880
AMANDLA STENBERG: What
connected me to the story

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.130
was the book by Angie Thomas.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.680
And if you haven't read it, I
highly recommend that you do,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.300
because it is so beautiful.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.352
SPEAKER: Second that.

00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:20.310
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.200
I was immediately
just blown away

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.830
by this story and the
power that it had in

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.780
depicting a nuanced
experience of blackness

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.730
in a contemporary world.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.530
I feel like not
often are we afforded

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.476
those sorts of representations.

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.100
And so it was really
exhilarating to me

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.700
to see this girl who was
code switching, you know,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.350
who is presenting
herself differently

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.490
in different spaces.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.410
SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.910
AMANDLA STENBERG: And then the
way in which she's galvanized

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.540
towards activism because of
these really tragic events

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.780
that we've often
become desensitized to.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.390
So to see those placed
in a personal narrative,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.460
and to understand the power of
instilling empathy in people

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.520
through that, that's what
really drew me to it.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.360
SPEAKER: And so you
mentioned code switching.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.036
And that's a term that's kind of
gaining more and more attention

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:12.660
as people are trying
to understand what

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.540
it is to be a person
of color in two

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.870
different spaces in the world,
a white space and a black space.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.459
Can you explain
a little bit more

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.860
about that, and how
Starr sees herself

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.140
code switching in the movie,
the specific situations

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.392
that she feels that she
needs to make that change?

00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.600
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah, sure.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.040
So code switching
is entering spaces

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.280
that you're not necessarily
fully accepted into,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.430
and so understanding that the
way that you present yourself

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.460
in that space might be a
little different from how

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.890
you are in your most
authentic environment,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.430
because you understand
that if you present

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.420
as authentically as
you are, it could

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.390
be detrimental to your
success, unfortunately,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.440
or you could be further
alienated or isolated, which is

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.349
something that everyone does.

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.890
You know, when you're
at home, you're

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.810
probably a little
different than who

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.450
you are at work or at school.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.260
But Starr is really
caught in this dichotomy--

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.340
which I actually
experienced as well--

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.200
of growing up in a
neighborhood that

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.550
is black and has a lot less
privilege than the neighborhood

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.560
that the kids at
her school are from,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.520
because she goes to this school
an hour and half across town

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.570
that's mostly white.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.270
And so she's one of the
only black students there,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.650
and she does a lot of
self-policing because she knows

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.770
that these kids don't understand
her experience of blackness,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.760
don't understand her community,
or who she is, or her culture.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.240
And so she figures out how
to adjust to that environment

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.890
in order to be more accepted.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.850
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.516
AMANDLA STENBERG: And so the way
that that manifests in the film

00:05:52.516 --> 00:05:56.600
is she has Starr Version
1 and Starr Version 2.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.610
And when I first read it in
the book, it really just--

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.270
it registered in a
way that I had never

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.620
seen it depicted, like in any
sort of piece of media before.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.380
Whereas Starr describes
the experience

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.850
of feeling and hearing
your voice change.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.110
When you enter a space that
you're not most comfortable in,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.950
or at least when you enter
a white space in which you

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.830
understand that your blackness
will not be understood--

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.870
SPEAKER: Right, right.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.210
AMANDLA STENBERG: So I
really connected to that,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.330
and this whole idea of Starr
being kind of canonized by her

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.200
peers at school as an
accessible black girl,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.620
as a nonthreatening
black girl, as a

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.800
not-like-other-black-people
black girl

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.620
SPEAKER: Oh, Starr,
you're different.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.078
AMANDLA STENBERG:
You're different.

00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:48.650
You're not like them.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.690
Which is just so
kind of invalidating

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.590
and simplifies our
existence in a way

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.890
that's really detrimental.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.940
So it was so
exhilarating to me to see

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.180
a portrayal of a black
girl that was actually

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.220
reflective of our
experiences and that

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.830
was really expansive and all
encompassing and multifaceted.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.620
Because oftentimes,
you know, we're

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.660
only given a certain
amount of tropes

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.040
that we're allowed to play.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.240
SPEAKER: It's a
little box sometimes.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.310
AMANDLA STENBERG:
There's a little box.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.809
Yeah.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.260
We can play the humor.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.387
We can play the pain.

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:23.970
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.511
AMANDLA STENBERG:
But not often is it

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.070
that we get to be
everything, and so that's

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.697
what was so exhilarating
about reading this character.

00:07:31.697 --> 00:07:33.530
You're right, in the
unpublished manuscript.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.570
It wasn't out yet.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.120
But it was floating
around, because people

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.800
were so excited about it.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.020
And I attached really early on.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.760
SPEAKER: Your heart
latched on, for sure.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.020
AMANDLA STENBERG: My heart
latched on for dear life.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.520
SPEAKER: Which is great.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.395
That says something
about the work, for sure.

00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:48.464
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah.

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:50.380
Another thing that I
kind of want to discuss--

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.220
I mean, it's super,
super timely.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.100
Obviously, police
brutality is on the top

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.100
of mind for so many people,
and especially here in Chicago

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.590
with the case of Laquan
McDonald, Jason Van Dyke just

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.290
being convicted for his murder.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.750
What is the importance
of a movie like this,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.650
landing at this time?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.760
You know, there's
never a right time

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.330
to talk about the hard things.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.520
But it seems like this is
almost healing in a way,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.920
for this movie to happen
right now, as some things are

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.764
changing in America.

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:17.680
GEORGE TILLMAN: Mm-hm.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.440
Yeah.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.880
Yeah, I just felt
like, you know,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.380
I was just telling Amandla, like
we were in Atlanta last week,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.800
and we finished this screening,
and someone tapped me

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.470
on my shoulder, and I
turned around, and asked,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.460
can we take a picture?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.720
And I was like, yeah,
we can take a picture.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.970
And they were like, thank
you so much for the movie.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.309
And they said, we're the
family of Emmett Till.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.600
And I was like, you know,
just kind of blowing me away.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.760
It was the whole family,
like six of them.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.440
And I just think back to Emmett
Till, being here from Chicago,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.060
going down to Mississippi.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.910
You know, he had sort
of the talk early,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.930
because his mom was telling him
how to act down in Mississippi,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.400
and how to conduct yourself is
a little different from down

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.000
there.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.700
So that talk is something that
you progress over the years.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.040
It probably was started
through slavery, you know,

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.670
when we were free, and how do
you act around certain people?

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.150
So I just felt like it was very
important for other cultures

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.440
to be able to recognize and see
that the talk to some people

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.820
is like the birds and the bees.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.370
But for us, for
African-Americans, or people

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.570
of color, it's a difference.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.670
So in a young girl like
Starr, just have to navigate

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.970
and keep pushing through.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.030
She's very much of
the world, and know

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.510
how to interact and know how
to move inside her [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.480
world.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.840
But she has another-- we
have these other things

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.060
almost as well.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.560
So a lot of that is just to let
people, as Angie was saying,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.070
who wrote the book, is to have
empathy what people go through,

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.550
and also recognizing how
did these things happen.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.390
And the shooting of the cop, why
did he react the way he react?

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.560
We talked about that.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.530
And we see it from a black
cop perspective with Common.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.240
And we'll see,
sometimes, there's not

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.610
that much of a difference.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.380
So when you think about that,
it has to be the system.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.220
The system.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.230
How do they teach cops?

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.310
Who were in charge?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.495
Who are the leaders
inside those departments?

00:10:09.495 --> 00:10:11.340
And we don't condemn.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.130
We just show what
the reality is,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.014
so we can cause conversation.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:18.180
SPEAKER: I thought Common's
character, Uncle Carlos,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.429
was so unique.

00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:20.970
Like you were saying,
you don't often

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.580
get the perspective
of a black cop.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.460
I mean, it's such an
interesting situation

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.640
to be in where you see what
the people are going through.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.265
You understand.

00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:31.390
You're part of the culture.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.420
And then, also being
kind of on the other side

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.610
of, these are your coworkers,
these are your colleagues,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.450
and how do you speak up.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:36.870
So--

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.620
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.180
SPEAKER: He's so
nuanced in that way.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.850
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.470
And it's true.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.030
I mean, let's say all
of us in this room,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.670
we all have it inside of us.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.426
I mean, let's just take
Common's character, myself, like

00:10:48.426 --> 00:10:50.550
as an African American man,
and it's a conversation

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.600
that we have had in rehearsals.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.350
If I'm walking on the
south side of Chicago,

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.090
if I'm by myself,
African American man,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.780
and if I see three African
American guys walking

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.075
on the other side of street,
and they walk over here,

00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:04.820
I'm gonna think something's up.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.690
I'm gonna move over
across the street.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.460
So that's that own
internal racism

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.849
that I have within myself
within my own culture.

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:11.890
So that has to be broken.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.750
That's what Common realizes
when this young girl, Starr,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.380
confronts him.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.930
And those are the
kind of dialogues

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.125
that the movie brings up.

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:20.750
SPEAKER: Right.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.330
GEORGE TILLMAN: You
know what I mean?

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.102
On both sides.

00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:23.560
SPEAKER: And it's
beautifully done.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.250
AMANDLA STENBERG: I think
Angie's intention with the book

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.850
was to present these
topics and these issues

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:35.610
in a way that was inclusive of
different perspectives, that

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.390
didn't further perpetuate a
divisiveness, that grounded it

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.930
in humanity.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.280
And like, we always get
asked about the timeliness

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.020
of this project.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.542
The thing is, it's been
timely for a really long time.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.500
SPEAKER: Always timely.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.583
AMANDLA STENBERG: And
unfortunately, will probably

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:53.610
be timely for a while.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.010
But we always get asked
this also really interesting

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.710
question.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.700
And I think last night, we
got asked it, which was,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.770
what is the role of an
artist in social movements?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.020
Like, what is the
role of the filmmaker?

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.090
You know, when is
it time to make art,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.480
and then when is it time
to get up and go out

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.420
in the streets in protest?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.070
And I think they're
so interconnected,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.479
and both are so invaluable.

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:22.020
SPEAKER: They work
off of each other.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.070
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.403
And when they work off of
each other, as you know, like,

00:12:24.403 --> 00:12:27.750
art has always been one of
the driving forces or conduits

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.520
for social movements.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.400
SPEAKER: Absolutely

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.983
AMANDLA STENBERG:
Like they, you know,

00:12:31.983 --> 00:12:34.540
have like a really beautiful
symbiotic relationship.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.190
And so, I think that was the
driving force behind this

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.410
piece, is to make
something that,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.000
in the midst of what feels like
chaos and what feels like times

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.690
in which things are postulated
as so black and white,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:55.080
wrong versus right, me versus
you, winner versus loser,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.870
I think it was-- it felt
important to create something

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.950
that explored it in a way that
would ground us and what makes

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.200
us most human, and understand
that every single experience is

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.160
multifaceted and requires--

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.070
in order for there to be
any sort of movement made

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.180
or any progress made,
you have to consider

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.725
even your enemy in a way
that is not one-dimensional.

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:22.350
SPEAKER: Right.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.760
And it also comes
down to empathy,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.810
like you were saying before.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:25.290
AMANDLA STENBERG: And empathy.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.300
SPEAKER: Just being able
to understand and look

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.880
at another side or perspective.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.964
You mentioned the
humanity in this.

00:13:31.964 --> 00:13:33.880
You know, there's so
much going on this movie.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.800
There are so many themes.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.008
But one of the things that
I found really interesting

00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:39.830
is your portrayal
of the black family.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.040
Right?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.660
You don't get a
lot of that in TV.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.090
I mean, we're starting to
get there a little bit more

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.510
with shows like "Blackish,"
and we're normalizing it.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.000
But Maverick is such an
interesting character as well,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.310
because he is this father who is
so complex, and he's done time,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.160
and it wasn't
necessarily his fault,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.381
but he's coming from this
one life that he had before,

00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:03.630
and it's kind of completely
switching into a new role,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.300
and he's being a father.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.600
I'm interested to know, what was
the most important thing to you

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.930
when you were portraying black
masculinity and fatherhood,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.085
and the home in this movie?

00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:15.960
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.290
One of the things that
I loved, that, you know,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.950
the perspective of having
a father in a movie

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.920
like this-- because
when I look back,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.600
I've been making films for a
little bit, since the '90s.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.940
SPEAKER: Little bit.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.920
GEORGE TILLMAN: So when
you look back at it,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.580
I say some of the African
American characters, films

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.160
that have African American
characters in it, 80%,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.130
70% of them don't have a
father figure in the household.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.730
It's always a single parent.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.780
And that's not the case in the
neighborhood that I grew up in.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.649
I had fathers next to me, to
the left or the right of me.

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:49.440
It was a community.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.190
The community actually
raised everyone.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.580
And it was always a barbershop.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.850
Like, Mr. Lewis and
always a barbecue joint.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.170
And like Mr. Reuben,
you know, like I

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.660
don't know if you
noticed on the wall,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.940
it was like, he would
give kids free barbecue

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.427
if he sees their report cards.

00:15:04.427 --> 00:15:05.010
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.230
GEORGE TILLMAN: And
that's the kind of thing,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.550
that we want to
bring community back.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.000
One of the main things is
I love their relationship.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.360
It was very strong in the book,
between Mav and his daughter.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.620
And I thought that was great.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.630
And one of the
things I love to say

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.140
is that the family
has so much joy in it.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.191
We have so many levels of humor.

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.482
Believe it or not, there's
a lot of humor in the movie.

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:28.860
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.600
There really is.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.392
Don't get us wrong.

00:15:30.392 --> 00:15:32.850
GEORGE TILLMAN: There'll be a
lot of emotion, and it's fun.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.090
You will be entertained.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.130
But it's just issues
that we see every day.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.020
And I really do believe that the
film is an entertaining venue.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.110
That's why people pay
to go see movies--

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.980
to be entertained.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.438
But the movie has that, but
you'll be able to relate to it,

00:15:47.438 --> 00:15:49.420
because there's the family.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.040
And no matter all
these obstacles,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.976
they keep pushing through.

00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:54.100
They keep going through it.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.900
And at end, we see
Starr has her journey.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.025
And that's the main thing
that I'm really proud of,

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.770
that it was two parents.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.460
They're very close.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.290
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.317
GEORGE TILLMAN: They
talk about sex a lot.

00:16:04.317 --> 00:16:04.900
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.970
There really is, like,
a romantic relationship

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.100
that grounds them.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.100
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah, it
grounds them together.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.390
SPEAKER: They're like,
there's my parent.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.139
GEORGE TILLMAN: I just
had some memories--

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:13.690
I just had memories
when I was-- we

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.970
were doing a scene
in the diner, and how

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.980
the family, after
this big incident,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.950
the family just closed their
hands again, and they prayed.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.900
So to me, that was a
throwback to soul food,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.727
around the dinner table,
and the food, and every--

00:16:25.727 --> 00:16:27.310
And I'd even tell
the actors to do it.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.400
Everybody just started
overlapping, talking

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.470
dialogue, talking about
food, eat that hot sauce,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.820
don't put the hot sauce
on that, you better

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.920
get to those vegetables first.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.867
All that was just, we
were family at the time.

00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:37.450
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:37.870
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.661
SPEAKER: And that's
what makes for a really

00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:41.180
authentic storytelling, too.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.380
And you mentioned the fun,
and the joy, and the humor,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.170
and a lot of the things
you were shooting.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.000
How did you guys
maintain a sense of joy?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.380
You know, I feel like black
joy and black excellence,

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.762
black happiness, is so
important in terms of self-care.

00:16:56.762 --> 00:16:58.720
So like, even when you're
shooting a scene that

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.740
is so heavy, that's
emotionally charged,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.510
how do you guys kind
of come back and find

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.925
the joy in what you're doing?

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:08.050
AMANDLA STENBERG: Well, we
have Regina Hall on set.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.949
SPEAKER: Right?

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:11.240
AMANDLA STENBERG: She is a gem.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.157
SPEAKER: Oh, goodness.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.781
AMANDLA STENBERG:
Man, she's hilarious.

00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:15.010
She always brought the joy.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.680
Always brought the humor.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.930
I think is just our
natural inclination

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.359
to work through trauma
that way, to rely

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:26.920
upon our humor and our joy,
and even though this experience

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.330
was so intense and
traumatic at times,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.040
there was always
a sense of levity,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.460
and like always a sense
of community and family,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.900
and a feeling that if you really
were coming up against a wall

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.630
emotionally, and you were tired,
and these events and portraying

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.000
them feel so heavy,
there is always

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.420
someone you could turn to
who would have your back.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.650
SPEAKER: That's community
at its very finest.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.530
And kind of having a nice
family to shoot with, really

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.810
helps with that kind of thing.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.691
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yep.

00:17:58.691 --> 00:18:01.107
SPEAKER: Talking a little bit
more about having, you know,

00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:02.920
having that community
and that family all

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.840
around you on set,
in the movie, I

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.490
guess Starr is trying to figure
out who her community is,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.890
even outside of her home.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.540
So, in her school at Williamson.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.710
Chris is a great character.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.450
He's really interesting,
because he's

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.600
navigating allyship,
and trying to figure out

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.690
what that means for him, how
he fits into the scene, how

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.960
he fits into Starr's life.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.310
If you guys had to, I guess,
determine something that's

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.070
important for someone who
is trying to become an ally,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.010
or trying to figure out how they
can get involved in movements

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.230
and civil rights
and racial equality,

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.710
what's the first step?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.380
You know, it can
feel heavy, right,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.780
to step into a world you're
not used to, and be like,

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.680
you know what?

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.220
I'm with them.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.337
How do you do that?

00:18:48.337 --> 00:18:50.170
AMANDLA STENBERG: One
of my favorite lines--

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.710
when I read it in the script,
I had this feeling of like,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.650
retribution of like,
oh, my god, I wish

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.900
I had had this in high school.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.190
It would've have saved me so
much like, internal strife.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.810
But there's this scene
where Chris says to Starr,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.960
I don't see color.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.664
I just see a person
for who they are.

00:19:07.664 --> 00:19:08.330
Like, I see you.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.520
SPEAKER: Yes, yes.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.895
AMANDLA STENBERG:
And Starr says,

00:19:10.895 --> 00:19:12.987
if you don't see my
blackness, you don't see me.

00:19:12.987 --> 00:19:13.570
SPEAKER: Amen.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.850
AMANDLA STENBERG:
And that was so

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.310
validating to read on the page.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.470
Because I think there's
this idea that in order

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.390
to be an ally, you have to
look at the other person

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.610
as your equal.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.200
But almost as if in the
process of doing that, in order

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.900
to do that, you have to
discredit the aspects of them

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.420
that are different,
or that make them

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.830
more marginalized than
you, when really it

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.120
should be the opposite.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.330
When you look at someone you
want to be an ally to them,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.750
it's so important that you are
inclusive of all the aspects

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.350
of their identity
that make them them,

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.520
and see them in the way in
which those aspects of self

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.970
dictate or influence
their experience.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.270
Because the idea of, oh, I don't
see color is, like, really,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.819
like, it's a great intention.

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:03.610
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.735
AMANDLA STENBERG: For sure.

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:07.570
But it also like, rests
upon the assumption

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.575
that we live in a post-racial,
post-identity society.

00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:13.116
And we all know that
that's not true.

00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:14.050
SPEAKER: Which we would love.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.591
AMANDLA STENBERG:
We would love that,

00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:16.880
but that's not where we're at.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.588
I don't even know if
it's possible for us

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:23.780
to be in a place that
doesn't use identity

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.640
as a lens through which we
primarily look at each other.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.280
So I think being an ally
is about looking at someone

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.360
and not being afraid of the
discomfort, of, oh, this person

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.040
is different than me.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.590
Their experience
different than me.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.760
It's not about
trying to postulate

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.950
their experience
as equal to yours,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.900
but rather like respecting it,
and all of its differences.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.727
SPEAKER: Accepting.

00:20:52.727 --> 00:20:53.310
Learning from.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.570
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.810
And learning about it.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.226
And I really think
sometimes, it's

00:20:56.226 --> 00:20:57.412
just is about shutting up--

00:20:57.412 --> 00:20:59.120
sitting down, shutting
up, and listening.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.222
SPEAKER: Open those ears.

00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:01.180
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yeah.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.660
Because I think that's
what is really, you know--

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.400
when there's a group of
people who have historically

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.430
taken up a space and been
very comfortable in that,

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.610
it is very uncomfortable to
no longer take up that space,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:18.790
or control it, or kind of demand
that you take up most of it.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.150
And so, what looks
like discomfort

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.800
to people who have
historically had

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.830
privilege is often just equity.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.410
That's what's really
essential for Chris

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:38.210
to understand, is he needs
to take a step back and not

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.870
take up as much space, even
in their conversations.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.800
SPEAKER: Right.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.590
AMANDLA STENBERG: Starr is
really assertive in making sure

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.830
that he's listening to
her and saying, actually,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.690
this is my time to talk.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:51.530
And listen to me.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.370
SPEAKER: Here's my story.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.260
AMANDLA STENBERG:
Here's my story.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.310
And so, I think that's
a huge part of it,

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.160
is stepping back and
being like, oh, I'm

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.340
so used to taking up all
this space right here.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.720
But, actually, let me step back.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.000
I mean, draw it back in
and allow this other person

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.400
the time and the space.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.700
I'm using the word space a lot.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.127
The time and the space
to express themselves.

00:22:15.127 --> 00:22:15.710
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.850
AMANDLA STENBERG: And
express their perspective.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.410
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.490
There's like, two people--

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.239
there's two lines in
the movie that define

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.420
that, how an ally can work.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.400
Sabrina Carpenter plays Hailey.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.486
And she says, who else is going
to speak up for people, girl?

00:22:31.486 --> 00:22:33.920
And she's a white
individual saying that.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.512
And then you got--

00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:36.470
SPEAKER: Shook my core.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.345
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:22:37.345 --> 00:22:38.900
You got K.J. Apa
who plays Chris,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.200
and his line is, being an ally,
what do you want me to do?

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.360
What do you want me--

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.357
how can I help?

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:46.190
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.731
GEORGE TILLMAN: So that shows
the difference between the two,

00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:50.510
that we show two
different sides.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.290
One is about listening instead
of trying to follow somebody.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:54.890
So--

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:55.840
SPEAKER: Being a part of it.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.780
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yeah.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.880
SPEAKER: So one thing
that's really interesting

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.910
is, you know, as Starr is trying
to figure out whether or not

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.760
she's going to use her
voice and speak up,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.000
I mean, we see that happening
in different ways in the world

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.630
now with, like,
hashtag activism.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.130
Right?

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.040
So it's incredible that
we're using social media

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.830
to say their names
and to learn more

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.900
about the stories that aren't
really being told without it.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.650
But then bringing that
into the real world

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.450
and taking another
step is very different.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.630
So what advice do
you have for people

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.579
who are yearning to speak
out, who want to speak out,

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:32.120
who want to try and
do something new,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.780
but are kind of feeling that
little bit of them that's

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.870
holding them back?

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.120
What's the first step
to opening yourself up

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.370
to trying something like that?

00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:46.130
AMANDLA STENBERG: I really--

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.010
because I really love
approaching activism

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.310
from a place of like,
artistry and humanity.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.980
And like, when Angie
Thomas wrote this book,

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.620
she was still in college.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.560
She was writing it
on her lunch break.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.810
GEORGE TILLMAN: Lunch break.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.100
Short story, too.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.725
AMANDLA STENBERG: It
was a short story.

00:24:04.725 --> 00:24:05.224
You know?

00:24:05.224 --> 00:24:08.570
She was someone who was
socially active on the internet,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.940
but wanted to find a conduit
through which she could express

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.420
it further, take the next step.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.080
And for her, that ended
up writing a novel.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.610
That has now been "New York
Times" number one bestseller

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.280
for 83 weeks.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.780
You know?

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.390
SPEAKER: Unbelievable.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.265
AMANDLA STENBERG: I'm
not saying that's going

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:28.190
to happen to everyone.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.620
But find your own lane.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.120
But I feel like--

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.720
I don't know.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.800
I really believe in the power
of expressing your activism

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.634
through your
artistry, and this was

00:24:38.634 --> 00:24:40.300
such a beautiful
opportunity, because it

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.449
was this like, synchronistic,
like, beautiful thing, where

00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:44.990
everything came
together, and we were

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.462
able to marry all of the
things that we cared about.

00:24:48.462 --> 00:24:50.110
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.310
AMANDLA STENBERG: And
I feel like, yeah, it's

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.850
about expressing yourself
in whatever conduit

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.530
that may be right.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.400
SPEAKER: I think we have some
audience questions coming up

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.540
for you guys.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.730
Two quick questions
before we hop to that.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.854
And you guys can kind of
start lining up at the mic

00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:09.320
if you have any questions
you want to ask.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.920
On a lighter note, for both of
you guys, you being a Chicago

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.050
guy, having lived here
for so many years, what's

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.630
one of your favorite
places to eat in the city?

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.600
GEORGE TILLMAN: You know
what, they got one--

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.230
they have one in Atlanta,
but it's not the same.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.380
But right down on
Wabash, you know, right

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.750
in front of Columbia College,
was Harold's Chicken.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.650
SPEAKER: Always.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.955
Good.

00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:33.814
You can stop by while
you're still in town.

00:25:33.814 --> 00:25:35.480
GEORGE TILLMAN: I
think I wanna stop by.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.096
Can we stop by there?

00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:39.290
[LAUGHING]

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.150
SPEAKER: It's a classic.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.630
And then for you, I heard
that your Harry Potter

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.680
fandom is real.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.170
AMANDLA STENBERG: Yes.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.110
SPEAKER: My heart is
just skipping a beat.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.302
So I want to know.

00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:53.510
Nothing to do with the movie.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.680
Just my own curiosity.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.170
If you had a patronus,
what would it be?

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.780
AMANDLA STENBERG: Oh, my
god, that's so challenging.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.950
SPEAKER: Take a second.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.100
I'll start with mine.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.402
It'd be a dolphin.

00:26:03.402 --> 00:26:04.024
[LAUGHING]

00:26:04.024 --> 00:26:05.690
AMANDLA STENBERG:
Damn, that's accurate.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.315
SPEAKER: Right?

00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.250
That's good, right?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.030
AMANDLA STENBERG: I
would like to think

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.960
that mine would be like,
a deer or something,

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.544
but I feel like it would
probably be like, a mouse.

00:26:13.544 --> 00:26:14.339
[LAUGHING]

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:15.755
SPEAKER: Hey they're
cute, though,

00:26:15.755 --> 00:26:16.910
and [INAUDIBLE] real fast.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.980
Like, you never know.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.940
Anybody with questions, anyone
who wants to ask anything?

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.577
If not, I will keep on going.

00:26:24.577 --> 00:26:25.910
Don't tempt me with a good time.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.990
Do you want to step up
to the mic over here?

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.880
AUDIENCE: So my question is,
you talked about really living

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.210
this dichotomy life, growing
up from where you are,

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:40.590
and then having to really change
that persona when go to school.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.269
And I think about Lakeith
Stanfield in "Sorry

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:44.810
to Bother You," in
the movie, and how

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.179
he switched to his white voice,
right, because he had to work,

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:50.220
and he had to pretty much
change his environment.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.360
So I'm curious to
know, how have you

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.800
been able to navigate your life
in your professional career

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.590
where you might have to change
a mannerism a little bit,

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.440
and kind of juxtaposing that
with your actual environment

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.060
from where you are back home?

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.250
How are you able to
navigate through the waters

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.228
and kind of live two
different personalities?

00:27:14.064 --> 00:27:15.026
[LAUGHING]

00:27:15.026 --> 00:27:17.322
SPEAKER: Challenge.

00:27:17.322 --> 00:27:18.780
AMANDLA STENBERG:
You know, I mean,

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.980
I started going to that school
when I was 10 years old.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.950
So for me, for a long
time, I had this idea

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.000
that there was something
wrong with code switching,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.900
that there was
something wrong with me

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.210
for having kind of this
multi-faceted personality

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.810
that shifted depending
on who I was around.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.605
And it kind of took me
until I was a bit older

00:27:45.605 --> 00:27:47.730
to understand that there's
nothing wrong with that,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:53.190
and that that's pretty natural,
considering the circumstances.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.020
I used to hate that I had
to make myself smaller

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.680
or change who I was in
order to feel more accepted

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.610
into that environment.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.740
But learning that language
of whiteness and privilege

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.380
has actually been
really invaluable to me

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.540
when it comes to
navigating Hollywood.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.280
Who would have thunk it?

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.610
[LAUGHING]

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.287
So it's a tool.

00:28:17.287 --> 00:28:19.120
You know, it's a tool
at the end of the day.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.660
I don't necessarily
look at it anymore

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.820
as having to compromise myself.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.700
I also have kind of witnessed
this shift happening,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.920
where we are living in a culture
that is so transparently driven

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.730
by black culture and by
blackness that I'm starting

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.130
to notice that, even
in my spaces of work

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.640
within my industry, if I show
up to that space authentically

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.030
as myself, I seem to be
more accepted than I ever

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.750
have been in the past.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.080
And there seems to
be this kind of push

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.750
for an inclusivity that is new.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.400
And so I feel like
I have to compromise

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.500
myself less and less.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.460
But I'm just more accepting of
all the different parts of me

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.970
and the way that they
manifest in my mannerisms,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.520
or the way I talk.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.780
SPEAKER: All wrapped up nicely.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.720
Oh, thank you guys so
much for being here.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.320
We're just honored to be able
to talk to you about this movie.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.145
It really is such a
movement right now.

00:29:19.145 --> 00:29:20.520
And we hope that
it's going to be

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.440
received so well
by so many people,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.887
and seen all across the world.

00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:25.470
And I really think
it's going to start

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.180
a lot of great conversations.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.250
I was telling you before,
my husband and I saw it

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.130
last night.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.130
We talked about it for
like, an hour and a half,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.469
just chatting and
chatting and chatting.

00:29:34.469 --> 00:29:36.010
And I think that's
one of the really,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.634
really special things
about this movie,

00:29:37.634 --> 00:29:40.440
is that it allows for
that conversation in such

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.370
a safe and open space, mixed
with humor, mixed with emotion,

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.174
mixed with your classic family.

00:29:46.174 --> 00:29:48.340
And I think that's what's
really beautiful about it.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.740
So congratulations to you both.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.823
GEORGE TILLMAN: Thank you.

00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:53.190
SPEAKER: Guys, the movie is
out everywhere October 19.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.690
Make sure you go out and see it.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.400
Also, pick up Angie
Thomas's book,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.304
which is based off of--
it's also a brilliant read.

00:29:59.304 --> 00:30:00.720
Nice and easy all
the way through,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.366
and just a really robust story.

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:05.490
And it's kind of what
inspired you guys to be here.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:05.910
GEORGE TILLMAN: Yup.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.710
And it's selected
theaters this weekend.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.460
Selected theaters.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.240
SPEAKER: Amen.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.614
GEORGE TILLMAN: So you can
see it tonight in Chicago.

00:30:11.614 --> 00:30:12.162
Right here.

00:30:12.162 --> 00:30:13.870
