00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.420
On behalf of the Humanities

in the District of Columbia:
1823 to 1900, based on the book

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400

Alton G. Roundtree, entitled,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.780
The History of the Most
Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.380
of the District of
Columbia: 1822 to 2016.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.910
We thank you for joining us.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.490
I'm James Sweany, Assistant

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.720

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.970
I would like to take a moment
and express appreciation to all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.050
who made possible this event today.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.360
To Sibyl Moses, the
reference specialist

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.170
and to Michelle Wingfield
of the Office

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.430
of Special Events and
Public Programs.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.700
We are especially appreciative of
Mr. Evans for coming to the library

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.440
to discuss his book with his.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.500 position:56%
The Humanities and Social Sciences
Division provides reference services

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.420
in collection development for
subjects that encompass information

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.630
in all formats for the arts,
humanities, social sciences,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.310
local history, genealogy
in the main reading room,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.110
in the library's Thomas
Jefferson building.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.330
We now ask if you would please
check your phones and other devices

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.520
to assure that they do not
interrupt today's program.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.990
This event will be filmed
and for future webcast.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.190
Note that the staff of the retail
marketing office is selling copies

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.570
of Mr. Evans' book in the
lobby outside of this room.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.570
And now, to introduce Mr. Evans,
Dr. Sybil Moses of the Humanities

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.870
and Social Sciences Division.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sibyl Moses: Thank you, Jay.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.800
Alright, good afternoon!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.100
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good afternoon!

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sibyl Moses: Okay.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.420
We are extremely grateful
for your presence.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.990
And your presence is an indication
of a strong interest in research

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.570
on Prince Hall Freemasonry.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.930
Today's presentation is important

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.270
because Prince Hall Freemasonry
is the oldest recognized

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.230 position:56%
and continuously active organization
founded by African Americans,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.540
with roots as early as 1775.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.410
In observance of this year's
African American History theme,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.870
the crisis in black education,
we dedicate this presentation

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.010
to three dynamic Prince Hall
masons, each a 33rd degree mason,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.990
and each involved in combatting
the crisis in black education:

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.750
Charles Wesley, Amos T.
Hall, and Thurgood Marshall.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.800
Charles Wesley served as
President of Wilberforce University

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.480 position:56%
and Central State University, and he
wrote the first scholarly biblio --

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.780
biography of Prince Hall,
as well as the history

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.600
of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge
of Ohio, among other words.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
Amos T. Hall was the Grandmaster
of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.520
of Oklahoma from 1941
until 18 -- 1971.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.490 position:56%
And he served as President of the
Conference of Grandmasters from 1950

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.650 position:56%
until 1964, a period critical in
the history of school desegregation.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.860
It was Amos T. Hall who
encouraged Thurgood Marshall

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.040
to join Prince Hall Freemasonry,
and later to appeal to the masons

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.960
for their financial report --

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.200
support of the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.090
Thurgood Marshall, General
Counsel and Director

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.680
of the NAACP's legal defense and
educational fund, was also Director

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.490
of the Prince Hall Mason's
Legal Research Department.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.690
This department funded the Civil
Rights Movement for a period

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.100
of 10 years, formerly, but had
been funding the movement before

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.280
and then continues to do so.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.130
Later, Thurgood Marshall
became Associate Justice

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.030
of the United States Supreme Court.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.180
Works by and about Charles
Wesley, Amos T. Hall,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.490
and Thurgood Marshall
are represented

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.760
in the library's collections,
and on the bibliography

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.450
that you have with you today.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.310
Our speaker today, Mr. A.
Tehuti Evans, is the co-author

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.690 position:56%
with Alton Roundtree of, The History

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.980
of the Most Worshipful Prince
Hall Grand Lodge of the District

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.660
of Columbia: 1822 to 2016.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.120
Mr. Evans and Mr. Roundtree
are to be congratulated

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.870
for their publication, because the
history of Prince Hall Freemasonry,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.710
as is the history of many African
American charitable, benevolent,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.700
and fraternal organizations, is one
area in African American history

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.410
that is difficult to
understand and explore.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.660
Published sources are
largely inaccessible,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.790
and where they do exist --
exist, they are often scattered

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.660
and incomplete, and Mr.
Evans will tell you,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.760 position:56%
they traveled throughout the United
States to pull together the research

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.360
that was necessary
to write that book.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.150
Too often, the personal
papers of members

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.430
and prominent leaders
have not survived.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.940
One exception being Judge
Robert Terrell's papers,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.030
who was Grandmaster in the District
of Columbia from 1899 to 1902,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.890
and his papers are held by
the Library of Congress.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.130 position:56%
Mr. Evans and Mr. Roundtree overcame
all the obstacles, and, today,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.300
we have, I think, a
really definitive history

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.460
of the most worshipful
Prince Hall Grand Lodge

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.690
of the District of Columbia.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.460
Mr. Evans is a prolific
author and editor.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.850 position:56%
He is a decorated Vietnam veteran,
and among other things, he has been,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.790
and is known affectionately
as a cultural soldier,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.500 position:56%
a college professor, an
entrepreneur, and a social activist.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.670
At Howard University, he majored
in engineering, and later served

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.460
as a military engineer in
the United States Air Force.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.590
His awards are many, but the
one that caught my attention was

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.290
when the Washington Urban
League awarded Mr. Evans The Man

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.910
of the Year Award, and
promoted him to Director

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.250
of Employment and Training.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.800
Although retired, Mr. Evans
has held several positions

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.230
in Prince Hall Freemasonry
in the District of Columbia.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.180
He served as the Grand
Historian and Archivist of D.C.,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.790
and also the Editor of the
Prince Hall Masonic Digest.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.190
And as a side note, he is my go-to
man whenever I have a question

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.400
about Prince Hall Freemasonry that
comes to the Library of Congress

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.260
and I can't answer it, I'll
call Mr. Tehuti [laughter].

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.510
So, please join me in
welcoming A. Tehuti Evans.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:46.770
[ Applause ]

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.220
&gt;&gt; Alonza Tehuti Evans:
Good afternoon, everyone!

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.060
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good afternoon.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alonza Tehuti Evans: I would like
to take this opportunity, first,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:08:00.090
to thank Dr. Sibyl Moses, Mr.
Sweany, and the whole staff

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.330
of the Humanities and Social
Sciences Division of the Library

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.160
of Congress -- Congress for the
invitation to speak here today.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.590
But first, it is my privilege
to introduce the honorable,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.470
Phillip David, Grandmaster
of Prince Hall Masons

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.510
in the District of Columbia.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.120
[ Music ]

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.270
Accompanying my Grandmaster is
his wife, Mrs. Rosalie David.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.850
[Applause] And the Deputy Grand
Master of Prince Hall Masonry

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.210
of the District of
Columbia, and my lodge mate,

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.510
Brother Quincy [inaudible].

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.410
[ Applause ]

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.740
As Sibyl pointed out, the
-- the book we produced,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.210
The History of the Most
Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.650
of the District of
Columbia: 1922 to 2016,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.080
was a six-year work of
research and writing.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.060
But rather than talk about
the details of the book,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.880
I'm going to talk about it in a
way in terms of the social impact.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.740
Okay. Today I will -- the topics
of discussion, the early history

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.460
of Prince Hall Masonry here in the
District of Columbia: 1822 to 1849,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.170
I'm going to talk about the
antebellum period in the district,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.490
1850 through 1862 specifically.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:32.120
The Civil War to Reconstruction,
1863 to 1880, and, finally,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.320
the post-reconstruction to the
turn of the century, 1880 to 1900.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.210
The early -- early history
of Prince Hall Masonry, well,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.180
Prince Hall Masonry starts in
Washington D.C. officially in 1825.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.070
But before 1825, there were
some things that occurred,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.770
which caused the brothers
to turn to masonry

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.850
as a way to solve their problems.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.600
When the federal government --
when the Constitution was written,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.360
it provided for the
creation of the District

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.870 position:56%
of Columbia for the federal capital.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.040
After the 10 mile square was laid
out, and the government moved

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.100
from Philadelphia to
Washington in 1800, what we --

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.460
what they found were there were
some free African Americans living

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.290
within the borders of the
district, but there were no rules

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.240
or laws which applied to them.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.060
There were only rules or laws that
applied to those still in captivity

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.690
in the institution of slavery.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.260
But in 1816, a unique set of
experiences started to occur.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.850
The founding of the American
colonization society.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.350 position:56%
Now this was done because the --
the plantation owners, slave owners,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.340
had a problem with the
growing number of free Africans

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.620
that were beginning to
live in the country,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.770
but there were no real
provisions for them.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.650
The same was true here in
the District of Columbia.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.970
So in 1816, they came up
with a plan, of course,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.160
of shipping all the free
blacks out of America.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.290
They -- they've got funding and
formed what we know as the Colony

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.450
of Liberia on the west coast
of Africa, and set about trying

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.540
to ship our free blacks to Liberia.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:24.700
In the District, in
1821, following the lead

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.630
of the American colonization
society, the District Board

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.960
of Aldermen passed what we called
the harshest set of black codes,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.530
which limited -- limited the
ability of free blacks to move

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.070
about in the District of Columbia,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.060
and that caused quite a
concern to many free blacks.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:50.260
So, in 1822, a man, John W. Prout,
a brother from Philadelphia,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.120
called a meeting in his
house, in Georgetown,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.400
and they had about 20 brothers
who came to the meeting,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:03.150
and he made a plea to them that
they should form a masonic lodge.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.870
And he used the example of what
the brothers had done in Boston,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.860 position:56%
Massachusetts as the reason why
they needed to form a masonic lodge.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.530
What he talked about was,
one, the men who formed the --

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.830
who led the revolution, and who
were leading the government were

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.820
mostly freemasons.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:29.030
Prince Hall, the founder of the
order, had found that he was able

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:35.100
to get citizenship status for
free blacks in Boston by writing

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.030
to the city council, having
quite freemasons on that council,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.170
and he found a listening ear.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.070
His first letter, you
can find it in the --

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.910
a book entitled, Letters of
Prince Hall, to this council was

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.990
to get permission to build a
school for the free black children

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.240
of Boston, and that was granted.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.790
Later on, he wrote and asked for
permission to build a church,

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.710
and later on, this lodge
wrote and asked for permission

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.180
to build what we now know today as
The Historic African Meeting House.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.310
So, steps to citizenship
were achieved in Boston,

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.100
which had not been
achieved anywhere else.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:23.810
In 18 -- in 1797, the same plan
was shipped to Philadelphia,

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.780
Pennsylvania, where Absalom
Jones and Richard Allen,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.230
who had founded the first
black church in Philadelphia,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:38.700
came to Boston because they
were, again, suffering from some

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.610 position:56%
of the same indignities because they
were not included in the legislation

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.150
as citizens of Philadelphia.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.040
So they wanted to reproduce the --

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.800
what I call the Prince
Hall template,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.210
to assert their rights
in Philadelphia.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.710
At that time, the government
itself was housed in Philadelphia,

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.750
they didn't move to
Washington until 1800.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.490
So while -- while there, a
lot of the brothers who --

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.360
who became Prince Hall
masons started to interact

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.880
with those masons in the federal
government who helped them interact

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.640
with the members of the
Philadelphia legislature

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.710
and the Philadelphia City
Council, Pennsylvania legislature,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.770
and the Philadelphia City
Council, to get some rights

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.910
for free blacks in Philadelphia.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.600 position:56%
John Prout, being from Philadelphia,
knew what had happened, therefore,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.700
he called for the brothers meeting
in his house in Georgetown in 1822

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.470
to try to replicate the
Prince Hall plan here

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.150
in the District of Columbia.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.500 position:56%
They wrote and asked for -- to start
a lodge, they got permission to do

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.510
so on June of 1825, social lodge --

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.980
what we call social lodge
number one, was established here

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.440
in the District of Columbia.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.260
Upon establishing the lodge in
the District, the brothers began

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.050
to take their case to
court for citizenship.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.810
The first of those actually took
place before the lodge was formed,

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.690
and that's the case of
William Billy Costin.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.720
Bill Costin became
the first secretary

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.940
of social lodge number
one, but he, himself,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.920
had a very interesting history.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.890
The black codes, which limited his
ability to move about the city,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.780
which prevented him from being
on the streets after 10 o'clock

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.040
at night, which prevented
him from assembling with more

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.100
than two other black men on the
streets, he felt were an injustice

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.070
to him, so he took
his case to court,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.110
and a Judge William
Cranch heard the case,

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:48.290
and he ruled that Billy Costin was
grandfathered into conditions prior

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.550
to the black codes being written,
and all other free blacks who lived

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.700
in the District of Columbia were
not subject to the black codes

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.900
since they were here before
the codes were written.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.290
Another one of the members
of the social lodge, in fact,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.700
worked for Master John Prout
himself, was later accused

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.790
of [pause] helping slaves to escape
from the Underground Railroad

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.630
through the District of Columbia.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.620
He was a schoolteacher, he could
read and write, and he was accused

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.260
of forging passes for
free blacks passing

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.480
through the district to go north.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.740
From my reading of the
record, he was guilty.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.590
That was part of what
he did, in fact,

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.890
social lodge number one
was one of the stations

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.790
of the Underground Railroad
through the District of Columbia.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.980 position:56%
However, the men who wanted to bring
in a handwriting specialist to look

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.900
at this document he
had produced to prove

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.770
that he had written the document,
the judge didn't allow it,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.390
ended up fineing Brother Prout
50 dollars, and let him go!

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.880
Same judge, William Cranch.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.450
Am I right?

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.520
Third -- a third brother

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.860
in this same lodge was
Brother Clements Beckett.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.830
Now, Brother Beckett had purchased
some property in the District

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:10.520
of Columbia while he was still,
quote unquote, "a slave".

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.260
On this property, he built
up two rooming houses,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.650
renting rooms to free blacks
running through the district.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.610
Well, two white gentlemen decided
to try to take this property,

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.050
stating that a slave
couldn't own property,

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:32.460
and since this property was a
money-making piece of real estate,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.560
they wanted to take control of it.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.530
But -- but the case, again,
heard before John William Cranch,

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:46.780
Judge Cranch ruled that Brother
Clement Beckett lawfully owned his

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.630
property, and, therefore,
a precedent was established

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.280
that free blacks could own property
in the District of Columbia.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.380
So it seems that John
Prout's original discussion

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.730 position:56%
with the brothers was true, becoming
masons, interacting with masons

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.160
in the district, by the way, the
federal government, of course,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.110
moved here in 1800, and there
were many masons on Capital Hall,

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.730
there were many masons
who came to Washington

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.180
to interact with the government.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.970
And even the crisis of 1825,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:22.060
known as the Captain
William Morgan Affair,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.930
didn't negatively impact
the progress

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:33.820
that the brothers were making as
masons in the District of Columbia.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:39.080
Let me...before going
to the -- the next step.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:48.210
So between 1825 and 1845, while
white freemasonry was under attack

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.200 position:56%
from the anti-masonic party and
other individuals who were disgusted

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.620
with the rumors of the murder of
William Morgan, he did disappear,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.590
white freemasonry kind of
had their head underground,

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.130
but black freemasonry was growing.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:11.510
In 1845, we created our
second lodge in the District

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.740
of Columbia, Universal Lodge.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:19.400
At that time, Universal Lodge was
created in Alexandria, Virginia.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.320
Now, Alexandria was still
part of the 10 mile square

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.040
of the district at that time.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.690
So it was Alexandria, the
District of Columbia, where this --

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.520
the lodge of brothers were erected.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.540
The reason they were erected there,
Alexandria being a port city,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.950
several brothers had been made
masons overseas in England,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.670
and they resided in Alexandria
and decided that the trip

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.570
from Alexandria into Georgetown
to meet with the brothers

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:50.820
in Washington was getting more
difficult, so they wanted a lodge

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.830
in Alexandria itself,
so that was created.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.820
A year later, our third
lodge, Felix Lodge,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.290
was created in Washington
D.C. What we --

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.390
what's called Western Washington.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.850
So by 1846, we had three lodges.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:13.360 position:56%
Two years later, March of 1848,
these three lodges met in convention

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.760
and formed the Grand Lodge.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.080
So, as of 1848, we had
the Union Grand Lodge

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.660
of the District of Columbia.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.280 position:56%
In terms of the expansion of masonry
here in the District of Columbia,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.580
so by the time we reached the Grand
Lodge status, we were here to stay,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.610
we weren't going anywhere.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:38.300
Grand Lodge created
several civic organizations

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.900
as a strategy to fight
civil battles.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.980
What I mean is this.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.210
Instead of going into courts
or interacting with the people

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:53.170
in the city as a masonic
organization, the brothers decided

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.100
to create what's called the Social,
Civil, and Statistical Association,

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.250
the Bethel Literary Association,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.040
and the Young Men's Literary
Association, so as they met,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.250
they met under one
of those three titles

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.000
with other people in the public.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.960
So there's a cover for what they
were doing, advocating again

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.320
for rights for free blacks
in the District of Columbia.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:22.220
But by 1862, Abraham Lincoln
had been elected president,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.690
and there was rumors afoot that he
wanted to send all the black folks

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.650 position:56%
out of the United States of America.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:37.160
So, Abraham Lincoln, through one
of his men, requested a meeting

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.640
of a delegation of free blacks
from the District of Columbia

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.270
to discuss a plan, the plan
he called, The Panama Plan.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.880
And this -- in that meeting, John
T. Costin was a former Grandmaster,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.760
in fact, he was the
second grandmaster

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.720
of Prince Hall masons
in the District.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.870
Edward W. Thomas had
been grandmaster in 1861,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.030
and then there was this
young up and comer,

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:05.850
real energetic young man
named, John F. Cooke,

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.640
Jr. His father founded
the second school

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.650
for free black folks in the city.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:18.280
He, himself, had been run
out of the city, I'm sorry,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.330
his father had been
run out of the city

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.180
in 1835 during what was
known as the Snow Riot.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.020
But -- and he would become --

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.010
and he would be a future
grandmaster, from 1865 to 1873.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:35.440
And of these five men, delegation,
two other men, Cornelius Clark,

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.270
who was in the Social, Civil,

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.020
and Statistical Association,
but he wasn't a mason.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.230
And Benjamin -- Benjamin McCoy,
a minister and teacher, in fact,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.000
he was the founding minister
of the Ashbury Church.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.360
Well, Abraham Lincoln made a long,

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.200
a long plea to these men
explaining why, that after slavery,

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.490
he saw no way that free blacks
would want to live in a country

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.870
with people who had enslaved them.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.240
He thought because of the
deaths during the Civil War,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.180
that the former confederates
would never forgive blacks,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.830
they would call -- charge
them with being the reason

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:16.820
that they lost relatives, so he had
gotten 600,000 dollars allocated

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.740
from the United States
Congress to ship all blacks

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.200 position:56%
out of the United States, to an area
of Panama to -- well, it was not --

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.910
it wasn't called Panama at that
time, but to Panama, to become --

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.020
create a country of their own.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.680
He thought both free blacks and
former slaves shouldn't live

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.400 position:56%
in the country, and he needed these
five men's delegation blessing to go

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.550
about to the other
free black communities

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.840
and convince them to
buy into his plan.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.720
This was August 14, 1862.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:58.460 position:56%
The five men delegation heard the
president's call, was polite, but --

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.810
and only one of the five
thought about, perhaps,

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.510
supporting the president's plan,
but since he didn't get the support

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:10.150
of the four or five men delegation,
Lincoln brought the plan up again.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.040
So, again, part of the
impact of these men,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.890
especially those Grandmasters
of Prince Hall masons,

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.640
with them saying no
to the president,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.500
they wouldn't support the
plan, I assert it's one

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.410
of the reasons there is a black
Washington D.C. community today,

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.000
because if Lincoln
had gotten his way,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.360
there would be no African
Americans in the country,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.370
they all would have
been shipped out.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.000
A lot of people, in a lot
of historical settings,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.250
as our history is told,
especially during this period,

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:44.110
this Panama plan is never brought
up, the discussion that took place

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.700
with the president is never
brought up, and as far as I know,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.510
no one else has made an
assertion about the impact

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:56.150
of them not accepting the
president's recommendation.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.410
[Audience mumbling] New information
[laughter], again, [applause] --

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:08.450
again, in the -- in the book, we --
we cover the meeting, and, in fact,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.340 position:56%
we thought it was of such
importance, that we had the entirety

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.660 position:56%
of the president's address through
the five men delegation in the book.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.980
Okay. 1863 to 1880, talk a
little bit about that time.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.430
Following the Civil War,
Washington D.C. was kind of unique,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.820
because all of a sudden
blacks began to move

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.640
into very important
positions, like in other --

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.840
the reconstruction
governments across the south.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.540
John F. Cooke, Jr., who
I already mentioned,

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.210
was appointed the Collective Taxes
for the District of Columbia.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.700
William A. Taliaferro was elected
to the Common Council in 1868.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.960
Carter A. Stewart was elected
to the Common Council in 1868,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.010
and the Board of Alderman in 1869.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.880
So for a time period, part of the
legislative leaders of the District

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.180
of Columbia were all [inaudible]
masons, and even though

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.070
in the history of the
District of Columbia,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.390
you might see their names
mentioned, no mention is made

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.930
of the fact that they were masons.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.100
Okay, again, John F. Cooke,
John F. Cooke, Jr., as I said,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.270
was Grandmaster of the --

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.200
of the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge, he served two terms.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.360
His first one was 1866 to 1873,
and he came back into Chair

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.120
in the east [phonetic]
from 18 -- 1876 to 1877.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.470
He was appointed by
Ulysses S. Grant.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:39.670
D.C. Chief Tax Collector serving
a 10-year term, from 1874 to 1884.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.410
Cooke served as the
district delegate

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.160
to the Republican National
Convention in 1872 and 1880.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.020
And he was also appointed to be
D.C.'s Jury Commissioner in 1889.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.330
By the way, his wife
was also an activist,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:58.520
Helen Appo helped found the
National Colored Women's' League.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.690
Another one of our
brothers was James Wormley.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:07.580 position:56%
A lot of people don't know, but
James Wormley built and owned the --

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:14.100
one of the most prosperous hotels
in Washington D.C. in the 1870's.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.550
His hotel was at 15th and 8th
Street Northwest, in fact,

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.750
it became a favorite for
Washington's rich and famous,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.120
attracted by well-managed rooms,
renowned cuisine, in fact,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.190
his turtle soup and seafood were
considered to be excellent dishes,

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.760
and amenities, such as
the first hotel elevator

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.800
and the first telephone
in the hotel was in --

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.160
in the Wormley Hotel
at 15th and 8th Street.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.830
By the way, there's a school,
the Wormley School in Georgetown,

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.440
3331 Prospect Street,
which is there today,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.560
was built and named in his honor.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:03.890
1880 to 1900, because of Howard
University, a lot of elite blacks

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.270
who were attracted to
the District of Columbia,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:10.110
men such as Dr. Daniel Hale
Williams, Dr. William A. Warfield.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:15.160
In 1886, the Grand
Lodge at the District

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.420
of Columbia hosted the first
ever black industrial exposition.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.240
That is it was a black
expo, 1886 right here

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.380 position:56%
in Washington D.C. The only one held
in the country during that time,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.990
but, again, the brothers of
the Grand Lodge at the District

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.220
of Columbia are the
ones who sponsored it.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.150
It was held at the
Shallow Baptist Church.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.810
Also during this time period, there
are a lot of writers, by the way,

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:44.630
this is a catalog from that -- from
that expo, basically the catalog,

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.930
first industrial exposition, the
colored citizens of the District

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:54.860 position:56%
of Columbia, masonic fraternity at
Union Bethel Church, September 1886.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.810
We're still trying -- I can't find
an original copy of the document,

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.330
but I but I have this
facsimile of it.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:10.640
Some prominent freemasons in
D.C. during this time period.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:17.350
Dr. Samuel R. Watts, in fact,
he was in Lodge number 25.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.690
Let me back up.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.560
Dr. Samuel R. Watts was the 29th --

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.780
the 25th grandmaster of the
Grand Lodge District of Columbia.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:32.820
He was an internationally-known
doctor, and was very prominent --

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.640
prominently featured in his visits
to several countries in Europe.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:46.160
Solomon G. Brown, once described
as probably the best employee

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.190
of the Smithsonian Institution.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.380
In fact, the original director of
the Smithsonian Institution wanted

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.090
to appoint him as his successor,

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.850
and stated that he couldn't do
it because, him being black,

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.990
he knew that the white
power structure

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:04.790 position:56%
of the government wouldn't allow it.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.630
But in -- in most instances
where he's talked about,

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.990
he was the most know --

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.860
knowledgeable person
about the holdings

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.260
of the Smithsonian Institution

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.740
than any other employee
of that institution.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.360 position:56%
The next slide is Hamilton S. Smith,

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.430
he was the 29th Grandmaster
of masons here.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:27.260
Hamilton S. Smith was also the
son of the last living master

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.890
of African Lodge 459 of Boston.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.620
He was both a dentist and
photographer, and, in fact,

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.780 position:56%
one of his pictures is -- graces the
cover of a recently-published book

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.680
from Massachusetts about the
Grand Lodge, the African --

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.450
the Prince Hall Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:53.920 position:56%
With the authors just using the
picture on the book, and not knowing

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.860
who took the picture
or anything about it.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.270
The irony about the picture,
doing my research, in fact,

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.480 position:56%
I have the sister picture to the
one that's on the cover of the book.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.090
The picture is of the most
[inaudible] Grand Lodge visit

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.890
to Prince Hall [inaudible].

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.990
And prominently in that picture
are a couple past grand masters

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.270
and some very important
people that are not named

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.570
on the cover of the book.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.530
The picture on the book contains --
is a picture of the men and women,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.950
the husband and wives, who
went to the -- on that visit.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.150
The sister picture is just a
picture of the men, the masons,

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:34.880
who were on that trip, and,
again, that's part of our files.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.580
The other gentlemen at the bottom,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.150
Senator Blanche K. Bruce,
was a [inaudible] mason.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:47.090
After -- after serving his term
in the -- in the government,

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.950
rather than go back to
Mississippi, he settled down

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.420
and became the leading socialite
here in the District of Columbia.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.400
Next to him is the 23rd
Grandmaster of masons here,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.970
this is Leonard C. Bailey.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.750
Leonard Bailey was the
first black millionaire

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.050
in the District of Columbia.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:10.160
He made his monies, he designed
a trussel of holding in -- for --

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.910
for a body wounds, he
invented the trussel

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.940
to hold the body part
in for the wounded men.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.970
He also invented the folding army
cot, that, you know, in fact,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:25.190
that folding army cot, I
slept on one when I was

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.680
in the military myself,
so it's still in use.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.960
And he made millions,
and the millions

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.050
that he made made him the
founder of one of the first --

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.920
the first black banking at District
of Columbia, Capital Savings Bank,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.270 position:56%
which is down on F Street
Northwest, which pictured beside it.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:48.080 position:56%
And as Dr. Moses pointed out, two
other people I'd like to talk about.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.320
During the course of writing an
article for the Masonic Digest,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.800
I wrote one about Washington
D.C.'s second-most famous black

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.200
power couple.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.250 position:56%
And that is, at that time,
President Barack and Michelle Obama,

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:10.110
but the first Washington D.C. real
black power couple was Judge Robert

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.990
Heberton Terrell and
Mary Church Terrell.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:18.870
Now, Robert Terrell, again, was
one of our grandmasters at the turn

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.780
of the century, from 1899 to 1902,

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.560
he was the first black
appointed judge here in the city,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.640
and was very significant in helping

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.690
to found Sigma Phi fly [phonetic]
here in the District of Columbia.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.800
But probably more famously known
was his wife Mary Church Terrell.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.300
Mary Church Terrell
lived until 1954.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.340
Her husband passed away in 1925.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.470
She continued to be a leading
social activist fighting

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.640
against segregation in the city.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.020
She was also a leading
women's suffragette.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:01.830
In fact, on the side, it's kind
of a statement, she didn't want

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.990
to become a member
of the Eastern Star,

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.740
the female affiliate
of Prince Hall masons.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.620
She told -- she was just
too forward-thinking,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.650
she said, as an independent.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.560
She was fighting for women's rights
and she wanted to be a leader

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.600
in that and she didn't want
to be in the organization,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.300
but she was a leading proponent and
right up, just before her death,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.480
she led marches here in D.C.
I personally remember --

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:39.370
remember her from the early
protests at Glen Echo Park.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.210
If any of you older Washingtonians,
and know right outside

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.350
of the district, then Echo Park
was an amusement park that, again,

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:51.940 position:56%
desegregated, wouldn't allow African
Americans to attend, and she marched

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.740
against that establishment.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.540
So, during the course of
the 18th century, I'm sorry,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.000
the 19th century, there are
many books that's been written,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.620
literature written about blacks
in D.C. during that period.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.930
Among those, Secret City:
The History of Race Relations

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.200
in the Nation's Capital,
by Constance Green,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.310
an excellent book I suggest
everyone would enjoy reading it.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:21.920
Another one, Aristocrat's of Color:
The Black Elite: 1880 to 1920,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.330
though Willard Gatewood's book
wasn't talking just about D.C.,

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.730
the largest percentage
of the, quote unquote,

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.490
"aristocrats" of color were
residents here in the city.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:37.600
Another book that talks a lot about
the blacks in Washington D.C.,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.610
especially in the latter part

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.710
of the 19th century is Leading
the Race, by Jacqueline M. Moore.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.280
By the way, all of these books are
here in the Library of Congress,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.280
and most of them can still
be acquired through some

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.960
of the book selling
outlets in the city.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.000
The fourth book, the Black
Anglo-Saxons, by Nathan Hare,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.860
it's another that talks about
this unique black Washington

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.160
D.C. community.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.420
What was unique about
it is that through all

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.290 position:56%
of the negative circumstances that
people had faced, what gathered here

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.610
in the District of Columbia,

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.770
primarily due to the black
freemasons of the city,

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:27.590
was the most sophisticated, black
middle class of any jurisdiction,

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.610
any political jurisdiction
in the nation.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.720 position:56%
If you want to know where the,
quote unquote, "uppity blacks" were,

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.810
they were in Washington
D.C. [laughter].

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:41.970
And I use that term affectionately,
both said by members of the race

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:48.460 position:56%
and -- and described by many
newspaper reporters as they reported

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.260
on the behavior of these people.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:56.120
But the idea of being organized,
fighting as an organized body

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.160
for rights, and establishing
a -- what --

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.900
I like the term, a safe zone,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.310
where black middle class people
could freely express themselves,

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:15.390
enjoy citizenship without all
of the pressures of black folks

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.400
in other parts of the south.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.830
Remember, we're south
of the Mason-Dixon line.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:24.180
There was nowhere else in the south
where blacks had as much freedom

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.330
and expression of themselves,
or created as much wealth

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.810
as what had happened here
in the District of Columbia.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:35.830
At the foundation of what
made all of that possible,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.620
were Prince Hall freemasons.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:44.580 position:56%
The fact that here in 18 -- 1822 was
when the -- when the process began,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.730
and the fact that they organized
for their rights, stuck together,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.070
it's -- it's quite an
achievement for that

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.870
to have occurred in the south.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.700
In the north, they say that doing,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.990
especially antebellum
days during the 1800s

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:03.260
that free blacks had more
privileges, that might be true,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.970
but there was no city
anywhere else in the nation

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.710
where blacks had as much success.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:13.600
During the period of captivity,
before the end of the Civil War,

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.310
and immediately after the end
of the Civil War, up to the turn

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.880
of the century, the most successful
blacks in America, as a group,

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.040
as a class, existed
here in Washington D.C.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:33.830
And their story is a result of the
Prince Hall Freemasons of the city.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.860
We -- we founded it, we're very
proud of what we have done,

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:43.120
and we only see more
success in the future.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.960
Our next work will
address our successes

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.120
and impact during the 20th
century, but for this presentation,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.650
we limit it to the 19th century,

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.610
because at that time we think it
reached kind of a peak of success

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.810
that we like to talk about.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:01.280
Let me make sure.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.480
No, okay, that was the last slide.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.280
But I hope that this little,
short overview of the book,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.020
you know, has been informative.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.110
And before we go outside
to start signing autographs

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.550
or selling the book, I
would like to take this time

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:21.010
to entertain questions from
you about -- about...yes, sir?

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:25.600
[Inaudible background question]
Frederick Douglas did not become

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.900
a mason.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.780
In fact, I would say Frederick
Douglas got, my personal opinion,

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:39.280
Frederick Douglas thought that
the [pause] form of what we do,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.580 position:56%
in practicing masonry, the substance

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.560
of what masonry is,
was a waste of time.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.860 position:56%
He thought that man should be
spending more time outwardly working

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.320
for the freeing of
those in captivity.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.760
So, he -- but his son was a mason.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.060
But he didn't.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.860
Yes ma'am?

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:13.490
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:20.730
Yes! [Laughter] That's a -- yeah,
well...yeah, okay, let me --

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.350
let me answer the -- let me
answer the question this way.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.450
No, well, it's a very important
question because, often times,

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:32.890
a lot of -- a lot of African
American historians shy away

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:37.040
from this point.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:43.960
The mixed race African Americans
are 99.9 percent a result

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:51.990
of white plantation owners
having sex with captured women.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.420
Today, it would be called rape,
legally, because you have power

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.860
over somebody and you have
sex with them that way.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.880
I mean, they don't have
the power to give consent,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.110
since they're in captivity.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:09.510
So, a lot of these plantation
owners who had children

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:15.730
with their captive women both
respected and loved their children.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.450
And in many cases, they gave them
a [inaudible] upstate, as it were,

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:23.430
and sent them up north to
live, there such, right?

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:28.380
Washington D.C. became one
of the primary landing places

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.330
for a lot of mixed race people.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.240
As an example, I'll talk
about Mary Church Terrell.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.140
Mary Church's grandfather
was a white man

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.440
that had a son with a black woman.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.840
He loved his son, brought him up in
his business, gave him money to --

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.010
he'd stay right -- yeah, I think
it was St. Louis or Kansas City

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.340
where his son even became very
wealthy, as such, and, you know,

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.840
and they -- his daughter married,
Mary Church, she was a feisty,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.230
young woman, they sent her off
to college, and her grandfather

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.500
and father took her
on a tour of Europe,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.070
following her graduation
from college, as such.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.550
But a lot of people who looked
at her when they see her,

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.430
they wonder what her ethnicity is.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.760
In fact, another one of the
stories of our fraternity

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.380
across the board is
that in the early days,

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.170
a lot of the leadership were
mixed race brothers and --

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.970
were mixed race black men
because of that one phenomenon.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:34.190
Not that they didn't escape and run
north, like a lot of blacks did,

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.870 position:56%
but a lot of them were actually
given their freedom by their fathers

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.700 position:56%
and sent north to other cities
where they could live a decent life.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:46.470
And so I do understand, by looking
at the pictures, you could think,

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.220
wow, they all -- they're not,
quote unquote "dark black".

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:55.290
But because of the one-drop rule
passed by the government, you know,

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.740
like the real status, if you
had one drop of black blood,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.330
no matter what you look like,
you were considered black.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:07.600
And a lot of people -- a lot of
people of mixed race, a lot of --

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.510
a lot of mixed race
people don't look black.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.380
In fact, one of the phenomenons
that occur in this country,

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:18.950
there's a term called passing,
and a lot of black folks --

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.470
a lot of people who, by law, would
be considered by black are passing

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.830
for white, because
if you don't know --

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.100
you don't know their DNA or blood
line, you would never be able

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.360
to tell that they had
one drop of black blood.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.820
But that's a good question.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.620
Yes, sir?

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.380
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.720
Oh, beautiful question.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.110
Well, William [inaudible]
was the grandson

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.220
of Martha Custer Washington.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:59.640
Marth Custer's father
brought him into the world.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:07.680
Alright? So he -- Marth -- [pause]
her father, Martha's father,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.190
alright, was his father also.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:17.310
Now, Martha had a mixed -- Martha's
sister was a mixed race woman,

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.710
Native American and black.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:29.270
And when Martha got married, her
father gave her her step sister,

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.690
you know, as her captive.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:38.110
After Martha was married and had a
child, her son, when he got of age,

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.400
he raped his aunt, not
knowing it was his aunt.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:48.020
Alright? And so her son had a
child with her stepsister, so,

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.620
William [inaudible] was
both Martha's grandson

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.970
and nephew [audience
mumbling] as such.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:58.140
Now here was such a
high-spirited and intelligent man,

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.320
that when both George and Martha
died, he left the plantation

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.140
of his own free will and
moved into the district.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:10.440
He became one of the most trusted
men at the Bank of Washington.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.970 position:56%
In fact, a lot of widowed women with
monies would call on him to come

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.860
to their homes -- would send
for him to come to their homes

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.970
and get monies that he
would go down and deposit

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.270
in the Bank of Washington.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.950
By the way, the Bank of Washington
is, today, is in the exact spot

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.720
where it was during Billy's life.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.420
And he had the respect of a
lot of whites at that time

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:36.370
who knew what his parentage was.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.770
So they knew that he was a
Custer's [inaudible], and, in fact,

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:44.710
after Martha died, the
[inaudible] sisters,

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:48.570
or the Custer's sisters
had Billy do all

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.190
of their banking and official work.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.490
They didn't trust their --

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.690
they trusted him more than they
trusted their own blood brother.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.990
So he had quite a status.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:00.360
In fact, when he died in 1842,
he was the first African American

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.130
to have -- or to be eulogized
on the floor of the House

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.000
of Representatives, and the man

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.290
who eulogized him was the former
President and newly-elected House

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:18.840
of Representative, John Quincy
Adams, eulogized him in 1842

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.700
on the House -- on the floor
of the House of Representative.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.220
And then the newspapers
of the day, you know,

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:29.140
like his funeral procession was
covered by all the local media,

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.120
in terms of the respect
of the number of people

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.270
who turned out to honor this man.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.710
Both black and white, he was one

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.680
of the most honored
men during his lifetime

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.810
in the District of Columbia.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.610
Yes, sir?

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:56.220
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.560
Hard -- yeah, it was
a six-year effort.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:04.490
A lot of the works are in
the masonic library in our,

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:09.180
thank god for the grandmaster
of masons of our back

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.310
in the late 1800's who had
enough foresight to say

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:17.170
that it was intention to create the
best masonic library in America.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.120
And he told his man, hey, he
didn't care about the rules,

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.040
he wanted all of the proceedings
of the black masons in the country,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.740
as well as the white masons.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.680
So thanks to him, a lot of
original records are copies

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.830
of the original records
at our masonic library.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.350
There's another process
in masonry where the --

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:45.760
we have a CCFC, a chairman

correspondence whose responsibility

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.930
it is to communicate
with other grand lodges.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:03.460
Whenever a -- when we printed
our proceedings for what we did

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.710
for the year, our chairman
would send copies,

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.450
or at least write a summary of what
we had accomplished for the year,

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.930
and send those summaries
to other grand lodges.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.500
So we had to go out and look in
the records of other grand lodges

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:22.960
for a CCFC report, and
I guess the other thing,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.600
my background as a historian.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.010
I went back to school after
engineering and got degrees

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.580
in history and philosophy.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.170
But in studying African American
history, prior to becoming a mason,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.380
a lot of these people knew
their place in society

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.020
and contributions they had made,
for my background as a historian.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.680
I didn't know they were masons!

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.770
Until six, you know,
within the last six years.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.370
By the way, I was asked,

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.340
I volunteered to assist
Brother Roundtree, in fact,

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.720
I was asked to volunteer
because of my background

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.870 position:56%
as an African American historian,
to Brother Roundtree is a researcher

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.360
and a writer, but wasn't
necess -- didn't, at that time,

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.140
consider himself a historian.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.410
So, we wanted to add this flavor to
the works that would be produced.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:19.270
So I was quite surprised to
find that a lot of the people

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.100
who were already heroes of mine

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.080
from black history were
also [inaudible] masons.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.140
And so, you know, so it was kind
of like a cross fertilization.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:32.230 position:56%
My background plus the masonic
records, my method of research added

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.590
to Brother Roundtree's
method of research,

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.860
it was definitely a
work of collaboration.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.810
Yes, ma'am?

00:49:40.810 --> 00:50:08.810
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:16.390
Oh, yes! John T. Costin, as an
example, was personally responsible

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.510
for uplifting blacks in Georgia.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.060
He left D.C. and was called a,
quote unquote "carpet bagger",

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.280
but after -- after the
war, he went to Georgia,

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.240
traveled all over the state
organizing black folks,

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.940
both for the purpose of organizing
them to vote to get empowerment

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.590
in that way, and also in community
meetings, teaching them how

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:45.480
to organize their resources
for their own upliftment.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:51.390
Another gentleman,
Richard Howell Gleaves,

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:57.840
who was a past national
grandmaster and from Philadelphia,

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.170
Pennsylvania, went
to South Carolina.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:03.130
In fact, he was elected
the Lieutenant Governor

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.650
of South Carolina during
the reconstruction era.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:08.550
He as from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, but he came back

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.330
and settled down, became
a member of --

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:15.030
of the our body in Washington
D.C., but his personal wealth

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.770
and knowledge helped uplift the --

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:23.800
I did it again, uplift the
brothers in South Carolina.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:29.720 position:56%
So there was a way that the people,
our knowledge and organizing skills,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.690 position:56%
went south to organize in the south,

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.630
the newly-freed Africans
there, right?

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.930 position:56%
To help them get their act together.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.180
Another thing that people might
not know, but both Absalom Jones

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.540
and Richard Allen of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church,

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.420
were both grandmasters of masonry
in the state of Pennsylvania,

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:59.020
and they sent riding bishops into
the south to organize churches.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:03.470
The two elements of what makes a
community, where they organize men

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:05.380
as masons, and the church.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.110
They was the anchor for spiritual
development, as such, right?

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.850 position:56%
And, again, those ideas, [inaudible]
from [inaudible] masonry went

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:17.280
to settle and help create the
successful communities of blacks

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.880
in the south following
the Civil War.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.790
Yes, sir?

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:40.160
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:48.500
Okay, well, because of the
grand lodge being here in 1867,

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.300
I think when [inaudible] was
formed, that the -- the --

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:58.330
those men who created the
institution depended on a lot

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.110
of the -- the brothers
in [inaudible] masonry

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:05.210
to help give them a way
and get them set up.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:10.770
Dr. Warfield, who set up Howard
University's Surgery Department,

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.210
was also one of our grandmaster,
a grandmaster of masons, alright,

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.910
here in the District of Columbia.

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.710
I don't have a list
of all the professors,

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:21.390
but there was always
a close relationship

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.070
between our grand lodge
and [inaudible] Howard.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:37.470
In fact, from 1865 until 1925, if
you were an African American man

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:41.800
in America, the highest social
status you could have was being a

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.140
mason, being a [inaudible] mason.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.010
The reason I put that date and line
in there is because from 190 --

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:53.020
from 1904 through 1925 is
the period of the creation

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:58.970
of the Greek fraternities on
college campuses, and over time,

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:03.730
even though each one of them used
our procedures and our handbooks

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:09.600
to create their organizations, as
such, right, as one became educated

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:16.550
through time, in the minds of some
people, being a [pause] Greek --

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:22.690
in a Greek fraternity was the
highest status than being a mason.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:26.280
But about, I would
say from 1920 to 19 --

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.750
well, until 2016, or until today,

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.310
one of the most [inaudible]
statement that you can make is

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:35.210
that you're a double brother.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:39.550
Now, double brothers are mason and
an omega or mason and an alpha,

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:43.640
a mason and a cappa, or what
have you, but double brothers.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.680
So, [laughter], you know, it's
like we -- we created them, they --

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.720
they've come back and we've joined.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.970
So we both have the -- the frater
-- the college fraternal order

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.780
and [inaudible] masonry all have
the same goals for our communities.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.180
There's [inaudible]
in moving forward.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:05.030
Yes? That's the last...alright,
last question.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.830
Yes, sir?

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:12.410
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:22.240
Okay, well, I'll put it this way,
is the -- when the masons of --

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.060
of the revolutionary period,
designed the documents,

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:33.300
which are the foundation
of this country, in fact,

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:37.400
13 out of the 39 men who created
the Constitution were masons.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.840
The first country in the world

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.750
to have a constitution is the
United States, and the idea came

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.060
from the fact that masonry was
run by Anderson's Constitution.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.000
And many of the elements in the
U.S. Constitution duplicate what's

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.960
in Anderson's Constitution.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:00.070
But the -- what we call America's
original sin, not just slavery,

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:05.140
but the discrimination that slavery
caused, [inaudible] tenants say

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:11.550
that in the country, that
all men are created equal.

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.890 position:56%
The government didn't practice
that, and though freemasonry is a --

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.220
is an organization itself, which
states that all men are brothers,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.100
so we don't -- we only deal
with each other based on what's

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:26.200
in our hearts, in those days, these
three [phonetic] didn't do that.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.500
So there was discrimination.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:31.550
There were whites who wouldn't --
who didn't allow their interaction.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:35.700
My co-author wrote a piece several
years ago, called two faces,

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.460
one public and one private,
in which -- which --

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:44.230
what was pointed out is that there
have always been white masons

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.710
who worked with and helped
black masons move forward.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.940
But at the same time, there
have always been white masons

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:57.320
who did everything they could to
prevent us from moving anywhere,

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.680
and who denied our
legitimacy, as such.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.950
Right? So that's internal politics.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.310
So, in America, as opposed to
anywhere else in the world,

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.880
what's called [inaudible]
freemasonry is talked

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.280
about as black freemasonry or
African American freemasonry.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.230
But the truth of the matter is
both groups practiced the exact

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:18.860
same thing.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.160
Both groups do.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.870
But, again, the legacy of racism

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:26.100
and discrimination has
-- is still with us.

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:32.920 position:56%
There are -- of the 50 states in the
country, there are 8 grand lodge,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.830
or white masons, primarily
in the south,

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:37.120
who don't recognize
black freemasonry

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.380
as a legitimate fraternal
organization.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.130
Therefore, when we talk, we
have to talk about white masonry

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:45.610
and black masonry and we
bring up those circumstances.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.510
Okay? Well, thank you very much!

and it's such a wonderful experience
every conversation you have

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.120
with this man, is so
enlightening, and what he has done

with Alton Roundtree is enable
us now to tell the story

of African Americans in
the District of Columbia,

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:27.620
because now historians can now
take their work and integrate it

into future histories, and this is
what is needed across the country.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.880

It's -- it's unbelievable when
you look and dig what is here.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.840
Just the other day, I called
Tehuti, and I said, you know, I --

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:06.480
I found a letter by John Cooke,
you know, is this our John Cooke?

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.200
And he said, yes.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.580
It was John Cooke, Sr., it's
a letter, 1837, downstairs,

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:18.620 position:56%
and the curators and the manuscript
collection have pulled that document

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.570
out along with some other
documents so that we can go down

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.690
and actually see them, alright?

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:29.240
So what I have for you, Mr.
Evans, and for you, Mr. David,

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.810
is a copy of one of the [pause] --

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:37.390
a copy of one of the reports
that Thurgood Marshall made

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:42.980
to the NAACP's legal defense
fund, talking about the money,

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.610
actually documenting, it was
his report to the conference

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:49.540
of grand masters where he
documents what the funds

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.110
that the Prince Hall masons gave

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:55.190
to the NAACP's legal defense
fund actually achieved.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:59.940 position:56%
Okay, and we know that there were
over 400 school desegregation cases.

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.730
[Applause] So, you have that, okay?

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:07.570
And on a final note, my father
was a double brother [laughter].

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.490
He left Howard, he was
drafted while he was a student

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:14.550
at Howard University to go to
Tuskegee Army air-flying school

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:18.470
as a Tuskegee airman, and while
he was in Tuskegee, Alabama,

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.260
he became a Prince Hall mason.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.060
He went through Lewis Adams Lodge,
and for those of us who know,

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.930
Lewis Adams was one of the
founders of Tuskegee Institute,

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.440 position:56%
along with Booker T. Washington, and
so they named the lodge after him,

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.580
and my father went
through that lodge,

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.560
and one of the things
he has always told us is

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.930
that to be a balanced black
person, you have to belong

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:42.920
to the craft and to a fraternity.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.220
That's what he would say.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.800
He said, because there you get
the representation of all of us,

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.350
and he said that Prince Hall
freemasonry was the gatekeeper

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.440
of our culture, and you can hear

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.690
from Tehuti's presentation
today how it is.

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.980
You cannot tell the story of
African Americans in this country

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.130
without telling the story
of Prince Hall freemasonry.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.280
So, thank you, again, for coming.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.510
The book is available outside,
and we hope you will come back!

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:17.050
[ Applause ]

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.940
&gt;&gt; Announcer: This has
been a presentation

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.920
of the Library of Congress.
