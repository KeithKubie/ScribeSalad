00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.720
Representation is a big issue across
television and film - who gets represented

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.740
and what that representation looks like
are two topics that are guaranteed to

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.000
start a Twitter fire.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.580
But what does representation of communities and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.789
characters that usually don't get the
spotlight look like beyond simply being

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.440
present in a story.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.120
Ramy is a new show on Hulu that follows a very particular Arab

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.449
American Muslim family as the main
character, this guy, tries to navigate his

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.320
faith and, well, his libido.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.820
I got to sit down with the creator and star of the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.530
show - Rami Youssef - to talk about what authentic

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.020
representation can look like.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.480
I do want to say two quick things one, I actually

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.220
don't watch "Game of Thrones"
even though probably everyone else does.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.120
I don't either.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.000
- You don't either?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.620
No.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.560
I just know.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.080
When you think about representation, like what does that word actually mean to you?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.700
I think it's really important to find a character

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.260
with a point of view and really live
with them and sit in their problems.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.070
I think showing them at their most
vulnerable, showing them at their weakest,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
showing them at their most flawed is the
most fun way to represent somebody

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460
because we all have those 
weaknesses, we all have those flaws.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.759
I feel like the Ramy character is designed for us to see our vulnerable selves. I don't really

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.600
believe in, you know, giving someone from
a certain culture three lines in one

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
scene and then saying 'You know, we did it. We covered it.' I believe in giving that

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.480
person an entire show, giving that person
an entire episode, giving that person, you

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.660
know, scope to be in a scene, in their
problems, without dialogue.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.820
So what is something that you really want the
various audiences that are watching this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.506
show? What do you want them to take away?

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.979
We did an early testing of this show

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
that opened up at the mosque. All the
people in testing thought the show is

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.060
about terrorism because it was in a
mosque, and people were speaking Arabic.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360
So this is the mindset that people are
entering. And I hope at the very least,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.140
we've created something that shows
people, people go to the mosque for a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.720
sense of community to solve their
problems, to see their friends, that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.500
people pray and say, "Allah Akbar," to find
comfort, to find direction,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.554
to find guidance and nothing more than that.

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:22.660
Then who does Ramy ultimately represent? How
accurate is it even to your own life?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.140
I mean I think right off the bat a lot of
the facts are different.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.950
He's not a standup comedian - that's probably the
only thing that helps my family stomach

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.320
watching the show is that they're like,
OK, at least it's clearly not us.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.290
I tried to imagine a family that was less
communicative than mine. I tried to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.320
imagine a character that didn't have a
creative outlet like I do.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.360
Someone that was a little more stuck and that was a
little more in their problems.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.620
There's been a lot chatter already on
Twitter. How do you respond to people who are reacting?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.240
You don't have to watch it
and I've never said that this would

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.030
represent you ... I mean, this
show is called "Ramy" you know, I think it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.250
offers something that hasn't been in pop
culture in this way. I don't think we've

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.213
seen a practicing Arab Muslim put that
on display.

00:03:05.213 --> 00:03:06.990
- And I do think a lot of this

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.540
show is algebraic in a sense. I think,
OK, we have a crazy uncle who says

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.989
sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic things.
And if you are in an Arab family, maybe

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.200
you have an uncle like that maybe you
don't. If you are in a Jewish family, you

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.980
have that uncle who maybe says all those
things about Muslims and Palestinians.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.580
If you are in a white family, you have that
uncle who says those things about Black people.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
I noticed how one of the cool
things about the show is that like it's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.200
very unapologetically Muslim as well,
right?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.540
- Yeah. 
It really normalizes Islamic

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.240
practice in a way that's 
not like a caricature.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.110
Well, I mean everyone wants you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.080
to have a good hummus recipe when they
find out you're Muslim they don't want

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.980
to hear you talk about Allah like that
that's a lot... But I think, you know,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.850
figuring out ways to talk about it is a
lot of what's behind the show, too.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.650
You know, how how can we, you know, be as
authentic as possible to, you know,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.514
wherever we're at.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:02.489
- It seems like all the
female characters in some way or another

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.489
kind of defined by their like proximity
to sex. And so I'm curious as to whether

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.380
we're gonna see more female character
development as the show goes on.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.960
I want more nuance for the women in the show.
Absolutely. This show is called "Ramy."

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.640
To already get two episodes that I'm not
even in, in the first season of a show

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.730
that is based on my stand-up 
was like a huge

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.230
coup with the network. I
think that we talk about sex a lot in

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.980
the show. Sex is also a big part of the
Muslim world but we're acting like it's

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.340
not part of our daily lives.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.570
How do you respond to the idea that any

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.620
representation of a community becomes
representation of all, whether it's from

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.530
that community itself, so Muslims may be
watching this show and thinking like, "Oh

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.040
my God, is this supposed to represent all
of us?" How do you respond to something like that?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.980
I feel for people who want to
see themselves on screen. We don't have a lot of stories.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.340
At the same time, I think
that to try and do it all is really

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.240
damaging. And I think what we do too is
we hurt our creators because when

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.550
something comes out and all that happens
is like an onslaught of shooting it down,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.590
there is the Black Muslim creator who's
now a little afraid of taking a risk on

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.050
their show.
There is the South Asian creator who's a

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.500
little bit afraid. There is the woman
who's a little bit afraid because

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.620
there's no way to cut it where people
aren't going to be upset.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.620
- So where does "Ramy" go from here?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.740
- I think he continues to
expand. I think he I think he starts to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.110
realize his hypocrisies in a deeper way.
I think I want to see him realize the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.710
way his actions are affecting other
people in his life a little bit more. And

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.360
also as a show, I really want to dive
into more nuances of the people who are

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.200
around him.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.260
If there's anything you want
to say to our audience right into the camera.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.520
Oh, no, I I've never wanted to do anything

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.940
to camera ever.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.440
Really?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.280
Dead serious. Yeah. It freaks me out.
