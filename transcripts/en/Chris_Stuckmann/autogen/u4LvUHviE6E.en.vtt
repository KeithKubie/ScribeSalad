hard for a developer to allow you to

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909
hard for a developer to allow you to
 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.490
hard for a developer to allow you to
invert your controls this game allows

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500

but not left and right it doesn't make

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
but not left and right it doesn't make
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.580
but not left and right it doesn't make
sense to me that's just a little nitpick

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
