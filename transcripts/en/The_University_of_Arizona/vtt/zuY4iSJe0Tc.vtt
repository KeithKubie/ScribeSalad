00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.950
So if you ever come
across a cicada nymph,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.030
you'll notice that their front
legs are modified for digging.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.760
That's because a cicada
nymph lives underground.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.340
They feed off the roots
of plants underground,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160
and while underground,
they develop

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.050
and dig chambers and
tunnels underground

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.650
so they can go from roots
to root for feeding.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.040
And it's possible, if you're
digging underground sometimes,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.980
you might be able to come
across a chamber or a tunnel

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.930
that the cicada nymph has made.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.910
And this is just
one example of what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.250
that could look like
whenever you come across it.
