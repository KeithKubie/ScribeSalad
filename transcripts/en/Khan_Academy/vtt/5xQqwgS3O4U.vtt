00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.180
Everything we've been
doing so far has

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.830
involved systems of equations.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
In this video, we're going to
tackle the problem of systems

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.100
of linear inequalities.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.480
What we're going to do is,
essentially, figure out all of

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.960
the points on the xy plane
that satisfy a system of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.240
linear inequalities.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
So let's start with our first
linear inequality.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.600
Let's say we have 2x minus 3y
is less than or equal to 21.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.060
And we've seen how to
graph this before.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.600
You can just graph this line,
and then figure out what the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.180
less than part means.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.610
So let's just rearrange this
into slope-intercept form.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:56.810
So if you subtract 2x from both
sides, we get negative

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.090
3y-- these cancel out
--is less than or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.850
equal to 21 minus 2x.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.010
Or we could say negative
2x plus 21.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.410
And then we can divide both
sides by negative 3.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.330
And remember, when you divide
by a negative number, or you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.180
multiply by a negative number,
you swap the inequality.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.430
So you get negative 3y over
negative 3 is greater than or

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.500
equal to negative 2 over
negative 3x plus 21 over

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.680
negative 3.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.080
And so this equation becomes y
is greater than or equal to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.420
2/3 x minus 7.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.150
So that's the first inequality
right there.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.430
And let's graph it.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.700
I'll graph it in orange.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.270
y-intercept is negative 7,
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.660
And it's slope is
positive 2/3.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.325
So when you run 3,
you go up 2.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.970
When you run 3, you go up 2.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.320
And in this direction, if you
go back 3, you go down 2, so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.390
the line will look something
like this.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.550
The line will look like that.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.820
Keep going.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.450
And since we have y is greater
than, or equal to,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.900
essentially, this line, the
area that satisfies this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.990
inequality is going to
be above the line.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.290
At any point, for any x
you pick, this is the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.240
value 2/3 x minus 7.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.395
So if y is going to be greater
than that, it'll be all the

00:02:38.395 --> 00:02:39.920
points above that.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.560
So just this constraint right
here, y is greater than 2/3 x

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.020
minus 7, or this constraint,
which is the same thing, 2x

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.220
minus 3y is less than or equal
to 21, will give you all of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.410
this area up here.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.400
I don't want to draw it
too dark just yet.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.150
So it'll give you all
of this area all the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.950
way above this line.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.860
Now let's add another inequality
to the mix.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.840
Let me do that other
inequality in blue.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.210
Let's say I have x plus 4y.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.770
Let's make it less than 6.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.730
The problem I have written here,
has less than or equal

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.820
to, but I want to mix it up
with an equal sign and a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.590
couple of them without
an equal sign.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.590
Just so we remember how
to graph these things.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.970
And so let's put this again into
slope-intercept form, so

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.490
we can subtract x
from both sides.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.280
Then the left-hand side
just becomes 4y.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.930
The right-hand side becomes
a negative x plus 6.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.865
And then we can divide
both sides by 4.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.350
And we get y is less than
negative 1/4 x plus 6.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.960
So just like the
first equation,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.940
let's graph the line.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.910
The y-intercept is positive 6.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.670
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.320
And then the slope is
a negative 1/4.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.550
So every time we run by
4, 1, 2, 3, 4, we're

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.360
going to go down 1.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.590
So you run by 4, 1, 2,
3, 4, you go down 1.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.620
You run by 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, you're
going to go down 1.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.519
So this line is actually
going off the table.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.090
To go back by 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,
you're going to go up by 1.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.366
And since we're not actually
including the line, we're

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.200
going to have to draw
a dotted line here.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.580
This is going to be
a dotted line.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.110
Try my best to draw
a dotted line.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.040
And actually, let me continue
that previous line there

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.190
because I actually want show
where they intersect.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.280
Goes a little bit off
of our graph paper.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.270
But the graph of this equation
is that right.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.700
I did a dotted line because it's
not less than or equal

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.510
to, it's just less than.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.440
So this inequality, if I were to
graph it, would be the area

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:59.790
below the line right there.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.110
That's what satisfies
this inequality.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.840
For any x, this is the
value of that line.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.430
But the y's that satisfy
it are the y's that

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.210
are below the line.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.810
Now if I were to ask you, if I
were to have a system, where I

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.465
have 2x minus 3y is less
than, or equal to 21.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:22.180
These aren't equations.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.690
These are inequalities,
they're not

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.050
equal to each other.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.270
The other one is x plus
4y is less than 6.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.440
And if I were to ask you what
x's and y's satisfy both of

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.450
these any inequalities, well you
say, it's just going to be

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.000
the overlap of their solution
sets, right?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.690
It's going to be the area in
the xy plane that satisfies

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.330
both of them.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.100
So in this case, it'll
be the part that's

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.430
above the orange line.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.250
Remember I shaded that in
orange right there.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.420
So all of this above the orange
line, and the part

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.260
that's below the blue line,
and the part that overlaps

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.320
that satisfies them both of
these-- I'll do it in yellow

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.160
--the part that satisfies both
of these is right in between

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.590
the lines there.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.260
Now what if, just for fun, we
were to add a third equation.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.720
Let's add a third equation
in green.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.270
3x plus y is greater than
or equal to negative 4.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.550
Well, it's the same drill.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.290
We put this in the
slope-intercept form.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.430
So you get y is greater
than or equal to

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.910
negative 3x minus 4.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.090
I just subtracted 3x
from both sides.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.350
We can graph this line.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.430
It's y-intercept is 1,
2, 3, negative 4.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.860
And it has a slope
of negative 3.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.450
So every time you go one to
the right, you go down 3.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.800
1, 2, 3.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.500
If you go one to the left, if
you go negative 1 in the

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.860
x-direction, you go up 3.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.370
So you go negative 1, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.690
Negative 1, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.170
Negative 1, 1, 2, 3.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.820
So this line right there's
going to look like this.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.840
It's going to look like that.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.520
Trying my best to draw it.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.300
That's that right there.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.010
And I can have it in bold.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.850
I don't have to do a dotted line
because I have a greater

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.450
than or equal to and so what
are all the y's that are

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.330
greater than this line?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.540
Well, for any x value you pick,
the value of negative 3x

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.420
minus 4 is going to be this.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.970
And we care about the y values
that are greater than that, so

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.090
it'll be above the line.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.160
So for just this inequality
it'll be

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.630
everything above the line.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.540
And then if someone were to come
along and say, all right

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.350
, tell me, show me, graph me,
all of the points on the xy

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.660
plane that satisfy this system
of inequalities.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.850
What would you tell them?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.500
Well, it would be the overlap
of their solution sets?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.210
So the part of the xy plane that
exists in all of their

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.850
solutions, so what's above
the orange line, right?

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.390
We have to be above the
orange line, right?

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.490
And we graphed that before.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.370
It was all in orange before,
because we're above the line

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.600
to 2/3x minus 7.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.660
It might trick you a
little bit because

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.550
there's a less than here.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.962
But when you put it in the
slope-intercept form, you have

00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:11.720
a greater than.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.710
So it's everything above this
line, which is all of that

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.530
over there.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.650
Everything below this line--
below the blue line and not

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.510
including the blue line
--and everything

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.520
above the green line.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:31.610
So it's going to be this area
right over here, is the

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.340
solution set.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.640
And we're going to include this
boundary right here, and

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.960
we're going to include that
boundary right there.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.169
And since I engineered the
problem to have a less than

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.580
there, not a less than or equal
to, up here is going to

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.190
be a dotted line.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.130
Because you're not actually
going to include that line.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.870
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
