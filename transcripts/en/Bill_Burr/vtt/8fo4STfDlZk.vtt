Hey, what's going on?

00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.930
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

I'm screaming loud enough RNA. You know people when you're not talented,

9
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:36.310
what you have to do is yell. If you don't believe that,

10
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:40.240

11
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:41.950
I don't know how many special I've done.

12
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:45.040
You know when you talk in the amount of Shit I do,

13
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.370
why can't I hear myself the way I want to hear myself?

14
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:52.880
Why can I hear me the way I used to? Who am I going deaf?

15
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.590
Is that what's going on? How's that? Is that too much? Hello? Hello? Test one,

18
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:06.100
I have an around some sort of fucking parental mode,

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.251
you know,

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:13.251
hearing laws is one of the number one causes of hearing loss in 2017 because

21
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.890
these ear buds that are all the rage with the children. Um,

22
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.030
I actually had time today to go over and go play drums today and I put on a

23
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.470
fucking add clinic. Jesus Christ.

24
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.150
I like practice. 9,000 things got better at nothing. That's how I practice. Hey,

25
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.240
let's do double bass for two minutes. Hey, let's work on singles and doubles.

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.240
Okay? Hey, let's do the jazz ride pan. Hey,

27
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.160
let's fucking do some bottom triplets. Alright. Just kept going and going.

28
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.710
But you know what I, I didn't sound that bad. I had a good time.

29
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.000
I fucking love that kid though. I had the small set up letter.

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.470
You guys gave me shit cause I had fucking three floor toms.

31
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.720
Like would you do it with boy? You fucker. You fucking toupee.

32
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.480
I don't own it. A toupee. All right.

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.440
You can't own it to pay it. Just it, you know what I mean? I've though,

34
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.650
I bet they make them really good right now, but I just,

35
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.480
it would just be like wearing this fucking hat. You could never take off.

36
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.610
You know, you wake up in the morning and you got your little roller, you know,

37
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:18.550
with the glue, you know, and you just fucking go on over your scalp,

38
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.780
you know you're doing that and your wife comes walking in. I mean, Jesus Christ,

39
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.000
I mean, she's going to be banging another guy within three days.

40
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.050
If your fucking woman walks in while you're glue in hair to the top of your

41
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:32.730
head, all right, and she doesn't leave you. That woman is a sane,

42
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.173
you know what I mean?

43
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.090
I love the guys who have like the fucking the to pay and then they can't even

44
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:44.620
get like the, the, like the, the sides to match it.

45
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.510
You know what I mean? It's like, dude, are you fucking colorblind?

46
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.940
Do you really think that, that, that's blending into what you got on the sides.

47
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.570
You know what's funny too is when you go down the to pay road, um,

48
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.560
they don't, I, I don't, as far as I know, they don't make any white ones.

49
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.480
Like if you're an older guy, so then you gotta Dye the shit you got on the side.

50
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.661
<v 0>Right.</v>

52
00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:12.290
So then it just makes people look at your head like you just like this guy's

53
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:16.640
like 60. How does he have jet black cow. Good Lord. Look at that fucking thing.

54
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.670
JJ. Um,

55
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.810
you know I don't like about toupees actually hair plugs now is they're too good

56
00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:26.330
now. Used to be, it used to be able to tell

57
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.260
and you could really fuck somebody up in conversation y'all need to do,

58
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.530
I didn't give a fuck how smart they were led to do is just kind of look up at it

59
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:39.740
and then look back at 'em and then they would just fucked for the rest of the

60
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:44.741
conversation and those days are gone now because they got too God damn good at

61
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:49.730
it. Um, so anyways, I was playing, you know,

62
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.160
playing all the drums shit. Nah At this point,

63
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.810
cause my drum teacher is out on the road. I haven't been taking any lessons,

64
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.060
you know, drum teacher Davey Lich out with the night game. Um,

65
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.710
opening for a Dave. No, not, I was a Dave Matthews. No,

66
00:04:06.711 --> 00:04:11.180
John Mayer opening for John Mayer was Steve Jordan on drums.

67
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:12.320
Jesus Christ.

68
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.330
<v 0>You get to see Davey Lich and then you get to see Steve Jordan. How about that?</v>

70
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.880
Hey, there is a fucking evening for you. You know,

71
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.770
that'd be enough for your Goddamn millennials. Um, yeah,

72
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:28.220
so I haven't been taking lessons, but uh, so I just,

73
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.520
it's actually kind of been a good thing because I can go back to all this shit

74
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:36.521
that I never fucking got down that he showed me a while developing new bad

75
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:41.360
habits. But I know I'm kidding. Anyways, I'm having a great time.

76
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.580
So people give me shit cause I got the three floor toms,

77
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:47.900
but this is why I did it. This was the method to my madness. All right.

78
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:52.820
I got 12 inch rack, then I got a 14, 16, 18 floor Tom. So, and then at 22 kick.

79
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.680
Right. So, um, I hate having to rack toms,

80
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.770
but I ended up ordering another one. So I've got a 12. I got 13 comments.

81
00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:05.210
So now I can go big. A small people. Biggest smile I give you. They got 12, 14,

82
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:09.470
16 or 13, 16, 18, depending on whatever the fucking,

83
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760
whatever song I'm going to go butcher on the goddamn comedy jam. All right.

84
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.250
Why can't I just have a hobby without people criticizing it?

85
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:23.870
Why can't people just say, Hey, nice drum kit that Da da.

86
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.590
What do you got to dirt fucking floor talk four. I go to stickiness. Jesus.

87
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.120
I Dunno does,

88
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.810
I'm trying to get out of the fucking the bottom, uh,

89
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.130
death spin. I went on for fucking 30 years. I'm just trying a different set up.

90
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:44.300
That's all I was doing. Got More God damn shit for that. Uh,

91
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.870
that and saying nuclear instead of new clear. You know,

92
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.870
I love the word police, you know what I mean? It's just like,

93
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:56.460
where are you gonna get in life with that? You know, it's not new killer.

94
00:05:56.461 --> 00:06:01.340
It's new. I've always said no killer always said it.

95
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.500
It sounds right to me. Rolls off the tongue a little bit easy then. New Clear.

96
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.450
It's a nuclear weapon. Not Nuclear. Laughing my ass off. Let me ask you this.

97
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.070
Where are you laughing your ass off. Where exactly are you in your fucking life?

98
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.640
Cause it's dumb as I am. I'm doing all right. You know,

99
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.560
is there, is there a fucking job that you can do where you dot all your i's,

100
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.380
crossed all your t's and correct spelling. Are you going to be like,

101
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.390
I guess a teacher? Is that what it is?

102
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.000
Do I have a bunch of teachers following me on Twitter?

103
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.860
I don't know why they wouldn't, you know, good Lord,

104
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.240
these fucking people that are always like, there's so much shit.

105
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.470
I used to say Palo instead of pillow. Get the pals off the fucking tee.

106
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.410
I mean I've, I've, you know, this is shit you just saying a different way.

107
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.110
Cause does that mean you don't know what the fuck you put your head on at night?

108
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.200

110
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.303

116

She can do the New York Times crossword puzzle. Great. Fantastic.

117
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.730
Where does that get you?

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.220
<v 0>What does that get you in life? I mean, I don't know.</v>

120
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:35.430
I mean, tell me, tell me how that's holding me back. That's what I want to know.

121
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.730
And I know I'm kind of harping on this, but this is like the 900 words.

122
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:42.030
You guys have fucking correct me on it. I don't give a shit. I like new killer.

123
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.200
Sounds like it's more fucking like the missiles spinning a little bit more

124
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.720
nuclear like new, clear. Keep it clear. Here it comes nuclear. It's like, whoa.

125
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.300
It's a little shoulder roll in there. New Killer. I like it.

126
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.680
I'm keeping it fuck off. Um, you know,

127
00:07:58.681 --> 00:08:02.250
do you guys like right fucking JZ every time he says Ho and you're like,

128
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.180
I actually, it's whore laughing my ass off.

129
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.520
I bet you don't. Right? Cause you're liberals, you know,

130
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:14.370
but you fucking white male fucks up. And what do you do?

131
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.580
You hold my fucking alabaster feet to the fire, don't you?

132
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.510
I've had a little bit and I've had enough of it. All right.

133
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.660
I've had enough of people trying to make me not sell.

134
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.600
Like I'm ashamed of how stupid I am. I'm not. Okay.

135
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.560
I saw the carrot man and I walked towards it.

136
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.140
I knew what I was good at.

137
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.250
I knew being a loud mouth fucking moron was what I was good at.

138
00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:43.020
And I just did that. Okay.

139
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.860
I'm not going to ever be in a classroom teaching people how to spell or

140
00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:51.120
pronounce shit. Okay? So let it go. The ship has sailed.

141
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.270
There's no hope for me. All right?

142
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.810
But you know the drill is the real reason people did not do when it for me.

143
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.100
They're doing it for them to show how smart they are.

144
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160
Oh, it's not tordal.

145
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:10.020
It's turtle laughing my ass off. I know how to say that.

146
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.420
Fucking even fib Ian's name. Oh, bit. Actually it's not. Even if we stop it,

147
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.820
it's not an amphibian. And in Phoebe, in his humility, shut the fuck up.

148
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.680
You want this? What are those people? Are they practicing to be on a game show?

149
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.783
Is that what it is?

150
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.860
<v 0>That's like the smart way a person plays the lottery, I guess. Right?</v>

152
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.530
The lottery. You just can be a dope like me going dough.

153
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.090
Do you see that nuclear weapon?

154
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.060
And then you go and let me get a fucking set for life. Right.

155
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.130
That's how I try to make it. Okay. The smarty pants who can do the fucking,

156
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.070
who can actually do the New York Times crossword puzzle is now, you know,

157
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.580
try to get on like wheel of fortune. Cause you know,

158
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:55.620
that's like the fucking dumbest crossword.

159
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.400
You can do whatever the fuck it is that a crossword? No, it isn't. Right?

160
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.070
It's like, yes, the letters that looks like a crossword, but it is.

161
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:05.340
But I just love that you could be smart enough to do the New York Times

162
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.300
crossword puzzle and then still you're going to get on there, right.

163
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.800
And you've got to spin a whale

164
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.350
and spinning that wheel. There's no intelligence. You just spin it right?

165
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.270
You can be the smartest person on the world and you're going to roll,

166
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:22.104
lose a turn,

167
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.520
<v 2>well bankrupt and it's fucking over.</v>

168
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.620
<v 0>Um, I like watching jeopardy when, uh, you know, there's somebody just,</v>

169
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:35.940
you just can't defeat this guy and all these other smarty pants get on there and

170
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:39.720
their whole life, they were the fucking smartest one, you know?

171
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.590
You know those people that don't like drink and they like,

172
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:47.550
they play board games. Like let's play trivial pursuit, you know what I mean?

173
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.390
Let's, let's play whatever those fucking games I got to tell you. Um,

174
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.820
<v 1>okay.</v>

175
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.380
<v 0>Some of the saddest moments in my adult life as I've gone to parties and all of</v>

176
00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:59.120
a sudden they break out board games

177
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.150
<v 1>and [inaudible]</v>

178
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.980
<v 0>you ever see like when somebody is on hidden video and they start looking around</v>

179
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:07.690
like what the fuck? And the crowd starts laughing.

180
00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:11.440
Like that's the look on my face. Like, yeah, then they're not going to do this.

181
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.520
They're not doing this other, does everybody have to play? Like,

182
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.170
I don't want to do this. I don't want to fuck with you.

183
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:20.900
One of my five years old, you know,

184
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:25.490
we trapped in a fucking cabin and then there's no television. No,

185
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:29.630
this is great. You can connect with you. I'll play some cards. You know,

186
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:31.730
I like how cards is like they want to go a cards.

187
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:36.731
It's just like there's a Sleazy v Vibe to cards that I've always enjoyed,

188
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.030
even though I don't play a lot of cards. But you know,

189
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.070
even like those fucking old ladies seen some old lady with their bony fingers

190
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:45.470
fucking shuffling, not even look and talking some shit.

191
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.260
She's got a favorite little candies right to the right. You know,

192
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.900
in a dish I'll, you know,

193
00:11:50.901 --> 00:11:55.850
I saw an old schooled old lady today. I was in a,

194
00:11:55.851 --> 00:12:00.010
I was down at the grocery store buying some fucking food, right?

195
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.331
And A,

196
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:06.070
this lady comes around the corner she had on like this Turquoise Blazer.

197
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.390
We'd like some sort of broach, I forget what she had underneath it.

198
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.200
She had white slacks on, white shoes and a white parse,

199
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.160
just old school dress to the fucking nights. She looked great.

200
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.110
Total fucking class act

201
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.170
made me miss my grandmother. My grandmother was a sharp dresser. They,

202
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.470
oh they, those people, they knew how to fucking dress, you know what I mean?

203
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:32.520
And then they did buy a pair of shoes and God damn it, they talk caravan,

204
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.240
not like us today, you know.

205
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.943
<v 2>Well,</v>

206
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.730
<v 0>every black person I knew, they always took care of their fucking sneakers.</v>

207
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:44.790
You know what I mean? Keep the fucking things. Look brand new, you know,

208
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.290
taken out a God damn, you know, in the nail brush scrubbing the sides. Right.

209
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.930
It was another white privilege moment, right.

210
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.550
How you could just dab dirty sneakers and that was okay. What man?

211
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.500
I went outside and they got dirty man. He keep watching. I mean he just,

212
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.300
he's always going to eat dirt out here, man.

213
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.550
I remember when a Patrice just give me shit for my sneakers being dirty.

214
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:09.210
I was just like, wait a fucking beauty pageant.

215
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.350
These like pill. If you were black and you walked out, I'm like, I'm not black.

216
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.950
This is totally socially acceptable for me. I get it.

217
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.330
You have new sneakers on. Congratulations. Um,

218
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.570
anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

219
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:29.850
I'm doing this this Sunday night cause there's always,

220
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:34.650
I have a million things to do, uh, during this time of year as we're writing.

221
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.700
Um, season three, three, three, I've episode family, family, family. Um,

222
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.420
we're going to be recording episode three and writing episode four this week.

223
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.160
Big Shit going. We're almost at the clubhouse turn here now.

224
00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:51.960
It's actually the guy coming down the back stretch.

225
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.211
<v 0>You know,</v>

227
00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:58.770
I think we'll have five written and recorded by the end of this this month.

228
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.840
And I know what you guys are thinking. So what does that mean?

229
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.080
It comes out in December. Oh No, no,

230
00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:08.280
there's like 40 different other things you have to do to it over the course of

231
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:11.100
the next, I don't know how many months before it finally fucking comes out.

232
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:11.934
I have no idea.

233
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

234
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.790
<v 0>We were joking one time. I think by the time we do the sixth season,</v>

235
00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:20.500
I'll be in my late sixties. Uh,

236
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.080
but I have to tell you, I really fucking like it.

237
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:26.360
I really liked doing it and um,

238
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.870
I really enjoyed being in the writer's room. You know,

239
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.090
some days it sucks when like just this shit just isn't working and my brain

240
00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:37.970
isn't working and I'm fried. Some of those days suck. But generally, but then,

241
00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:42.800
you know, then everybody else is saying funny shit. So that makes you get going,

242
00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:46.250
you know? But I actually really, uh, enjoy writing dialogue.

243
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.900
Who would've thought, you know, in a way I could, you know,

244
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.840
some guy who says can actually write a fucking episode of television.

245
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.280
You know, just think about that. Okay. Think about,

246
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.200
think about that and then stop complaining about who's president right now.

247
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.710
Okay. If you can say nuclear and then you can fuck, I mean, George Bush,

248
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:07.544
you say nuclear,

249
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.600
the amount of people that fucking laughed at him and I want to be like, Hey,

250
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.000
are you bilingual? Can you also speak Spanish?

251
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.593
<v 2>Huh?</v>

252
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.710
<v 0>Did you go to Yale? The guy went to fucking Yale. All right.</v>

253
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.580
I don't give a shit of his dad got him in a what? He's a legacy.

254
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.460
He still went there. He's still got that education.

255
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.270
Still gotta be a member of the skull and bones.

256
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.160
I think that's why he had that last, he said,

257
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.250
cause he knew he didn't belong there anyway. He feeds us,

258
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:37.160
got pushed down that fucking road, you know.

259
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.970
What do you think he really wanted to do?

260
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.650
I think like what you do after your pres,

261
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.740
after your president really lets people know how much you love the job.

262
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.930
You know what I mean? And like he just fucking Disabil Clinton, he's still,

263
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.530
you know, Bill Clinton was all about the horse, you know, so he's still,

264
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:01.490
he's still out there giving speeches. Ah, I know that. And I was fucking tense.

265
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:04.490
Right. He's still out there. You know,

266
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.070
Jimmy Carter is building fucking homes, you know, and then he got fucking, uh,

267
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.030
George Bush. He's just, he's fucking hanging out like a trust fund kid.

268
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.080
He just sit around. Peyton, do you ever see that documentary rich kids?

269
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.430
Like one of the saddest fucking things I've ever seen in my life was

270
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.693
<v 2>like</v>

271
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.970
<v 0>these people, they were born into such wealth.</v>

272
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.380
Like one of them was, they were part of the Johnson and Johnson family,

273
00:16:34.381 --> 00:16:36.000
which I think a lot of people don't know what that is.

274
00:16:36.001 --> 00:16:38.610
But like when I was growing up, everything was made by Johnson and Johnson.

275
00:16:38.611 --> 00:16:41.040
I'm sure they got bought out, whatever. But when,

276
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.623
<v 2>um,</v>

277
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.620
<v 0>I guess when they bought that out, Johnson and Johnson,</v>

278
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:50.670
they built it in that their kids would always just be taken care of and would

279
00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:53.790
have a, I don't know, a position. The competition, they were just getting money.

280
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.850
It's this fucking beast that Johnson and Johnson built just it,

281
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:02.160
the inertia of that fucking thing,

282
00:17:02.161 --> 00:17:06.390
just tearing through the capitalist economy right.

283
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.840
Was just so big that they just, they just like, if they get the Skimm,

284
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.090
remember fucking casino, the Skim,

285
00:17:12.091 --> 00:17:15.030
the kids still get the skim and the fucking skim alone.

286
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.840
They get a little fucking duffle bag of cash that they don't ever have to work

287
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:23.820
in their life. Right. And I, you would think that, that'd be, dude,

288
00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:25.680
that would be the fucking greatest thing ever.

289
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.350
That would be the greatest thing ever. And um,

290
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.590
it kind of turned out that it wasn't,

291
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.890
I think it would be the greatest thing ever if you actually a live the other way

292
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:42.110
first. But even then, I think, I think it'll get boring after a while.

293
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:43.220
Do you think you could do it?

294
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.380
I think if you just had enough money where you never had to work again, my

295
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.630
thought would be, well, the next big thing in my life is I'm going to die.

296
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.700
That's an the next eventful thing. I have no deadlines.

297
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.380
I have no worries.

298
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.210
Oh Man. My F I would get like psycho obsessed with shit,

299
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.850
you know, like I do already. But I then like my real life takes over.

300
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.080
They don't fucking play dumb shit. Oh,

301
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.320
they'd run fucking hours and I find blame all fucking time.

302
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:19.900
And then like my real life to a,

303
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.250
you got to go into the writer's room and then it eases it off.

304
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:24.020
Like if I just fucking was sitting there,

305
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.160
like when I was talking to you guys about that building in Manhattan,

306
00:18:28.161 --> 00:18:32.330
the one that looks like a giant cigarette, um, something park avenue.

307
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.381
And I was like,

308
00:18:33.381 --> 00:18:36.530
what the fuck is that thing that thing's bigger than the Freedom Tower?

309
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.150
And, uh, I went back and I looked at those pictures that they have from the,

310
00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:46.151
the penthouse in that building and that bath tub you had backed up everybody has

311
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:50.280
now, which it's shaped like a, like the fuck in Chicago Bears Stadium,

312
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.140
you know that one, that freestanding one is not on legs. Like it's, it's big.

313
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:57.090
The ladies love it evidently. Right.

314
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.900
And it's right up on the fucking window and you can just look out all the way

315
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.970
south of Manhattan past the Statue of Liberty to see the fucking, you know,

316
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.330
whenever the Germans come to attack us against the, you know,

317
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.430
this person in the fucking top is going to see at first, right. The Japanese,

318
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.280
I should say, I just figured that side of the country, you know,

319
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.320
the Germans would be coming right with their nuclear weapons

320
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.460
actually. Why would you bring it over here?

321
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.420
You just fucking shoot it off when you, um, anyway, so I was just looking at it.

322
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:35.880
I was just trying to imagine sitting in that tub,

323
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:40.790
taking a bath that that would be one of the saddest experiences you could,

324
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.940
you could possibly have.

325
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.360
It looks so fucking lonely. First one I saw, I was like, Holy Shit,

326
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:53.040
that's fucking unbelievable. That looks like, I feel like I'm in a helicopter,

327
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.720
but you're like in a, in a fucking building.

328
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.130
But then just being that high up, you can't even hear the city anymore.

329
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.170
Just how quiet it would be. You know, you literally,

330
00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.630
you're getting to that love, that thing that astronaut.

331
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.900
See you're like to astronauts.

332
00:20:10.901 --> 00:20:14.480
They would go out and they would orbit the earth and they would just look down

333
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:19.250
at it and they will above all the bullshit, all the politics,

334
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:23.690
all the religion, all the fucking war, all the disease, all the suffering.

335
00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:28.691
And they looked down and they were able to see how beautiful it was.

336
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.160
The paradise that we actually live in.

337
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.900
We just sit here with all this petty shit and like these guys would come back

338
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.940
and they couldn't talk to anybody about it.

339
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.870
Couldn't give anybody else that perspective unless they talked to a fellow

340
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.450
astronauts. So then they would just be, you know,

341
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:46.700
pulling up to a stoplight and they would see something.

342
00:20:46.701 --> 00:20:48.250
They would just randomly start crying.

343
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.390
I think that would happen if I took a bath that high above Fuckin Manhattan.

344
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.880
<v 0>And you just looking out August man. Why Kid? Why cousin?</v>

346
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.513
<v 1>Great.</v>

347
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.250
<v 0>Why don't we ever do the right DB philosophically just stay.</v>

348
00:21:07.251 --> 00:21:09.850
Why don't we do the right thing? Why are we always like, you can't, that's,

349
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.270
that's the, that's the scary thing.

350
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.100
That's why all pilots are a little fucking weird.

351
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.030
There's something weird about going up there and just looking down at all of it,

352
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.030
you know, like a higher being.

353
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.940
Then you also get to see what the fuck would do to the planet.

354
00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:30.470
It's a really fucking, it's a weird thing. Um,

355
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.930
and then you combine that with the fact that you've taken a bath.

356
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.100
One of the most relaxing thing ever. Just looking down at this fucking terror.

357
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.900
I Dunno. I also kind of wonder like with global warming,

358
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:45.780
like what's going to happen, you know?

359
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.680
<v 0>I'm sorry. Climate Change. I didn't mean to shock you by saying global warming.</v>

361
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:52.960
I hope I didn't ruin your day with those two fucking words.

362
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:55.600
Let me say climate change so you can fucking relax a little bit.

363
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.630
Still don't understand why they say that climate change.

364
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.720
It's like when Halliburton changed its fucking name, right?

365
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.670
Well they changed it to peaches and cream. I can't fucking remember anyways. Um,

366
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.210
I was just thinking that like the more like severe the weather's going to get.

367
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.720
Like what will that mean? You know,

368
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.440
like we can expect some crazy storms we've never fucking seen before.

369
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:24.550
I wonder if they took that into consideration when they built that goddamn thing

370
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:31.260
that all of a sudden, you know, yeah, we're going to start getting like,

371
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.070
like steroid era Mark McGuire era fucking,

372
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.060
you know, hurricanes.

373
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.121
<v 0>You know,</v>

375
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:44.320
and this is going to be a category 19 and you're up there taking a fucking bath.

376
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

377
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.070
<v 0>Watching this shit rolling in.</v>

378
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.540
You're going to go right out that fucking window in that tub

379
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.140
all the way down to the fucking pavement.

380
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.120
But what a way to go that porsan thing. It'd be like the cartoons.

381
00:23:00.121 --> 00:23:03.060
We try to get the bathwater back into the fucking tub.

382
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.190
It will be a hell of a death. I honestly think if there is a god, you know,

383
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.080
he would fucking take extra time.

384
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.840
He would take extra time with you just being like, ah,

385
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.770
like just watching the game, film your death going

386
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.410
I a just being like, you know, I've seen people die for since the beginning.

387
00:23:21.411 --> 00:23:26.150
Man, I this, this, this is, this is one is this is definitely,

388
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.280
I'd never seen this one before.

389
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.550
I never seen somebody in a bathtub at 1,350 feet.

390
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.003
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

391
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.500
<v 0>I dunno. I Dunno why I'm obsessed with that fucking building. It's just,</v>

392
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.100
I dunno, there was just something about it.

393
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.880
And then the fact that they can't sell the one underneath that is the funniest

394
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:49.370
shit ever because who the fuck is gonna pay $85 million and still have somebody

395
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.250
living above and below you? You fucking knock it off up there.

396
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.090
What am I paying for you? Um, anyways,

397
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.530
how about those red socks? Huh? How bout those red socks?

398
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:05.990
But you know something, they want fame. They, they're undefeated.

399
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.860
They went five in a row undefeated this month. All right. And I went on the,

400
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:13.460
I went on the old Internet there, right. And, um,

401
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.930
I see, I looked up the standings, the baseball standings yet that, that,

402
00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:24.560
that would [inaudible] baseball one right this weekend, baseball duty duty

403
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:30.030
<v 1>due to the [inaudible] Dah, Dah,</v>

404
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.170
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. But I do to do today

405
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.403
<v 0>[inaudible] to do,</v>

406
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.930
if you saw the highlights and actually heard an orchestra playing one,

407
00:24:36.931 --> 00:24:39.810
I just played it or tried to sync, it'd be tremendous.

408
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:45.530
So [inaudible] the Houston Astros evidently are the other beasts of the American

409
00:24:47.311 --> 00:24:49.290
league. Um,

410
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.080
I was all excited that we swept a white sox and just realized that [inaudible]

411
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.310
41 in 68, I guess that's not such a big deal,

412
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.780
but we did what we were supposed to do. We kicked the shit out of a man.

413
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.960
We want sex in a row, gone eight and two last 10 picked up three games on them.

414
00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:10.140
Fucking Yankees. You see fucking Aaron judge 35th home run today

415
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:16.170
at the same trajectory as a base hit except for one out of the park telling you

416
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.740
it's like fucking Paul Bunyan coming to the goddamn plate.

417
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.720
I'm loving the Indians in first place. That'd be great to see them win. One.

418
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.710
Let's test my knowledge. All right. Red Sox. Last world series, 2013 Yankees,

419
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:34.310
2009 Tampa Bay. Never sit down.

420
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.370
Shut the fuck up. Baltimore Orioles. 1983 okay.

421
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.840

422
00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:47.350
1948 Kansas City royal

423

<v 4>warranty.</v>

424
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:54.060
<v 0>15 last year. It was a cubs, right? Minnesota twins.</v>

425
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.080
Uh, 1991.

426
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.080
Detroit, 1984. Chicago White Sox, 2005 Houston Astros.

427
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.410
Never say shut the fuck up.

428
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.510
Seattle mariners never sit down. Shut the fuck.

429
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.260
So childless Los Angeles angels.

430
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.100
2002 Texas Rangers. You know what? Never sit down.

431
00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:23.671
Shut up.

432
00:26:23.671 --> 00:26:28.450
Bug Up Oakland 89 okay.

433
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.150
Washington centers never sit down. Shut the fuck up. Miami Marlins,

434
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.950
was it 2003 Atlanta Braves is 95 New York mets.

435
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.270
Every red sox fan knows that's 1986. Philadelphia Phillies,

436
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:46.860
2008 2016 Milwaukee brewers never sit down and shut the fuck up.

437

Never Arizona Diamondbacks. 2001.

443
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.590
The one time I ever rooted for the Yankees cause it was right after nine 11.

444

450
00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:37.300

one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

454
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.850
I was talking to someone about that the other day when somebody got a doorbell

455
00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:54.770
like that, when I had a paper route when I was a kid,

456
00:27:54.771 --> 00:27:57.980

457
00:27:57.981 --> 00:28:01.760
bong or the fucking dentist real one.

458

459
00:28:05.901 --> 00:28:06.860
Ding Dong.

460
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.670

I don't want to talk. I almost fucking went too far on that one.

529
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.890
I was going to talk about where you then put the flowers and what you use as a

530
00:32:37.891 --> 00:32:41.390
face and I'm not going do that cause I'm going to be a little more classy.

I can't even tell this story. It's too fucking embarrassing.

538

I can't even tell you. But like I didn't my fucking way.

539
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:15.380
I moved something around and it was just something sitting on the winds of sill

540
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.030
in a room full of 5,000 knickknacks and it was literally there for 20 minutes

And then after a while you get that little divider, you know, up in first class,

583
00:36:10.871 --> 00:36:13.510
you guys ever get bumped up. Brady's fucking thing that'll ever happen to you.

584
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.820
Grip. You know what?

585
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.620
Short of Jesus coming back and you find out that you did enough fucking good

586
00:36:20.621 --> 00:36:23.560
deeds that you get saved or whatever your religion is.

587
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:28.270
Mom had comes back and does something fucking uh, Abraham,

588
00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:33.070
Buddha, l, Ron Hubbard, whoever, you,

589
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.000
whoever you wait for whoever you wait in for it comes back. Okay?

590
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.450
The only thing that's the only thing better than if that's shit's true, right?

591
00:36:40.451 --> 00:36:41.920
The only thing better is fucking,

592
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.070
you know that little you get bumped up to first class,

593
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:47.920
you know that little fucking divider, you know,

594
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.340
and you fly across country next to somebody for six hours and you don't say one

595
00:36:51.341 --> 00:36:55.600
fucking word to each other. All right? If you want to experience that at home,

596
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.720
you get a customized mattress either side. That's the same thing.

597
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.810
And turn your loved one into a complete stranger.

598
00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:04.890
Your mattress arrives at your door, right about a week in shipping is free.

599
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.170
That's why everyone from GQ magazine to Forbes are all talking about Heloc

600
00:37:09.171 --> 00:37:12.870
sleep. You have 100 nights to try it out, and if you don't love it,

607
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.310
I'm like the post office stamps.com never closes. Ooh,

608
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.560
shots fired. Unlike those pussies down the street, we keep going.

609
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.430

635
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.840
versus out there killing it. Like I knew he was gonna. All right.

636
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.340
August 13th at the Tarrytown theater in beautiful Tarrytown,

637
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:33.760
New York. Picturesque Tom Hanks.

638
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:37.840
Fucking sleepless in Seattle. Look at fucking place, right.

639
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.320
Um, me and uh, Hey god,

640
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:49.250
Dennis fucking computer. It's fucking screen.

641
00:39:49.251 --> 00:39:52.740
Keeps shutting off. Me and Pete Davidson. Let me get this back on me.

642
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.530
There we go. Alright, me and Pete Davidson will be, uh,

643
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.740
we'll be the sort of the masters of ceremony. We've been warming up,

644
00:40:00.741 --> 00:40:02.720
going out on stage together, giving each other's shed,

645
00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:04.820
trying out new jokes fucking around.

646
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.070
I'm going to try to come out there in between shows.

647
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.440
I don't want to slow down the taping, but I will definitely get out there,

648
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.050
sign whatever you got, take some pictures or whatever.

649
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.980
And I'll try to move it along. Um, or whatever, you know,

650
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.520
whatever I can do to, to fucking interact. We have a few seats left.

651
00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:23.750
I want to sell this thing out. It's really important I for Paul and uh,

652
00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:28.220
the all things comedy network. So, uh, I'd appreciate it if he got the time.

653
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.490
He want to listen. Listen to a, you know, some comedy. Come on down August 13th.

654
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.250
All right. Plowing ahead and I'll be at the count base.

655
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:41.000
He theater this weekend out in Jersey, out in New Jersey, Red Bank,

656
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.140
New Jersey. Um, which is really beautiful.

657
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.330
I might go down to Asbury Park during the day.

658
00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:51.980
I have no idea what I'm going to do. Um, cause I usually stay in the city.

659
00:40:51.981 --> 00:40:55.610
I think I'm going to fucking stay at somewhere out in jersey, you know.

660
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:56.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

661
00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.780
<v 0>Maybe I'll call fucking, what's his face for any brand? Any brand has a boat.</v>

662
00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.920
I'm terrified of the ocean going to go out in the fucking ocean with a Goddamn

663
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.090
club owner. Why not? All right. Okay. Here we go.

664
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.590
The probably with North Korea, deer,

665
00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:14.300
Ronald McDonald balls.

666
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:21.080
North Korea is a serious threat to East Asia and now two good.

667
00:41:21.081 --> 00:41:25.430
A portion of the world. I understand that.

668
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.390
So what, so all week, so are we,

669
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.220
you know, if you've got to play this, you know what I mean? Like,

670
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:37.730
like everybody that said that patriots cheated. If you gonna play that game,

671
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:40.940
then you got to see the cheating that you're doing. Correct. Am I nuts here?

672
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.470
Am I crazy? Yes. The missile tests the other day was a ballistic missile,

673
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.060
but they can put a nuclear weapon on it as well. Okay.

674
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.300
And so can we, we already, we already have ours ready to go.

675
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.010
Their latest test puts most of the u s all of Europe and a good portion of

676
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:00.680
Africa within range of their weapons. Yes.

677
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.880
In all of those places are in range of our weapons and Russia's weapons.

678
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.230
<v 2>So,</v>

679
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.610
<v 0>you know, I mean, look,</v>

680
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:13.160
I'm not saying it's great that this guy has his fucking thing,

681
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:17.210
but just imagine if he had what we had, what the fuck would we be doing?

682
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.050
Wouldn't we be doing the same fucking thing? Well, we gotta get some stuff.

683
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.190
He ain't, he's making that shit cause we got our shit

684
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.083
<v 2>right.</v>

685
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.690
<v 0>It's like when the Yankees started spending 200 million fucking dollars,</v>

686
00:42:30.691 --> 00:42:35.010
the red sox had to spend one 90. That's what happens. That's what happens.

687
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.923
Um,

688
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.920
<v 2>yeah.</v>

689
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.940
<v 0>And if they are actually able to successfully launched from a submarine as they</v>

690
00:42:41.941 --> 00:42:45.300
are attempting to do this, this not only increases the range,

691
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:49.440
but can potentially dramatically increase the amount of time we have to respond.

692
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.430
If they were to launch a missile. Well what, what would happen, sir?

693
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:55.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

694
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:59.960
<v 0>Listen, everybody knows there's no end game to this shit. Okay? It's good.</v>

695
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.330
It's going to be over. We would have time to respond.

696
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.170
Don't you remember what the fuck was at war games?

697
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.440
I can't believe how seriously people are fucking taking this shit.

698
00:43:11.441 --> 00:43:15.160
Like I don't think this guy's out of his fucking mind in North Korea. Alright.

699
00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.950
I'm just so fucking sick of, of,

700
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.300
of having to turn on the TV and have somebody has to try it.

701
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.430
It's like news now is just scare the shit out of somebody and offer no fucking

702
00:43:26.651 --> 00:43:27.484
solutions.

703
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.870
And then normal people just sit there screaming at each other to the point that

704
00:43:31.871 --> 00:43:35.350
this fucking dope is taking the time to turn my podcast,

705
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.750
which is supposed to be a break from all of that shit,

706
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.830
which is why I just say silly shit about it. You turn this into meet the press,

707
00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:43.773
<v 2>okay.</v>

708
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.420
<v 0>If that fucking asshole shoots one off pointed right at my house,</v>

709
00:43:47.421 --> 00:43:48.450
cause I don't want to survive it.

710
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.520
<v 2>I don't give a fuck. Alright?</v>

711
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.380
<v 0>We have no one to blame but ourselves.</v>

712
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.870
<v 2>Okay,</v>

713
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.160
<v 0>we're fucking defective. If you went beings were cars, we would all be recalled.</v>

714
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.770
All right? We do not handle position of power. Well,

715
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.320
and this is what the fuck happens. All right?

716
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.440
We're fearful fucking lunatics who for some stupid reason,

717
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.580
we're given the ability to fucking intimidate nerds so they would build all this

718
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:18.050
shit for us. And now here we are.

719
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.260
<v 2>Here we are. All right.</v>

720
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.760
<v 0>North Korea also has the highest percentage of slaves in the world fully like</v>

721
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:31.320
you care, sir. Like you give a shit fully.

722
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:36.000
4.4% of its population is in slave that it's approximately 1.1 million. Sir,

723
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.200
I am on an apple fucking computer right now and I'm sure you typed yours on an

724
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:44.140
apple computer too. Those people are jumping out of the factory there.

725
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.730
They're fucking slaves.

726
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.980
All the shit that I'm wearing was made in sweatshops.

727
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.280
Like what are we doing now? Now we're going to fudge the fucking numbers.

728
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:55.110
So these people look like they're out of their minds,

729
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.480
but everybody else is fucking okay.

730
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:01.590
This is like coming countries or like community colleges where they will figure

731
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:04.500
out what their number one and so they can fucking put it in there. Yeah.

732
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.910
Pamphlet. Um, okay,

733
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.310
let's read some more fucking depressing information.

734
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:14.770
This is why I don't watch the news, um, today did that today.

735
00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.190
And that doesn't even mention the network of concentration cramps across the

736
00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:21.390
nation. And the people getting less than some,

737
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.470
less than subsistence levels of daily calories. Well, I mean,

738
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:31.000
they're also not allowed to trade with anybody, are they? You know,

739
00:45:31.001 --> 00:45:32.830
they really can't get this shit going. Right. I mean,

740
00:45:32.831 --> 00:45:37.831
part of that is us trying to force them into giving in to get in forever 21

741
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.550
Starbucks there. Isn't that right? I mean, I might be wrong.

742
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.530
So I fucking watch sports. I watch sports, I listen to music.

743
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:53.200
Okay, I block all this shit up. So I'm sure I mispronounced some words here.

744
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.240
To put that into perspective,

745
00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.760
about that 388,000 slaves were shipped to North America from 1525 to eight 900

746
00:46:01.401 --> 00:46:05.160
1866 it's obviously a huge issue.

747
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.350
Well, how do you,

748
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:12.060
how do you put that in perspective without telling me what the population of

749
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:17.061
Korea is and also 388,000 people back in between 1525 and 1866 was a way more

750
00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:25.800
significant portion of the population than it is today. Correct.

751
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.920
So I don't know what you're saying there, sir.

752
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.840
But I do know that whenever we have an issue with the country,

753
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:38.190
all of a sudden we pretend to care about its people. Unfortunately,

754
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:40.260
there isn't any easy solution to the problem.

755
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:44.760
Even if China withdraws their support and the regime regime collapses,

756
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.230
you're still looking at a potential civil war in a nation with nuclear weapons.

757
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.480
Let's just hope people smarter than you are.

758
00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:55.140
I can find a different solution to the problem and that they won't,

759
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.430
there's only one solution. Got To go in there and get them. Uh,

760
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.250
keep up the good work. I love hearing you talk about us,

761
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.180
how awesome it is to be a parent instead of constant talk about how hard it is

762
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:07.260
as a dad of two boys.

763
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.440
There are obviously days when I feel like ripping out what little hair I have

764
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:15.090
left, but the vast, vast majority of the time is just awesome. Uh, look at this.

765
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:18.420
He was actually just informing me and I got all fucking defensive because all

766
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.710
this week people said that I said nuclear instead of nuclear. Um, yes sir.

767
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:24.330
I realize he's out of his fucking mind.

768
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:26.970
I realized that person's out of his fucking mind. The Guy Before him,

769
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:31.420
his dad was out of his fucking mind. Okay. Trump is out of his fucking mind.

770
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.970
I'm out of my fucking mind. Okay.

771
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:39.180
Nobody should have weapons other than you fucking fists and whatever you can

772
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.330
grab in the kitchen. That's ideally, that's what, that would be better.

773
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.140
All right. I think,

774
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.340
I don't understand why war is legal, but it is.

775
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.520
So this is the game that we play with each other and it is fucking inevitable

776
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:01.120
that one day somebody is going to go Martin Sheen dead zone.

777
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.310
And what are you going to do? You know?

778
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.160
See people, this is why I have all four sports packages

779
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.500
because I don't want to know about this shit.

780
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:19.060
I don't want to fucking sit here and watch the news and have them scare the

781
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:23.620
living shit out of me that now this is going to happen, you know,

782
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.130
and some flies going to bite me and then I'm gonna have a baby with a little

783
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:31.720
head. Somebody else is gonna fucking blow me up. It just, I,

784
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:34.480
I just, yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to talk about this. Okay.

785
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.300
Trying to keep it light on the podcast here. Let's just make,

786
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.000
let's just laugh at me not being able to pronounce words.

787
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.770
Don't bring actual facts into this podcast. All right,

788
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.670
girls softball, team punished. Um, hey there Billy batting glove.

789
00:48:49.671 --> 00:48:53.260
Did you hear about the girl's softball team that was removed from the world

790
00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:54.180
series because of a,

791
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.960
a picture of some of the players flicking off the camera on social media.

792
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.630
One of the girls on the team is the daughter of a family friend.

793
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.430
It's fucking brutal. Um, yeah.

794
00:49:09.431 --> 00:49:11.300
I mean, I don't, I don't know. I don't know what,

795
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.910
I don't understand social media.

796
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.660
I'm Kinda over it other than for business purposes.

797
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.520
I don't just don't think it's a good thing.

798
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:23.200
That should've just been a funny picture that they all took shared amongst

799
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:23.681
themselves,

800
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:28.120
but now you upload it and everybody sees it and you know somebody's going to get

801
00:49:28.121 --> 00:49:28.954
offended.

802
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.050
Let me guess what they the best where they probably were the number one seed.

803
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:37.260
This sounds like if one of those bad news bears things, um,

804
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:45.490
they removed from the world series. Well, well, you know how,

805
00:49:45.491 --> 00:49:47.290
you know people are there trying to make money.

806
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.230
They make money off that world series. Is it a national thing? I don't know.

807
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.000
It's like the Colin Kaepernick thing.

808
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.850
Everybody's fucking flipping out and immediately thinking that this guy's not

809
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:58.840
getting hired because of racism. It's like the NFL is a fucking corporation.

810
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:04.030
Okay. You know what? They give a fuck about money. Now look,

811
00:50:04.031 --> 00:50:08.140
if he was trying to get a coaching job or own a team, then yeah,

812
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:12.190
I would say racism would be more obvious. But like what he does,

813
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.600
most of the league is black doing okay.

814
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:20.770
Their thing is they're such cheap fucking cunts.

815
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:24.400
They would rather lose a fucking game.

816
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.830
They probably have an algorithm going like, okay,

817
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.920
if we get this guy and he wins a few more games,

818
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:34.850
how many jerseys where we sell versus the amount of people who won't buy a

819
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:38.480
Jersey because we signed this guy and I swear to God, if, if,

820
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.720
if we'll sell a fucking jersey less by signing a guy who would actually make us

821
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.730
a better fucking team, I sweated God, they will decide not to sign the guy.

822
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.040
I don't think, I'm not saying this isn't racist with them involved,

823
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.530
but it's really, it's fucking economics.

824
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.900
And what these fucking corporations try to do is they,

825
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.840
they don't want any bullshit.

826
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.130
They want smooth fucking water. That's what they want.

827
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.240
Everybody fucking just tow the fucking line. That's what they want.

828
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.290
And I'll tell you all these fucking groups that are trying to make change. No,

829
00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:15.980
that shit.

830
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.250
Which is why they always complain to the advertisers because the advertisers

831
00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:24.110
will then pull sponsorship from TV shows. They'll do it from fucking podcast.

832
00:51:24.111 --> 00:51:28.460
Everybody knows that. So the NFL is a corporation, so that's what they're doing.

833
00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:30.860
I don't know what the fuck league these girls are in,

834
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.300
but I'm sure they have some sort of stupid conduct thing that they're trying to,

835
00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:39.890
you know, trying to uphold. Yeah, it's fucking stupid.

836
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:43.490
It's also fucking stupid to upload that picture. I mean,

837
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.180
how many of these dumb stories you're going to see where people get offended by

838
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:49.880
absolutely nothing and then something happens. Right?

839
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.680
A that's unfortunate. It's unfortunate. All right, Trent Reznor.

840
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.620
This is like a way more serious podcast than I ever want to do. I don't know.

841
00:51:58.621 --> 00:52:01.220
I don't really have to do and I'm going to just start making up shit here.

842
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.550
I try to read the news, but it's just all depressing.

843
00:52:04.551 --> 00:52:07.490
Although the funny one was all this shit coming out about Lady Diana.

844
00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:11.690
Now I just don't understand how new evidence 20 years later they're finding,

845
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.470
they found out that fucking Sheila was listening to Prince Charles Jerking off,

846
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:17.300
talking to some other lady on a toilet.

847
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.720
Did somebody have that tape for fucking 20 years going, hey dude,

848
00:52:22.721 --> 00:52:26.050
listen to this. I swear to God, don't tell anybody I have this.

849
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.210
I'm going to release it when the time is right.

850
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.900
And then you just hear the echoing sound of Prince Charles going right.

851
00:52:31.901 --> 00:52:36.730
I'm going to put in your ass. You are. Um, all right,

852
00:52:36.731 --> 00:52:39.550
Trent Reznor article, a bully, bully, bully,

853
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.830
bully a thought you could relate to this.

854
00:52:41.831 --> 00:52:46.831
Trent Reznor talks about what it's like to meet his parents.

855
00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.693
Kids.

856
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:53.110
You meant to say his kids' parents while having a body of work with lyrics.

857
00:52:53.111 --> 00:52:57.370
Like I want to fuck you like an animal. Yeah, I read that article. But um,

858
00:52:59.010 --> 00:52:59.843
<v 2>okay.</v>

859
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:05.080
<v 0>Never underestimate the power of celebrity. And especially, I don't know,</v>

860
00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:08.650
he's an older dad, so maybe they don't even know what his fucking music is,

861
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.390
<v 2>but you know,</v>

862
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.640
<v 0>I wouldn't give a shit. I sang, I downloaded that, fuck it.</v>

863
00:53:15.641 --> 00:53:17.060
So I fucking loved his stuff.

864
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:21.050
That shit came out like that album blew my fucking mind. And I'd be like,

865
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:25.290
that's Trent fucking Reznor. They sweetheart. That's Trent fucking resonate.

866
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.930
I wouldn't give it a shit, you know, but it's gotta be weird.

867
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:33.000
But then there's of course the people that don't like it,

868
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.330
you know the people that were at like the four h club

869
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.143
and you know, what did he do?

870
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:45.810
He wanted to fuck someone like an animal and he expressed it all right.

871
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.300
Cart girlfriend cheating after joining the military.

872
00:53:48.301 --> 00:53:53.150
And I legally can't leave her. What? She's your girlfriend?

873
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.850
All right, dear Billy Ball balls. He's a good this week you guys usually,

874
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:02.930
you know, lately there's been a little drought. He's a fucking funny this week.

875
00:54:02.931 --> 00:54:07.250
All right. Greetings from Scotland. Uh,

876
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.900
recently I quit my well paying job to join the British Royal Marines.

877
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.960
My girlfriend had four years,

878
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.810
was very hesitant and didn't want me to leave,

879
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.110
but it had been a dream of mine since I was 14.

880
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.180
I sat her down a week before leaving and gave her the opportunity to separate,

881
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:27.141
wait,

882
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:30.140
my girlfriend and four years was very hesitant and didn't want me to leave but

883
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.370
had been dreaming since I as far as okay.

884
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.720
I sat down with her a week before leaving and gave her the opportunity to

885
00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:38.720
separate on good terms and maybe continue our relationship on.

886
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.180
I had finished my mandatory four years service,

887
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.240
but if we stayed together but we stay.

888
00:54:44.241 --> 00:54:47.990
If we stayed together and she cheated, she would be dead to me.

889
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.040
I'm half Sicilian by the way. Uh, she chose to stay.

890
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:55.700
Um, the fact that you would given her the option to leave, I mean,

891
00:54:55.701 --> 00:54:57.020
how much do you give a shit about this woman?

892
00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:01.850
I was in for just over four weeks and fell during a run and is six,

893
00:55:01.851 --> 00:55:04.310
six months. Serve a guy, stood on my leg,

894
00:55:04.311 --> 00:55:07.700
breaking my Tibia in two places. Oh fuck.

895
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:12.800
I was given the choice of staying in medical custody on base and rejoin training

896
00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.380
when I had healed or leaving for a year.

897
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:19.300
I chose to leave so I can spend more time with my girlfriend. Oh.

898
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.800
Oh. I thought it would be nice surprised to not tell her I was coming home. Oh,

899
00:55:24.801 --> 00:55:29.630
Jesus. I arrived home around 9:00 PM on Thursday. Oh my God.

900
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.120
To find my girl out. Jesus choking on some guy's Dick.

901
00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:42.450
Wow. So what he's to do, throw your fucking crutches at him.

902
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:46.530
Naturally. My instinct was to beat the shit out of the guy,

903
00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:48.810
but I'm not too mobile with a pair of crutches.

904
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.670
I forced the two out of my house and kept my promise of you're dead to me by

905
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:57.960
changing the locks the next morning and blocking her number and social media

906
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:00.090
accounts around. Two weeks later,

907
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:03.510
I received a letter from a lawyer saying that if I don't take her back,

908
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.630
she can legally take half of all my assets,

909
00:56:06.631 --> 00:56:11.631
including the house my mother left me in her will because we had been together

910
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:16.230
for more than two years. What?

911
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.130
I thought you had to be married, but low and behold,

912
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:24.560
the British justice system does me another solid.

913
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.970
<v 1>I could understand if I was away on tour from nine months and she cheated,</v>

914
00:56:28.971 --> 00:56:33.140
but four weeks fucking four weeks. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

915
00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.770
Should I just take the loss and leave this dumb whore?

916
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.890
What do I take her back and try to forget the fact that she took the first

917
00:56:39.891 --> 00:56:43.880
opportunity she had to jump on jump another guy's bone. Your bones,

918
00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:47.630
your input would be great and maybe can put a funny twist on this fucked up

919
00:56:47.631 --> 00:56:50.570
opportunity for your listeners. Dude, you need to get a fucking lawyer.

920
00:56:50.571 --> 00:56:53.060
You need to get that bitch out of your life and get a fucking lawyer.

921
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:54.590
That's what you need to do.

922
00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:56.440
<v 0>All right.</v>

923
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.810
That is one of the dumbest laws I've ever heard in my life and that's going to

924
00:57:00.811 --> 00:57:01.644
cause.

925
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:07.460
That's going to cause people to make some really fucked up decisions if someone

926
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:10.440
can screw him that fucking bad. All right,

927
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.020
over here I found a statutory, a statutory rape. What is it?

928
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:20.880
What is it? What is the fucking law when you've been illegally married?

929
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.930
That's squatter's rights. What the fuck is it? I don't know. Why are we here?

930
00:57:24.931 --> 00:57:27.270
It's like you gotta be living with somebody for like seven years,

931
00:57:27.271 --> 00:57:31.800
depending on the state. Um, and at that point they considered,

932
00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.160
it's so dumped, they, that she's entitled to half you shit.

933
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.890
Especially if she's not making any money and you're fucking paying for

934
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:40.920
everything, you know? Um,

935
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.850
oh, it's fucking ridiculous. What a fucking cunt.

936
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.960
You know what I mean? I mean,

937
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.200
how many fucking stories do they do out there about men beating women and how

938
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:56.650
awful men are to fucking women, right?

939
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:59.200
Which obviously they got to shine a light on that, but look at that. She's,

940
00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:02.440
she's gonna just fucking whore. Who sucked?

941
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:06.490
This other guy's Dick doesn't could care less about taking half of the House

942
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:07.570
that your mother left you.

943
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:14.650
Oh my God. What a fucking cunt dude. I would get a lawyer.

944
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.910
I would get all my, I would get a fucking lawyer. What a fucking piece of shit,

945
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.340
dude. Like, I don't know.

946
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.800
I can't make this is like making me angry that someone could do that to

947
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:31.260
somebody. What kind of a piece of shit?

948
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.310
Yeah, the kind of person that fucking blow somebody for week seven.

949
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.470
But even then, there's plenty of women that would do that.

950
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.120
There's plenty of fucking women that would do that.

951
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.800
They wouldn't take your fucking house. They will raise, right.

952
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.530
If they get caught, suck in a deck, they guy, you know, fair enough.

953
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:52.530
And they leave Jesus cry. We'll get a lawyer, sir.

954
00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.710
I would get a lawyer and I would fucking fight this thing.

955
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.740
Find some fucking thing that, oh my God.

956
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

957
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.620
<v 0>The advice that I want to give you,</v>

958
00:59:02.621 --> 00:59:07.420
I can't say over this because I'll be liable. Okay. And it's like,

959
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.920
all right, let me tell, let me tell the fucking little story here. Um,

960
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.420
no I can't. I can't do it.

961
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.880
I can't tell the story cause I'll get in fucking trouble. I won't Sir.

962
00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.670
You know what? I would get a lawyer and handle it legally.

963
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:24.530
Don't do anything fucking crazy. All right. Jesus Christ. What I can't do,

964
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.810
I'll tell you right there, man. You, you met one for the ages.

965
00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.530
That's a first ballot hall of fame con. If I ever fucking heard of one,

966
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.630
good Lord,

967
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.240
I could see if she caught you and then out a vindictiveness then did that, that,

968
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.040
you know, they'd be like, wow, you know what the fuck.

969
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:44.690
But she's going to do that and then take half your fucking house.

970
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:51.460
And you know what kills me when she tells the story. She a,

971
00:59:51.461 --> 00:59:53.820
I'm not saying she'll play the, she won't be in the rock.

972
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.410
I mean that's a fucking psychopath.

973
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.713
<v 6>Okay.</v>

974
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.900
<v 0>Thank God you didn't breed with her man. Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

975
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:02.303
<v 6>Okay.</v>

976
01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.680
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Well, you know what? Thank you for your service, sir.</v>

977
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:08.830
You know what?

978
01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.890
These whores can take everything you've got and there's nothing you can fucking

979
01:00:11.891 --> 01:00:14.650
do about it. That's how the laws are set up. And I gotta be honest with you,

980
01:00:14.651 --> 01:00:17.560
dude. You know, worst case scenario,

981
01:00:17.561 --> 01:00:19.590
if she takes your half your house and half the shit,

982
01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.930
even still considering what the fuck they can do to you,

983
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:27.740
you actually got off easy, easier than a lot of guys did.

984
01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:31.530
But Jesus Christ can,

985
01:00:31.531 --> 01:00:35.370
I apologize for this podcast. I don't want to get involved in world politics.

986
01:00:35.371 --> 01:00:37.050
I don't want to talk about North Korea.

987
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.390
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You know what I mean?

988
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:43.650
And for the 18 people that are going to take any of this shit fucking seriously,

989
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.770
I don't give a shit. Let's just keep it to correcting my fucking spelling.

990
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:51.630
Shall We? Um, I'm going to end this fucking podcast on an upbeat note.

991
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.690
It's Joe d Rose's birthday today at goddammit.

992
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:59.850
He's coming home from fucking Amsterdam. I've got happy birthday,

993
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.560
Joey Rose's happy birthday, Joey roses. Oh,

994
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.210
I can't even, I can't sing the song. If you ever heard this fucking songs,

995
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:14.150
we sing to each other. I mean, just,

996
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.590
I'm trying to think of a group that would be offended by, well,

997
01:01:16.591 --> 01:01:20.570
I know the one group in particular, um, I,

998
01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.460
I literally can't even sing him the fuck. This is just whole thing.

999
01:01:23.461 --> 01:01:24.930
Just went off the fucking rails.

1000
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:28.230
This whole podcast went off the rails because that was one that was such a

1001
01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:30.060
fucking, do you know what I did? You know,

1002
01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.670
because I've been stuck in the writer's room and I haven't been going out and

1003
01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:34.480
doing stand up and seeing people.

1004
01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:37.830
You'd have the stories to tell you what I do before I get on the podcast now as

1005
01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:41.370
I just click on Google news and it's just the most horrific shit.

1006
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:47.190
You know that fucking ride that broke in Ohio.

1007
01:01:47.191 --> 01:01:48.870
Fucking 18 year old kid died.

1008
01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:52.110
Kid was born in 1999 died going to a fucking amusement park.

1009
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:55.530
Somebody blew up a mosque, tried to and fucking Minneapolis.

1010
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.980
I don't understand how people sit there and they watch CNN and Fox and all that

1011
01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:03.140
shit. Just like what? What does it do for you to stay informed? I,

1012
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:07.500
I didn't have a fucking, I don't know what it'd be fucking,

1013
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.610
I didn't want to say it. I want to sit the fuck I would be doing. I, I, I,

1014
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.030
it's just not fun anymore. I got, you know, when I got to do,

1015
01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.590
I'm going to watch, I promise you guys,

1016
01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:19.510
I'm just going to watch sports between now and Thursday and I,

1017
01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.960
I'm going to do something. I'm going to go to a mall or something.

1018
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:23.670
I'll just make fun of fat people when I get back.
