00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.570
&gt;&gt;Good afternoon distinguished
guests and colleagues.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.860
Thank you for joining the
law Library of Congress

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.050
and the United States
Supreme Court today

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.070
for the 2019 Supreme Court
Fellows Program annual lecture.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.680
My name is Jane SÃ¡nchez and
I have the honor of serving

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.750
as the 25th law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.630
[applause] The Law Library
serves as the nation's custodian

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.280
of nearly 3 million
items from all countries

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.010
and legal systems of the world.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.750
Our foreign law specialists
are a diverse group

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.640
of foreign-trained attorneys and
specialists with a diverse group

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.010
of librarians as well.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.610
We do information and analysis

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.150
of 270 countries
around the world.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.550
Our skilled Law Library
staff, both American-trained

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.600
and Law Librarians also
provide research assistance

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.300
and reference on U.S. ,
federal, and state legal issues.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.690
While our collection
and expertise reach

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.310
across all points of the
globe, for today's event...

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.240
we partnered with our
next door neighbor,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880
who happens to be the
highest court in the country.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.740
While I don't want to overstate
our love and admiration

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.180
for our colleagues
across street,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.250
it is probably not
mere coincidence

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.460
that we hold today's
event on Valentine's Day.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.620
[laughter] Just saying.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.580
This afternoon, we're pleased
to be able to collaborate

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.130
with the Supreme Court as
they celebrate their 46th year

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.490
of the fellows program.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.980
It is well-known that our
featured speaker today has an

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.130
affinity for baseball.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.770
If any of you have time to stay
after the event, I encourage you

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.000
to head up to the specked
floor of this building

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.610
to see our baseball
Americana exhibition.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.400
It features items from
the library's collections

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.320
and as well as from the
national baseball Hall of Fame.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.460
And MLB. Please note

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.620
that today's program is being
live streamed on the Library

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.400
of Congress YouTube
channel, so all sounds,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
images and remarks will
be captured on video.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.740
Please take a moment to silence
your cell phones and refrain

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.510
from taking photos
during the event.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.580
At this time, I'd like to
invite Jeffrey P. Minear,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.800
Executive Director of the
Supreme Court Fellows Program

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.530
and counselor to the Chief
Justice of the United States.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.830
Thank you.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:29.520
[applause] SPEAKER: Thank you,
Jane, for your warm introduction

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.140
and thanks to you and the
Law Library of Congress

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.440
for your fellowship

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.880
in sponsoring this
afternoon's event.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.790
It's wonderful to have
such a great turnout

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.920
for a very special
gathering of the friends

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.530
and alumni of the program.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.080
Let me say just a word about
the program in my capacity

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.260
as its Executive Director.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.900
Each year, the Supreme Court
fellows commission made

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.780
up of federal judges and
other legal leaders appointed

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.270
by the Chief Justice selects
four talented professionals

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.920
to spend a year within the
federal judiciary, participating

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.020
in court administration,
while engaging in research

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.090
and other enrichment activities.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.340
Today's event is a public
component of two days

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.040
of activities in which we
celebrate our current Supreme

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.190
Court fellows and
bring together 46 years

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.870
of fellows program alumni.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.320
Over the course of
today and tomorrow,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.550
we will also select
next year's fellows

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.860
from the superb finalists who
are with us this afternoon.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.410
I understand we have
many law students with us

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.600
in the audience today,
as well as law clerks

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.980
from several courts in the
federal and state systems.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.310
If you care about the
judiciary and are interested

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.730
in how our federal courts work,
I hope you will take the time

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.960
to learn about the
fellowship opportunity we offer

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.860
and consider applying
in a future year.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.130
I invite you to visit our
website at fellows.supremecourt.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.490
gov. Applications for the 2021
class will be due in November.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.530
First, we have a great
feature this afternoon.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.040
We'll be joined by the 111th
justice of the Supreme Court

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.670
of the United States, the
honorable Sonia Sotomayor.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.990
Who has served on the
Supreme Court since 2009.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.940
Six years ago, Justice Sotomayor
published her best-selling

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.830
autobiography My Beloved World.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.040
Last year she released
two more volumes.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.120
The Beloved World of Sonia
Sotomayor, Middle School Readers

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.040
and Turn Pages for
elementary school readers.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.060
These books have been
inspiring people of all ages.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.610
We have two wonderful moderators
for today's conversation.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.080
Chief judge Robert A. Katzmann

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.320
from the United States
Court of Appeals.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.910
He's also the chairman

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.950
of the Supreme Court
Fellows Commission.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.410
Professor Eloise Pasachoff
is a distinguished scholar

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.630
at Georgetown University
Law Center.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.040
She's an academic from
the Fellows Program.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.350
She served two two
highly regarded chairs

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.770
that may sound familiar.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.720
Justice Sotomayor
and Judge Katzmann.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.300
Please give them a warm welcome.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:51.000
[applause] [cheering
and applause]

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.260
SPEAKER: This room
is so beautiful.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.080
It's just a beautiful room.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.110
SPEAKER: I have the privilege
of asking the first question...

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:12.090
[laughter] SPEAKER: Justice
Sotomayor, a few years ago...

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.680
you wrote the best-selling,
my beloved world.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.860
Which is widely acclaimed,
available in paperback,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.200
required reading in school
districts across the country.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.250
In the past year, you
published two more books,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.250
this time for younger readers.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:38.510
One called Turning Pages and the
other called The Beloved World

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.130
of Sonia Sotomayor.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.720
You managed to do this while
having a busy important day job.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.010
What motivated you
to write these books?

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:56.330
SPEAKER: I should tell the
story of My Beloved World.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:03.230
The publication department
called me up one day and said,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.100
we really should do this event.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.420
I said, Michelle, it's hard
for me to break away and do

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:18.000
that event, I just
can't say yes.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.040
I stopped her and said, I
have a distracting little job.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.520
[laughter] SPEAKER: She
actually quoted those words

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.250
and put them up on her desk.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:43.310
Writing these books isn't
a distraction for me,

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:52.180
writing these particular books
was an important mission for me.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.560
The middle school
book, The Beloved World

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:03.660
of Sonia Sotomayor, was a
product of my cousin, Miriam,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.840
who is a bilingual education
middle school teacher

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.180
in Stamford, Connecticut.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.420
She's been using my adult
book for lesson plans

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.200
for her students for
a number of years.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.890
She kept insisting she
needed a middle grade book.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.410
Because the parents book, now
that I have two kids books...

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.870
now I call My Beloved
World the parent book.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.460
[laughter] My parent book had
too many sophisticated concepts.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.180
She wanted a middle school book
that dealt more with the stories

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.920
that children could
more-easily understand.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.280
They talked about a
younger reader book.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.580
I realized that would be a book
that was equally as important.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.910
For those who are adults,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.350
I ended up loving the young
reader book, Turning Pages.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.680
The illustrations
and I didn't do them.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.150
Lula dela Cray [phonetic]
did and they are beautiful.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.690
I had no idea how hard
illustrators worked

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.730
until I worked with one.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:19.110
She did incredibly, extensive
research on every single theme.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:28.740
She was on the internet
constantly to make sure

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:51.220
that every single
detail was accurate.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:59.010
She went through -- I have a
suitcase of old photographs,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.800
lots of people have gone through
that suitcase, including me...

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.520
she not-only went through
it, but devoured it

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.190
and found things I didn't know.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.850
So... one scene in turning
pages, she gave me a picture

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.520
with me and these flowered
pants and I wrote back

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.750
"I would never wear
flowered pants."

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.940
[laughter] And she
sent me back a picture

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.030
of a kid wearing flowered pants.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.840
And I said "I stand corrected.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.120
" But it was that -- she's
just done an extraordinary job.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:41.160
But... it was from the hope
that my story will serve

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.660
as an inspiration for kids who
came from my kind of background.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.300
To know that what I have
achieved is possible

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.510
for them too.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.540
And... that's the
purpose of my books.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:02.510
To tell those kids who come from
circumstances similar to my own

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.680
that all dreams are
really possible.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.120
And... having a living example,
I think, is terribly important

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.170
to people who live in situations

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:21.670
in which their life can
often appear impossible

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.700
or so desperate that no
good can come from it.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.240
And so... that's the purpose
of all three of my books.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.600
I hope to give hope.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.590
SPEAKER: So...

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.180
there's another way in which
you've been touching children's

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.430
lives recently, that's through
your work with civics education.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.730
SPEAKER: Ah.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.030
SPEAKER: So...

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.890
you've been active in this
program called ICIVICS

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.850
[phonetic] founded by
Sandra Day O'Connor.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:58.760
Could you talk to us about why
that's an important mission?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.730
What's necessary about it --
what are you doing with it?

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.370
SPEAKER: I'll tell you how
I started getting involved

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.120
with ICIVICS.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.830
There was an event
honoring O'Connor

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.500
and Mont speakers was
the head of ICIVIS

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:23.860
and she described the purpose
of ICIVICS and the games.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:31.720
I wondered if the games could
teach bilingual students.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.740
10% of the United
States, could this be used

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.680
to teach those civics.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.640
She said to me "I
love the games,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.610
but they're too sophisticated
for my students."

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:58.530
For students just beginning to
master the English language --

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.260
they're not accessible yet.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.590
My next question was,

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.030
do you think the games
could be tweaked two make

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.970
them accessible?

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.760
She said "let me think about it.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.820
" She said, I'm putting
you in touch with Louise,

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.790
the one in charge of ICIVICS
and let's talk about your idea.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.530
An Advisory Committee
was put together

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:32.030
of educators across the country.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.400
The games are being
translated into Spanish,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.070
but the exercise taught
us that there were things

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:50.620
in the English versions that
were hindering slow-learners.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:57.040
So... one of the things we
found out or realized is...

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.700
that some slow learners,
whether they're Spanish-speaking

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.060
or any other language-speaking

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:10.290
or just slow readers have a
problem with literal words.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.370
Throw the book at someone.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.500
They don't understand
the secondary meaning

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.780
of something like that.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.240
So... now we created a glossary,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.460
not just for the
Spanish speakers,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.150
but for the English speakers
who have trouble with literalism

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.810
and believe it or not, there's
quite a sizeable population

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.860
of readers with that difficulty.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:44.950
So... now, there's an English
glossary and Spanish glossary.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.640
So... two of the games
have been translated,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.260
they're now working
on more of the games.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.290
But... it was my small
contribution to being

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.210
as a result of calling
about this issue...

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.910
to join the board after Justice
O'Connor was stepping away

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.330
from public life.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.650
They wanted a part
of the Supreme Court

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.120
to always be represented
in ICIVICS

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.630
because she was its
founder and originator.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.540
It is surprising
how many people,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.210
who are well-educated don't
get 100% on the games.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.510
The kids love them.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.740
It teaches them about
civics, but...

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.000
you're more fundamental part
of your question was why.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.960
We can't preserve our democracy
unless our citizens are informed

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.520
about it.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.150
Ben Franklin was asked as he
was leaving the constitutional

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.060
convention, what
do we have doctor?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.090
A monarchy or a republic?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.800
His response was "a
republic, if you keep it."

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.570
We can't keep it if we're being
educated about our Civic Life

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.530
and our civic responsibilities.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.790
We have rights, because
they come with obligations

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.870
and they obligate us to
preserve our democracy.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.600
And to make sure
it remain vibrant.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:19.950
My charge, personally, morally
as a justice, is to ensure

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:27.600
that I don't just write
about the constitution,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.560
but that I teach about it
and try to enview everyone

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.820
with a passion and love
as deep as the one I feel.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.960
We're working as a community
to empower and ensure

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:54.510
that every member
is striving as hard

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.660
as we are individually
to be active in it.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:05.690
I'm doing everything I can

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:25.330
to further it even more
than she already did.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.110
SPEAKER: I can't
wait to have you back

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:11.320
at your old courthouse --
in the Marshall Courthouse,

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.900
we launched a circuit-wide
project,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.810
Justice for All courts
in the community.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.980
It's the nation's first
coordinated civic education

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:28.160
program, involving every
court in our circuit.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.960
We have this wonderful learning
center where children can come

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.690
in and meet with the judges.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.700
We have teachers institutes
where teachers come in and meet

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.280
with judges and scholars
about social studies.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.490
We have curriculum
exchanges with the boards

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:55.270
of education on how to teach.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:02.210
We go out to the
communities every day...

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:09.830
Law Week, Constitution Week and
we've got a wonderful poster

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.200
about you, so you
definitely have to come back.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.700
We're working on an
exhibit and her time.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:27.070
Sonia Sotomayor was
born in 1954.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:34.660
You'll be able to check
what she was doing in 1970.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.070
[laughter] SPEAKER: It's a way

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.400
of bringing our young
people closer

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.080
to the communities
and the courts.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.430
So... we can't wait to
have you back with us...

00:20:52.430 --> 00:21:00.750
SPEAKER: Make sure you
visit 500 Pearl Street.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.230
The learning center, I
served before it was opened.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.490
Pieces of it before it was open.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.790
SPEAKER: It said 40 Foley.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.090
SPEAKER: Oh...

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:14.170
sorry. SPEAKER: One of the
things that's quite moving

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.470
as an example -- SPEAKER:

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.750
They're right next
door to each other.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:30.150
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: For a young person,
how extraordinary is it to bring

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.610
to life one of the great icons.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:39.560
You were a judge before
President Obama nominated you

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.740
to the Supreme Court.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.950
. Then as a countertops
judge in New York.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:54.190
What are some of the differences
between your day-to-day work

00:21:54.190 --> 00:22:02.080
on those courts and your
current day-to-day work

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.900
on the Supreme Court?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.030
I won't ask you which
job you like better...

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.990
[laughter] SPEAKER:
But I'll answer that.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:16.430
I'll include an answer to that.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:21.540
[laughter] SPEAKER: I've
often described the difference

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.630
between the three
courts as follows.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:34.990
District court life is
like controlled chaos.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.670
There's a fast-move ing
pace every single moment

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.780
of every single day.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.850
There are countless different
motions running and...

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.850
jumping through your door.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.210
There are hearings and
trials and procedures

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.390
of all kinds occurring
in the courtroom.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.930
What you can expect is that
one day will never look

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.960
like the preceding day and no
two days are ever identical.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.290
The amount of information
you absorb as a judge is an,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.700
in one given day, is so large
that at the end of my first year

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.640
as a district court
judge, I told a friend

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.740
that I finally understood
why the brain is a muscle.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.650
All the knowledge I
was stuffing into it,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.210
it's a good thing it was a
muscle and could stretch.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.510
It is not only varied

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.630
in the matters the district
court judge is handling,

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.440
and the issues that
you're dealing with,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.680
but it's also varied in your
human interactions with people.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.120
You're dealing with lawyers
and not just in cursory ways,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.740
the conference room
where a motion might be,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.240
but in the hearing, they'll
appear before you for a number

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.710
of hours, if not days, and
certainly for days, if not weeks

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.430
or months in an extended trial.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:06.550
You get to know, not just those
lawyers and their personalities,

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:12.750
but their styles and what's
important to them as litigators,

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.370
as they get to know what's
important to me, as a judge.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.900
It's very personal
enterprise and...

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.320
you're hearing witnesses,
you're hearing from parties,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.340
you're dealing with jurors
and their own pica dillos

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.980
and their own reactions.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:39.350
One of the most-fun
things to do was

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.820
to present a litigator
before her case or a jury

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.990
and watch how the
jury was reacting.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.200
I'd often take notes and
at the end of the trial,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:55.010
go back to the litigants
and say "when you did this,

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.970
the jurors didn't like it.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.980
" And I'll tell you why I think
why or they really enjoyed

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.180
that part of your presentation.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.320
Maybe you should think
of including more

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.070
of that in what you're doing.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.980
What you're focused in
on as a trial judge,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.870
a district court judge is
the parties before you.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.980
And you're trying to
resolve their dispute.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:29.420
You're trying to understand why
this case is important to them,

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.800
what about the issues is
motivating this dispute and...

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.990
you're also trying to figure
out what's important to them

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.200
in terms of settling
the case if you can.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.530
That's part of your
charge to try

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.030
to avoid the litigation,
if you can.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.910
You'll have to understand
the why of doing that.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:03.610
Finding justice for those two
parties, when ours a Court

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.580
of Appeals and Appellate Court,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.220
it's a different
kind of justice.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.690
You're trying and dealing
within the parameters set

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.250
by the Supreme Court and
the precedence it's created

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.340
and the precedence of your
own circuit and looking

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:27.480
for uniformity in that part
of your world in the circuit.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.100
You're trying to find justice
under the law, as it exists

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.880
at that moment in that
place, your circuit.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.020
So... it's justice for
the law in that place.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.720
When you're on the
Supreme Court,

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.560
and their life is more
contemplative, you are dealing

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.530
with lots of cases,
certainly not as many

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.270
as on the district court.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.320
Only about, I think,
it's ten, the maximum,

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.920
15% of all district
court cases ever end

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.540
up on appeal, generally.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.150
And so... you're dealing with a
volume that is, by definition,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.400
much smaller than on
the district court.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.840
Most of the cases, not all...

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.590
they all have one or more
twist in them, but...

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.850
they're more clearly controlled
by precedent than not.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.070
You do get, maybe...

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.570
in that 10%, 10% of the cases

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.330
that might ultimately be
reviewed by the Supreme Court.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.570
So... it's a smaller
fraction of your overall work.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.550
And... I don't want to say the
circuit court can become more

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:44.180
routinized, but it does have
a pace where there are things

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.210
that are much more controlled,
clearly by prior law,

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.820
prior precedence and so...

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.960
what you're trying to do is to
ensure that you get to your work

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.210
in an efficient way, so...

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.880
the parties are not
kept waiting forever.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.080
The same task the district
court is trying to do,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.140
but you're trying to be
clear for those parties

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.980
within your jurisdiction.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.940
Supreme Court, well...

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:18.100
we take now, on average,
60 to 70 cases a term.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.580
It's been closer to 60, Mark,
the last couple years, okay?

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.000
The last couple terms.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.590
There's less volume, but...

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:32.280
every case, the Supreme Court
takes is a Supreme Court case.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.460
And what that means is...

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.500
that it's an unsettled
area of law.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.480
It's an area in which
reasonable jurors

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.130
across the country
have disagreed.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.430
Because...

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.250
we rarely have ever taken a case
unless there's a split among the

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.230
courts below.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.130
There are 13 circuit
courts across the country

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.330
and those courts don't all
agree on issues of law.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:05.140
And it is those cases that the
Supreme Court exists to correct.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.410
Those cases in which
those reasonable judges

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.750
of both genders are
agreeing or disagreeing.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.330
They're harder cases.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.930
We tend to have much
more reading

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.580
than even the courts below.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:30.400
The number of Amica briefs can
number into the multiples of 10.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.090
And... the briefing
may be the same size

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.770
on the Court of Appeals, but...

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:40.230
the research, in terms of not
just what the case readings,

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.420
themselves, but even for me,
reading articles and journals

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.960
about areas of law in those
areas that I know less about,

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.230
or am less comfortable
with, is much more extensive

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.670
on the Supreme Court than
it was on the lower courts.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.600
But... what are we
doing justice for?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.080
We're doing justice for
the law as it should be.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.380
Because...

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.520
we're not just looking
at the case before us.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.250
There are some who would argue
that's what the Supreme Court

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.430
should be doing.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.430
But... every time we announce
a principle of law, we are,

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.800
or of interpretation of law,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.400
we are deciding not
just that case...

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.290
but the cases that
come after it.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.640
So... it's not uncommon
in the Supreme Court

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.750
for a Supreme Court
Justice to ask a litigant

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.810
if we follow your rules,

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:44.300
isn't the natural outcome
this other extreme?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.910
So... I'll give you an example
that occurred on the Court

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.750
of Appeals, but it happens
regularly on the circuit court.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:31:01.230
I had a case involving the first
amendment, where a judge had ,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:07.120
issues a gag order, stopk
the press from reporting

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.980
on information that had
been disclosed in court.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.250
And the appeal came to us, by
the litigant, by the newspaper,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.870
who claimed that
was an abridgement

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.170
of the first amendment.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.470
Because...

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.000
anything said publically
in court...

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.140
was subject to public
dissemination.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.340
One of the questions
that I asked was...

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.520
what happens in the
following scenario?

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.050
There is a bomber on
trial, a terrorist,

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.350
and he takes the stand.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:47.600
And in the middle of his
testimony, he says...

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.540
these infadels have
to be destroyed.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.800
Another bomb will go
off in five minutes.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.730
This is prove that God
is not here to save you.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:07.150
The prosecutor jumps up
and says, your Honor,

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.860
please bar the press
from leaving the room

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.170
and disseminating this story.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.250
We need to call the FBI
to get them there in time

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.150
to save people and
try to find that bomb.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:26.650
What does the judge do?

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.120
The lawyer says he
denies the request

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.640
that came out in open court.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.460
I looked at him and I say...

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.360
and you're unwilling to
save all of those people

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.420
when those five minutes
could be saved?

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.180
And his response was...

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.680
judge... I didn't tell
you that in the order

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.180
of his courtroom he couldn't
lock the door for five minutes.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:33:00.700
Not a perfect answer,
but an answer.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.800
That's what we do
with all of our cases.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.430
We take the principles that
we announce and try to figure

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.490
out where they will lead us.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.940
Where they're going to lead the
society and the lower courts.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.570
And if it's a place
that doesn't seem to fit

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:25.390
within the constitutional
theory, as we understand it,

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.480
then we have to look at
the premise and figure

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.660
out if we need to
change an outcome.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:39.240
And so... for us, it is justice
for the law as it should be.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.440
And those are, very much,
the stark differences

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.810
between the three courts.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.050
An answer to your
unspoken question...

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:52.530
[laughter] SPEAKER: I didn't ask
who your favorite colleague was.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.540
[laughter] SPEAKER:
That, I won't answer.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.450
I have announced that if I
ever, if, underscore that word,

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.580
undertake senior status...

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.930
that I would go back to
being a district court judge.

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.450
It's a lot of fun.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.290
[laughter] SPEAKER: I'm going
to follow-up on the fun part

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.150
in that last sentence and ask...

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.760
what do you do for fun with
a busy, important day job.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.760
How do you relax and
unwind after all this?

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.100
SPEAKER: First of all...

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.680
I love exercise -- I do do some
exercise, when I'm not injured.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.680
Some injuries are
self-reflected.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:42.880
Falling isn't a smart thing
to do -- I love exercise.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.700
I do like reading
fiction as opposed

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.430
to serious books when I can.

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:52.620
That seems to be getting
relegated to my summers

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.350
than to the term year.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:59.440
I've been doing my book
tour and got to read a lot

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.790
of children's books lately.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.840
And... that's been a lot of fun.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.430
And... I also like
playing poker.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:14.620
[laughter] SPEAKER: And I play
poker with people I really like.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.080
SPEAKER: Before we open it up
for Q&amp;A; from the audience,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.920
do you have in mind a next book?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.580
SPEAKER: It's coming
out in September.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.800
It's a second children's book.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.980
When the publisher was very
interest did in doing the story

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.590
of my life, Turning Pages is
that, for young readers, but...

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.940
I conditioned it on
doing the children's book

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.380
that I wanted to do forever.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:55.500
And it's a book about children
who face life challenges.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.470
And it was born from an
incident that occurred to me,

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.370
that happened to
me, not occurred --

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.010
happened to me when
I was younger.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.120
I was in a restaurant and I,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.690
at a time when I was hiding my
diabetes from the world and went

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.540
into a bathroom and
was taking my shot.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.100
Someone happened to walk
in while hi was doing it.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:21.470
I sort of finished what I
was doing the left the room.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.200
As I was leaving the restaurant
and walking by the table

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.350
of the woman who had
come in, she was leaning

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.760
over into her companion
as I walked by

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.810
and said "she's a drug addict"

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:40.750
in a stage whisper
and I was outraged.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:46.720
I walk back to her and
said "I'm a diabetic

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.530
and that shot I took is
my insulin and what I use

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:56.830
to stay alive, you should not be
judgmental and judging people.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.860
If you don't know
something, ask,

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.190
don't assume" and I walked away.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:07.810
And as I've been living my life
and I have many, many friends

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.100
with children with
chronic conditions,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.370
and some with conditions,
obviously...

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.190
they can't help, like
Tourette's Syndrome.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:24.730
In the store, recently, someone
looked at my friend and said...

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.560
can't you control your child?

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:33.640
Because her child had twisted
in an unusual way and banged

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.800
into her by mistake
and my friend was just

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.640
so hurt for her daughter.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.110
And that incident...

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.850
and mine, made me
realize that I wanted

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:51.710
to write a children's book about
kids, and there are so many

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:57.880
of us, with conditions
that challenge their life

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.370
and I wanted to explain that the
richness of those conditions,

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.680
richness in the sense of the
positive things that they bring

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.800
to our life as a community.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.190
And so... my next
book is Just Ask.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.600
Hence where the title
came from, right?

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.820
Be different, be brave, be you.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.260
That's the title of the book.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.450
It describes children with
all kinds of conditions.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.750
Diabetes, obviously.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.830
I start out with me.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.180
But... children in wheelchairs,
children who are blind,

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.980
children who are deaf, children
with Tourette's Syndrome,

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.800
children who have
attention deficit,

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.250
children with Down Syndrome,
children of all kinds

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.510
with life challenges and I
describe the frustrations

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.410
of those challenges, the
difficulties, but also,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.000
the things that they
help us with.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.380
How they make us stronger

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.760
and more-important contributing
members to our community.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.610
It's set in a garden and I show
how every garden has different

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:12.380
things in it, just
like the world does.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.750
And we're a richer
garden and a richer world,

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.950
because of children
who are different.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.250
And so... that's my book.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.550
It comes out in September.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.380
SPEAKER: We can't wait
for that book to come out.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.830
SPEAKER: I told the doctor he
has to put it in his office.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:47.810
SPEAKER: We'll now have
Q&amp;A; from the audience.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.110
SPEAKER: All right...

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.890
I'm coming down to say
hello to everybody.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.450
Are you going to be brave
enough to get up and tell me

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.750
who asked the question?

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.680
SPEAKER: Yes...

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.540
as Jeff Minear, our
leader, pointed out,

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.510
this is it a gathering

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.570
of the Supreme Court
Fellows Commission.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.220
We're going to hear questions

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.110
from Supreme Court
fellows, alumni.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.470
The first question
is from Sara Wilson.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.480
SPEAKER: Sara, where are you?

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.690
She knows me very well.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:22.460
She probably knows me
better than I know myself.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.070
It's great to see you -- she was
an instrumental part of my being

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.180
on the Supreme Court because
she was the person who led me

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.750
through my district
court nomination.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.470
So... I'm internally
grateful to her.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:46.270
[applause] SPEAKER: Thank you
for those wonderful remarks.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:51.790
What advice would you give a new
judge, either a new trial judge

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.170
or a new intermediate
appellate judge,

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.540
given that you have
served on all levels

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.950
of the federal judiciary?

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.410
SPEAKER: Ah...

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.290
that's a -- I'm going to walk up
-- I need somebody to guide me.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:06.030
You come down -- SPEAKER:
I don't need that --

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.830
SPEAKER: Thank you, sir.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.150
SPEAKER: Um...

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.550
it's advice that
you're obviously going

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.640
to find difficult to understand.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.990
To be a judge, you
have to be decisive.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.740
You have to come
to a conclusion.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.520
Both because you can't angst
forever about one case.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.820
Otherwise...

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.010
everybody who appears
before you will suffer.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:40.650
That kind of delay will cause
justice, justice delays,

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.820
justice denied [indiscernible],
is very important

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.030
to understand and respect.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.170
On the other hand...

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:55.050
you have to be willing to
admit when you make mistakes.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.720
And many of us forget that
when you become a judge.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.510
There's a temptation
to say "well,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.020
that's the way I ruled,
I had to be right."

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.060
Or I can't look indecisive
to others, so...

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.790
I can't change my mind.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.970
I think that's an error.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.540
I think that you
have to use judgment.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.140
You have to work
efficiently at thinking

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.650
about all the possibilities
and coming to a decision.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.980
But... every once in
awhile, you should pause

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:39.430
and rethink something, to
ensure you got it right.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:44.640
One of the justices I
most-admired, John Paul Stevens,

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.530
one of the speeches, last
speeches that I heard him give,

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.830
just after he left the bench
was at Fordham Law School

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.860
in which he described
the three areas of law

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.760
where his views had
changed over time.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:07.530
Where he had become educated by
learning that he had been wrong.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.010
And... I hope that I
can follow his example.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.080
I have, in small ways, and so...

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.590
especially in trials,
not all the time,

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.920
because you can't do
it all the time, but...

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.340
occasionally, I'd be in
the middle of a trial

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.640
and someone would raise an
objection, I'd say denied

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.640
and I go home that night or
go back to my office and say

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.600
to my law clerks
"I'm uncomfortable

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.990
with that decision, please help
me find some research on it"

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.860
and I read it and go
back the next morning

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:43.640
and say "I made a mistake,
let's start again, start over."

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:50.120
There've been moments
on the Court of Appeals

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.420
where I wrote an opinion
and after writing it,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:00.320
said "I'm wrong" and
wrote a second opinion

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.620
and went the other way.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.770
I've sent both to the panel.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.130
And I said...

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.170
I wrote myself out of this.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:13.840
[laughter] SPEAKER: In one
case, the panel went with me.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.610
In another case, they
went the other way.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.160
And... ultimately,
I was proven right,

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.370
but that's beside the point.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.670
[laughter] SPEAKER: But...

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:28.050
if I give any advice
to a new judge...

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.020
is... keep an open mind.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.790
I think that ability to say

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:41.980
"I can make mistakes" let's you
listen in a way that opens you

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.080
up to accepting that
you're a human being

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.120
and that your initial thoughts
on something don't have

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.680
to be your final thoughts.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.050
And so... for me, that's, that
has been an important lesson.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.860
SPEAKER: Our second question
comes from Derrick Webb.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:05.180
A 2014/15 Supreme Court Fellow.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.110
SPEAKER: Hello, how are you?

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.480
SPEAKER: Good to see you.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.200
I've heard recently that you've
been working with your neighbor

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.830
on the bench, Justice Gorsuch
on civic education programming.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.960
SPEAKER: We have,
we've had so much fun.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.600
But... I can't talk him
into coming off the stage.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.900
SPEAKER: All right...

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.860
SPEAKER: I keep telling him
over time he'll get used to it.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.610
SPEAKER: You might
prevail on that.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.950
The question I had -- why did
the two of you decide to get

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.900
into this program
on civic education,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.810
in a moment when citizens

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.700
and lawyers are having difficult
times talking with each other

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.940
across political differences
and legal differences,

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.410
what connection do you see
between your program work

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.310
on civic education and the other
virtue of sort of, civility?

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:57.900
SPEAKER: I think that the
Supreme Court is a prime example

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.580
for the nation.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.580
Of how you can agree,
disagree agreeably.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.000
And... that's a hard
thing to do.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.410
To listen to people who
are fundamentally different

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.070
than you are.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.490
And... to really go head-to-head
with them on an issue and...

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.310
if you've seen some
of our writing,

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.330
you know that in writing,
we go head-to-head.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.890
We're not always so
civil in writing...

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.290
we're trying to fix that up...

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.750
but we're not always
as civil as I'd like...

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.090
including me.

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.270
That's always because
you're passionate.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:38.210
It's very hard to disagree
with somebody and...

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:41.610
they write something that
you think is terribly wrong

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.760
and you not want to take them
and shake them and say...

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.780
why can't you see this?

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.570
What's wrong with you?

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.590
[laughter] SPEAKER:
That's the gut instinct.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:55.530
The hard part is to
fight that gut and say...

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.600
okay... you disagree with me,
I will try to understand why.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.330
I will explain in my
opinion why you're wrong.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.220
And... if you still
don't agree...

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:09.110
I'm going to leave it to
history to figure it out.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:14.330
But... I don't have to
dislike you because of it.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.780
I think that we forget that
people who differ from us,

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.020
even though what we sometimes
think are fundamental issues,

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.320
and...

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.180
you know, I had a friend
who once said to me...

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:31.990
"my son can't marry a
republican" [laughter] SPEAKER:

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.240
And I looked at her and said...

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.370
you can't really mean that.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.240
That's ridiculous.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.890
And she said "no, no, there's a
fundamental difference in values

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.490
between the two parties.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:45.400
" And I said "there's no
fundamental difference

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.600
in values between people.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:54.150
" We all have some basic values
that cut across cultures,

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:58.820
gender, parties,
religions, everything.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.810
We are all committed to family.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:08.620
We all believe in the importance
of family and being supportive,

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.970
in loving those people
who are a part of us.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:16.040
We all believe in friendship.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.210
And being supportive
in those friendships.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:27.670
We all believe in our country,
we all want us to succeed.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:32.360
Those are the fundamental
values that we have to look to.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.290
Now... the expressions of
it, we can fight about,

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:40.020
we can talk about, but you have
to look at the good in people.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.930
You cannot look at what
you're painting as bad,

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:47.260
as defining them
as human beings.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.940
And so... if you start from
there, it becomes easier

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.060
to disagree agreeably.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.800
And... Justice Gorsuch and I
have found ways to do that.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.300
We have disagreed, all
right, on a lot of things...

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.610
but we agreed on a
couple things and one

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.700
of the things we're most
committed to is civic education,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:12.300
both of us and it didn't matter
to me that he wasn't say,

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.300
voting with me more often.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.120
Hopefully over time
I'll convince him.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:27.190
[laughter] But in the interim,
it's fun to work with him.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.820
It is fun...

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.460
I mean, people are reporting
that we're constantly laughing

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.120
on the bench together.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:38.300
We can poke fun at each
other and it is poking fun.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.700
It's not criticism,
it's not anger.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.170
It's just enjoyment.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.780
Of each other as people.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.170
He's a lovely person.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.410
And... to the extent that both

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:55.840
of us fundamentally love this
country and love children

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.550
as much, we're doing something
that we both think is important.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.310
I hope most of the world
would figure out how

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:05.680
to find that common ground.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.450
And work in that common
ground more often.

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:12.690
But... we tend to be
going to the uncommon,

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.210
rather than the common ground.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:18.060
SPEAKER: We have time
for one last question.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.770
SPEAKER: We have time
for one last question.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.800
Debra? 2015/16 Supreme
Court Fellow.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.490
SPEAKER: Hello, Debra.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.650
I didn't pick these guys, okay?

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.650
[laughter] SPEAKER: But I happen
to know and like them all.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.700
SPEAKER: You spoke earlier about
what you hope children will take

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.460
from the books that you've been
writing over the past few years.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.020
I'm wondering what you've
learned about yourself

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.710
through the process of
writing these books?

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.320
SPEAKER: I've learned so much.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.220
But... about myself...

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.370
well... I've learned a lot
about -- you know, if you --

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:03.180
I went to an event in Chicago
and there was a reporter

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.060
who came up to me at
the event and said...

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.780
"how many years of
psychotherapy have you been in?"

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.630
[laughter] SPEAKER:
And I looked at her

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.810
and said "what are
you talking about?"

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.140
She said "nobody could
write this kind of book

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.910
without having gone
through therapy."

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:25.860
And my answer was "this
book has been my therapy."

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.160
You know...

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:31.580
the reason I wrote the
book was my first year

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.910
on the Supreme Court,

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:38.380
it was such a shocking,
jarring experience.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.410
I went from a modest
stage in New York...

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.760
it wasn't so modest a job,
but it was abruptly a job

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.380
from the Circuit Court
of Appeals and was

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.450
on a limited stage there.

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:55.930
To a world stage.

00:51:55.930 --> 00:52:04.340
I was catapulted and yanked
out of a semi private life

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.500
into this world stage.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:12.680
And... everything was
happening so fast.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.350
The hearings were
[indiscernible],

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.650
all of a sudden, I'm
at the Supreme Court,

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.230
nominated at the end of May,
I'm at the Supreme Court

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:23.490
in the beginning of April.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:28.260
(? ) The first case on my
desk is Citizens United,

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.590
all right in one of the
biggest cases, probably one

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:37.450
of the most-important
cases in modern times.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:42.840
And... I'm being fitted by
presidents, vice presidents,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:48.560
senators, representatives,
people from around the globe,

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.360
famous people, not
so famous people...

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.170
but... you know, I had dinner

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.850
with Jennifer Lopez
and Marc Anthony.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:53:00.090
[laughter] SPEAKER: How are you?

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:06.390
And... I became afraid...

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.160
you know...

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.700
I gotta get around.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.780
I became afraid...

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.070
yes... that in this process...

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.510
I would lose me.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:25.880
You've heard the old adage
"absolute power corrupts,

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:31.200
absolutely" and I realized
that being in this kind

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.740
of position can both
isolate you and...

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.700
absorb you.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.820
So... you became self absorbed.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.130
And... I needed a
way to avoid that.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:46.430
So... what did I do?

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:50.830
I absorbed myself in myself,
by taking that first summer

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:54.250
and escaping from
being a justice.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:57.300
To looking at my life
and trying to figure out

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.750
and remember how
I got where I got.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:06.120
And... that's what
My Beloved World is,

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.100
is that personal journey for me.

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:15.640
Of remembering the people,
the life situations,

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.930
and the circumstances
that created who I am.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:25.770
And... it's that, that I
want to keep a part of me.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:31.000
How much I valued and
value, all of those people

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.080
who have made little pieces
of me is so deeply ingrained

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.520
in my psyche and
so important to me.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.670
And I wanted to make them
real for other people...

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:46.350
but I also wanted you to
find, within yourselves

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:48.320
that which created you.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:54.760
And to learn how to appreciate
it even with all its warts.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:01.370
I never thought, and it's hard
to explain, there are incidents

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:05.040
in my book that I describe,
that I never thought

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.980
that I could forgive others for.

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.640
And I think I speak
with pride when I say,

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.390
the book helped me find
those moments of forgiveness.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:19.490
And so... that was surprising.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:25.570
Because we all hold hurts
and moments of anger that are

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:31.000
so deep within us that we
never think we can let them go.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.200
And... writing the book
has helped me do that.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.500
So... yes...

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.890
that's what it's taught me.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.370
Which is...

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:44.450
there is nothing we
can't figure out.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:48.920
Especially if we figure out
what we've learned from it.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.720
And so... it's been a joy
for me to write these books.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.680
Just Ask book will be slightly
different venue for me,

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:02.350
but even there -- I'm
sharing and letting go of some

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:07.460
of the anger that I had
about being different.

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.760
Because...

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.880
I think every child who is
different in some way...

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.730
or perceives themselves to be,

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:17.240
holds some hurts
and anger about it.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.140
And so... I've learned for
myself, how to let some

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:26.360
of that go and I hope it
will help them do the same.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.130
[applause] SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:40.530
