KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:03.680
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.450
Joining me in the
studio right now

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.547
is Edith Yeung
from 500 Startups.

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:08.880
Edith, thank you for joining us.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.363
EDITH YEUNG: Thanks.

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:10.330
Nice to meet you, Kory.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.140
KORY JEFFREY: So tell us a
little bit about 500 Startups.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.860
EDITH YEUNG: So 500 Startups
is a early stage C accelerator

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.570
and also VC firm.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.130
500 Startups is actually
no longer 500 startups.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.786
We actually have invested
in 1,200 startups now.

00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:31.800
Our staff is actually almost
90 people now and almost 20

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650
investment professionals.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.310
And so half of our investment
is done through accelerator.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.610
What that means is
every three or four

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.200
months we have
about 700 startups

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.935
will apply to get
into accelerator.

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:47.410
And we usually take
about 30 companies.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.840
And once you get accepted,
right now we actually

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.272
are investing $125,000
for 5% of the company.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.730
Once you get
accepted, you actually

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.020
spend four months
with us on-site,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.726
either in Mountain View office
or San Francisco office.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.290
And we will bombard
you night and day

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.792
with a lot of mentorship,
a lot of classes,

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:12.130
but with a very strong
focus on growth.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.600
We have about, right now, about
15 [INAUDIBLE] in residence.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.205
So all these guys will
basically spend a lot of time

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.420
with our companies to help
them to figure out the funnel,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.130
really think through like what's
the right strategy in terms

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.601
of marketing user acquisition.

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:29.600
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.448
So if a lot of the
focus is on growth,

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:33.406
does that mean most of
the people, the startups

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.121
that you take in, have
a product already?

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:35.871
EDITH YEUNG: Yeah.

00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.660
So we don't really
invest in idea.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.540
And actually many
of the companies

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.610
that get accepted as
accelerators, let's

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.720
say if you're mobile
apps, I would minimum

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.270
look for at least five digit or
above in terms of install base.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.230
If it's just a few hundred,
it's very tough for us

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.720
to see if this is
actually a good--

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.204
at least like a product that is
valid for a particular market.

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.140
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.969
So 500 Startups
has famously said

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.135
that we are going to go
around the world and invest.

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:09.047
You're probably one of the
first accelerators, anyways,

00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:09.547
to do that.

00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:10.363
EDITH YEUNG: Yes.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.490
KORY JEFFREY: Can
you talk a little bit

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.156
about your guys'
international strategy?

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:16.055
EDITH YEUNG: Yeah, so we-- very,
very early on when Dave first

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:17.430
started, Dave and
Christine first

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.940
started the firm, pretty much
a year in, I say like Paul,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.250
your friend, we hired people.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.900
Folks now has people in India
Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.620
Vietnam, Japan, Korea,
Brazil, Russia and Israel.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.030
We have partners in all
these different places

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.800
around the world.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.250
So our who strategy is that we
believe in emerging markets.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.474
We know that US is
great, and all of us

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:54.640
have a lot of awesome
developers that we found here.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.260
But still I think
in terms of growth,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.160
it's definitely international.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.060
So we want to invest
very, very early

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.860
in some of the best people in
all these different countries.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.869
Of course, Canada
is awesome, too.

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.410
We need to spend
more time in Canada,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.860
and Waterloo particularly.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.090
But really, we want to
be the first one that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.710
invests in some
of the best people

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.210
in that particular country.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.600
And we believe that if we
don't have people there,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.290
we don't understand the market.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.025
I want to say right now
about 20% of our investments

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:25.210
are international,
like non-US founders.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.126
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:27.100
Wow.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.329
And so you said that about
half of your investing

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.870
is through the
accelerator, so that's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.200
where companies from around
the world will come to you.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.570
EDITH YEUNG: Yeah.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.236
KORY JEFFREY: And
then is the other half

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.074
done by these people in
market, in the regions

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:38.782
around the world?

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.638
EDITH YEUNG: Yeah, so I actually
happen to focus on mobile.

00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:45.860
So I have a mobile
collective fund,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.842
focus on early stage
mobile around the world.

00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:51.327
So I've done about 20
investments so far.

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:57.080
And about four of
them are non-US.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.788
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:03:57.788 --> 00:03:59.279
EDITH YEUNG: And
we will do more.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.261
So in that case, not all of
them will come to accelerator,

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.973
because our accelerator's
actually very, very US focused.

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:06.806
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.630
EDITH YEUNG: Or I
guess, let's say

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.100
if you're from China,
if your goal is actually

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.224
to grow in the US, I think
that an accelerator will

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:17.023
help you a lot.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:17.981
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.814
EDITH YEUNG: But we
also invest in companies

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:22.292
where a particular--
a Chinese developer

00:04:22.292 --> 00:04:23.729
focused on China also.

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.700
KORY JEFFREY: Yep.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.044
EDITH YEUNG: So, in
that case, our help

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:29.012
is a little bit different then.

00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:32.317
And coming to accelerator
could help with concept.

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:34.400
But to go to market would
be very, very different.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.030
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah,
growth-hacking in the US versus

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.998
growth-hacking in China would
be two very different things.

00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:38.982
EDITH YEUNG: Yes, that's right.

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:40.065
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.879
So you were on stage
earlier today You

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.069
were talking in a
panel, I believe, right?

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.860
What was kind of the
key messaging that was

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.226
getting across in that panel?

00:04:48.226 --> 00:04:51.600
EDITH YEUNG: So in that panel,
it was all about investing

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.010
and sort of focus
on think through,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.790
at least sharing with
the audience, OK,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.330
what do some of these
investors look like.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.175
I think the big thing
for me to take away,

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:03.300
I was actually quite
surprised most of the audience

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.800
didn't know some of the basic
about this sort of fundraising.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.270
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.810
EDITH YEUNG: And I think there's
a really good book by Brad

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.406
Feld.

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:13.885
Shoot, I forgot the name.

00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:15.045
What is it called again?

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:17.336
KORY JEFFREY: I know exactly
what you're talking about,

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:17.829
but I forget.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:19.037
EDITH YEUNG: Yeah, that book.

00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:21.773
Everybody should
read Brad Feld's book

00:05:21.773 --> 00:05:24.238
to just learn some of the
basics in terms of fundraising.

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:25.224
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.810
EDITH YEUNG: But for
us, for fundraising, we

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.120
invest in any-- for
the first check,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.800
anywhere from 50k up to 200k,
that I actually have done.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.860
I think the big thing
is that early on when

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.610
we evaluate a
particular startup,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.000
it's all about the founder
being very thoughtful about some

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.176
of the early metrics
that they should look at.

00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:50.800
Because we understand
that early on you

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.230
don't have money to do
a lot of paid marketing.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.640
But still, I think, put 100
bucks or a few hundred bucks,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.480
buy Facebook or
Twitter advertising.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.218
Particular focus on consumer,
if you focus on that,

00:06:02.218 --> 00:06:03.010
is not hard, right?

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.843
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:06:03.843 --> 00:06:05.730
EDITH YEUNG: And I
think everybody always

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.320
love to pitch us on, oh,
with like no marketing.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.730
I'm like, OK, sure.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.532
KORY JEFFREY: Not
necessarily a good thing.

00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:13.870
EDITH YEUNG: But I think
early on for founders,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.150
it's only usually a
couple people, right?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.725
And you have to do everything.

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:19.941
And when we talk to
the founders all about

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.000
like thinking through,
oh, is this person

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.830
being really thoughtful of why
they built certain features?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.560
Why did they measure
that versus-- like later

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.636
on, about monetization, we
know that you don't make money.

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:33.330
But it's OK.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.730
So, it's thinking through,
like, why this person?

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.712
Because it's so much
about the founders.

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:39.670
KORY JEFFREY: So as you
walk around here today,

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.430
you'll see there's
all sorts of booths,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.950
so there's all sorts of
different technologies.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.390
EDITH YEUNG: Yep.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.014
KORY JEFFREY: Is there anything
in particular that excites you?

00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:47.080
EDITH YEUNG: Yes, VR.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.746
EDITH YEUNG: VR?

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:51.230
EDITH YEUNG: I'm very bullish
on the virtual reality.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.320
I believe that VR,
especially for next year,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.512
there's a lot of
all the big players.

00:06:57.512 --> 00:06:59.220
Even for you guys,
you had the cardboard.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.170
KORY JEFFREY: Yep.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.211
EDITH YEUNG: And I have
a couple of that at home.

00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:04.760
I'm always testing
all kind of VR app.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.587
I think VR, the platform itself,
will be the next Android.

00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:10.050
KORY JEFFREY: That's very cool.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.072
Do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:07:13.072 --> 00:07:14.530
EDITH YEUNG: I have
to say Android,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.580
because before joining
500, I worked on a Android

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.570
browser called Dolphin.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.800
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.096
EDITH YEUNG: And 90% of our
user base are on Android.

00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:29.130
And I think that
other than the barrier

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:34.000
or maybe-- I guess
we are all Android

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.450
users, which is awesome.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.520
Most other developers--
you guys hear

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.680
that I usually start with iOS.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.120
But they have no idea the
rest of the world, 80,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.885
90% of the world
population use Android.

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:47.010
KORY JEFFREY: That's right.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.176

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:50.416
EDITH YEUNG: That's right.

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:51.392
KORY JEFFREY: --typically
an Android focused thing.

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:52.392
EDITH YEUNG: Definitely.

00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:53.404
Totally bullish.

00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:54.320
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.784
EDITH YEUNG: Big Android fan.

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:56.272
KORY JEFFREY: Big Android.

00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:57.940
