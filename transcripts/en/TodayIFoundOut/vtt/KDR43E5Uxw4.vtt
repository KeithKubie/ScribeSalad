00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.830
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out Youtube channel.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.350
In the video today, we’ll finally be answering
one of the more asked questions in our inbox-

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.650
Why does storing a car battery on a concrete
floor drain it?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.480
Contrary to very popular belief (even touted
by many a mechanic), today's car batteries

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.550
with their hard plastic shells will not discharge
or otherwise be damaged when placed on a concrete

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.550
floor.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.630
(Of course, the other way around isn't always
true, with an already damaged battery leaking

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.690
battery acid on a concrete floor potentially
causing some damage to said concrete.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.300
And if you're curious, see our video: The
Difference Between Concrete and Cement)

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.480
But don't take our word for it.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.310
To quote Interstate Batteries, "The type of
plastic (polypropylene) used in battery cases

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.130
is a great electrical insulator.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.410
Also, tremendous technological improvements
have been made in the seals around the battery

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.370
posts and vent systems, which have virtually
eliminated electrolyte seepage and migration.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.770
So, it's OK to set or store your battery on
concrete."

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.180
So how did this pervasive myth get started?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.219
As with so many such myths, it once had a
basis in fact- a remnant of an era when car

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.109
batteries were made of different materials.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.700
For example, some of the earliest car batteries
were composed of lead-acid contained in glass

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.220
cells, all encased in a tar-lined wooden box.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
Placed on a potentially damp surface such
as concrete, the moisture could cause the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.429
wood to swell and shift, and the glass cells
to break, damaging the battery.

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.810
Advancements in battery technology ultimately
led to a nickel-iron battery known as the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.060
Edison cell, which was more durable but also
had a downside in its classic form.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.619
Encased in steel, an Edison cell battery placed
directly on a concrete floor would discharge

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.979
more quickly than normal.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.759
A subsequent innovation, encasing the battery
in hard rubber, also had its drawbacks, as

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.779
rubber is both made of carbon and a bit porous.

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:52.520
Between the carbon and the pores, together
with moisture and a concrete floor, this could

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.609
potentially lead to a path for the electricity
to flow, resulting in the battery draining.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.070
Today all of these automobile battery-destroying
or current-conducting flaws have been eliminated

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.619
by using plastic shells around the various
types of battery designs.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.810
And the potential problem of damage to the
concrete floor from battery acid leakage has

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.799
also been mostly mitigated, as previously
noted by Interstate Batteries.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.760
However, it is important to note that today's
batteries will still ultimately be drained

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.950
just sitting there, just in different ways.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.670
For example, if a battery's terminals are
dirty with a combination of dirt, dust and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.909
leaked acid, the filth can potentially create
a circuit between the terminals, draining

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.909
the cell.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.849
This is, of course, easily prevented by cleaning
the top of the battery case before storage.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.291
What's not preventable, however, is the fact
that, as with all batteries, a car battery

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:42.340
will self discharge over time due to certain
chemical reactions occurring within the cells.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.900
In fact, a discharge rate of 1%-25% per month
for modern lead-acid car batteries without

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.989
any load is typical, with the two major factors
on discharge rate being temperature and age

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:53.989
of the battery.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.230
This leads us to another common car battery
myth- that cold weather will increase this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.469
self-discharge rate.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.950
In fact, the opposite is true- cold weather
slows the self-discharge (via slower chemical

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.330
reactions) and hot weather speeds it up (via
faster chemical reactions).

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.770
As Pacific Power Batteries notes, "A battery
stored at 95° F (35° C) will self-discharge

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.359
twice as fast than one stored at 75° F (23.9°
C)."

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.249
On top of that, the overall lifespan of the
battery is also diminished when kept in hot

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:30.420
weather vs. cold, with lead-acid car batteries
having about a 60% increase in expected lifespan

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.109
when kept in cold climates instead of tropical
ones according to Pacific Power Batteries.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.799
The idea that cold weather is bad for these
types of lead-acid batteries used for automotive

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.301
purposes most likely derives from the fact
that, in extremely cold weather, a battery

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:48.310
may seem drained when one tries to start a
car, with the car potentially cranking slowly

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.310
or not at all.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.499
Assuming the battery was properly charged
before the car was shut off, in most cases

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.110
this is not because the battery lost its charge
but because, due to the aforementioned slowing

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.129
of chemical reactions, a cold battery simply
isn't capable of outputting as many amps to

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.739
the starter as when it's warm.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.909
An old battery on its last legs may also be
exposed as such in this scenario with its

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.810
cranking amp ability already diminished with
normal age-related reduction in capacity.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.880
On top of that, the problem is (potentially)
made worse by the fact that an extremely cold

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.000
engine may in some cases take more cranking
amps than normal to turn over- all potentially

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.949
contributing to people thinking cold weather
is worse for the battery than hot.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.210
For reference here, according to Industrial
Battery Products, a typical lead-acid car

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.199
battery will see about a 50% drop in its normal
cranking amps at -22° F (-30° C) vs. around

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.590
75° F (24° C).

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.110
On the flip-side, that same battery would
see about a 12% increase in cranking amps

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.699
at 122° F (50° C) vs. 75° F (24° C).

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.789
Thus, if you were to place a cold lead-acid
battery back in a relatively warm environment,

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.560
once it warmed up, you'd find its cranking
amps restored and that it actually would have

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.090
maintained its charge level much better in
the interim while it sat there vs. stored

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.990
in a hot environment; this is all thanks to
the very same slowing of chemical reactions

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.810
that reduces the battery's cranking amp output
ability in colder temperatures.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.919
So, in the end, cold storage is ideal for
this type of battery (and many others) if

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.400
one is interested in extending the battery's
useful lifespan or otherwise conserving as

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.699
much energy potential as possible when storing
the battery.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.630
Which for most people's car usage is what
they're doing with the battery the vast majority

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.949
of the hours of the day.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.009
And if you make sure to get a battery with
a large enough buffer of cranking amps for

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.051
your particular car (which is generally the
default option anyway), the reduction in cold

00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:44.180
weather shouldn't be much of an issue until
the battery is nearing the end of its lifespan.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.919
Now, you might at this point be wondering
about extreme cold weather scenarios.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.160
The chemical reactions going on in the battery
leading to self-draining continue to slow

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.460
(and the overall lifespan of the battery continues
to increase) the colder the battery is kept.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.550
However, there does come a point when the
water content of the lead-acid batteries may

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.729
freeze and crack the cell casing.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.669
But this physical damage isn't something most
outside of the coldest environments ever have

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.669
to deal with.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.360
For reference, according to Interstate Batteries,
a fully charged lead-acid car battery shouldn't

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.840
have any freezing issues until around -76°
F (-60° C), whereas a fully drained battery

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.030
will begin to freeze at just 32° F (0° C)-
the lesson here being you definitely want

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.090
to make sure a car battery being stored in
cold weather areas starts out with at least

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.090
some charge.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.860
And as long as it is charged up, the cold
weather will actually be functioning to extend

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.080
the car battery's overall useful lifespan,
not hurting it, as so many think.
