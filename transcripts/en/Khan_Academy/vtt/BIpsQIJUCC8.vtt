00:00:00.751 --> 00:00:03.457
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that you love frozen yogurt.

00:00:03.457 --> 00:00:05.477
So every day after school you decide

00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:07.230
to go to the frozen yogurt store

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.154
at exactly four o'clock, four o'clock PM.

00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:13.871
Now, because you like
frozen yogurt so much,

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:16.089
you are not a big fan of having to wait

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.573
in line when you get
there, you're impatient,

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:21.092
you want your frozen yogurt immediately.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.227
And so you decide to conduct a study.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:24.749
You want to figure out the probability

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.815
of there being lines of different sizes

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:29.091
when you go to the frozen yogurt store

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.388
after school, exactly at four o'clock PM.

00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:35.035
So in your study, the
next 50 times you observe,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.194
you go to the frozen
yogurt store at four PM,

00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:39.214
you make a series of observations.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:41.930
You observe the size of the line.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.753
So, let me make two columns here,

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:48.506
line size is the left column,

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.274
and on the right column,

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:53.906
let's say this is the
number of times observed.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:58.322
So, times observed, observed.

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:05.897
All right, times observed,
my handwriting is,

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:10.548
O-B-S-E-R-V-E-D, all
right, times observed.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.287
All right, so let's first think about it.

00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:15.168
Okay, so you go and you say, hey look,

00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:19.185
I see no people in line,
exactly, or you see

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.593
no people in line, exactly 24 times.

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:27.194
You see one person in line

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:29.448
exactly 18 times,

00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:35.069
and you see two people in
line exactly eight times.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.757
And, in your 50 visits,
you don't see more,

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:39.638
you never see more than
two people in line.

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:42.157
I guess this is a very efficient cashier

00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:45.141
at this frozen yogurt store.

00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.996
So based on this, based
on what you have observed,

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:52.196
what would be your estimate
of the probabilities

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:55.431
of finding no people in
line, one people in line,

00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:59.170
or two people in line,
at four PM on the days

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.688
after school that you visit
the frozen yogurt store?

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.591
You only visit it on weekdays
where there are schooldays.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.204
So what's the probability
of there being no line,

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:08.259
a one person line, or a two person line

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.239
when you visit at four PM on a school day?

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:16.545
Well, all you can do is
estimate the true probability,

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:18.265
the true theoretical probability.

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:19.808
We don't know what that is, but

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:22.201
you've done 50 observations here right.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.187
I know that this adds up to 50,

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:29.180
18 plus eight is 26, 26 plus 24 is 50,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.830
so you've done 50 observations here

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.432
and so you can figure out, well what are

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:34.905
the relative frequencies
of having zero people?

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.064
What is the relative
frequency of one person,

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:40.291
or the relative frequency
of two people in line?

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.429
And then we can use that as

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.309
the estimates for the probability.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.072
So let's do that.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.401
So, probability estimate.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.433
I'll do it in the next column.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:53.223
So probability, probability estimate,

00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:56.684
and once again we can do that by

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:58.704
looking at the relative frequency.

00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:02.001
The relative frequency of zero, well we

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.821
observed that 24 times out of 50.

00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:08.808
So, 24 out of 50 is the same thing

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:13.011
as 0.48,

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:16.446
or you could even say that this is 48%.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.294
Now, what's the relative frequency

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:20.794
of seeing one person in line?

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.495
Well you observed that
18 out of the 50 visits,

00:03:25.682 --> 00:03:28.433
18 out of the 50 visits, that
would be a relative frequency,

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:31.795
18 divided by 50 is 0.36,

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:35.926
which is 36% of your visits.

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:38.520
And then, finally, the relative frequency

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.691
of seeing a two person line, that was

00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.977
eight out of the 50 visits,

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.467
and so that it 0.16,

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:51.364
and that is equal to 16% of the visits.

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.502
And so, there's interesting things here.

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:55.220
Remember, these are
estimates of the probability.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.902
You're doing this by essentially sampling

00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:00.328
what the line on 50 different
days, you don't know,

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:02.848
it's not gonna always be exactly this,

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:05.906
but it's a good estimate,
you did it 50 times.

00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:08.358
And so based on this, you'd
say, well I'd estimate

00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:11.458
the probability of having
a zero person line as 48%.

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.629
I'd estimate the probability of

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.731
having a one person line as 36%.

00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:17.692
I'd estimate the probability of having

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:21.013
a two person line is 16%, or is 0.16.

00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:22.533
It's important to realize that

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:23.775
these are legitimate probabilities.

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:25.737
Remember, to be a
probability, it has to be

00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:29.058
between zero and one, it
has to be zero and one.

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.949
And if you look at all
of the possible events,

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.886
it should add up to one,
because at least based on

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:36.034
your observations, these
are the possibilities.

00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:38.205
Obviously in a real world,
it might be some kind

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:39.865
of crazy thing where
more people go in line.

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:42.489
But at least based on the
events that you've seen,

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:44.253
these three different
events, and these are

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:46.053
the only three that you've observed,

00:04:46.053 --> 00:04:50.371
based on your observations,
these three should add,

00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:51.926
cause these are the only
three things you've observed,

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:54.863
they should add up to one,
and they do add up to one.

00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:57.873
Let's see, 36 plus 16 is 52,

00:04:57.873 --> 00:05:00.961
52 plus 48, they add up to one.

00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:02.743
Now, if once you do this,

00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:04.745
you might do something interesting.

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.035
You might say, okay, you know what,

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:09.317
over the next two years,

00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:13.139
you plan on visiting 500 times.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.967
So visiting 500 times,

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:22.253
so based on your estimates

00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:24.993
of the probability of having no line,

00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:27.325
of a one person line,
or a two person line,

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:31.070
how many times in your
next 500 visits would you

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.448
expect there to be a two person line?

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:37.246
Based on your observations so far.

00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:39.847
Well, it's reasonable to say,

00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:44.386
well a good estimate
of the number of times

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.142
you'll see a two person line
when you visit 500 times,

00:05:47.142 --> 00:05:49.857
well you say, well there's
gonna be 500 times,

00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:52.574
and it's a reasonable expectation,

00:05:52.574 --> 00:05:55.140
based on your estimate
of the probability that

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.309
0.16 of the time,

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:01.370
you will see a two person line.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.309
Or you could say eight
out of every 50 times.

00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:06.608
And so what is this going to be?

00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:09.508
Let's see, 500 divided by 50 is just 10,

00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:14.508
so you would expect that
80 out of the 500 times

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.692
you would see a two person line.

00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:20.680
Now to be clear, I would be shocked if

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.550
it's exactly 80 ends up being the case,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.930
but this is actually a very good

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.183
expectation based on your observations.

00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:28.527
It is completely possible, first of all,

00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:30.443
that your observations were off.

00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:33.485
That you, you know, that
it's just the random chance

00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:35.400
that you happened to observe this many

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.083
or this few times that there
were two people in line.

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:39.127
So that could be off.

00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:41.891
But even if these are very good estimates,

00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:45.884
it's possible that something, that you see

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:48.753
a two person line 85 out of the 500 times,

00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:51.655
or 65 out of the 500 times.

00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:53.489
All of those things are possible.

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.112
And it's always very
important to keep in mind,

00:06:56.112 --> 00:06:59.828
you're estimating the
true probability here,

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:01.639
which it's very hard to know for sure

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.158
what the true probability is,
but you can make estimates

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:07.521
based on sampling the
line on different days,

00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:11.352
by making these observations,
by having these experiments

00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:13.300
so to speak, each of these observations

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.728
you could use in experiment, and then you

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.061
can use those to set an expectation.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.941
But none of these things
do you know for sure,

00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:21.020
that they're definitely gonna be

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.363
exactly 80 out of the next 500 times.
