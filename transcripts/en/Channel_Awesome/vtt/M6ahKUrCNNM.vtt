00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.099
From one Halloween movie with Under-wraps to another one with Halloweentown. But sadly, unlike Under-wraps

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.709
This is pretty much exactly what I thought I was gonna get with a cheap lame Disney Channel movie

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.649
I guess they made a couple sequels to this, but God help me if I can figure out why. This is stupid!

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.949
This is the kind of movie you would see on Mystery Science Theater

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220
It's filled with hokey acting, lame effects, and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.950
surprisingly, not very creative ideas. That is to say, the initial setup is not that bad

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Three kids are forbidden to go out on Halloween

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.789
Because the mother says they can't. But things start to turn around when their grandmother, played by the late

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.589
Debbie Reynolds, literally flies in and says that she needs the mother's help. The kids overhear,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.829
Follow the grandma, and discover that she is in fact a witch and they follow her on this magic bus to Halloweentown

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.609
And if you're anything like me you're thinking Halloweentown is gonna be something like Halloweentown the one from Nightmare Before Christmas

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.618
Weird buildings, dark, creepy, odd, everything a little askew

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.119
But nope! It's a bright cheerful place that just has a bunch of people in Halloween masks. Oh, I mean uh ghouls and goblins, ooh

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.959
But Halloween town is in trouble because this evil bad guy who

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.760
Kind of looks like a mix between the Grim Reaper, and Jim Carrey's Grinch and acts about as subtle

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.680
"Welcome to my museum! AHAHAHAH!!"

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.880
Wants Halloweentown to take over the land of the humans

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.360
So they don't have to live apart anymore. Actually doesn't sound like that bad of a plan

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.100
I'm not sure why they're separate anyway

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.760
But nevertheless, the grandma tries to teach the kids how they can be little witches and warlocks to come together and stop his evil magic

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.139
Okay, so from a setup like this, obviously story is not gonna be a biggie

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.559
This is some excuse to have some really creative images and ideas

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.610
And characters and so on and so forth and that's not for the most part what we get here. The writing's not especially

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.869
Imaginative it just sort of goes by the numbers. "Hey look, a ghost. Hey look, a werewolf." The acting isn't necessarily awful

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.349
But it's just bad enough. Like the 13 year old is supposed to be odd and strange and a bit of a weirdo

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:24.469
"Seeing as how Marnie likes weird stuff so much." "She's got the weird part down pat." "Halloween is like made for her."

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.100
Okay

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.019
Look and listen to this kid and tell me if you would get that "And how are we supposed to grow up if we can't

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.920
explore the world?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.140
Try new stuff and take some risks?" uh-huh No Daria is a weird kid. The Monster Squad are weird kids

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.189
You're like the cheerleader from American Beauty trying to be weird

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.850
But doing a really bad job at it because you're the everyday average kid

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.120
There's nothing odd about you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.160
The brother is the typical geek with all the analysis and book smarts that he brings up at every single moment because that's all he is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.699
"Give me a good nature documentary any day." "Well all that candy causes cavities and gum disease."
 "trees are important, too,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.959
you know." "Everyone's got their thermostat set to 68 degrees." Degrees, science

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.299
That's my entire character! Never seen that before! And the smallest one is so bad, they only give her a sentence at a time

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.350
Hell sometimes just a word at a time "I was pretending."

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.919
"I wished the lock would turn into a frog." "The bad thing." the only one who's ever doing a good job is Debbie Reynolds

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.800
I don't know what it is. She acted like every single part

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.510
She got was the role she always wanted to play. She just puts everything into it

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.419
And she's 100% believable even in such a silly idea

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.860
"I don't like witches. They're mean and scary" "Oh no no no, sweetheart. I mean they're just like everyone else; some are kind, some are mean. That's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.739
That's the way they use their magic." Aside from that, I'll give some credit to some of the creativity in the make up

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.979
I mean don't get me wrong. They're obviously masks. They don't look real, but they're kind of like the Evil Dead movies

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.929
You know they're fake, but they're very creatively fake. Some of them have really cool designs, and I specially loved this skeleton taxi driver. "Oh,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.589
first time in town for you kids?" Look at this thing! Look how expressive it is. It would have been so easy just to have a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.589
Skeleton in a cap hat and just have the mouth move up and down

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.959
But look at this. The eyebrows have a lot of motion, the mouth is moving left and right as well as up and down

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:25.020
It's actually a really good effect, but then they ruin it with this line: "It's probably an animatronic. Disneyland's full of stuff like that."

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.340
What? What are you doing, you dick?! Don't ruin the illusion!

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.140
That's like someone coming out to the Muppet Show saying "yeah, you're probably all puppets most likely from the Jim

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.419
Henson studio." Little douchebag! Once in a while

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.809
there's a joke that gets a little bit of a laugh like I enjoy how the witches microwave has boil and bubble and toil and

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.560
So forth. There's a fun little segment where the kids have to get ingredients for a spell like:

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.989
hair of a werewolf, Fang of a vampire, and sweat of a ghost. How do they do that in this world? By going to a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.030
Barbershop, a dentist, and a gym, of course! Leading to probably the film's best line: "Ghosts are dead.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.349
Why would they worry about fitness?" but aside from that, it's pretty empty.

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.919
I mean just look at this place when I hear Halloweentown,

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.549
I want to see something dark and creepy and whimsical, not just any other town with people wearing some masks

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.560
It's kind of like a mix between a bad

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:19.799
Goosebumps episode and that really lame Babes in Toyland starring Keanu Reeves. The few creative elements are nice

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.210
but it's not enough to cover up the cheapness of both the writing and the budget I

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:30.149
Suppose if you have like little little kids, this is fine. Or I don't know, maybe it did have more of an audience than

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.599
I thought they made a ton of sequels, but when you hear "Halloweentown"

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.579
And you think of something more like what the cover looks like as opposed to this bright suburban sunny day

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.039
Then I say this is a definite pass
