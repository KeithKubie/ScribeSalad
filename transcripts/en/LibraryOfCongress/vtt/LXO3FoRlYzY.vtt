&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.180
&gt;&gt;Aimee Picard Soller:
Our author today,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.410
Chris Bohjalian describes
himself in a social media bio

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.240
as author, bicyclist, and gym rat.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.960
He is those things I'm sure,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.550
as well as New York Times
best-selling author of 19 books.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.820
His novel, Midwives, was a number
one New York Times best seller,

and a New England Booksellers
Association discovery pick.

His work has been translated
into over 30 languages

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.250
and three motion pictures.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.360
And, a fourth is in the works

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.110
with the Sandcastle Girls being
adapted from a feature film.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.860
He's written for many
publications including the Times,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.690
the Washington Post,
Cosmopolitan, and Readers Digest.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.990
He is currently a fellow

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.670
of the Vermont academy
of arts and sciences.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.640
And his latest novel,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.630
"The Sleepwalkers" was
released in January.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.670
And, readers can anxiously
anticipate his next novel,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.610
The Flight Attendant, in March.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.050
Chris's awards include the

his work in educating Americans

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.750
about the Armenian genocide.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.310
The Armenian National Committee
of America Arts and Letters Award

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.280

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.490
A Boston public library
literary light.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.670
A finalist for the Lamda Literary
Awards for Trans Sister Radio.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
A best lifestyle column
for Idyll Banter,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.030
and the Vermont Press Association.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.800
Fans of his work marvel at his
ability to develop a character

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.160
with such depth and
article language.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.390
He says that he allows
the characters to develop

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.710
and lead him through the stories.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.490
His books are always
edited using a fountain pen

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.390
as he says they are messy and
they force you to think slowly.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.470
Chris has said that he
found his voice in Vermont

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.880
where he lives with
his wife Victoria.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.820
That is there he was able to
develop the novels and characters

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.300
that readers have come
to know and love.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.800
We are very glad that he's
brought his voice here to DC

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.420 position:56%
in the national book festival today.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.850
Please note that after
Chris's remarks he will be

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.970
in the book signing section
from 1 to 2 p.m. Please join me

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:35.560
in welcoming Chris to
the festival stage.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.860
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.160
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: Thank you,
Amy, for that introduction.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.570
It is a pleasure, it is an
honor, it is a privilege to be

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.460
at the national book festival.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.900
Today -- I spoke yesterday at the
Library of Congress which is one

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.360
of the great honors any
author can ever experience.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.660 position:56%
I thank all of you for celebrating
with me today with words and reading

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.300
and books can mean to the soul.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.740
It's a particular pleasure to be
with all of you this afternoon

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.430
because I'm not on a book tour.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.050
Make no mistake.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.380
I like book tours.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.100
It wasn't all that long ago
that my book sold briskly

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.980
but only among people
with my last name.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.870
I try never to lose sight of that.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.430
Most people presume, however,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.730
that book tours are
unbelievably glamorous.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.630
You jet around the country and
you hang with Oprah and Katie

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.700
and Terry Gross and sell
whole pallets of books.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.360
But, the reality of
most book tours is this.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.900
They have moments that
are far more humbling

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.470
than our honorific this afternoon.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.030
I will share with you but one.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.910
I am in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.850
I get to the airport at five
in the morning because I am

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.370
on a 6 a.m. flight to
Jackson, Mississippi.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.610
When I get there everything on
the concourse is closed except

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.260
for one guy with a cart selling
something he calls a gritty cat.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.490
A bear claw pastry that has
been deep fried in grits.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.270
I'm thinking to myself I'm going
to have one of those bad boys.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.620
I'm just about to get on
a turbo prop, why not.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.260
So, I had my gritty cat.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.560
It's not bad.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.860
Get on the plane.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.410
It's a 17-seater and there
are three other passengers,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.540
and it's a really choppy rainy day.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.500 position:56%
And, so, the pilot says we're going
to be on the tarmac for a little bit

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.900
and it's going to be a choppy
ride, no cabin service.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.010
We take off and it is choppy.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.220
We've been in the air no
more than, I don't know,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.040
three and a half minutes when the
woman two rows behind me vomits.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.640
So, I'm thinking to myself
I'm a frequent flier but just

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.300
in case let's get the
air sickness bag.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.900
So, I reach into in seat pocket
to get the air sickness bag

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.790
and there's not one there.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.310
At which point the gentleman
a few rows ahead of me vomits.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.280
So, I'm thinking to myself
these are more desperate times

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.580
than you realize.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.800
So, I unbuckle, stand up
planning to go seat to seat

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.100
to find an air sickness bag.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.400
So, I stand up unbuckled

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.390
and the flight attendant
says to me sir, sit down.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.690
Sit down now.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.860
And, in a post 911 era when a
flight attendant says sit down,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.630
sit down now, you do, and I did.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.370
And, at that point, the third other
passenger vomited leaving me the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.140
last passenger standing.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.280
So, we do level out, and we are
circling for a really long time

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.940
over Jackson because
the air is so choppy,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.240
and I'm concreasingly
worried about this chop

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.540
and whether I'm going to make it.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.230
But, finally, the pilot says
we're about to begin our descent.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.030 position:56%
And I'm thinking you're good, but we
hit a bump, and it was pretty scary.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.040
So, I reach into the
seat pocket ahead of me,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.340
take out the in flight magazine,
rip out two thick glossy pages,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.440
swirl them into a snow
cone, fold the bottom.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.390
And, I don't know whether it is
a thousand feet above Jackson

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.400
or 2,000 feet above Jackson,
but you're looking at the guy

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.230
who created the first ever
airborne snow cone of vomit.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.640
So, we land.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.140
And, the flight attendants
very grateful

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.870
that I don't give him my
airborne snow cone of vomit.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.170
I go to the men's room.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.170
I clean myself up.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.030
And, then I go to baggage.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.610
Whenever you are on a book tour
your publisher gives you an escort.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.910
Not that kind.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.820
These are the lovely woman and men
who know where all of the libraries

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.740
and the book stores are and they
get you to and from the airport

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.000 position:56%
and you find them in baggage because
they are holding up your book.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.620
So, I go into baggage and I
see a woman holding a book.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.200
Not my book, and I'm thinking
wow, that's a cookbook.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.590
One of the people on the
plane with you was a chef.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.990
But, then she says Chris.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.600
And, I said yes.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.110
And, she says hi -- and
she introduces herself --

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.360
and she says I forgot your book
at home but I found this cookbook

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.820
in the back seat of the car and
figured it would do just fine.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.590
And then she says I
got some bad news.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.780
You circled so long that
you missed your slot

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.250
on the public radio station.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.550
And, I said that's okay.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.100
And, then she says
you must be hungry.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.910
And, as a matter of fact, I was.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.100
And, so she said I'm going to bring
you to the best waffles in Jackson.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.400
And, I get in the car with her.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.360
And, we drive and we
drive, and all of a sudden,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.790
we are in the country
nowhere near a restaurant.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.460
And, I realized I am living
out Steven King's misery.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.180
I am never going to see my
wife and daughter again.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.880
And, in the middle of
nowhere, we pull into a house.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.960
And, in all fairness,
it's a really nice house.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.120
We're talking serious medomansion.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.750
But, she gets out of
the car, and I'm sitting

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.070
in the passenger seat
thinking do you text in 911.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.200
And, she says in her best Sandra
Bullock The Blindside voice well,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.500
are you coming.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.160
And, I realized I was a coming.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.850
So, I got out of the
car, I follow her

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.030
into the garage and there's a door.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.980
And, I know that behind that door
is either a kitchen or a dungeon.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.950
We open the door and
yes, it's a kitchen.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.530
And, in there are four
guys in golf clothes.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.890
Two massive William snow
[inaudible] waffle makers.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.530
She's brought me to her house where
her husband, her brother in law,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.320
and their two best friends from
Minnesota get together every week

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.860
in October for golf and waffles.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.050
She welcomes me into
this wonderful man cave.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.650
And, her husband says
to me with a red bull

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.250
and a green bull what would
you like on your waffles.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.780
We got ourselves pulled
pork and Cajun shrimp.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.090
And, I said I'm a blueberry
waffle man myself.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:43.550
And, his wife says George, I
told you, he's a vegetarian.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.960
At which point George -- and I'm
not making up one word of this --

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.260
says I'm going to make
you something special.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.350
He gets on a stool, reaches up
into the top shelf of the pantry,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.330
gets down a bag of grits and says
you ever had yourself a gritty

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.630
cat waffle.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:07.500
I actually categorized this
among the unhorrific moments

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.760
because it was a really
lovely morning and the way

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.990
that this woman welcomed
me into her home

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.660
and her family it was
a great, great day.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:21.960 position:56%
It's a particular pleasure to be at
this book festival because it is all

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.660
about libraries and the
Library of Congress.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.900
I am a novelist for lot of reasons.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.650
But, a big one are libraries.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:40.000
And, very specifically the
Hialeah Miami Lakes public library

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.220
in south Florida.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.990
When I was in eighth grade,
my family moved from a suburb

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.920
of New York City to Miami, Florida,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.120
which is arguably another
suburb of New York City.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.070
And, we moved there the
Friday of Labor Day weekend.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.930
That Tuesday, I started school
at Palm Springs Junior High.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.960
And, then I went to see
my new orthodontist.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.480
A sagest it would turn
out if there ever was one.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.740
He gave me some orthodontic
headgear that looked

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.270
like the business end of a back ho.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.490
Think Bane from the movie
Batman, the Dark Knight.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.520
And, I had to wear this
device for four hours a day.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.370
I wasn't allowed to sleep
when I was wearing it,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.670
I couldn't speak when
I was wearing it.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.230
So, I would come home from
Palm Springs Junior High.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.240
I would put in my headgear
and I would go

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.700
to the Hialeah Miami Lakes
public library and I would read.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.890
And, I would read so
many of the books

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:43.000
that an eighth grader was likely
to read in the late 1970's.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.100
Steven King had started publishing
his remarkable grand [inaudible].

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.980
I read William Peter
Blatty's, The Exorcist.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.370
Peter Benchley's deceptively
wonderful and really appropriate

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.490
if you live in south
Florida novel, Jaws.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.920
And, I read a higher caliber
of literature as well.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.970
It was at that library
for the first time

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.150
that I read Harper Lee's
To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:19.340 position:56%
And, Joyce Carol Oates national book
award winning The Expensive People.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.330
I still recall the first
sentences of Expensive People.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.270
Five words.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.300
I was a child murderer.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.680
The next three pages deconstruct
that one short sentence.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.480
Is the narrator an adult

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.940
who one time is a child
accidently kill someone.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.190
Or, something far darker,
an adult serial killer

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.750
who on a regular basis
murder small children.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.410
I was a child murderer.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.730
From those books, I learned so much

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.460
that would help me
as an adult writer.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.660
From the Blatty and the Benchly,
I first learned the importance

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.530
of linear momentum
and narrative drive.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.620
What is it in a book that
keeps us turning the pages

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.590 position:56%
into the small hours of the morning.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:20.080
From Harper Lee and Joyce Carol
Oates I first began to realize

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:26.570
that the narrator in a first-person
novel is a fictional construct too.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.950
And, every bit is made up
is the fictional characters

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.740
around him or her.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.840
Now, you would think after
an epiphany like that

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.420
in eighth grade I would be
killing it as a young writer.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.750
Nope. You're looking
at a guy who managed

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.010
to amass 250 rejection slips
before I sold a single word.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.180
When you graduate from college,
Penguin Random House doesn't say

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.220
to you you look like a
young writer, promise.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.250
Here's a boat load of
money, go write us a book.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.090
So, you get a day job.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.520
And, I was working in
New York City at an adage

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.460
and see my work was
working as a bond trader

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.200 position:56%
on the 104th floor of 2 World Trade.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.720
And, every day between
five and 7 a.m.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.780
in the morning I would
write fiction.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.020
I would write very F Scott
Fitzgerald short stories

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.610
and send them relentlessly to
the New Yorkers and Harpers

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.000 position:56%
and the Suwanee review and be
summarily and consistently rejected.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.450
And, I remember when I got
rejection number 250 thinking

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.230
to myself plan A not working.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:43.280 position:56%
Time to try plan B. And, at the time
Cosmopolitan was publishing a lot

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.580
of fiction.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.170
So, I rounded up six months'
worth of Cosmopolitans

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.970
and I read them thoroughly
really trying

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:56.510
to understand what constitutes
a Cosmopolitan short story.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.160
And, then I wrote one.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.730
It's about a female super model
who lives in lower Manhattan

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.670
and is married to a fabulously
wealthy arbitrage trader

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.260 position:56%
but their marriage is kind of dicey.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.820
So, one weekend she goes out to
their equally cool beach house

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.020
on Fire Island, the Atlantic Ocean,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.840
to see if their marriage
can be saved but instead,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.540
spends the entire time playing
scantily clad beach volley ball.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.720
Cosmopolitan bought it.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.440
First story I ever sold.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.350
And for the archivists among us,
I need to tell you that it is

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.960
in a very special issue
of Cosmopolitan.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.600
The only issue of Cosmopolitan,
a magazine that is known for sex,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.270
that ever had nudity in it.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.900
I am in the yes, infamous now build
your better bust breast issue.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.060
My mother was so proud.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:59.320
After that story was published,
much to my utter astonishment,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.550
literary agents began
to approach me.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:07.920
And they all asked the same
thing, have you written a novel.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.840
And, I haven't which was ironic

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.660
because in college
I'd never been one

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.280
of those young writers
desperately trying

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.460
to understand the [inaudible]
natural magic of Lori Moore,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.770
Andre Debus, Raymond Carver, the
masters of the modern short story.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.860
I'd always love the
door stops, [inaudible],

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.670
the 40 days of Musa Dagh.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.370
Anna Karenina.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:46.880
But, urged on by these agents, I
gave up the immediate gratification

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.660
of writing the short story to
hunker down and write a novel.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.370
And, a year later, I had one.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.330
And, much to my other astonishment,
an agent sold it instantly.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.140
Now, in all fairness
this was the late 1980's

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.390
when grocery lists
could be sold as novels.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.610
But, it was a novel and it
was going to be published.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:18.360
My wife and I moved from our 520
square foot apartment in Brooklyn

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.490
to an 1898 Victorian in
Vermont, and I continued to work

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.020
at ad agencies here so, you know,

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.710
we'd have a health plan
and mortgage money.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.550
And, the novel was published.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.820
But, now we're living in Vermont.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.650
And, you are looking at
the author responsible

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.030
for the single worst first
novel ever published bar none.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.560
How bad is that first book.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.630
On a Sunday afternoon in
Vermont, my wife gets a phone call

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.250
from her college roommate who
lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.310
and says oh, my gosh, Chris's book,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.300
it's reviewed in the
Boston Globe today.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.360
This is my first major review
so my wife says oh, my gosh,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.440
that's wonderful, is it good?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.480
And, her roommate realizing she has
made an egregious mistake calling

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.270
says I don't remember.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:15.180
So, my wife says can
you read it to us.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.380
And, her roommate thinking
infinitely more quickly now says I

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.420
would but I've already bound
the newspapers up for recycling

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.850
and they're in the
basement of the apartment.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.870
This was 1989.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.270
Years before you could
go www.dotbostonglobe.com

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.570
and assess the carnage.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.790 position:56%
So, I had to wait until the next day
to go to the Fletcher free library

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.990
in Burlington Vermont to read
the day before's Boston Globe

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.560
and a review of my first novel
that ends with this paragraph.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:52.210
And, so, although Bohjalin attacks
his first novel with real energy,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.530
his writing is stylus
and without grace.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.390
And, the quaint Saint Martin's
tradition of citing the editors

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.730
in the acknowledgements in this
case did absolutely nothing

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.580
to insure the quality of
editorial detail a subpar debut

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.770
in every way I can imagine
and some I probably can't.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.300
Now, that was 19 books ago.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.420
Aren't you all glad
you're here today?

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.020
That was 19 books ago.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.550
If nothing else, because the
Malcolm Gladwell 10,000-hour rule,

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.140
I had to have gotten at
least a little better.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:32.210
Which brings me to the
Sleepwalker, my most recent novel.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:38.450
The Sleepwalker actually had its
origins when I was having lunch

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.040
with the director of the University

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.520
of Vermont hospital sleep
center in Burlington.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.090
I was going to write a book about
dreams, that great fright in abyss,

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.950
the id, the subconscious.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.040
And, I wanted to understand
the physiology

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.160
of the brain when we dream.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.110
And, he had just come from a
patient who was a sleep walker.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.840
And, so rather naturally our
conversation gravitated there.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.710
And, suddenly, he was telling me
stories of people who sleep cook,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:19.130
sleep drive, sleep jog,
sleep sex, sleep murder.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.410
And, I was absolutely entranced.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:28.840
I knew that this, this was what I
wanted my next novel to be about.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.570
This was especially interesting
to me because I love the research

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.710
that goes into a novel and
sleep study is a very new field.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:45.970
It was only in 1968 that the
term arousal disorder was coined.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:52.630
It wasn't until 1979 that modern
medicine began to categorize all

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.840
of the different kinds of
parasomnias that exist.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.110
And, forensics sleep medicine,
the investigation of sleep crime,

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:10.250
as a discipline, it
dates back only to 2007.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.670
Moreover, sleep walking
is very common.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.340
10% of children sleep walk.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.280
Nearly 4% of adults do too.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.830
If you have depression or an
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.340
you are three and one half
times more likely to sleep walk.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.620
The University of Vermont
hospital sleep center had six beds

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.320
and they are filled almost
every night of the year.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.400 position:56%
Now, in all fairness, a lot of those
beds are for patients being treated

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.440
for sleep apnea, but
you see my point,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.980
sleep walking is very, very common.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:53.830
Now, here is what sleep
walking is not.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.440
Acting out a dream.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.110
Sleep walking occurs in the
earlier cycles of sleep.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:09.350
Dreams tend to occur in the latter
rapid eye movement cycles of sleep.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.350
Here's what sleep walking is.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:17.800
Imagine that the part of your
brain that controls judgment

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.700
and motor activity,
the part of your brain

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.530 position:56%
that controls motor activity is wide
awake, and the part of your brain

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.630
that controls judgment and
memory is sound asleep.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.830
Virtually, anything you can do
when you are awake you can do

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.150
when you are sleep walking.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.700
What triggers sleep walking.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:50.200
Exhaustion, stress, alcohol, sleep
deprivation, certain medications.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.250
We've all heard stories of the
way certain sleep aids lead

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.280
to sleep walking experiences.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:02.170
And, it may come down to one little
chemical messenger in the brain,

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.540
gama aminobutyric acid or GABBA.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.920
It calms the brain and
it helps us to sleep.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.530 position:56%
And, it develops as we grow up which
is why children are more likely

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.750
to sleep walk than adults.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.620
Scientists speculate
that some adults

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.980
who sleep walk may simply have
GABBA never fully developed

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.200
or that is far more
sensitive to those triggers.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.190
As you can see, I loved
researching this book.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.560
John Gardener, great teacher

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.700
of writing short story writing
novelist once said there are two

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.100
ways to wake a reader
from the fictional dream.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:46.880
Clumsiness, bad writing, and
inauthenticity, bad research.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.800
I've been guilty of both.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.040
I certainly know when I have
writers block in the morning

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.170
that it means I haven't
done my homework.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:01.550
I haven't done sufficient research
to really understand the scene

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.800
and so I need to roll up my
sleeves and do some more.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.340
But, I also know this.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:14.650
All of you who give me the
great gift of reading my books,

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.910
which is an honor and I
can't thank you you enough,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.330
read my books not necessarily to
learn something though you might.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.940
You might learn something
about sleep walking.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.410
You might learn something
about the Armenian genocide

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:31.180
but you read my books for the same
reason I read the books of so many

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.340
of the amazing authors here because
I'm entranced by the characters

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.670
and I want to know what's
going to happen to them.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.170
Because there's something in
the story that is causing me

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:46.350 position:56%
to phonetically turn the pages which
brings me back to sort of the yin

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.120
and yang of that John
Gardener quote.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.970
And, it's a quote I
love from Ian Forrester.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.450
We all know that fiction
is truer than history

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.580 position:56%
because it goes beyond the evidence.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.760
I think about that quote
a lot when I am writing.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:13.650
My goal in life is never to
write the same book twice.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.120
That point noted, I think
my books tend to fall

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.610 position:56%
into two sort of general categories.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.880
Contemporary literature
and historical fiction.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.960
The contemporary literature well,
it's such books as the Double Bind

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.760
about Laurel Estabrook, a social
worker in Vermont who works

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.500
with the homeless who believes

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.480
that she has found among
her clients the bastard son

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.450
of J Gadsby in Daisy Fay Buchanan.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.290
Or, Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.200
About Emily Shepherd, a 16 year
old girl trying desperately

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.770
to keep it together after a melt

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.370
down at Vermont's lone
nuclear plant.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:02.490
The historical fiction well, it
falls into such realms as the Light

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.060
in the Ruins about one
Italian families collaboration

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:11.750
with the Nazis and the
price they will pay even

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.890
after the second world war.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.010
Or, the Sandcastle Girls,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:21.610
a big sweeping epic love
story set in a Aleppo, yes.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:25.760
That Aleppo that has broken all
of our hearts the last five years

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.290
in 1915 in the mist of
the Armenian genocide.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.360
But, all of these books I think
have two threads in common

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.980
that you will see woven
into the sleep -- is this.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.440
And, it's an emotion.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.740
It's a sensation.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.220
And, whenever I think of it,
I think of a moment in one

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.480
of my absolute favorite
television shows ever, Madman.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.640
You don't have to have
seen a moment of the show

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.140
to know this sensation,
but here's the scene.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.480
A middle school aged girl named
Sally Draper gets out of a cab

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.560
on New York city's upper east side.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.010
And, instead of going to school as
she is supposed to, she goes home.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.160
And, everyone who's watching this
scene knows that she is going

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.070
to catch her father in bed with the
downstairs neighbor and it is going

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.050
to be devastating for
dad and daughter.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.700
And, I'm watching the scene
alone in my TV room in Vermont

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.320
at five of 11 on a Sunday night.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.600
And, I'm talking to
the television set.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.660
I'm saying no, Sally, no, no.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.960
Get back in the cab.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.260
Go to school.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.560 position:56%
Don't go home, but she does go home.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.720
She catches her father and
it is indeed cataclysmic.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.940
That emotion, it's dread.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.690
When my books work they
are in part about dread.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.600 position:56%
Now, I have to digress briefly here.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.940
When I was talking about dread with
a reporter in San Diego in January,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.310
she said something to me that was
really smart and surprised me.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.580
She said it might be
dread for your readers

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.340
but it's something else
for your characters.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.770
And, I waited.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:14.000
And, she had with her a paperback
of my novel the Guest Room

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.710
which had just been published.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.010
And, she went to the epigraph.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.990
And, the epigraph is from one

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:24.440
of those door stops I
just love [inaudible].

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.350
And, it's this.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.850
I don't think I can love you
so deeply if you had nothing

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.340
to lose and nothing to regret.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.970
And, she said it might
be dread for your readers

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.830
but the underlying emotion
for your characters is regret.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.450
And, I think she's on to something.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.680
I think of regret a lot when
I think of the sleep walker.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.470
The other thread from my other
books I think you will see

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.310
in this new one goes back to
something my daughter said.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.400
My daughter's here today.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.890
She's a young actor,
immensely astute.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.490
She's been reading
my books for years.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:07.090
She's actually read parts or all
of my last three books on audio.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.010
After she read a rough draft
of Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands,

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:14.800
she said to me dad, take this as
a compliment because I mean it

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.180
that way, but I think
your sweet spot

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.070
as a writer is seriously
messed up young woman.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.160
And, she's right.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.460
Just think of the woman in
those books that I mentioned.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.830
Laurel Estabrook in the Double
Bind spiraling into madness

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.540
after a cataclysmic sexual assault.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.190 position:56%
Emily Shepherd in Close Your Eyes,
Hold Hands popping Oxycontin tablets

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.340
as if they are M and M's.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.100
Sarah [inaudible] in The Light
in the Ruins, a partisan fighting

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.290
against the Nazis in the second
world war forever disfigured

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.040
in a fire fight.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.730
Now a burner or a cutter
but with flame.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.580
Or, all of those Armenian girls and
the Sandcastle Girls [inaudible].

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:03.510 position:56%
Forever scarred by what they endured
under the searing Assyrian sun.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.900
You will meet two more of
them in the Sleepwalker.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.370
Vermontor's in this case.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.370
The Sleepwalker set in 2000.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.210
It's the story of Anna Leigh
Ahlberg [assumed spelling],

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:23.350
a 48 year old architect, wife,
mother of two, who one August night

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:28.230
in the year 2000 sleepwalks
into oblivion.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.990
Just disappears.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.050
And, now, in the year 2017,

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.020
one of her daughter's
Lianna [assumed spelling],

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:43.170 position:56%
a mother herself, is chronicling the
way 17 years earlier her mother's

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:48.300
disappearance forever
scarred her family.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.110
I love what the Washington
Post said about this book.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.080
They called it dark, Hitchcockian.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.450
And, Publishers Weekly
call it a stylish fusion

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.300
of mystery and domestic thriller.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.310
I love those reviews because
they got at the novel.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.040 position:56%
There are five players in the drama.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.720
There's Annalee Alhberg,
the sleepwalker.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.580
Her husband, Warren, an English
professor at the nearby college.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.570
They have two daughters.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:21.210
Lianna, 21 years old in the
year 2000, an aspiring musician

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.370
of sorts, and 12 year old Paige.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:31.870
Paige is an athletic outlier
of sorts and a ski racer.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.050
Now, I mentioned there are
five players in the drama.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.260
Who's the fifth?

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.930
Gavin Rikert, 33 years old.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.230
A detective with the Vermont
state police who's leading the

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.130
investigation onto
Annalee's disappearance.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.450
And his relationship
with 21 year old Lianna

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.390
as the novel progresses
becomes as we want to say

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.940
on Facebook, complicated.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.780
Now, before I turn it over to you
for your questions about gosh,

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.690
anything, I'm going
to read you one page.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.530
It is the first page of the novel.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:16.510
And it may or may not
be a diary entry.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:22.470
It makes all the sense in the world
you awaken and smell smoke and see

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.190
that the cat at the foot
of your bed is on fire.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.710
And, so, you scoop him up
and race to the bathroom

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.550 position:56%
and douse him with water in the tub.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.020 position:56%
You reassure him that he'll be fine.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.230
He is fine, telling him
that everything's okay.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.520
You hold him firmly but
gently under the faucet

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.610
because you are worried
about his burns.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.820
The only thing is you're not awake.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.420
But you're not precisely
dreaming either.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.370
After all, in the morning, the
sheets were wet where the cat slept

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.200
when you both went back to bed,
and there is fur in the tub.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.830
There are scratch marks on your
arms and the back of your hands

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:05.570
because the cat was justifiably
resistant to the idea of a bath

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.870
in the middle of the night.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:11.230
And, of course, the
animal never was on fire.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.550
Nothing in the house was on fire.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:17.150
And, you're a reasonable person.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.480
You know that cats don't
spontaneously combust.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.380
But, in the middle of the night,
in the fidelity of that instant,

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.820
you were saving the cats life
and that's all that mattered.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.160
Or, another time you open your eyes
in the charcoal dark and decide

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.320
that you're hungry so you
stroll to the kitchen and whip

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.510
up an omelet tossing
out the whisked eggs

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.620
in the [inaudible] little
cheddar cheese and a hand full

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.560
of baby aspirin because
in the murkiness

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.320
of the moment you were
craving the sweet and sour tang

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.010
of orange Saint Joseph's.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.950
Or, you decide to go
for a swim in the river.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:01.760
Or, you are teased by a stirring
between your legs than a craving

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.320
and so you reach for
the body beside you.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.820
And, if no one's there,
you push off the sheets

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.580
and you climb from the bed.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:14.010
You will search out a
stranger who will satisfy it.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.060
With any luck, you will
wake before you find one.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.480
But, not always.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.960
It is you are vampuric.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.360
And, while it would be easy
to use words like insatiable

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.710
or inquenchable, they would be
inprecise because the liberty needs

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.590
of your sleeping soul
will be stated.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.340
They will and that's the problem.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.420
Thank you so much.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.140
[ Applause ]

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:51.270
And, the first question is the
hardest for you and for me.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.160
Yes. And, I will repeat
the question.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.840
&gt;&gt; So, from the title
[inaudible] book number one,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.990
what's next after Sleepwalker?

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.290
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: The title

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.580
of the Sleepwalker says book
number one, what's next.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:15.180
Book number one suggests
that this is a series.

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:20.870
It's not. What I believe
happened is this.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.840
I was so enamored with
Emily Ahlberg and Lianna

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.740
that when I finished the
book I missed them and, so,

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.510
I wrote a prequil short
story called The Premonition

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.830
about Ana Leigh's life
before she disappeared.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.810
And, you can, you know,
certainly find that at all

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.140
of the online bookstores.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.730
And, I think that the creation

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.550
of the premonition
created this misperception

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.840 position:56%
that there was going to be a sequel.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:35:06.580
I doubt there will ever be --
thank you for bringing that up.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:07.880
Yes.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.180
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.170
The question is this what
is my response to Moby Dick,

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:16.820
one of the great door stops
of American literature.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.120
I like Moby Dick.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.410
It's not my favorite door stop.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.820
And, it is a door stop like many
door stops that has material

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.280
that would never survive
an editor in 2017.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.110
Exhibit A, the amount you learn
about whaling and Moby dick.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:38.910
Exhibit B the fact that Victor Hugo
spent 60 pages describing the sewer

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.120
system of Paris and [inaudible].

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.950
And, I find this very interesting

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.110
about door stops today
and door stops then.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.050
And, there have been some great
door stops published recently.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.240
I will share with you some
of the my favorite door stops

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.540
of the modern era.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.930
But, I find this very interesting.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.020
Most [inaudible] we think of Les
Miserables we think of the musical

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.620
or we think of the movie.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:07.510
And, they begin with Jean
Valjean stealing the candlesticks.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:13.160 position:56%
In the novel, Les Miserables, the
candlesticks are stolen on page 105.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.350
You have 105 pages about the
goodness of the cardinal.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.520
That would never happen in 2017.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.940
But, among the door stops, I
have just loved that are modern.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.860
I loved A Little Life.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.780
I loved City on Fire.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.130
I loved the Gold [inaudible].

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.980
The door stop is -- I
love the corrections --

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.920
the door stop is alive and
well, it's just different.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.220
Yes. Oh, sorry.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.520
Go ahead.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.820
&gt;&gt; Please use the mics.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:54.090
We have two mics up here
so we can all here you.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.050
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: This is
called the dramatic pause.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:06.870
&gt;&gt; So what do you think
are some of the keys

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.720
to giving a character
authenticity as a writer?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: What are the keys
to giving a character authenticity.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.010
Your questions are so terrific.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:22.640
The key to giving a character
authenticity is minutia.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.910
It's not simply though
-- this is critical.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.230
Her eyebrows, his hairline.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.120
It's the details of
his or her back story.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.600
What do we know about
how he or she grew up.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.360
What were the defining
moments in their childhood.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.660
All of that matters.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.530
And, yes, what do they
do during the day.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.440
What is their professional
life like.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.320
When I was writing before, you
know, kindness, which is in part

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.780
about a public defender, I spent
days following a public defender

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.030
to understand how she
spent her life.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:05.270
When I was writing midwives, I must
of interviewed 65 moms and dads

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:10.820
who had their babies at home as
well as midwives and OBGYN's.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.110
So, you know, it's
doing the research.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.410
Now, I will say this.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:20.870
It is also important to bring your
imagination to that character.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.950
Most of us if we are writers
always have our fingers pressed

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.370
against the glass looking at
the party we weren't invited to.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.180
And when you watch, you learn.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.380
&gt;&gt; I think she was first.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.980
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: Hello.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want to go back to what
you said a minute ago about things

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.750 position:56%
that wouldn't survive editors today.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.210
Do you think that's because we
have shorter attention spans

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.030
or we're used to action movie --

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.070
I mean, what do you
think the difference is?

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.370
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian:
What is the difference.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.700
Why do I believe that the
door stop has changed.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.010
Is it shorter attention.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.500
Yes. Let's begin there.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.180
I think there are at
least two reasons.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.400
We do have shorter
attention spans beginning

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.100
with the way the digital
age draws us relentlessly

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.950
to the social networks
and to our phones.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.560
That's a reality.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.460 position:56%
But, I think there's another reality
that is affected our attention spans

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.060
for literature and
how we approach it.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.770
And this isn't necessarily
a bad one.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:22.790
I think the last ten years
have been a renaissance

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.630
in television whether
it's Breaking Bad,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.320
The Sopranos, Madmen, The Crown.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.410
There is so much remarkable
television that we watch,

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:41.720
and I think all of us now approach
literature with this understanding

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.320
that you can't read a political
thriller today without thinking

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.480
of House of Cards, for instance.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.500
I think we got time for
one more or two more.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.800
Two more, okay.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.110
&gt;&gt; I have a question about two of
your historical base novel Skeleton

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.310
at the Feast and The
Light in the Ruins.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:01.660
In both of those you have very
complex characters on both sides

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.540
of the issue, many of
whom are Nazi collaborates

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.420
and one case sort of
a Nazi partisan.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:11.930
Do you ever get blow back from
your portrayal of participants

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.990
in those novels or the
way you portray the --

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.290
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: Okay,
the question is this.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.790
In Skeleton's of the
Feast, which is a novel

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.370 position:56%
about one German's family complicity
in the Holocaust or the Light

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.090
in the Ruin which is about when
Italian families collaboration

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:31.220
with the Nazi's, have
I ever gotten blow back

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:37.540
for having German characters
or Italian collaborators

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.960
who have some degree of
moral ambiguity to them,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.860
they are not simply the
devil with a [inaudible].

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.470
No, I don't think I have.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:53.280 position:56%
And, I think that's largely because
Skeletons at the Feast and the Light

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.140
in the Ruins unlike a lot

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.970
of my contemporary literature
aren't about moral ambiguity.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:02.750
They are first and fore most
about people's willingness

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.190
to be complicitous with evil.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:11.840
As Francesca [inaudible] says
Francesca [inaudible] says

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.500
in the Light in the Ruins, which
is talking about her father's deal

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.560
with the Nazi's, you
are collaborating

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.120
with the cowardly angels,
quoting Donte.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.520
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: I think
this is the last question.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.820
&gt;&gt; Yes, hi.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.970
I've read a lot of stuff
you've said and as the person

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.450
who introduced you said living

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.090
in Vermont I think you said has
really inspired your writing.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.600 position:56%
And, having living in Burlington for
a long time, I'm just wondering why,

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.900
you know, moving from New York

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.640
to Vermont really, you
know, inspired you?

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.500
&gt;&gt;Chris Bohjalian: Why did
my wife and I move to Vermont

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.690
and why did it inspire us.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:57.130 position:56%
We moved to Vermont to be completely
honest because it was the 1980's

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.400
and we were looking at
ourselves in the mirror

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.280
as an advertising executive
and a bond trader

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.950
and we were afraid we
were on an up escalator

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.940
that if we did not get off now

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.080
when we were young we would
forever lock us into that role.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.530
And that wasn't the
role that we wanted.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.720
It wasn't feeding our souls.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.310
My wife is an immensely
talented photographer

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.740
and she wasn't taking pictures.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.230
I had no idea if I had any
talent at all as a writer.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.910 position:56%
Certainly, I hadn't demonstrated it,

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.980
but I wanted desperately
to be a writer.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.270 position:56%
And, so, we made the decision to
get off that financial up escalator,

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.700
take a risk and see if
we could keep our soul.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.190
Because here's what I
always tell young writers.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:47.200
I tell young artists you
have one chance in this world

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.170
to live your life the
way it should be.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.960
Live it with an appropriate
moral compass.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.630
Do the right thing
and feed your heart.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.270
Today, I want all of you to
feed your souls with books.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.660
Thank you so much for joining.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.960
