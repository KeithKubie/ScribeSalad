00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.960
So we've explicitly defined
four different sequences here.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.550
And what I want
you to think about

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.970
is whether these sequences
converge or diverge.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.700
And remember,
converge just means,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.705
as n gets larger and
larger and larger,

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:17.620
that the value of our sequence
is approaching some value.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.254
And diverge means that it's
not approaching some value.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.170
So let's look at this.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.794
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.510
and try this on your own
before I'm about to explain it.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.110
So let's look at this first
sequence right over here.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.729
So the numerator n plus 8 times
n plus 1, the denominator n

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.070
times n minus 10.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.530
So one way to think about
what's happening as n

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.074
gets larger and larger is look
at the degree of the numerator

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:41.490
and the degree of
the denominator.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.906
And we care about the degree
because we want to see, look,

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.260
is the numerator growing
faster than the denominator?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.604
In which case this thing
is going to go to infinity

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.020
and this thing's
going to diverge.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.870
Or is maybe the denominator
growing faster, in which case

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.180
this might converge to 0?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.040
Or maybe they're growing
at the same level,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.699
and maybe it'll converge
to a different number.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.990
So let's multiply out the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.270
and figure that out.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
So n times n is n squared.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.900
n times 1 is 1n, plus 8n is 9n.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.180
And then 8 times 1 is 8.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.020
So the numerator is n
squared plus 9n plus 8.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.960
The denominator is
n squared minus 10n.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.400
And one way to
think about it is n

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.290
gets really, really, really,
really, really large,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.930
what dominates in the
numerator-- this term is going

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.410
to represent most of the value.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.660
And this term is going to
represent most of the value,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.210
as well.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.687
These other terms
aren't going to grow.

00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:38.270
Obviously, this 8
doesn't grow at all.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.200
But the n terms aren't going
to grow anywhere near as fast

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.670
as the n squared terms,
especially for large n's.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.080
So for very, very
large n's, this

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.470
is really going
to be approaching

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.600
n squared over n squared, or 1.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.570
So it's reasonable to
say that this converges.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.735
So this one converges.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.860
And once again, I'm not
vigorously proving it here.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.990
Or I should say
I'm not rigorously

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.210
proving it over here.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.240
But the giveaway is that
we have the same degree

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.950
in the numerator
and the denominator.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.990
So now let's look at
this one right over here.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.150
So here in the numerator
I have e to the n power.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.980
And here I have e times n.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.030
So this grows much faster.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.130
I mean, this is
e to the n power.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.140
Imagine if when you
have this as 100,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.110
e to the 100th power is a
ginormous number. e times 100--

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.430
that's just 100e.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.340
Grows much faster than
this right over here.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.170
So this thing is just
going to balloon.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.586
This is going to go to infinity.

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:40.835
So we could say this diverges.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.140
Now let's look at this
one right over here.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.420
Well, we have a
higher degree term.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.090
We have a higher
degree in the numerator

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.520
than we have in the denominator.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.510
n squared, obviously, is going
to grow much faster than n.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.130
So for the same reason
as the b sub n sequence,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.750
this thing is going to diverge.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.680
The numerator is going
to grow much faster

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.654
than the denominator.

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:04.570
Or another way to think
about it, the limit as

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.970
n approaches infinity
is going to be infinity.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.230
This thing's going
to go to infinity.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.510
Now let's think about
this right over here.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.562
So as we increase
n-- so we could even

00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:16.270
think about what the
sequence looks like.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.180
When n is 0, negative
1 to the 0 is 1.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.350
When n is 1, it's
going to be negative 1.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.335
When n is 2, it's going to be 1.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:24.960
And so this thing is
just going to keep

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.710
oscillating between
negative 1 and 1.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.350
So it's not unbounded.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.700
It's not going to go to
infinity or negative infinity

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.160
or something like that.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.300
But it just oscillates
between these two values.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.010
So it doesn't converge
to one particular value.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.290
So even though this one
isn't unbounded-- it doesn't

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.870
go to infinity-- this
one still diverges.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.697
It doesn't go to one value.

00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:47.780
So let me write that down.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.530
This one diverges.
