00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.360
The URL that we built looks good and the JSON

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.010
string from the server also looks good. However, it still is

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.840
one long string. Let's look at it more carefully to see

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.770
what data we should extract from it. In order to make

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.500
sense of the string that comes back from the server, we

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.090
can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.420
If you Google for those terms, you'll be able to find

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.530
a helpful tool such as this one. Here, we pasted the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.550
result of the web query. Then, it formatted the output for

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.549
us showing us the hierarchy of these elements. Now based on

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.200
the wireframes that you saw for the Sunshine app, can you

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.780
tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.660
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.960
the purposes of the quiz on the next screen, we're just

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.870
looking at the leaf nodes. Make your selections below on which

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.280
attributes we'll need in order to display the list of forecasts
