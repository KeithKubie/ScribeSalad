00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:06.673
NARRATOR: Luxor, Egypt.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.426
Here lies the tomb of
the world's most famous

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.721
pharaoh, King Tutankhamun.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.563
When it was discovered in
1922, completely intact

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:25.400
and preserved after
more than 3,000 years,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.152
it was considered
one of the most

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:32.198
significant archeological
discoveries of all time.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.243
But as spectacular
a find as it was,

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.037
almost a century
later, new evidence

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.123
has come to light
that there may be

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.001
much more to King Tut's
final resting place

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.212
than meets the eye.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.549
While examining high
resolution scans of the tomb,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:55.388
on September 28 of 2015, British
egyptologist Nicholas Reeves

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.266
found something remarkable--

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.227
the possibility of
two hidden passages

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:05.648
connected directly to
King Tut's burial chamber.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.400
There was a
Spanish company who

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.862
was recruited to scan
the tomb of Tutankhamun

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.907
in order to replicate it.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.118
It is through this high
definition photography scanning

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:21.706
that Reeves noticed that, on
the north wall of the burial

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.750
chamber, there are
some cracks indicating

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.130
the possibility of a door,
and also on the eastern wall.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
So there's two
possible chambers.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.552
RAMY ROMANY: Reeves
took his laser images

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.388
to Dr. Mamdouh Eldamaty,
who is the Minister

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.140
of Antiquities in Egypt.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.936
And they both decided
to dig further.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.813
They used thermal
scanning, which

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:48.316
tells you the exact density
of the wall at every part.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.611
And they have confirmed that
they might have discovered

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:55.990
another passway, or
a chamber behind King

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.951
Tut's burial chamber.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.702
NARRATOR: Whether
there are more buried

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:04.082
treasures beyond the painted
walls remains to be seen.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:08.086
But if so, Reeves has a theory.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:12.006
He believes the passageway
may lead to the tomb of Queen

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.844
Nefertiti, the wife of
Pharaoh Akhenaten, who ruled

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:19.556
during the 14th century, BC.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.685
ROBERT BAUVAL: Reeves speculates
that, in fact, Tutankhamun

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.980
inherited the tomb of Nefertiti.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.231
The reason is this.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.900
The tomb of Tutankhamun
is very unusual.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.695
It's rather small compared
to the other pharaohs.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.905
All great kings of
the 18th dynasty

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.576
have amazingly large tombs
with store rooms and chambers

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.286
and so forth.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:46.082
Tutankhamun's tomb, if it
is his tomb, is very modest.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.126
NARRATOR: But why
would Nefertiti's tomb

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.587
be hidden beyond King Tut's?

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.173
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe there

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.092
may be a profound reason--

00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:01.681
that Queen Nefertiti
was not of this world.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.184
Nefertiti's
parents are unknown.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:11.107
On pictures, she's shown with
one of these elongated heads.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.234
Now, we know the gods--

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:14.861
the old Egyptian gods--

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:19.365
they had longer
heads than we have.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.993
And according to
the pyramid texts,

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:26.080
sometimes, they left Earth,
and then they returned again.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.585
So Nefertiti's parents were
maybe extraterrestrials.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.879
King Akhenaten
and his wife looked

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.340
completely different than
all the other ancient

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.675
Egyptian kings.

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.427
King Akhenaten
always was depicted

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:45.183
with an elongated skull, a
bigger-sized hip, a belly that

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:51.522
draws over his belt. He
believed that he wasn't a man,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:54.400
and he wasn't a woman,
and he wasn't a king.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.111
He was just something else.

00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:58.404
ROBERT BAUVAL: The
most unusual feature

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.615
is the elongated skulls.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.325
There's been a
lot of discussions

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.453
about what these skulls meant,
whether they were literally

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:10.083
elongated skulls or whether they
were just decoration features.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.542
It's certainly very intriguing.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.836
It doesn't appear
before or afterwards.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.507
So there's something rather odd
about this, I have to admit.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.134
NARRATOR: The reign of
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.637
introduced a new
and controversial

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.056
monotheistic faith to Egypt--

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:29.102
worshipping the
disk-shaped sun god, Aten.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.062
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
The Aten was described

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.315
as this flying sun disk.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.693
Egyptologists are
merely saying that this

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.362
was nothing else but the sun.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.699
But the question is,
can the sun instruct

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.243
you in different disciplines?

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.412
And the answer is no.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:51.457
So we have to see whether
or not our ancestors

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:55.586
encountered technology
and misinterpreted

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:56.587
it as something in nature.
