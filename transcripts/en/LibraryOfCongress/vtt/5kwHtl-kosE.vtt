00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Socolow: Let
me begin by welcoming you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.470
and this is a different panel
because, as you've seen,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.260
most of the conference
has really been focused

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.560
on public media.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.140
And Sam Berlowski, in the
transcription one, made a joke,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.450
he said about two people
remember who Frank Stanton was

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.660
and the CBS archive has
come up in a couple of times

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.960
and a couple of ways in there.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530
And it is the 50th anniversary
of Public Broadcasting,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.400
but this is a place
that we're here to talk

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.870
about what commercial
broadcasting means in terms

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.230
of radio preservation in
that way and how it works.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.200
Okay, so the panel is Dr.
Noah Arceneaux is an associate

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.500

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.840
His PhD from the University
of Georgia examines the role

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.540
of department stores
during the early years

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.150
of American broadcasting and
his subsequent research --

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.290
and, by the way, if you haven't
read his article on technology

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.970
and culture on Wanamaker Stores
in the early nineteen teens,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.490
it's terrific -- his subsequent
research has explored the social

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.840
construction of new media
technologies as well

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.580
as emerging forms
of mobile media.

FOX television networks.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.510
Although she's a respondent,
she's actually going to go next

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.570
after Dr. Arceneaux
is Heather Birks.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.790

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.200
in the United States.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.140
His book, Making Radio: Early
Radio Production and the Rise

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.520
of Modern Sound Culture,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.740
forthcoming from
Oxford University Press,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.390
traces the development of
dominant production practices

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.210
and performance styles for
early US radio and their impact

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.800
on adjacent fields of
film and music recording.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.450
Okay. So, to end
the introduction,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.350
I asked the members of the panel
just to do very basic things.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.890
The first, I asked
the scholars to speak

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.190
about their interactions

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.260
with commercial broadcasting
community as scholars,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.870
researchers, and educators,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.980
and I asked our commercial
broadcasting representatives

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.690
to reflect a bit on how
historical audio is used

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.990
and preserved in the industry.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.220
And, the goal of this panel
is actually discussion.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.760
We also want to hear from you.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.060
We want to think
about how scholars

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.220
and researchers can work
with commercial broadcasters

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.670
for educational and
research purposes.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.310
So, Noah, take it away.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.610
&gt;&gt; Noah Arceneaux:
Good afternoon.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.080
I felt a little strange
when I realized

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.860
that I was slotted
on this panel.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.500
My dissertation completed,
now, 10 years ago,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.410
it was about the origins
of commercial broadcasting,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.040
which is why Josh probably
threw me in this slot,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.240
but after I completed
my dissertation,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.280
I started to do research on even
earlier era; the pre-radio era

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.020
of wireless telegraphy.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.260
As Michael mentioned,
I wrote something.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.520
Wanamaker's Department Store
had wireless telegraph in 1911,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.300
the New York Herald was
transmitting news via Morse code

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.600
even earlier than that.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.420
We don't have recordings of
these things and the fact --

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.680
it's just never really crossed
my mind would there even

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.980
be recordings?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.680
Who would record Morse
code transmission?

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.570
I only know of one such
recording from that era.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.670
What I wanted to share with
you, and I'm just going

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.830
to take full advantage of this
opportunity because I'm on stage

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.460
and I have a projector
so I'm going

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.550
to take full advantage
of this opportunity.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.850
Because of my research
into wireless telegraphy,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.670
I spent the summer in Oxford;

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.090
the Marconi archives are
at the library there.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.480
The Bodleian Library.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.340
I was told on my first
day it's not 'Bowedlean',

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.710
and you sound like
a dumb American.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.010
The 'Bodleian'.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.720
So, I spent two months there
digging through the archives,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.450
photographing as much as I
could and I found this document.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.520
This is what I wanted
to share with you.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.520
And I was aware, of course,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.230
of the Radio Preservation
Task Force

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.060
and I thought this is a
really weird artifact.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.140
This is a radio recording?

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.320
Maybe? It's a composition
book from 1897.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.720
Okay? Marconi had one of his
employees go out on the ocean

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.010
in a harbor and was
sending signals back

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.420
to a station located
on the Isle of Wight.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.780
And they recorded the
transmissions on little strips

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.400
of paper and I found many
of these strips of paper.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.590
But for some reason they pasted
these into a child's notebook,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.350
which has an essay
about Celtic Britain.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.240
So, of course, I find
myself reading the essay

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.250
and admiring this
child's penmanship,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.870
which is much better than mine.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.810
Yeah. 1897, that's a 7, not a 4.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.840
So, I was, okay, Marconi
-- he's doing wireless,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.760
which will eventually
become radio.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.650
He wants to make money.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.780
I'll just scroll through.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.460
He wants to make money.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.630
That's a commercial service.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.010
Is this recording
of commercial radio?

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.310
Maybe. I don't know.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.050
Depends on how you
define radio, right?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.860
Now what is the academic
significance of this?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.160
I have no idea.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.510
What's the theoretical
implication of this?

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.810
I don't know.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.110
I just thought this was
really weird and cool

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.410
and I wanted to share it.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.620
Right? So, that's
what I'm doing.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.920
I thought maybe I could turn
these strips of paper back

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.950
into Morse code and make my
students build a radio receiver.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.090
Would there be some
academic value of that?

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.390
I'm not sure.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.020
But, in terms of
my dissertation,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.300
which was about 1920s radio,
my argument, in a nutshell,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.370
was that there was
advertising on American radio

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.720
from the very beginning.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.350
And this is not commonly
acknowledged

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.980
because we don't have
recordings from 1920 and 1921.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:44.120
A station owned by AT&amp;T, WEAF,
airs the first radio commercial.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.770
This is in all the
textbooks that we use.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.410
This is memorialized
as a significant first.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.090
I was looking at
department stores

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.560
that had their own
radio stations

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.860
and I'm just convinced --

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.460
common sense tells me
the department stores

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.600
were advertising.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.570
In the program listings that
were listed in the newspapers,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.020
they had programs about shoes,
programs about women's coats.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.690
Surely they were doing
ads for those products.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.350
And some of the listings in
the newspapers would even say,

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.140
"Music brought to you
by Victor Records".

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.160
Well, if they're putting
it in newspaper listing,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.560
surely they must have been
saying it on the air as well,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.630
but because we don't
have a recording of it,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.150
WEAF and AT&amp;T get the credit.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.220
The one book on the
commercialization of radio

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.360
by Susan Smulyan, I
don't think she's here.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.090
Is that correct?

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.450
Really privileges the networks
because those are the records

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.990
that we have and I believe

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.730
that there was really just some
explicit commercialism going on.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.350
And the reason I think this
era is important is this is

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.290
when everything was really
formed and established,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.680
the network system, the
commercial broadcasting system,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.250
the rules that we still are
following to some degree today.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.280
So I think it would be good

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.900
if we could understand the
origins a little better.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.160
But obviously -- there are
some recordings from 1920s.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.480
I won't say there are none.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.710
I talked with Chuck
Howell and Mike Henry

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.460
when I was doing my
dissertation research.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.250
From being at this conference,

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.410
I've learned there are
maybe some more recordings

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.810
from that era that
have been uncovered

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.040
but we don't have anything like
a thorough, complete coverage.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.900
But obviously commercial radio
is a dominant form of radio.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.930
I don't mean to malign
public radio

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.060
but that's what many
people listen to.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.360
And there'd just be

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.650
such tremendous value
if we had more of it.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.640
And I'm not talking
about program logs

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.410
or what music was
played on what station.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.900
We can uncover the music,

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.650
but it's the advertising
that we want.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.400
It's the local announcers.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.590
It's that regional feel.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.560
And this lack of recordings --

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.620
it's not that the problem
has gone away as we all know.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.760
In 2011, there was a
massive power outage

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.060
in southern California.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.360
It was really remarkable.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.260
Basically, Los Angeles
down to the border.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.180
It was like all of southern
California lost power.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.050
San Diego people went berserk.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.310
Like it was the zombie
apocalypse coming.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.750
Your ATM wouldn't work because
there was no electricity,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.120
so the ATMs wouldn't work.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.420
Cell phones were dying.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.210
There was only one radio station
in San Diego that managed

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.360
to stay on the air
for the duration.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.910
The power was back
on by midnight.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.210
It only lasted a half a day.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.880
But only one radio
station, KPBS,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.600
our local PBS station
went off the air.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.890
One local news station,
an AM station,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.430
managed to stay on the air.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.580
And I have a representative
from Nielson come to my classes

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.130
and talk and he shared
with me the ratings data

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.670
from that particular day.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.880
As you can imagine, there
was this unbelievable spike

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.340
at four o'clock in
the afternoon,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.150
every single radio
tuned to that station

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.490
because it was the only
thing that was going on.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.620
And when I called
them, they don't --

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.310
I mean they have a
record of what happened

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.380
but there's no actual recording.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.930
I don't think it even
crossed anyone's mind, hey,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.640
this is an historic moment.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.190
So, maybe that gives people
some things to think about

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.280
and respond to, but I wanted
to share this with you.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.580
Thank you for indulging me.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.430
&gt;&gt; Heather Birks: Am I next?

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.770
Okay. Hi. Heather Birks,
as Michael introduced me,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.350
executive director of the
Broadcast Education Association.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.050
And I just have to
say, I'm sitting kind

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.590
of with some VA royalty here.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.870
Right? Got some dissertation
award winners.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.170
We have a book winner.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.660
So, that's kind of
exciting for me.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.800
So I feel very fortunate to
be in your company today.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.240
I'm going to keep my
remarks very brief.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.160
I'm not sure how many
of you are familiar

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.920
with Broadcast Education
Association.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.270
We're an academic
media organization.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.020
Our members are traditional
researchers

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.440
but also creative scholars,
which makes being in a place

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.090
like this important for us

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.850
because while our members are
using traditional research

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.850
methods, the creative folks
are also creating content,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.960
in particular, with archives

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.260
that I'll just talk
about for a minute.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.440
And some of our relationships
that we have and the importance,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.410
obviously, of students
and faculty having access

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.300
to those archives to be
able to create projects

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.930
for themselves whether
it's an audio documentary,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.670
which we awarded our
festival of media arts

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.280
if anyone's curious about that.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.820
And, also, with the Library of
American Broadcasting Foundation

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.470
and the archives,
trying to make sure

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.570
that all our student members
and faculty members are aware

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.250
of what they have and I know
that they've got symposiums

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.410
and that we're trying to
figure out how we can partner

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.290
with them just to give
access to everybody.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.960
And that's pretty much it.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.510
But if people have
questions after --

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:41.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.820
Yeah, well, we've got several --

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.630
actually we've got several
projects that we, history,

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.980
specifically broadcast media
history projects that we do.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:54.820
One is the Library of American
Broadcast award that alternates.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.190
One year it's a book award,

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.690
which will be awarded
this coming year in 2018.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.220
And then the alternating
years, it's a creative award.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.870
So, if you've done
a documentary,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.170
if you've done some kind

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.710
of interactive multimedia
project, we'll award that.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.190
Last year, in fact,
it was audio.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.650
A guy named Terry Likes

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.790
out of Tennessee State
University had produced a series

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.830
of mini documentaries
that he aired

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:26.280
on the local PBS radio station
or public station in Tennessee.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.750
So, $5000 prize, which
is a pretty good award.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:36.020
And then this year, for the
first time, we are given a grant

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.960
by Richard Liebner
and Carol Cooper.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.210
They were the founders of
-- I'm spacing the name --

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.810
of the talent agency
because it was UTA.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.110
[Inaudible].

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.410
Ah, Beanstalk.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.400
They did Beanstalk, which is
now part of United Talent.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.750
And the endowment is for --

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.410
it's a grant for a research
in progress for proposal

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.470
and progress creative work
that relates somehow to media

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.410
and broadcast history.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.920
Cynthia and I were
talking a little bit

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.220
at lunchtime about this.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.060
Some of our board members,
you know what I mean,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.700
obviously history is
-- they are worried

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.270
that it would be too
limiting, media history.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.110
But I'm convincing
them that that is --

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.700
I mean, that opens the doors to
all kinds of things, in fact,

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.980
it's huge that we're
all this gigantic.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.480
So, the deadline for the
submissions for that,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.210
I think it's December
or January.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:36.600
And we'll be giving that
out annually, $2500 grant.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.330
And more things to come too.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.240
I mean, again, we've got a good
relationship with the Library

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.270
of American Broadcasting
Foundation

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.010
and we feel very happy that
they've kind of found a home

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.330
with BEA knowing that there are

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.510
so many talented
scholars out there.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:20:01.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.040
&gt;&gt; Kathy Fuller-Seeley:
Gosh, since this just came

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.930
out last week -- I
don't have that much

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.270
to say other than hooray.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.380
It was about a 12-year project.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.190
Took me about three
years to write it.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.460
It's not the only fantastic book
out about Omega Radio performer.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.280
Also, check out David
Weinstein's new book,

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.660
The Eddie Cantor Story.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.600
We're going to be like
twins here about this.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:32.470
But if I can tell one very
quick story about the importance

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.510
of Jack Benny's show to
commercial radio, at large,

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.430
in the business and
consumer economy,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.460
is quickly the story of Jell-O.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.960
I can't resist telling the story
of Jell-O in one minute or less.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.120
Jell-O in the spring and fall
of 1934 was a dying product.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.420
It was 40 years old.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.230
It's competition, even A&amp;P
Jell-O, cost half the price

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.640
and tasted twice as good.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.370
So, General Foods was
about to sink the product

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.780
and put it out of business.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.240
But, indeed an advertising
agency Young and Rubicam

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.520
and I learned so much
about the importance

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.560
of advertising agencies as
creative and business forces.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.210
For instance, Cynthia Meyers.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:23.100
Advertising agency Young and
Rubicam came to General Foods

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.740
in the Jell-O division
and they said,

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.380
"You've got one last shot."

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.790
They said, "You have your
chemist fix the taste,

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.030
you have your marketers
cut your price in half.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.650
We'll pick up some talent and
we'll give it one last shot."

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.380
Because back in the day,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.310
if a radio audience
enjoyed the programming,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.960
they were being trained to go
out and purchase the product.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.690
So they said, "One shot."

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.290
Jack Benny was not
their first choice.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.590
He was about their
fourth choice.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.330
He had been fired by his
previous three sponsors

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.660
because he was determined
to be his own show runner.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.400
He wouldn't let them tell
why kind of comedy to do,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.840
what kind of programming to do.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.270
So, he's kind of a retread.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.500
But Young and Rubicam said,
"Let's give it a shot.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.440
He was really funny with
the advertisements."

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.690
So they bring Benny and
Mary Livingstone on board.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.330
They start the Jell-O
program in October 1934.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.550
And in the first two months,
the comedy was really great

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.500
but no Jell-O is selling.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.360
Even though the price
has been cut.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.900
And, General Foods is going,
"Well, everybody now has

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.350
to work at half price.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.760
We're going to cut
the salaries."

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.880
And Jack Benny and Mary
Livingstone say, "Okay.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.920
We'll work without salary
for the next 10 weeks.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.900
Give us that long to try and
get sales of a product boosted

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.430
and then we'll call it quits."

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.810
So, for 10 weeks they worked
without salary so that the rest

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.360
of the cast could
still earn a living.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.260
And they sell the
heck out of Jell-O.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:56.090
Don Wilson wears a striped tie
in the lemon, lime, cherry,

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.930
and orange striped variety.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.670
They do skits.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.350
Talk about Romeo
and Jell-O-ette.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.270
They are on the Good
Ship Jell-O.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.100
They're just Jell-O-ing every
six ways you could think of it.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:14.730
And about eight weeks later,
sales start to skyrocket.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.250
Pretty soon, they are
selling more Jell-O

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.170
than can actually be
made at the factory.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.630
They're in a small town
in upstate New York.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.850
They end up having to buy
other products and rebrand them

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.660
as Jell-O just to have enough
for Jack Benny to sell.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:37.340
By Christmastime, early January,
General Foods was so happy

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.230
at this complete
business turn-around,

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.900
here's the selling power of
radio, of commercial radio,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.690
they had a party at Jack
and Mary's apartment.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.540
They provided one of
those big lottery checks

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.850
for all of their back salary.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.140
They said you've
saved our product.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.980
Hooray. Just wait until
we get Bill Cosby.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.280
No. I kid you.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.050
They weren't that prescient.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:10.550
So, literally, a radio comedy
program turned the fortunes

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.410
of a consumer product and the
only joke Mary Livingstone had

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.540
to say about it was that the
company had provided a great big

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.100
tray of shimmering red
Jell-O and she told the maid,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.400
"Get that crap outta here."

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.510
Which she was a little
sorry got overheard.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.790
But, working on Benny
was a wonderful project

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.090
because I thought of him --

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.070
I wanted to tell the story
of the radio show instead

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.330
of the story of his
private life.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.670
And I found he was a
tremendous show runner,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.720
advertising creator, and
executive and intermedia star,

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.470
and an incredible
maestro and director

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.750

his [inaudible].

[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.340
&gt;&gt; Alex Kupfer: Sure.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.670
I want to talk just for a
few minutes about one example

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.870
of where some of my research
in radio has taken me as a way

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.980
to sort of offer some of
these questions about access

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.330
and preservation of
materials and then how

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.800
that shapes scholarship
potentially.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.970
And, the example that I want
to discuss actually came

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.100
out of the first
RPTF conference.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.810
And it was some research
that I had started to do

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.430
on a show called The Land
Grant College Radio Hour,

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.590
which aired in the 1930s
on NBC Blue Affiliates.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.400
So, just very briefly, this
was a monthly show that came

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.760
out of the National Farm
and Home Hour series.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.640
And during The Land Grant
the first few years,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.070
it would feature three
talks on domestic topics,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.370
or agricultural topics,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.450
delivered by speakers
supplied either

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.560
by a rotating university
extension program

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.490
or the US Department
of Agriculture.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.200
By the 1930s, interest had
really waned in the show

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.500
and it was rehauled as kind

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.660
of this traveling
road show program.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.550
Once a month, it
would be broadcast

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.250
from a different land
grant college radio station

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.850
from throughout the country.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.850
So, this was a really
interesting production process

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.560
because even at schools
which had their own stations,

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.900
it was fairly collaborative
between NBC

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.810
and faculty and students.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.750
So, NBC for instance, offered
technical support, equipment,

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.270
and some of the music you used
in the show as well as sort

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.690
of legal support over getting
the rights to this music,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.990
while faculty and students
kind of did the rest,

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.280
including perform
the entire show.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.080
So, the lectures that
were initially part

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.110
of the show were replaced by
kind of more general promotion

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.200
of each school's service to
the state and sort of histories

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.940
about the state and
the university.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.690
So, there were things like
historical reenactments

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.240
and interviews and various
musical performances

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.130
by different campus groups.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.700
Between 1936 and
1940, it was produced

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.410
at 47 different land grant
colleges in 44 different states,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.790
ranging from Hawaii to Maine.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.610
So, I think the Land Grant
College Radio Hour raises a lot

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.270
of sort of interesting
issues related

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.440
to access and preservation.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.550
So, because of this
decentralized collaborative

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.050
model between NBC and
the different schools,

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.300
there is no single,
real, archival home

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.960
for documents related
to the program.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.260
So, in practical terms too,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.250
this also means very few
[inaudible] episodes.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.700
I found four episodes going
literally episode by episode

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.130
and contacting different
archives and universities.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.290
Records can be very
difficult to find.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.540
So, for instance, records
documenting the development

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.130
of the show were housed at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.590
in the Wisconsin
Historical Society.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.540
And actually to fly to
the University of Nevada

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.870
to listen to their recordings.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.500
They were one of the few
who had transcription discs.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.420
And luckily they were
nice enough to transfer it

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.430
to a record where I could
later play it for my students.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.140
And they had also the files
related to the production

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.620
of the show as well as things
like letters from alumni

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.820
from across the country
who are really interested

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.580
in hearing their school
being discussed on the air.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.540
So, dealing with multiple
archives is not exceptional.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.380
I'm sure all the people
here could really talk

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.580
about the dozens
potentially archives

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.250
that they worked
on over the years.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.520
But I think it does pose a
challenge for how scholars

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.210
and archivists can address
situations like this show

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.490
where to discuss it, you
realistically would have to go

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.940
to numerous archives,
potentially up to four dozen,

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.370
to find where the
show was recorded.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.320
And this is because
it's an example

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.000
where you have this commercial
material from the networks

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.440
which had been mixed into
institutional collections.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.170
So, it's not housed in
NBC records but in each

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.810
of these different
university archives.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.910
So, I'll just sort of stop here
just by posing this question.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.200
Again, how can we formulate
ways to find this material

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.220
to make it accessible and then
ultimately to preserve it?

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.020
Thank you.

[ Inaudible ]

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Ann Watson: I just
wanted to say a few words

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.490
about the great privilege of
my life, which was working

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:56.260
with Norman Corwin editing a
book on his one-world flight.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.230
Working with Norman
was quite remarkable

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:06.310
because he had the most
fastidious files I've ever seen

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.410
but it was all Norman's doing.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.850
He tells the story
of when he left --

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:17.330
shortly after he left CBS, he
ran into a secretary from CBS

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.350
on the street in New York,
and she said to him, "Norman,

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:24.780
they're about to throw out
all these transcription discs

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.120
of your programs.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.030
Would you like them?"

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.970
He was crestfallen that
this body of work that was

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.540
so joyously saluted was going

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.410
to be just unceremoniously
tossed out.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:47.580
But he kept fastidious records
and when we sat down to talk

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.090
about One World Flight
that, of course,

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.530
was probably the reason he ended
up leaving commercial radio was

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.870
because his conclusion
at the end

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:04.530
of that documentary
series was that democracy

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.340
and representative
democracy and socialism,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.260
the best of socialism, might
actually work together.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.320
And that we should
consider that.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.720
Of course, in 1947, that
was not at all something

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.420
that could be abided in
commercial broadcasting

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.330
and he left CBS after that.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:30.600
But when I sat down with him
to talk about One World Flight,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.450
of course, we had
the programs and --

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.010
but I asked him did
he have letters,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.530
did he have things he might
have kept and he said, "Oh,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.810
I kept a handwritten journal."

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:44.210
And he said to his assistant,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:45.880
"Do you know where
that might be?"

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.990
And he said, "Yeah, I saved it
from a black trash bag that was

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.150
about to be thrown out."

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.700
And, so, that journal
exists and the book could be

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.610
in Norman's voice
because of that.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.910
And, just a few other things.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:10.170
Lately, I've been doing a lot
of consulting for documentaries

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.370
and programs where people are
looking for commercial things.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.600
For instance, CNN is now
doing a documentary based

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.110
on David Maraniss'
wonderful book about the city

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.270
of Detroit, Once
In a Great City.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:26.380
And I've been trying to help
them find very, you would think,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.090
easy things to find, like
things about the Motown Review,

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.760
radio coverage of the Motown
Review in 1962, radio coverage

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.000
of the introduction
of the Ford Mustang,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.690
things that you think
this is a no-brainer.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.950
We'll find this easily.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.250
No can do.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:47.320
It's just - it's very
difficult to find that stuff.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.190
It's the same story that
you've all experienced.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.510
So, thanks.

&gt;&gt; Cynthia Meyers:
Is this working?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.180
Hi, I'm Cynthia Meyers

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.540
and I wrote a book called
A Word From Our Sponsor.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.750
I just want to make
one or two points

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.880
about doing historical
work in media industries.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.810
First of all, Heather and I were
talking over lunch about some

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.840
of the challenges when
we're also dealing

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.510
with commercial entities
and companies

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.740
that might have records
or recordings

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.700
or archives or materials.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.860
Getting access to them is very
difficult, and for many, many,

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.160
many reasons, and I know

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.450
that we've had conversations
here this week

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.750
about some of those reasons.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.050
But, one of the things
I was talking to Heather

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.910
about was the fact that
history, for a lot of people

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.230
in the media industry
is something

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.820
to be embarrassed about.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.710
It's not something
necessarily to be proud of.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.400
Because those old shows
are kind of funny.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.930
You know, they're sort of weird.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.080
And, they're old fashioned.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.890
And connecting the current
today, forward thinking company

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.730
with these sort of
old-fashioned artifacts

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.380
or these old fashioned ideas
or these old-fashioned forms

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.130
of culture is not always
something that they want to do.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.000
And so some of the issues, and I
hope we can talk about it today,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.750
about private entities,
how they save,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.540
or don't save, their materials.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.740
I think we need to remember
those of us, the archivists

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.350
and the scholars, that it's
not just a financial issue

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.470
or storage issue, it's also
there's a cultural sort

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.930
of attitude issue and as
educators, we really need

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.320
to reach out and try to
figure out how to make some

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.110
of those companies feel that
their history is valuable rather

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.170
than something to be
embarrassed about.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.990
The other point I was going to
make was just that we all know

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.770
about the [inaudible] of
media and especially radio.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.770
We talked about how
there's very little of it

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.290
that has actually
been preserved.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.830
Well, this is also
true of advertising.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.110
Print advertising in magazines
is pretty well preserved

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.320
because there are lots and
lots and lots and lots and lots

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.620
of copies of magazines.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.370
So, a lot of advertising
history really is based

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.550
on magazine advertising because
you can actually access it,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.120
which is great.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.780
So, when I try to write
about radio and the role

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.730
of advertising agencies in
radio, naturally, there are not

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.920
that many recordings
or that many records

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.530
because it's ephemeral
and it's a media industry.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.710
But, what also happened with
some radio recordings is

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.780
that the advertising elements

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.370
in the recordings are
sometimes cut out.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.570
So, there are all sorts of
recordings circulating out there

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.760
like in the OTR community in
which that Lipton Tea commercial

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.130
in the inner sanctum
just doesn't appear.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.470
As a scholar, of course, I
want that context and I want

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.450
to be able to understand
how those things sounded

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:39.970
in those media artifacts.

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.660
So, I'm just going
to put it out there

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.550
that not only are the radio
programs ephemeral and difficult

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.000
to preserve and capture, but
then the role of the ad industry

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.300
and the importance

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.080
of the advertising texts
themselves were not seen

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.690
as important by some people who
are preserving these things.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.040
And as we're looking forward
as archivists and scholars,

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.340
what are the things today

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.280
that we're not thinking
are important now

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.580
but may be important
in the future.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.200
That is something that I
think we need to keep in mind.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.770
&gt;&gt; Ross Melnick: Okay
I guess I'm last.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.790
Let me see if I can tell you two
very short interlinked history

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.090
which will hopefully
be very short

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.390
and then we'll have
a relationship

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.990
to the conversation
we're having.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.630
I wrote this book,
American Showman, on Roxy

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.940
and it's interesting because
if you'll go back to 1925,

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.330
that's also somewhat of the
origin of the amateur hour,

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:33.000
in part because of course Samuel
Roxy Roth leaves the Capital

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.720
Theater to eventually open the
Roxy in 1927 and when he does

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.360
that Major Bo's takes over the
radio show and when he does

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.800
that Major Bo's is actually
a real estate developer

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.290
who becomes, a movie mogul, a
movie theater mogul if you will.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.930
And then he takes over the
radio show and runs that show

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.570
from '25-'34, when at WHN,
by the way Roxy begins

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.870
at WAF, it's call back.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:36:00.140
When he begins that show
at WHN he actually brings

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.720
that show to NBC in 1935.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.090
So for my purposes I
have that problem twice.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:13.030
And not even related necessarily
to his show and then he goes

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.480
to CBS for a year which
means no luck finding that.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.220
Once again, same issue, so here
I'm working on two broadcasters

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.020
over a 20 year period.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.650
I think the Library of
Congress has something close

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:37.390
to like 20 recordings or 40
recordings of the amateur hour.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:49.700
And the amateur hour as you
know goes form 1934-1970.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:37:50.250
From Dumont, there's my
call back over there.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman:
Thank you, Michael,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.000
what a great panel
you've put together.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.100
This is terrific, I'm absorbing
everything and it's bringing

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.120
so many things to mind.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:16.280
I will share some
experiences in attempting

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.940
to save audio archives.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.260
I'll synopsize these for you.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:28.540
I ran UPI's radio
network in the 1980s

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.970
and was the general
manager of CBS radio network

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.070
in the '90s through into 2000.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:42.240
And I think, as Mary Ann
said, there's a long tradition

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:48.530
of unceremoniously tossing
out archival material in radio

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:53.620
and it has long been
up to enterprising

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.810
in committed executives who have
the power to make that happen

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:08.330
and committed, thoughtful talent
like Sam Litzinger to bring

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:14.280
that material back to life
and then help preserve it.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.480
At UPI, where I ran
the broadcast division

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.400
from 1986-1990, it included
over sighted UPI radio network,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.960
which was then the principal
competitor to the AP radio

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.070
for audio services, and at
peak UPI radio I had more

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.060
than 800 subscriber
stations around the country

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.190
and was the principal
supplier of news audio

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.670
to NPR for many years.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:46.280
A lot of people thought that our
UPI correspondents were actually

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.110
NPR, like Bill Small with the
White House and Pye Chamberlayne

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.980
and Bonnie Erbe at Capitol
Hill, Bob Fosse in Los Angeles,

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.070
Carol Brooks in London,
Rob Navies is

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.370
at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.310
a lot of people thought
they were NPR people,

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.630
they were UPI radio folks.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.300
One day in 1986 I received a
call from our chief engineer

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.600
who lived in Pekin, Illinois,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.410
and he said that if we
didn't get these boxes

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.800
out of his basement by the end

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.800
of the week his wife
had instructed him

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.060
to put them out for trash.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.150
So we're hearing repetitive
narrations like these.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.680
Well, it turned out to be the
UPI radio archive dating back

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.330
to 1958 and so we hired a mover

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.600
and we brought everything
to Washington.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.440
And there was the mother lode,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.070
the archive of the United Press
International's audio services.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.990
And it included Yearend review
programs dating back to 1958,

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:52.490
newsfeed material, which is of
questionable long term interest,

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.290
but, a lot of voices and
a lot of news coverage

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.680
that hadn't been heard
in a very long time.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.630
We began to catalogue them;
we built a room to house them.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.510
Sometime after I left UPI
another executive determined

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.790
that the boxes were clutter
and ordered them removed

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.850
and that was the last
anyone ever saw of them.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:19.050
So they were found, retrieved,
saved, and then removed

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.420
and to this day nobody
knows where they went.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:29.590
In 1988 we created what was
called a UPI Radio Thirty Year

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.810
Retrospective, which
was a giveaway item

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.760
at the Radio Television News
Directors Association Convention

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.100
in Las Vegas and
that contained a lot

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.200
of wonderful historical
audio from the archive

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:50.450
and that is what remains of the
archive, that little compilation

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.670
and so we're happy
we saved that,

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.980
we're happy we put it together.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:01.810
I'm going to spin past CBS for
a moment and come up to the time

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.670
when I joined George
Washington University after CBS

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.300
and I received a call from a
wonderful, long time friend,

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.910
Bart Tessler, who's the
head of news programming

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.230
at Westwood One, who said
the network was moving

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.680
out of its headquarters
in Crystal City, Virginia,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.000
which is Arlington, Virginia,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.290
and his bosses had instructed
him to either find a home

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:27.230
for the Mutual Broadcasting
System and NBC Radio archive

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.160
or everything was going in the
dumpster at the end of the week.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.410
So we hired the same movers and
the collection was picked up;

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:43.060
900 boxes of seven and 10 inch
reels of tape and cassette tapes

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.920
and we brought them to George
Washington University here

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.610
in Washington.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.110
The collection included all

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.600
of Larry King's radio
programs on Mutual.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.910
I pulled one out of
the box and put it

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.630
on a reel-to-reel tape recorder

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.260
and it was Larry King
interviewing Buster Crab,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.690
so you never knew what
you were going to hear

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.860
when you pulled tapes
out of there.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.510
Several dramatic and
science fiction radio series

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.130
that were initiated in the
1970s including the Mutual Radio

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.800
Theater and a lot of newsfeed
material including their yearend

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.540
review programs.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.470
Those 900 boxes were then sent

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.730
to the Washington Research
Library Consortium Warehouse

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.940
in Upper Marlborough, Maryland,

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.550
and were placed in
that facility.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.170
Mutual did have an archivist
who helped catalogue those

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.810
and GW invested some
time and some money

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:40.580
into cataloguing that.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.420
We tried to raise
money to digitize them,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:49.690
by this time the processes
were in place to digitize them.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.170
It was expensive and we were
not able to raise the money.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:55.320
Not from the owners
of Westwood One,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.900
not from Larry King,
not from anybody.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.690
It was very difficult, in fact,
in turned out to be impossible

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.300
to raise the money at that
time for the digitization.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.570
I'm pleased to tell you that
those 900 boxes are still

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.480
in climate-controlled storage,
although, as you can imagine,

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.070
the tape is undoubtedly
deteriorating.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.620
It was moved to another
warehouse location

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.500
in Pennsylvania some
years ago, but it is still

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.570
under the auspices of
the Gillman Library

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.360
at George Washington University.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.790
At CBS, Sam and I had the
great pleasure of collaborating

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:41.020
on a number of documentaries
and wonderful archival programs.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.190
I served as executive producer
for several historical programs

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.110
at the turn of the millennium,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.150
including the three hour CBS
News 20th Century Roundup,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:56.120
which included the final reunion
of all of the surviving members

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.740
of Ed Murrow's original
team from World War II.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:04.200
We had Richard C. Hotilett and
Howard K. Smith and Larry LeSeur

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.320
as well as Bob Trout and Norman
Corwin joined us for the program

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.940
from California and we
used historical audio

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.240
from the CBS archive in the
broadcast which ran at the end

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:23.050
of 1999 on many of the then
400 CBS radio affiliates

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.650
around the country.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:30.210
I saved the three ten inch
master reels of the program

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.520
and created CDs of the masters

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.520
so the programming
would not be lost

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.920
and I think I may
be the only person

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.900
that has those at this point.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.860
Walter Cronkite and I
collaborated on several series

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:50.640
at CBS including a millennial
series called Walter Cronkite's

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.370
Post Script to the 20th Century.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.480
These are 31 one minute capsules

00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.960
in which Walter Cronkite
reviews historical events

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.420
of the 20th Century
using archival audio

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.120
and then offers a
postscript on the aftermath

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.590
and the significance
of each episode.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:13.140
We created CDs of the set

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.350
and I don't believe CBS
has that in its archive.

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.140
So, I think Sam has a
set and I have a set

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.010
and I think that's the archive.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.540
Walter Cronkite's
final special report

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.600
for CBS news was a radio report

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.780
when John Glenn went
back into space.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.310
In November, November 4,
1998, Walter and I went

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:40.460
to Houston together and during
the 40th anniversary of NASA,

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.020
before 2000 people,
Walter Cronkite engaged

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.340
in fifteen minute live
special report for radio,

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.600
A Conversation with
the Astronauts.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.710
Fortunately, C-SPAN was
there and C-SPAN recorded it

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:59.780
and at the end of that
broadcast Walter Cronkite closed

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.670
by saying, "And that's the
way it is, November 4th 1998,

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.600
this is Walter Cronkite
for CBS News in Houston."

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.440
That was the last time Walter
Cronkite offered his signature

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.250
close on a CBS broadcast.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.930
It is preserved because
C-SPAN was there

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:22.150
and it is now available
through the C-SPAN archive,

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.940
the video and the audio.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.370
There are, what I
would refer to,

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.600
as the Latter-Day
Saints in audio archives.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.420
Sam and I collaborated on a
one hour centennial tribute

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.880
to Louis Armstrong, which
featured Tony Bennett,

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.500
Charles Osgood, and others
who studio Centennial Salute

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.170
to Duke Ellington and perhaps
the last radio interview

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.520
with the great big band leader,

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.870
Artie Shaw, on his
90th birthday.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:56.480
It's a memorable interview that
Sam conducted with Artie Shaw,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.170
and interviews with Les
Paul, B.B. King, and others

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:04.060
and I do not believe that
these were retained by CBS.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.930
I was in my storage facility
in my couple of days ago,

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.620
I have the masters
to all of those

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.930
on ten inch reel-to-reel tape.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:16.180
And we did make CDs
of some of those.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:24.640
So, gives you an idea of how
tough it is to engage in this.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.080
I don't know, you know,
what has transpired

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.440
in the last few years at CBS.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.490
There was a wonderful
man named Tom Garofalo,

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:35.350
who was the CBS audio archivist

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.760
and if you can imagine Mel
Blanc's character protecting

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.530
Jack Benny's vault that's the
way I thought of Tom Garofalo

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:49.170
and I do recall asking him
for some archival material

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:53.360
and Tom brought up to my office
the original transcription disc

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.990
of Major Bo's Original Amateur
Hour with the whole Vulcan Four

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.400
and Frank Sinatra and the
original transcription disc

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:07.210
of War of the Worlds and,
so, I know they were there

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.710
at that time and then
they were taken back

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:14.140
down to Tom Garofalo's vault.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:19.820
And, but, this is a -- it's a
fascinating day and this is all

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.130
to say that I salute everybody

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:29.300
who is working toward the
preservation of these materials.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.840
I do think that there are some
important questions to ask

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.640
and maybe we'll get into
them including, you know,

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.320
who do you work with
at these networks?

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.980
Sam and I have some
thoughts about that.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.080
And also, what needs
to be saved?

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:50.240
Because the archives, there are
vast materials that are still

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.390
out there in different places.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.910
There are matters of space,
there are matters of time,

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.230
there are matters of money.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:59.620
Because the networks want

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.660
to monetize all this
stuff if they can.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.040
If they're still holding onto
it, and they're very reluctant

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.150
to release it for
other purposes.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.450
So, thank you very much.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.100
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Hi,
I'm Sam Litzinger.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.190
I'll be brief because I really
want to hear from you more

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.070
than I want to hear
from me, but following

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.370
up on what Mike was saying.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:22.060
Some people have the idea that
CBS has this vast audio archive

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.900
that I secretly go into
like in the early, you know,

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.660
Get Smart days of television
when people go through doors

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.010
and -- I don't know where
it is, if it exists.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.710
There is an archive across
the street from West 57th,

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.500
the main broadcasting facility,

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.120
primarily aimed at
television now.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.680
The audio stuff sort
of floats around,

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.980
but I don't know where it is.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.990
I've used, I think,
exactly one batch since 1998

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.290
and that was Tom Garofalo,

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.120
we were doing a Duke Ellington
special, and I said to Tom,

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.580
"Do you have anything on Duke
Ellington that I can use?"

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.380
and he said, "I don't know," and
kind of slunk off for three days

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.080
and then he came
back with this box.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.450
And the box was a big box

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.900
and it just said things
like, "Ellington."

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.080
So I started listening
to a reel-to-reel tape

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.320
and what I found, for example,
was a Mike Wallace interview

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.080
with Duke Ellington sitting
at the piano for an hour

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.670
and apparently it never aired.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.940
They just decided it
wasn't worth airing.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.360
So that's sort of sitting there.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.540
So there isn't really, at CBS,
an audio archives that I use

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.940
at all on a regular basis.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.240
I think Mike and I
have been to that,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.570
kind of by default being
part of the CBS archives.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.810
I thought I would play you
something if that's alright.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.400
So you can actually hear
what I occasionally do

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.230
with the archival material that
we have or that I can find.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.810
A while back they came to me

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:39.930
about a week before
the 75th anniversary

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:44.110
of the CBS World News
Roundup and they said,

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:46.480
"Can you do a special
show on that for the," --

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.490
I think it was going to
be for the weekend roundup

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.200
that we do -- and I said,
"Okay," because I say

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.950
that when I don't
know what else to say.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.170
And so I got to digging around
in our archives and I tried

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.980
to figure something out,
and then, what I normally do

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.470
when I'm processing it is find
out what material I have at hand

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:04.390
and then I write
around it and then try

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:05.690
to make something out of it.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.270
So if you don't mind, can
you play that for us please?

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.140
I think it's seven minutes,
something like that.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.440
&gt;&gt; Recording: This
is Sam Litzinger.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.870
In March of 1938, Europe
was getting ready for war.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:17.280
Adolf Hitler's German
troops were cheered

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.580
as they marched into Austria.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.070
A union, Hitler called
it, the [inaudible].

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.800
It was a blatant annexation
in the eyes of many others

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.440
and another indication that the
Nazis wanted more than the rest

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.240
of the world was
willing to give them.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.210
[ Foreign Language ]

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.850
On March 13th, CBS
radio executives decided

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:38.380
to put together a news program

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.080
to tell Americans
what was going on.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.380
&gt;&gt; Robert Trout: The program

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.070
of St. Louis Blues
originally scheduled

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.040
for this time has
been cancelled.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.460
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Robert Trout
anchored the first CBS World

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.850
News Roundup with sometimes
shaky audio links to people

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:56.100
like Edward R. Murrow in Paris,
in London, Vienna, in Berlin.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.310
&gt;&gt; Robert Trout: To bring you
the picture of Europe tonight,

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.630
Columbia now presents
a special broadcast

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.900
which will include pickups
direct from London, from Paris,

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.610
and such European capitals,
as at this late hour abroad,

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.470
have communication
channels available.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.150
This is Bob Trout speaking
to you from New York,

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:14.810
opening Columbia's short
wave transatlantic program

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.110
to cover the key
cities of Europe.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.630
But before switching to
our first European capital,

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.510
let us look once again at
the latest news bulletins

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:26.170
with swift, fresh details
of a Europe in turmoil.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:29.140
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: CBS management
insisted on live reports then,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:32.490
recorded pieces were
considered suspect somehow,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.130
and the technology for reporting
from the field was cumbersome

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:38.040
and unreliable anyway, so
live reports were the norm.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.110
&gt;&gt; Robert Trout: And now
Columbia begins its radio tour

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:42.880
of Europe's capital cities
with a transoceanic pickup

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.260
from London where we are to
hear Ellen C. Roarkinson,

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.680
woman labor member of
the House of Commons.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.880
We take you now to
London England.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.540
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: They called
them pickups back then,

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.440
we call them live
shots or hits today.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.790
I must say they're a heck
of a lot easier to do now

00:53:57.790 --> 00:53:59.400
than they were back in 1938

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.250
when there was no
internet, no cell phones.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.550
&gt;&gt; Roarkinson: While
Hitler continued or,

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:06.420
you might say completed,
his triumphant conquest

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.990
of Austria today, Great Britain
remained relatively calm.

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.870
Here in London there were some
anti-German demonstrations this

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:17.250
afternoon, a few
clashes with the police,

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.690
but nothing at all serious
compared with what I saw

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.080
in Vienna Friday and yesterday.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.120
What happened was this;

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.460
the International Peace
Campaign organized a big meeting

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.050
in Trafalgar Square.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:31.750
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: CBS's William L.
Shirer had just come to London

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.180
from Vienna and so was
able to tell what was going

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.480
on in both the cities.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.780
&gt;&gt; Shirer: -- in the
British government.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.900
There were boos and hisses
at the mention of the name

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.200
of the Prime Minister.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.250
When the meeting broke up,

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.160
most of the crowd
numbering several thousand,

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.360
and giving the clenched
fists moods,

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.660
marched on the German Embassy

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.400
in Carlton House
Terrace, not far away.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.710
Mounted and foot police;
however, blocked the way

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:58.680
at a respectable distance
and stopped the crowd.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.980
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: CBS
news correspondent,

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.450
Richard C. Hottilice, the last

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.530
of the famed Murrow boys
hired to cover the war,

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.830
remembers a reporter

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:08.920
in the field pretty much started
talking at an agreed upon time

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.820
and hoped that, somehow, the
broadcast actually made it

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.040
to New York and got passed
through to listeners.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.310
&gt;&gt; Hottilice: "We had a word
that you never hear anymore:

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:23.730
atmospherics, trying to
broadcast from the first army

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:25.610
in France and Belgium.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:30.400
More than half the time
you couldn't get through.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.580
What I'd do, you'd do your best,

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.750
and I'd get cables aimed
scheduling you for two minutes,

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:42.420
whatever it was, from so
and so and so and so to --

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.050
and you would appeal it.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:49.280
There was sort of a
little one room studio run

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.430
by Press Wireless, which
I think was an off-shoot

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:54.940
of the New York Times.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:59.140
You'd get there at the time
and you couldn't hear New York

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.700
or New York couldn't hear you

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.890
and if you couldn't hear New
York you went ahead anyway

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:07.270
at the appointed second, you
know, and if you start talking

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:10.570
up this is huddle it, --
you know, countdown go ahead

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:15.180
at ten seconds from now nine,
eight, seven, uh and go.

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.700
And on occasion, they heard you.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.670
They picked it up and it
was fine, but you never knew

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:24.370
until much later, if at all.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.740
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: The first
round had some glitches

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.280
and some dead air,
but it worked.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:32.020
In fact it was such a success
they did it again the next night

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.320
and helped set the standard

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.170
for radio newscasts
for decades after.

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:39.330
An anchorman, they were
almost all men back then,

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:41.790
opened program, gave a
summary of what was to come

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.650
and what the main
news was, and then,

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.670
if the radio gods were smiling,

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:49.690
listeners would hear
amazing things: live reports

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.680
from thousands of miles away
where Americans were fighting

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.380
and dying, maybe their
son or their father

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.390
or husband or sweetheart.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:02.930
&gt;&gt; Icy cold on the front
tonight and the mud on the roads

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:07.350
and in the fields is frozen
hard in wrinkles and folds.

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.930
The men, digging new positions
in the fields, have had to chop

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.580
up the ground with their
shovels and use axes.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.500
And overall over ruined
buildings and [inaudible]

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.790
and the ruins of
[inaudible] over everything.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:23.210
This late December
chill has brought a --

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.060
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: ask anyone old
enough to remember what it was

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:29.140
like to listen to a live report
from London during World War II,

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.600
it was a kind of miracle.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.570
&gt;&gt; Ed Murrow: This
is Trafalger Square.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:37.660
The noise that you hear
at the moment is the sound

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.190
of the air raid sirens.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.820
I'm standing here
just on the steps

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.120
of St. Marten's in the field.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.020
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: And if the first
world news roundup set the

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.230
standard, the man who became a
star made sure CBS's journalism

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.530
was first rate.

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.470
&gt;&gt; Ed Murrow: --
off in the distance,

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:57.350
one single beam sweeping
the sky above me now.

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:59.760
People are walking
along quite quietly.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.980
We're just at the entrance
of an air raid shelter here

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.110
and I must move this
cable over just a bit

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:05.730
so people can walk in.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.430
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: Ed Murrow
broadcast from rooftops

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:11.370
in London, reported from bombers
over Berlin, could barely speak

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:14.100
when telling the world what the
Nazis had done at Buchenwald.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.660
&gt;&gt; Murrow: The doctor's
name was Paul Hellot.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.780
He had been there since '38.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:22.670
As we walked out into the
courtyard, a man fell dead.

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:26.110
Two others, they must
have been over 60,

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:29.200
were crawling toward
the latrine.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.060
I saw it, but will
not describe it.

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.690
And in another part of the camp
they showed me the children,

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:36.990
hundreds of them, some were --

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.450
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: And it all began

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:45.220
with that first World News
Roundup March 13th 1938.

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.780
It had probably seemed
an impossible assignment,

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.280
find correspondents, make
sure they be near a microphone

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.740
at such and such time
ready to report the latest

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.290
on a world heading into war,

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:57.060
patch the relatively
primitive technology together

00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.370
as best you could and let's go.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:00.670
&gt;&gt; Bob Trout: This broadcast

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.140
from five world capitals
has been a presentation

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.310
of Columbia's Department
of Special Events

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:08.350
which will continue to cover the
European situation bringing you

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:11.090
special broadcasts and
bulletins as fresh news arrives

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:12.980
on this side of the ocean.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.830
Tonight at 10:30
Eastern Standard Time,

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:18.900
Columbia presents its regular
Sunday night news broadcast,

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.730
Headlines and Bylines,
which, tonight,

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:24.450
will include the latest
summaries at that hour.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:28.040
Bob Trout speaking, this is The
Columbia Broadcasting System.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.340
&gt;&gt; Litzinger: The Roundup showed

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.690
and still shows what
radio news can do best:

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:38.080
report and make some sense of
a world that never stays still.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.120
For the CBS News Weekend
Roundup I'm Sam Litzinger.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.020
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: So anyway
that's something that we did

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.060
with archival material
contemporarily.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.540
We love anniversaries
in broadcasting

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.950
so anytime there's
an anniversary,

00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:52.730
that's usually the
excuse to go back and find

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:58.220
out whatever we can get from
historical record and use that.

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.520
Michael?

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.070
Now -- [inaudible]
Almost none of it came

01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.840
from the CBS archives.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.130
I had in my own collection, I
had a lot of the Murrow stuff.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.070
My favorite period of broadcast
journalism is World War II

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.480
so I have a fairly extensive
collection of stuff in there

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.470
and I do have them arranged
so that I can find them.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:25.050
I mean I have Murrow
cuts individually labeled

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.530
and all that sort of stuff.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:29.290
And then Hitler I think I just
got off YouTube basically.

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.850
YouTube -- you'll find
that probably for all kinds

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.150
of radio networks,

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.340
any historical material
like this -- YouTube.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.760
That's where everybody
goes right now, so.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.590
Originally, that was
all CBS's material

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.300
so there's not copyright
problems, I guess in that.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.170
But, for some of the
historical material like,

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.810
and if it's in the public
domain you can use it

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.470
and that sort of thing.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:53.230
But yeah, that wasn't -- I don't
think any of that was actually

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:56.430
from the secret CBS
audio archives.

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:58.510
So, which I don't know
where they are, so.

01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:02.450
[Inaudible]

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.800
&gt;&gt; Shawn VanCour: Okay, I'm in
the unenviable position here

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.790
of being last so I feel
an obligation to try

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:09.700
to draw together some of the
things that I've heard here.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.970
As Michael mentioned
I wear two hats.

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.270
I'm a trained media historian.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.280
I also work in a program,
I teach archival studies.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.320
So I have three
historiographical issues

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.210
that I see kind of running
throughout different

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:26.360
presentations here and two more
archival studies issues I'd just

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.320
like to flag that will
hopefully be helpful

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.180
for larger discussion.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.680
So the first historiographical
issue is a question

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.980
of where we began.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.490
I was interested to hear people
grappling with this question of,

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:42.260
for radio history, is what's
early radio going back

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.830
to Noah's question, right.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:47.900
It's something I've dealt
with in my own work so,

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.250
traditionally, radio
history started

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.550
with the history
of the networks.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:55.620
What if we pushed that back
into the pre-network period.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.710
Film studies ran into a
similar problem, right?

01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.710
So early film, for a long
time, that was the beginnings

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.470
of the studio system,
but then there's a lot

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.770
that happens before that, right?

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.070
How far back do we go?

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.560
Do we go back to the beginnings
of wireless telegraphy?

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.470
Do we go back, even if
we're thinking more media

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.750
archaeological approaches,
to imaginations of radio

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:19.260
or radio-like technologies
before those actually existed?

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.630
And then, you know, what do
we consider radio recordings,

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:24.800
in that case?

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.870
And this question,
related to that

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:30.560
of historical contextualization,
so, if we're talking someone

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.260
like Jack Benny or Eddie Canter,

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.540
then is radio history also
the history of something

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.840
like Vaudeville, right?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.140
Is it the history
of film exhibition

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.590
if we're talking
someone like Roxy, right?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.570
Is it the history of
print advertising?

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:48.760
Is it the history of the --
since many of these people were,

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.140
also, recording stars,
is it the history

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.780
of the phonograph
industry as well?

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.180
So, where do we start
our radio histories?

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.970
Where do we look, then?

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.240
Where we start depends, you
know, affects where we look.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.200
And you know, then going back
to this question of network.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.920
History versus alternative
history,

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.860
something we've heard a
lot in this conference.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.400
The importance of
local community

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.580
of public broadcasting
histories.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.020
As Alex was talking about,

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.800
I think those lines are
not always so easy to draw.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.830
All network, I think here of, I
think Mark Williams has remarked

01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:31.380
that all network stations are
also local stations, right?

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.370
And then we do have these
histories of collaboration

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:35.900
between network and you know,

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.450
culture of community
broadcasters.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:43.330
There is the question of where
we look at the fragmentation

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:45.160
and dispersion of our
archival collections.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.330
I'm not sure that's a problem
unique to radio history, right?

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.470
It's one that historians
always grapple with, right,

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:53.740
nothing is ever in
the same place.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.840
But then, how do
you identify and get

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.180
at all those different
collections?

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.030
For radio, there is, one might
call it the paucity problem,

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:05.000
right, the lack of recordings?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.900
Though, there, if
we think about --

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.200
I think one of the
things that's come

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.200
out of these talks is
alternative sources, right?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.020
So we have print sources,
production records, scripts,

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:19.790
we also have -- and people often
mentioned, but policy documents,

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.260
license applications,
there's a lot of information

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.870
about our programming and
production methods there

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:29.010
and we also have, of course,
all of the trade presses,

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:35.390
the popular radio magazines,
the critics columns,

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.440
so there are other places
we can look for some

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.130
of this information to get
around that paucity problem.

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:47.180
And there is the discoverability
and access problem, there,

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.310
right, for discoverability.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:53.340
Hopefully something like the
RPDF database helps a little bit

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.640
with that.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.350
Finding where those
related materials are.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:04.970
That access problem
being, in part I guess --

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:11.640
What we're supposed to be
accomplishing here, right?

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.150
How do we build the
collaborations between the folks

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:18.840
like -- the mythical CBS
archive, which we need

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.140
to talk more about, right --

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.050
to what extent does
this exist, right?

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.310
To some of these collections
that have been harder

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.690
to get our hands on in the past.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.910
What do we look for?

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.610
It's sort of flipping this idea

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.590
of the program techs
on its head.

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:37.290
If we're doing histories
of commercial radio, right,

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.930
then this becomes --

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:41.810
we're looking for the
interstitial matter right,

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.780
as much as the main text.

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.140
And if we are looking
beyond strictly radio

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.880
and we're paying attention
to a lot of these performers

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:57.190
as intermedia stars or figures,
right, then, do the performances

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:59.830
in other media become every
bit as important, right?

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:03.000
So we need to listen to
those phonograph recordings

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.200
that have those radio artistry
and we need to watch the films.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:14.000
And then on the archival
site side of things,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.410
preserving these, right?

01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:18.380
This question of appraisal

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.310
that you were talking
about, what do we save?

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.550
This is something that we
might want to discuss here?

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:25.320
What do we see as the
really important material

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.780
that we want to privilege?

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:31.320
Where do we put that, right?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.680
That's always a question.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.710
And how is that -- I think we
should make the distinction here

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:41.410
as well between preservation
and digitization, right?

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:45.400
That these are not
necessarily synonymous.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.200
And then there is that
question of how people are going

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.500
to access that and
we start to get

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.690
into some copyright issues
there, but also, you know,

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:55.460
questions of resources.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.730
How can you make that available?

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.990
And then this feeds
into my last point,

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:04.200
which is more a question,
I think, of outreach.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.620
How do we share information
about these collections?

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.380
Scholarship is one
and education.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.540
We have going on right
now as we're talking,

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.160
the education session, so we can
hopefully, based on what we come

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.670
up with here, then work with
the folks who've been discussing

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.540
these education issues and
think about how to work some

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.930
of these materials into
the curriculum in ways

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:30.830
that might depart from
the existing curriculum.

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.890
And then, something I think that
has been brought to the table,

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.000
too, with what you two
were talking about,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.060
going with what Heather
was talking about earlier,

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.710
is the creative work, right?

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:46.060
That this is a great way
of exposing people to some

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.560
of these archival resources
and not just scholarship,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.840
not just in the classroom, but
also through creative work.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.310
So that's what I've got,

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:55.930
hopefully that helps get
some discussion going.

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:06.700
&gt;&gt; I saw the CBS
radio news archive.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.000
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Where is it?!

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.380
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you
where it was in 1975.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:16.860
I have a catalogue
of the disc portion.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:21.900
Martin Werber was the CBS
radio archivist at that time.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:27.500
Sam Serrat was the overall CBS
archivist, him I never met.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.740
Martin took me in, and this
was at West 57th Street,

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.800
in the same place
where the radio

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:39.670
and Walter Cronkite's news
room and the Bolton room was,

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:43.260
that same part of
West 57th Street.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:50.370
There was a cabinet in Martin's
office that was probably three

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:53.700
or four feet wide, four shelves.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:09:00.300
That was the CBS discs for CBS
News and Martin did a catalogue

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.710
of those, it's about 60 pages.

01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:07.440
I have, you know, a
Xerox of that catalogue.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.710
In the next room, which
was a much larger room,

01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:16.560
were all the tapes that
date back to the early '50s,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.950
to at that point,
which was around 1975.

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.640
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: And that
was all radio material?

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.090
&gt;&gt; That was all radio material,

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.310
none of the TV material
was there.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:31.350
So that, you know, as
far as the entertainment,

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:35.030
what I know about the
entertainment archive I can't

01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:36.330
say in public.

01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:38.260
I'll talk to you later about --

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.190
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Great.

01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:42.740
I'm sure it's a sad
story, but yeah, okay.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, about that.

01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:50.040
My other aspect of
CBS is Kate Smith.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.140
She was on the air from 1931

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:57.140
into the '60s at
least, in radio.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.480
There was something like less

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.140
than seven complete one
hour Kate Smith programs.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.970
There are seven of
the Kate Smith Speaks,

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:15.850
the fifteen minute noon
time program that she did.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.440
When I started doing
the research

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.140
on God Bless America we found

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:25.900
that that program
does not exist.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:30.050
None of the programs
from that era exist.

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:36.610
The choral director had the
Harry Smith recording studio

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:43.470
record the portions where
his chorus sang and Abbott

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:50.010
and Costello had Harry Smith
Studio record their routines.

01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:55.700
And the choral director
stuff was eBay'd disc by disc

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.730
by disc a few years back.

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:02.000
When it came to the God Bless
America disc he wanted something

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.940
close to $10,000 for it,

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.360
and which infuriated
Michael Feinstein.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.640
And Michael was able to
luckily notice that a dub --

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.770
and he didn't know it was a dub,
I figured out it was a dub --

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:21.170
a dub of that choral
director's disc was

01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:26.960
in Irving Berlin's personal
library, which is at Rogers

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.720
and Hamm at Lincoln Center.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.760
And so, now, I've inspected
that disc and I know

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.950
that it is a dub, comparing
it with the first minute

01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:40.360
that we have of the
choral director's disc.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:47.000
The Kate Smith fan club
director has about three

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.790
or four other recordings during
the next couple of months

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:59.240
of her doing God Bless America
so we were able to compare it.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.820
The Irving Berlin papers
in this building show

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:07.930
that it had been
recorded every single week

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:14.160
for if people were
interested in it, his agent

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.280
or the music publisher
would send it out.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.510
So we don't know -- all
Irving saved was the dub

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:30.460
of the first broadcast
November 10th 1938.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:36.970
But it's you know, and the words
are different, it's on YouTube.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.950
If the words are different

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.710
and if she does the
vocal introduction,

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.280
the spoken introduction
over a piano,

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.620
you've got the correct one.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:51.680
If it's a video of her, you
don't, you have the recreation

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.110
from this as the Army.

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:55.130
That was posted by
Michael Feinstein,

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:59.460
it's under a pseudonym.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.860
But it's amazing how little

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:07.020
of the important CBS
performers exist.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.020
The stuff exists only
if they contracted

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:17.900
out to have it recorded
by independent studios.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.180
I did a five and a
half hour broadcast

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:27.650
about God Bless America
and it's now available

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:30.540
on the web playing all
the different versions

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.500
that we do have, including
the one recording we have

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.470
of a closing of a
program from 1940

01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:42.520
with her singing God
Bless America at the end

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.170
and the closing theme of,
first, When the Moon Comes

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:50.710
over the Mountain and it
segues into God Bless America.

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:55.690
So, it -- there's so
little of her stuff it's --

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:59.300
and believe me, they've
been looking for it.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.750
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Yeah,
I'm afraid, I don't mean

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:04.880
to be overly cynical here,
but my guess is that,

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.740
if it costs money or it takes
time the media organizations

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.120
will not do it.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.090
Or, they might be
willing to say, "Okay,

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:16.640
we'll spend some money
and we'll take some time

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.670
if there's something on
the other end for us.

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.050
If we can make a profit
off of this somehow,"

01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:24.730
that might be incentive enough,
but it's just been my experience

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.390
that it's, again as
you were suggesting,

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:28.010
it's kind of a cultural thing.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.340
Nobody really says, "You know,

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.360
we ought to be saving
this stuff," and it's --

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.800
[inaudible] yeah, but you
know, what happens is the sort

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.840
of thing that Mike has run into
where new management comes in --

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.720
I mean, the horror
stories I've heard

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.710
from the Lawrence-Tisch
take over of CBS!

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:46.300
It's like, he came
in and he said,

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.800
"Why would I want
this old stuff?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.830
And why am I paying people
to keep this old stuff?

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.330
And why am I paying
for this room?

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.630
Get rid of this stuff!"

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.060
And it all just went away.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:00.720
Right, and there are exceptions
to it, but unfortunately,

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.320
the rule seems to be if it's
going to cost you something

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.070
or take time, we're
not going to do it.

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:06.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: I'll just
put a positive quota on it --

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.180
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger:
Good, it's about time.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.850
He'd used to do this
at CBS, too,

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.540
when I got overly
depressed about things.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: One of
the Walter Cronkite Postscripts

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:17.260
to the 20th Century is on Kate
Smith introducing God Bless

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.340
America on her CBS
radio program.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.450
I can't honestly tell you
whether the audio of her

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:28.250
in that capsule is
the original or not.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:32.550
Perhaps it isn't, but the
moment is captured by Cronkite,

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.510
which is quite lovely to have.

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:43.310
[ Inaudible ]

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:44.650
&gt;&gt; Shawn VanCour: So
I think another thing

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:48.790
that you're pointing to
here, Mike, is the importance

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:53.230
of reaching out and I love that
we have had a whole panel on,

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:56.440
you know, transcriptions
at this conference, right?

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.520
Who has these recordings
now, right?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.880
If they were not kept by
the original producers

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.130
and are reaching out to -- in
many cases as you mentioned,

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:06.640
right -- it may be
the fan communities,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.890
the collecting communities,
right, who have that stuff

01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:10.410
and who know about that, right?

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:11.870
So the importance of
really bringing them

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.170
into the conversation,

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.920
benefitting from their
expertise, right?

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.910
I wanted to also, just since
we got our mic back there,

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:22.310
for the folks up in the front
here who are on the panel

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:25.370
if you want to jump in --

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:26.670
&gt;&gt; Um, yeah.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:27.970
&gt;&gt; Shawn VanCour: Great, great.

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:30.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll keep it brief.

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.340
I'm, so this is really
interesting for me

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:35.020
because I'm a graduate
student and I study science

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.320
on television and most

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.630
of my dissertation work has
been focused on PBS programs

01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:42.820
because that's just sort of the
access I've been able to get.

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.540
Although, there's some really
great shows done, which I want

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.250
to talk to you maybe
more about, but, like --

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.420
Walter Cronkite's
Universe, which is hard

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.780
to find, but it seems amazing.

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:55.690
My question is, again, talking
a bit about the, like, NBC, CBS,

01:16:55.690 --> 01:17:01.200
ABC -- sort of on the executive
level, don't they all talk

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.530
to each other about how much
-- how great it would --

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.030
well, this is the
thing, I don't know, but.

01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:07.950
Do they, themselves, they feel

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:10.970
like there should be
an equal sourcing?

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:14.030
I mean, are they concerned about
the narratives that are written

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.690
that don't include CBS or NBC?

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:18.790
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: I'll let Mike
answer cause he was a manager

01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:21.830
at CBS for a while.

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:23.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: No.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:28.750
[ Laughter ]

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:31.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I will
just add to that,

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:35.520
that different institutions
have different cultures

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.690
about historical significance.

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.770
So every once in a while
you'll get lucky and you'll run

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:44.710
into an institution like
PBS that actually believes

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.200
in its institutional histories
being part of its legacy

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.430
and its value going forward.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:53.430
But most media industries
consider their value

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:55.760
to be ahead of them, right?

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.660
So they have to be
future-thinking

01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:00.300
and if they're thinking
about the past

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.870
that means they're
resting on their laurels.

01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:03.730
Or else they're referring
to things

01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:06.330
that might be embarrassing
to them in the present

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:07.730
or definitely don't
make them look

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:10.270
like they're forward
future-thinking.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.880
So my experience has been

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.500
that very few media
institutions think that way,

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.920
so NBC did deposit a
bunch of its records,

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.610
but then they stopped
doing that, right?

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:21.910
Anybody correct me if I'm wrong.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:25.200
They've stopped sending stuff
to Wisconsin to preserve

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.600
for historians to
continue using.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.260
J. Walter Thompson is the
only ad agency that I'm aware

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.290
of that has saved its records
and deposited them at Duke

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:36.160
and they continue to deposit
new records regularly there,

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.880
so in fact they keep growing.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.570
Because they're the only
ad agency that I'm aware

01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:43.550
of that think that it's
legacy is not only valuable,

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.020
but reflects well on itself.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.990
So, other agencies
their records are gone.

01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:51.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: NBC also
burned the earl kinescopes

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:53.540
of the early Tonight
Show to make room

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.310
on the shelf, so
it cuts both ways.

01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:58.500
One person who deserves
a real shout

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:04.160
out at CBS is Jeffrey Fager,
Jeff Fager is the producer

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.110
of 60 minutes and he was
the chairman of CBS News

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.140
at a very pivotal
time in its history

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.840
over the last 10-15 years.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:21.600
He is a person who cares
about CBS's history

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.200
and has worked hard
to preserve it.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.220
He also looked for
ways to monetize it,

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.940
which were a little
bit more difficult,

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.870
but Jeff is a really good
man and, most recently,

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.160
Jeff has commissioned research

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.670
through a lovely young
man named Sasha Reuther,

01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:45.620
for a new retrospective of the
Murrow Boys, which is based

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.310
on the Stan Cloud and Lynne
Olson book of the same title.

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:55.950
So, a real shout out to
Jeff Fager at CBS News.

01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:57.280
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: By the
way does anybody know

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.230
if NPR has an archivist?

01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.580
They do? They do?

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:06.050
Okay, they actually have full
time archivists who do that?

01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.350
I was just curious.

01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:11.600
And how accessible was NPR's
material to you scholars?

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.040
Okay. Alright.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:21.540
&gt;&gt; I have two points, the first
is probably blasphemous for some

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:24.800
of you collectors, here
but, in building an archive

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.050
of local media, I'll take
any recording I can get.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.140
I don't care if it's a dub.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:37.010
I'd rather save that than
limit myself to an original

01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:38.790
and not have anything.

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:40.870
So that's my blasphemous point.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:48.030
My second point for Mike and for
Sam, I was on KMOX in 1979-83

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:53.190
as an announcer and after
my retirement they asked me

01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:56.660
if I'd be their unpaid
historian, whoopee.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:01.770
I found a bunch of stuff,
but within the last year,

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:04.990
I got a grant at their request

01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:09.080
to digitize their
audio archives.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.360
CBS said, "We can't do it.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.430
There's a third party involved
here," my charitable foundation,

01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:19.160
"And we can't allow that."

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.370
My question for you, obviously
knowing that CBS radio is

01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:26.500
about to be sold, I've got
an in there, but how is one

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:31.050
to approach this
kind of thinking,

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:34.520
where I have an archive
in the palm of my hand

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.630
and I've got the
funding to digitize it,

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:41.390
and corporate lawyers say,
"Oh you can't do that."

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:42.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: It's
a really great question

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.000
and interestly enough,
someone who wasn't able

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.350
to make the panel
today is Harvey Nagler,

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:52.430
who recently retired
as vice president

01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:56.540
for CBS Radio Network News,
the person that brought me in,

01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.210
that brought Sam in to CBS.

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:06.350
And Harvey and I spoike on
Wednesday and I asked him

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:08.450
that specific question.

01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:10.300
I said, "You know, one
of the things that,

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:15.660
undoubtedly will come up is,
how do you access the material?"

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:21.830
And we both agreed that maybe
this is the wrong thing to say

01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:25.320
in certain quarters,
but you don't work

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.210
through the attorneys.

01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:29.610
You have to find,
and I said it before,

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:35.410
you have to find committed
executives who have the power

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:37.770
to make these things happen.

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:46.240
I think Jeff Fager is one of
the best people to come along

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.010
at CBS in the last 50 years.

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:54.410
He tutored under Don Hewitt
for many years at 60 Minutes,

01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:58.200
so he has that sense of history
within him, but I think you have

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.810
to work within an individual.

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:04.180
Because to try and
breakdown the barriers

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.810
from the outside is
extraordinarily challenging

01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:09.680
as you've found out.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.040
If you have an angel on
the inside, it can happen.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.400
You can make it happen.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.900
&gt;&gt; I've got a quick Harvey
Nagler CBS News story.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.200
An angel --

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.500
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger:
Is it a good one?

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.870
Okay, good, just checking.

01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:26.160
&gt;&gt; I found a piece of audio
here at the Library of Congress

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.630
in the NBC friles that
I could prove was CBS.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:33.980
And so I went and, Slate, I had
written an article for Slate

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.010
and the audio was really
key for the article.

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.980
And the librarians downstairs
said, "Oh what happened was,

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.130
when it was oversee stuff, RCA
just recorded the feed coming in

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:45.890
and didn't think about
it and threw it in there.

01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:50.320
You know, they didn't think
of whether it was NBC or CBS.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.100
And so I got the clip
and Brian Cornell, here,

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.700
in the Madison Building, said
to me, "You're going to have

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.140
to get the NBC permission.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.900
That's all I can tell you, but
if people find out at CBS,"

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.030
and my article said it was CBS,
"You're going to be in trouble.

01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:05.330
I'm just going to
tell you that."

01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:09.430
So I got the NBC permission,
then I got the dub from here

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.820
and they told me to
contact Harvey Nagler.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:14.200
And Iw as trembling, I
thought for sure this is going

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.090
to cost a fortune,
he's not going

01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:18.700
to let me put this on the web.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.000
I sent him an email, I
described it clearly,

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.080
and while I was doing an
education or whatever,

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.800
the email came back within 24
hours that said, "Go for it."

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.580
No charge, no anything,
just put it on there.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.880
So.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.180
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Yeah, well,
it's always been a mystery

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.060
to me why there isn't a
coororation, particularly

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.610
with academic institutions
and educational outlets and so

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.910
on it's just a mystery.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.860
If it were up to me, you
could all have access

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.690
to anything we had, but
it just doesn't work

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:47.000
that way for some reason.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.770
I guess because lawyers
are involved

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:51.070
with this stuff, I don't know.

01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.570
&gt;&gt; I'm Karen Fishman,
I'm supervisor

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:05.360
of The Recorded Sound Research
Center and Brian is one

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.040
of staff members and I just,
too, want to sing the praises

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.230
of Harvey Nagler because
whenever we had a CBS --

01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:15.830
so the library doesn't
own any copyrights.

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:19.320
So whatever we get -- if
somebody wants a copy they have

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.990
to -- our policy is they
have to get permission

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:24.290
from the rights holder.

01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:26.570
Harvey always said yes.

01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:30.560
Harvey was a joy and a
wonderful person to work with

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.110
and I just can't say enough

01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:36.770
and maybe we should
contact Jeff Fager.

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:39.150
Maybe he'll be another
Harvey, I don't know,

01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:43.020
but if you have some names of
people that we could contact

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.450
that would really help
the researcher community

01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:49.330
because we're always -- we
need to have that information

01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:50.630
so we can give it to people.

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:53.340
We want to give access --
we want to you, you know,

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:56.240
we want to give the
recordings we have,

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.110
that the library has, to people.

01:25:58.110 --> 01:26:00.960
We don't want to just have it
here, you have to come here,

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.770
we want to give it -- but
we have to have permission

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:05.070
from the rights holders.

01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:07.650
So, but I just wanted
to say, Harvey?

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:11.520
The best. So we really
appreciate all that he did.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: Harvey
and I talk every week.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.770
I'll be very pleased
to pass along all

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:18.040
of your nice comments
to him, thanks.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.540
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Andrew Depuso,

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.750
I work for Manon
Archiving Services.

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:23.610
I don't have a lot of
experience in radio,

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:26.350
that's primarily why
I'm here and thank you,

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:27.870
it's been a great panel.

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:31.260
But I do work with some of the
television news organizations,

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.110
so I'm working with
FOX News in New York,

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:35.250
for instance, and some others.

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.130
But FOX specifically, has
just hired a managing director

01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:41.800
for their archive, which I
thought was quite interesting

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.820
and he has taken an
active role in trying

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.420
to monetize their archive.

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:51.220
FOX, as part of this
initiative, did a survey.

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.040
And we know where
these tapes are.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.160
And they've identified 2,000,000
tapes in their archive that are

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.320
at risk of going away.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.790
A lot of the three quarter
inch are probably no good

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:02.410
anymore anyway.

01:27:02.410 --> 01:27:04.950
So the reason they're doing
this, and I think the reason

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:06.530
that most broadcasters
are protective

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.430
of their assets is they
always feel there's going

01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:10.380
to be some way to
monetize these even

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.090
if we don't know
what that is today.

01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:13.390
So they don't want
to give out --

01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:14.730
and before this I
worked for Sony Music

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:17.620
and I can tell you that's
exactly how they felt.

01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.040
So, I guess my question
is, is there interest

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.870
in potentially finding ways
to monetize these archives

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:27.460
that you could bring to the
broadcasters and say, "Hey look,

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.360
podcasts, all the
rage these days,

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.110
why don't you start broadcasting
these things again and looking

01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:35.510
for some way to get advertising
or other ways to monetize it,

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:38.050
so you know, you're
not basically looking

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:39.740
at something that's
going to rust."

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.880
I mean, old tape by
the way, is you know,

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.530
has got limited lifespan.

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:44.830
So it's either going
to become rust

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:46.630
in the not too distant future
or they're going to have

01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:48.790
to find a way to
make money with it.

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:50.090
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Yeah,
I mean, that's a concern.

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:51.940
If they don't monetize this
thing pretty quickly it's going

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.080
to disappear and then they won't
have anything left to monetize

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.130
so that's a big concern, but.

01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:57.430
Do you want to speak
to the other thing?

01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:58.730
What could you do?

01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:00.390
Or anybody else down
at the other end --

01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:01.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: I
think it just goes back

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:05.790
to what this gentleman
mentioned from KMOX.

01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:07.410
When there's third
party intervention,

01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:11.960
there's immediate reluctance
to participate in it.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.550
&gt;&gt; I'd just like to mention
that there are 750 episodes

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:23.870
of Jack Benny's radio show
available and it's not

01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:29.030
because of NBC or CBS or
the advertising agencies,

01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.060
it's completely due
to collectors.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.960
The individual collectors
who got copies

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.610
of the transcription discs,
got the AFRS recordings,

01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:42.430
and so it was them
sharing and trading tapes

01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:47.150
that have created the -- I'm so
grateful for the bounty I have

01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:49.370
for the performer
I've been studying.

01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:53.920
But, it turns out that it's
due to fans, to collectors.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.220
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Hey, Noah,
quick question for you.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.730
Who was recording that early
stuff that you mentioned back

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.240
in the '20s and how
was it recorded?

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.620
&gt;&gt; Noah Arceneaux:
Actually, prior to 1920,

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.610
I can't remember the
gentleman's name,

01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:10.250
but there was a German wireless
station in New Jersey --

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:13.030
yes, thank you, thank you.

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:15.590
This radio amateur was convinced

01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:18.240
that the Germans were
hiding secret messages

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.980
within the Morse Code so
he recorded, I think it was

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.000
like on a cylinder, it
wasn't even like a disc.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.730
Yeah, so there as a recording

01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:29.310
of wireless telegraphy
and he was correct.

01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:31.160
There were in fact
German messages hidden

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.460
in the Morse Code.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.180
I don't know of any other
recordings from that era.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.480
Are there other Morse Code --

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.780
[ Inaudible ]

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:45.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted
to make a comment

01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:47.390
about the monetization issue.

01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:53.600
Yeah, I mean I study
organizations

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.020
that are trying to
monetize culture.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.630
The problem with
historical research, though,

01:29:58.630 --> 01:30:01.790
is that when an organization
considers it

01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:04.930
to be potentially
monetizable (phonetic),

01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:08.980
that means that they don't
want to give anybody access.

01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:12.440
And so it kind of destroys
efforts by archivists

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.700
and scholars to get access to
it because it gets locked away

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.870
until it gets lost,
stolen, or destroyed.

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:23.350
So it actually makes me really
anxious when I hear people talk

01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:28.150
about trying to monetize, you
know, older media artifacts.

01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:30.810
But I'm also, you know,
there's a conundrum,

01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:32.820
which is that the stuff
is going to get thrown

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:36.560
out because it's too
expensive to maintain.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.790
And so then the nonprofit world,
the educators, the archivists,

01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:43.150
the libraries, the scholars
have to raise money to try

01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:46.490
to preserve it, but that in
and of itself is not enough.

01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:48.130
Because what often happens --

01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:50.710
and I've been involved
in a particular case --

01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:54.780
where the boxes are in a
warehouse in New Jersey,

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.080
but they're not going

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.930
to the archive even
though they were promised

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:01.000
because money has
to change hands.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.240
And the private company
thinks it should be paid

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.930
for all of its records.

01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:08.380
Whereas the archive thinks that
it needs to be paid in order

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.250
to catalogue these
thousands of documents.

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:15.110
And so since nobody has
the money and nobody wants

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:17.490
to spend -- the private
organization doesn't want

01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:20.350
to spend the money and the
archive doesn't have the money,

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.640
they're just sitting
in the warehouse,

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.760
possibly until they get
thrown in the landfill.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.170
And so if there's any
notion of monetization going

01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:33.000
on in anybody's mind, I think
it tends to undermine the goal

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.850
of archivists and scholars,
which is just to preserve stuff

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:42.430
for the cultural, historical
legacy, not necessarily to try

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.970
to make a profit
off of artifacts

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:47.250
that no longer have a
profitable possibility

01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:49.130
or potential anymore.

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:51.440
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Is there
any way around that, though?

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.060
Is there a solution to this?

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:56.550
&gt;&gt; I actually have an example
-- is anybody here familiar with

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:59.300
or worked with NBC Learn?

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.670
NBC Learn -- they
have it in Indiana?

01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:08.410
Yeah, NBC Learn in
2011 signed a contract.

01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:10.060
It's a unit of Universal,

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.730
although NBC's changed
hands, with Blackboard.

01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:16.000
Any of you who teach,
did you see Blackboard

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.880
for about three years,
from about 2011-2013,

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.280
had a little column on the left
that said NBC Media Library.

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.880
And anybody -- you'd click on
it and it had amazing stuff.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.480
It had the Hindenberg
Explosion, I mean, now,

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.830
anybody gets it from YouTube.

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.520
It had tons of great stuff
from the NBC archive.

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.880
The problem was when you
clicked on it from Blackboard,

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.870
they'd charge your institution.

01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:42.280
So you had to get permission
from your institution.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.610
That's an example of getting
around the monetization.

01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:48.120
Somewhat for academic purpose.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.370
I'm sure NBC wasn't
charging Blackboard

01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:54.590
and the institutions what
Proquest or somebody else does.

01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:55.890
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Well,

01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:57.190
my question for you is
how did they get the stuff

01:32:57.190 --> 01:33:00.560
from the NBC archives onto
the Blackboard website.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.920
Somebody had to do that, right?

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.320
&gt;&gt; You can -- it's still live.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.230
I don't know if the unit still
exists, but it's still live.

01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:06.680
You can go to NBC
Live dot com --

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.240
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: No I mean how
did somebody take the material

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.010
that NBC had and
transfer it over,

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:12.870
because some human being
had to do that, right?

01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:14.190
Several human beings had --

01:33:14.190 --> 01:33:15.490
&gt;&gt; I think it was just a shell.

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:18.290
I think NBC constructed --

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:22.310
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Maybe
somebody knows the answer.

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:27.130
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if this
is completely relevant,

01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:31.150
but when we -- so when somebody
wants something from NBC

01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.010
from the library that
we have the archives,

01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:36.310
we tell them they have to
get permission from NBC.

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:41.220
Many, many times NBC will
then put in an order,

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.200
they'll want what
they -- what we are --

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.980
what the person is asking
for because we charge

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:48.280
for the transfer, right?

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:53.520
So you'll get permission, but
NBC will then ask for a copy

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.920
for themselves, then
I think they were --

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.790
then they would give it to the
person who was asking for it.

01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:01.290
They would give it
to them directly.

01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:03.300
They would get a copy of
it, make a copy of it,

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.280
and then put it on
their website.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.500
So I think they were
getting it from us.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.480
They were being charged for
that and then putting it on.

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.440
I think that's how they got it.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.740
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Okay,
yeah I just wasn't sure

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.310
because it sounds like somebody
actually has to do something,

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:18.650
which can be a problem
at networks

01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:19.950
to get somebody to
actually do --

01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:22.380
&gt;&gt; Well we were doing,
what we would do is,

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.130
we would make the
digitization of the recording,

01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:28.330
send it to NBC, who
would then give it

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.110
to the researcher requesting it,

01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:32.280
but then they would have
a copy for themselves.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.580
So we would -- the Library of
Congress was doing all the work

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:36.880
for them, so to speak.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.800
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: We like it
when other people do the work --

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.730
&gt;&gt; So the Americna people, so
we charged them, so it wasn't

01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:47.220
that your tax dollars
were going to NBC.

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:51.090
&gt;&gt; Just to go along with
this, I mean I'm always sort

01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:54.810
of in this weird limital
state where I hear the desires

01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:56.900
from collectors and
archivists and researchers

01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:00.290
and then I hear the desires
of the media companies aside.

01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:04.240
And just to add a little bit of
empathy, if you haven't worked

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.540
in a media company before.

01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.690
This are incredibly
fortious places.

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:11.580
So you may work for CBS, NBC,
and you guys can correct me

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.860
if I'm wrong, but if you're
edecting your job isn't

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.160
to care for the archive.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.800
You don't have a way to
care for the archive.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.100
It's just, that's how it is.

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.680
And it can be horrifying
because you have your job

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:27.720
and then the next cubicle
over are the people

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.180
who should be saving what
you know should be saved

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.480
and you have no ability unless
you're higher up, to save it.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.780
So, I just always like to
spell that out because I know

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:39.290
that it's easy to
demonize even --

01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:40.860
I'm not going to
mention the Tisches --

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:44.050
but it's easy to
demonize the executives

01:35:44.050 --> 01:35:45.660
who may have thrown
this stuff out,

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.130
but it's no doubt it
was not their decision.

01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:49.600
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: No,
It's my experience that's

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.900
absolutely correct.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.640
What we do currently, is
at the end of the day,

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.840
one of the desk assistants,
if they think about it,

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.260
will file away some of the
major audio for that day.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.890
Maybe a dozen cuts or something,

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:03.640
if Trump says something
important,

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.890
that will go into a little file.

01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:09.410
Now, all of us who have access
to the CBS computers have access

01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:12.560
to those files, but that's
not really historic material

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.700
in the sense that it's, maybe,
only five years old, maximum.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:19.090
And occasionally they'll
put other things in there

01:36:19.090 --> 01:36:21.950
as they think about it, but
there's nobody specifically

01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:25.840
in charge of saying, "It is
my job at the end of each day

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.210
to take a certain number
of cuts and put them

01:36:28.210 --> 01:36:30.050
into the archival file."

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:33.070
And if it, some days it just
doesn't happen, you know, so.

01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:34.860
It's sort of hit or
miss, unfortunately.

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:37.270
&gt;&gt; Right, and that's why there's
been a real movement in terms

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:39.880
of film archives to really
systematize this stuff more --

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.480
and especially because the
media companies understood

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.940
that the assets were
worth a lot of money.

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:47.720
And so when they began to
realize there's a lot of money,

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.910
it was a lot more reason
to begin archiving things,

01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:52.630
preserving them, conserving
them and making them accessible,

01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:54.840
not for others, but
for disseminating

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.140
for Blu-Ray and streaming.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.460
&gt;&gt; Noah Arceneaux: If
I could just jump in

01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:01.730
and tell a sad story that I
could just kick myself for.

01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:07.310
From '96 to about '99 I was
working on the CBS News website.

01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:10.120
Originally, they called
it CBS News on the Web.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.770
And even in '96, those of us

01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:15.060
who worked there were
like, "This is a dumb name.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:17.480
CBS News dot come, please."

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.100
And then, sure enough,
eventually --

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.880
the point is, I knew that what
we were doing was important

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.990
and I knew this was a
new media technology,

01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:27.290
I didn't save any of it.

01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:29.420
I didn't save screen
shots of any of it.

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.770
And all of that stuff is gone
and I now really look back

01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:36.170
and regret, I was like, "Why
didn't I just take out a camera

01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:38.700
and take a screen shot
of AOL on my computer?"

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.230
or whatever it was.

01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:42.660
But there was no
one there thinking,

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:46.960
the present-ism we're always
looking for like Cynthia said,

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.600
who would ever want to
look at an old website?

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.530
Media historians exactly like
us, this would be valuable,

01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:55.830
I just can't believe
I didn't save it.

01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:58.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I can add to that,
I did the exact same thing.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.580
I worked on true mark
interactive websites,

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.960
never thought to myself,
this was 1998-1999,

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.260
I never thought it
should ve saved.

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.640
There was an organization
called Hollywood in Pixels,

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.420
which is now trying to go back

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.930
and preserve all the
digital media campaigns

01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:15.210
that have been run
for the last 20 years.

01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:18.030
Because nobody thought
of it, and you know,

01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:21.060
I grant you neither one of us
had PhDs at that point to think

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:24.000
of that sort of thing, but
the reality is we still didn't

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.300
do it.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.160
And so, maybe that's where
my empathy comes from,

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.750
because I guess you're
right, I'm just as guilty,

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:31.050
well maybe not just as guilty --

01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:33.590
&gt;&gt; Alex Kupfer: So they're
preserving current campaigns

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:34.890
too, though?

01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:37.260
&gt;&gt; My understanding is that
they are now trying to,

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.410
they have an awards
ceremony every year --

01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:41.710
yeah, they are trying.

01:38:41.710 --> 01:38:45.470
I don't know the actual efficacy
of sort of their archival thing,

01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:48.310
but they are trying to go
back and do all that work.

01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:51.000
All the way back to
things like the AI website,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.970
which was quite innovative
back in the day, you know,

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:54.710
all those sort of campaigns.

01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:56.010
But you're right,
and that's sort

01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.320
of the position that
everyon'es in.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.270
When you're running that fast,
especially when you're working

01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:03.760
in a media company, it's only on
your subway ride home you think,

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.210
I really should save that.

01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:08.050
Maybe you have that
conversation, most people don't.

01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:09.350
They just gon on to the next.

01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:12.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Freedman: I
think I'ts really important

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.320
to look for the hook.

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:19.250
That's what the broadcasters
are interested in.

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:23.590
Sam said it earlier,
we love anniversaries.

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:26.860
We did a lot of our
work together in the run

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.620
up to the millennium
celebration.

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:36.270
And the end of the 20th century
and CBS's role in broadcasting

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.570
in the 20th century

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:41.900
and in particular CBS
radio's role in it.

01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.780
And that captured
people's attention.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:47.750
But I will say, this
is just anecdotal, but,

01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:50.460
the day we recorded
the third hour

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:55.120
of The CBS News 20th Century
Roundup with those Murrow boys

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.320
in the studio, Andrew Hayword,
who was then the president

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.240
of CBS News, came over
to the studio, went in,

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.960
and greeted Dick Kotalet
(phonetic) and Robert Trout

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.040
who was then 90 and all these
wonderful, wonderful people.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.580
And then he came out and he put
his arm around me and he said,

01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:16.510
"Thank God somebody
thought to do this."

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:18.690
That's what it comes down to.

01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:19.990
It is.

01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:21.290
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: And
part of our problem is,

01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:23.970
I think of networks sometimes,
particularly news organizations,

01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:28.020
as sort of the Zen of all this.

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:31.730
We only live in the eternal
now and we don't tend to think

01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:35.670
of much that happened before and
we rarely look into the future.

01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:37.510
It's always, "Oh my
god a Trump tweet!"

01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:40.220
And then the entire news
organization sort of moves

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.440
in that direction and
it's just a series

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.740
of these things that happen.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.620
So, really, unless you have
somebody within the organization

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:50.670
who is thinking seriously
about preserving the history

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:52.170
or what do with the history

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:54.420
that we already have it
just doesn't get thought of.

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:56.430
That seems to be the
big problem for us.

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.170
&gt;&gt; Well, actually
I just want to add

01:40:58.170 --> 01:40:59.960
that I think Trump
is coming back

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.170
to what I was saying
before about FOX.

01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:03.810
I think that's a great example.

01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:06.990
It comes back to that
point of monetization.

01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:09.170
Right now, FOX News
and most people

01:41:09.170 --> 01:41:11.550
who have intellectual
property of any kind see

01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:13.130
that as a potential
to make money

01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:15.360
and they're not about
ot give it up.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.970
And FOX News is a good
example of that right,

01:41:17.970 --> 01:41:21.940
because they have all this
FOX News video of Trump back

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:25.060
in the '80s hanging out with
Marla and doing all this stuff

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:27.320
and so all of these news clips

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:30.400
that were basically collecting
dust in Secaucus, New Jersey,

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.540
in one of their facilities,
now very valuable.

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.260
There's all sorts
of demand for it.

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.410
For that reason, they're coming
to us, we're digitizing this,

01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:43.130
we're preserving it,
so if nothing else

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.760
from the FOX News
archive we will have Trump

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.150
preserved forever.

01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:48.450
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Why
are they doing that?

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:50.970
Are they doing that for
news purpose or in the hopes

01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:52.270
of selling some of that?

01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:53.570
&gt;&gt; They're doing clip sales.

01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.290
And Sony, by the
way I work for Sony,

01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:57.000
so I've done work
with Sony Pictures.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.080
Sony Pictures is now
doing this as well.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.670
They see an opportunity to go
into the clip sale business.

01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:07.440
And the internet and new
technology is making this

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.290
immensely easier than it
was just a few years ago.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:13.200
So it's easy for them
to put up these clips,

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.010
monetize them pretty
easily, they sell it

01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:16.340
by the two minute segments.

01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:18.980
I mean they don't sell
much more than that.

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.840
But you know, you want
to do a thing on Trump,

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.800
you want something with
Marla, there you go.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.360
Right? So they can
give you that sort

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.230
of thing out of their archive.

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:30.370
And I just, one last thing
about that, I also worked

01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:32.820
with Sony Music and
there's not a record

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.580
that anybody had even
the remotest interest

01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:38.040
in that hasn't been
digitized and restored

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.380
and preserved forever.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.310
Because there was a profit
motive in all of that.

01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:44.920
So, right now, what Sony
and Universal and the rest

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.020
of them are doing is
going beyond the records

01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.930
that they had released
from the beginning of time.

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.970
And they're going to the stands,
they're going to the outtakes,

01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:54.570
they're going to
the multi-tracks.

01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:55.870
Calgary --

01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:57.170
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Box
sets of things and --

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.470
&gt;&gt; Exactly right.

01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:02.240
And now they're thinking, maybe
there's a way to monetize these.

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.540
So you know, that's the sort

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.060
of thing that's basically
taking place now.

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.360
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Interesting.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.660
&gt;&gt; Shawn VanCour: I want to jump

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:10.290
in here while the mic's being
passed and just push back

01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:12.230
against the -- it's easy to --

01:43:12.230 --> 01:43:13.530
and I actually sympathize
with this

01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:14.830
because I encounter this
all the time, right --

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:16.820
it's easy to lament
everything we don't have.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:19.200
But I want to flip that on
its head and point toward --

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.460
I think, one of the things that
we've heard at the conference,

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.920
like, it's all of these amazing
collections we didn't know

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.220
about when we came hre, right?

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.730
Look at everything that's out
there that people aren't using.

01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:29.950
So how do we get people
actually using the stuff that's

01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:31.250
out there, right?

01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:33.470
How do you find out about it?

01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:38.190
How do you match the researchers
to the archives that --

01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:40.360
how do you match the
educators with these archives?

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.110
So to just put a more
positive spin on this,

01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:45.060
looka t all of the
history that is preserved,

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.050
let's get people using this.

01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:51.500
&gt;&gt; You may be able to
stop kicking yourself.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.440
I checked the wayback
machine nd there are entries

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:57.780
to CBS all the way back to 1997.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.450
&gt;&gt; Noah Arceneaux: Many of
the images are broken now.

01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:00.750
I've looked at that.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:03.590
There's just this kind of
outline with some words

01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:06.370
and I was like, "I know what
used to be on that page."

01:44:06.370 --> 01:44:12.850
&gt;&gt; I've been curious about
this last couple of days.

01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:16.910
The emphasis on public
broadcasting radio archives

01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:22.200
and you know, as we heard at
the very beginning of this.

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:27.590
This is the token program
on commercial radio

01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:31.110
and you know the focus has been
on the golden age of radio.

01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:35.430
We're talking about the problem
of collecting radio today

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:37.810
and there are 14,000
radio stations, it's like,

01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:39.500
we haven't heard much
in this conference

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:43.520
about collecting the -- you
know, commercial radio today.

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.260
Isn't that part of
our cultural heritage?

01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:48.660
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Do they
still have logger reels?

01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:50.360
Do you remember?

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.090
Does anybody know this?

01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:54.060
&gt;&gt; It's all done digitally.

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.940
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: It's
still an FCC requirement,

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.240
correct, is that?

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.270
It never was an FCC requirement?

01:44:59.270 --> 01:45:03.150
For those of you who don't
know, back in the old days,

01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:05.040
when I was starting in radio.

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.770
You had this thing that
was called a logger reel.

01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:10.770
And it was a slow-moving,
gigantic reel.

01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:13.880
And it would slowly turn
around and, in theory,

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.500
it recorded every single thing
that went out over the air

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.820
on your radio station
for that day.

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.990
Then at the end of the
day, the midnight guy had

01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:24.760
to change the logger reels,
or however long it was.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.600
Some of them would last
like three days or five days

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.900
or a week or something.

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.140
But then somebody pulled
them off and, theoretically,

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.680
they were stored some place.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:36.180
And that was required at every
radio station I worked at up

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.840
until I joined the
networks in the early '80s.

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.080
&gt;&gt; I can add something
that I was going on now.

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.290
The major radio station
in Atlanta, Georgia,

01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:52.220
it's been on the air
since about 1924,

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.020
I know some people
who work there.

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.650
They still have a
logging service.

01:45:55.650 --> 01:45:59.860
It's not a tape anymore, it's a
digital wav recorder type thing.

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:03.180
And they're dumped after two
weeks or a month automatically.

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:07.270
And he told me, and he would
know, cause he's big in news

01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:10.380
at that station, that the only
way anything is saved past

01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.570
that is if he wants,
specifically, to save something

01:46:13.570 --> 01:46:15.190
for his personal collection.

01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:17.830
And that's the policy
from the legal department.

01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:19.150
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: So
maybe that's some answer

01:46:19.150 --> 01:46:21.670
to your question, it's
not getting saved.

01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:23.340
A lot of it is not
getting saved.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:26.400
&gt;&gt; We did have our Born
Digital panel this morning.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:30.030
Denver, you were on that,
did this come up at all

01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:33.310
for current commercial content
or was it more podcast focused?

01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:34.610
More podcast?

01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.910
Okay.

01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:37.210
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Yeah,
if you can get something

01:46:37.210 --> 01:46:39.720
on the web it's likely to
live, but if you don't put it

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.230
on the web then it's
likely not to live.

01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:43.530
It seems to me.

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:46.990
I started at this little station
in Titusville, Pennsylvania,

01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:49.440
that used to save all
of its logger reels.

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:52.160
You know, and it had, like,
hundreds of these logger reels

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.570
and then the station got sold to
somebody and the truck pulled up

01:46:55.570 --> 01:46:58.020
and they dumped it all
out and it's all gone.

01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.930
So you know, if you don't
make a conscious effort

01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:04.470
to save this stuff, it's
unlikely to get saved.

01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:06.300
&gt;&gt; Alright, now I'm
Thomas Witherspoon.

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.310
I'm actually here representing
a project we're working

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:12.060
on called the Spectrum Archive,
The Radio Spectrum Archive.

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.430
I don't know how
many of you were

01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:18.520
in the curation panel
yesterday or the forum,

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:22.930
but basically we've
been enthusiasts, fans,

01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:25.620
have been making
spectrum recordings,

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.410
which are not an audio recording
of an individual broadcast

01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:32.460
on an individual
frequency, but a recording

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:36.900
of the entire AM broadcast
band, for example, all at once.

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.920
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: How
the heck do you do that?!

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.220
[ Inaudible ]

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.520
Oh.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you're -- yeah.

01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:45.440
You're --

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.060
It's, yeah it's about
one and a half megahertz

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:50.070
to get the entire
AM broadcast band.

01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:51.760
You can also do the
FM broadcast band,

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.710
shortwave bands,
and -- it's, pardon?

01:47:56.710 --> 01:47:58.010
[ Inaudible ]

01:47:58.010 --> 01:48:00.630
Yeah, yeah, it's
actually not that wide.

01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:02.220
The archives, I mean,

01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.460
the spectrum recordings
are quite large,

01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.550
so they're not easy
to manipulate.

01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:12.270
But, you know, for the past
two presidential elections,

01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:16.130
for example, I recorded the AM
broadcast band as it was heard

01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:17.960
in Asheville, North Carolina.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.830
So during the day,
local stations.

01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:21.660
At nighttime you could
hear things from all

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.990
across North America of course.

01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:26.250
So you can go back now

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:31.070
with a software defined radio
application, take my file,

01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:33.490
and you can tune through it
as if it were live radio.

01:48:33.490 --> 01:48:35.770
It's all the radio
stations and the static

01:48:35.770 --> 01:48:38.980
in between, everything.

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:45.680
And, so, that's one way around,
I guess, having a logger reel is

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:51.010
that people can make recordings
of more than just station.

01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:53.240
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: And what
are you doing with this?

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:56.370
&gt;&gt; Well, right now, I'm trying
to find a home for these files.

01:48:56.370 --> 01:49:00.550
At home, right now, talk about
an endangered collection.

01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:02.390
I have 50 terabytes

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:07.880
of recordings dating
back, for me, to 2011.

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.210
I've actually got recordings
that were made by other people

01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:13.880
that date back all
the way to 1986.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.760
In fact, one of the clips I
showed yesterday in the forum,

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:23.200
back in 1986, a radio enthusiast
in Providence, Rhode Island --

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:27.910
in fact, that's the recording
right there, he's bringing up --

01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:30.820
that is an SDR application.

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:33.960
And this is, you
know, how it works.

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.620
It doesn't look like a
radio it looks like peace

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.950
of test equipment, but all
of those little peaks you see

01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:41.360
on the line and the
waterfall display above,

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.940
that's what you call that;
those are all radio stations.

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.120
And it was recorded
on a VCR, a Hi-Fi VCR.

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.960
Someone tapped into the
intermediate frequency

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.560
on the receiver and
recorded it to the VCR

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.610
and then they actually
played back the VCR tape

01:49:57.610 --> 01:49:58.910
through the radio.

01:49:58.910 --> 01:50:01.060
Well, later, just a
couple of years ago,

01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:03.690
he actually digitized this
so that we could play it

01:50:03.690 --> 01:50:05.930
through an SDR application.

01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:09.250
This is what it looks like,
I guess, if it can roll --

01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:11.150
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: And can
you find something specific

01:50:11.150 --> 01:50:12.450
on this if you were looking?

01:50:12.450 --> 01:50:14.760
&gt;&gt; Recording: -- there is no
way of knowing just how bad

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.440
that Chernobyl nuclear
plant disaster really is.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.950
In the talk of the western world
there are still vast portions

01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:26.050
of the Soviet Union that have
no idea that anything is wrong.

01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:28.660
[Inaudible] with Stanford
University says the only people

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:31.970
in the Soviet Union
who were told

01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:33.270
about Chernobyl are
in Moscow and Kiev.

01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:38.630
We've been monitoring these
broadcasts since Tuesday,

01:50:38.630 --> 01:50:42.830
there's been absolutely no
mention of anything connected

01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:44.130
to a nuclear accident.

01:50:44.130 --> 01:50:45.430
The Siberian people --

01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:46.730
&gt;&gt; They actually narrate
in this just a little bit,

01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:49.990
if you listen just
a little bit longer.

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:52.030
This is a recording that
you can tune through as

01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:53.330
if it were live radio.

01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:57.860
This is what the AM band
sounded like in Providence,

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.060
Rhode Island, on May 1, 1986.

01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.710
I'll tune to another
frequency here.

01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:05.700
&gt;&gt; Recording: -- in Europe
speaks told us all the European

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:09.830
leaders are still expected
to come to the summit

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:11.130
in Tokyo this weekend.

01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:12.790
Vic Ratner, ABC News with
the president in Bali.

01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:16.080
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: Vic
Ratner's as old as the radio.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.380
&gt;&gt; Recording: -- live from
the Kennedy Space Center

01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.680
this evening.

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.980
It's the first launch there

01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:21.390
since the Challenger
Space Shuttle explosion.

01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:23.610
One Challenger investigator
says examination

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.420
of wreckage proves a
rocket joint failed.

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.290
Again pointing to a problem --

01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:28.590
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger:
That's interesting.

01:51:28.590 --> 01:51:30.630
The problem, though,
would be, I mean,

01:51:30.630 --> 01:51:32.980
other than for scholarly
purposes, we couldn't use

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:34.930
that audio because
it's too terrible.

01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:37.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:40.690
It's mainly, you know, for me
I would kind of classify myself

01:51:40.690 --> 01:51:41.990
as a radio anthropologist.

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:45.610
So for me, this is very
context rich stuff.

01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:49.300
You know. And right now we're
making the recordings because,

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.100
you know, a lot of us
believe that, you know,

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:54.220
through recording the AM
broadcast band's actually a

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.520
pretty diverse place.

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:59.620
Yeah, there's some big companies
in there that have a lot

01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:01.640
of stations, but you
have community stations,

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:07.250
you have a lot of diversity and
you can, you know, later on, 20,

01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:10.250
30 years from now,
scholars may want to go back

01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:13.110
and see what it was like during
a period when people were trying

01:52:13.110 --> 01:52:16.470
to discern between fake
and real news, for example.

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:18.350
But yeah, I just thought
I'd bring that up --

01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:19.970
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger: I didn't
even know that existed.

01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:21.580
&gt;&gt; Shawn VanCour: If you're
sending it to us for broadcast,

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.920
too, isn't that atmospherics
part

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.810
of the broadcasting
experience, right?

01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:27.110
&gt;&gt; Sam Litzinger:
You get forgiven

01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:30.730
if it's 1942 as opposed to 2017.

01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:32.680
&gt;&gt; And that's actually --
we're actually out of time.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.520
That's actually a
great place to end

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.570
because we spent all this
time on these missing archives

01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:38.870
and the problem with CBS --

01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:41.360
&gt;&gt; You know what nobody
mentioned in here?

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.100
Nobody mentioned ABC.

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.220
Nobody ever mentions ABC.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.090
No, but there's the
Roone Arledge book --

01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:50.930
there's something going on
there that's totally separate,

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:55.620
but we end it with somebody
who's rescuing commercial radio.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:57.800
Which, I'm very glad
you volunteered

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.630
that because here we
have all the problems

01:53:01.630 --> 01:53:03.830
with the monetization,
the profit, this and that.

01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:07.370
And we have people who are
actively engaged and energized

01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:10.430
to save something that the
companies themselves don't seem

01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:12.360
to even recognize in that way.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:13.660
So that's a very
positive, Shawn,

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.960
you were looking for positive.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.230
What a positive way
to end the panel.

01:53:17.230 --> 01:53:19.030
Alright, thank you very much.

01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:21.510
And thank our participants,
and this is terrific.

01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:26.680
[ Applause ]

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:30.330
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
