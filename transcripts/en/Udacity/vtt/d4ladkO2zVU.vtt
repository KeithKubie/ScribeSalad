00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.890
In your opinion, what can be roadblocks

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.760
to the Active Network's Vision? And I'm going to

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.520
give you multiple choices. And you can pick more than one choice if you think it

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.800
fits the answer to this question. The

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.710
first choice is that the active network's vision

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.630
needs buy-in from the router vendors. Router vendors

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.300
are vendors like Cisco. Who make the routing

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.030
fabric and the first choice is saying it

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.836
need, you, you need buy in from the router

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:33.650
vendors, the second choice is saying that because

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.640
the routing was active network is happening in software,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.320
the software routing speed cannot match the throughput

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.910
needed in the internet core. That's the second choice,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.880
the third choice says that. It makes the internet

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.350
more vulnerable, and the fourth choice says that it

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.420
makes the router more susceptible to code spoofing.
