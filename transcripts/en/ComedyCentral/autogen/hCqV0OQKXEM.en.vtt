(static)

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.169
- You know I probably
shouldn't use alcohol

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.874
to drown the pain but
Homegirl loved Century Club.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.909
Hundred shots 100 minutes.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.412
I'm in, let's do this.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.279
Let's do this.
(clearing throat)

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.514
It's an American thing.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:15.782
- Umm, if I could
have your attention,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.917
I just wanted to let
you know Blake and I

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:22.822
have channeled our sadness
regarding Homegirl's passing

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.859
into a charity in
Homegirl's name.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.229
- Homegirl's Home for
Girls Without Homes.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.932
- Well, I've also
made an organization

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.869
that's gonna raise money
to cure brain tumorism.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.937
It's called Rollerblading
Across the Americas.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.406
- Oh yeah, north and south?

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.875
- And east and west if
it'll find a goddamned cure.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.877
- Okay, well, all the
money in the world

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.713
isn't gonna do anything
to bring Homegirl back.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.948
The only way to
keep Homegirl alive

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.652
is to name stuff after
her like charities

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.387
or skateboard tricks.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.722
Blake?

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.825
- Uh.
- Show 'em the Homegirl.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.761
(cluncking)

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.130
(footsteps)

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.964
(claps)

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:05.865
- Homegirl.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.200
(claps)
- Woah.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.435
- You didn't show
her much respect

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.136
by not using her real name.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.038
- Yeah, well, obviously
it's that then.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:12.972
- It's what then?

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.140
- It's her name if that works.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.942
- And what's her name Ders?

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.144
She had a name dude.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:21.047
And her name

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.016
was Roberta Paulson.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:27.153
Her name was Roberta Paulson.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.290
- [Group] Her name
was Roberta Paulson.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.524
- Guys.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.060
- [Group] Her name
is Roberta Paulson.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.129
- How do you say
seance in Swedish?

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.363
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.065
- Then let us have a

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.934
(mumbling)

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.635
- Alice, you gotta
shut it down now.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.870
- What?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.605
- Homegirl's wake, shut
it down now, please.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.240
- Nobody's butthurt,
not anymore.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.842
We're all, we're all butthealed.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.877
- Yeah, our butts are the
picture of perfect health.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.145
- Praise the butt god.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.713
- The wake has to keep going.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.049
Her kids are on their way over
with some kind of video will.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.584
- Woah, whose video will is it?

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.619
Like a cool little droid dude?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.489
- No, it's like a video
with last words or wishes.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.723
- Wait, no, but
Adam's up there going

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:05.225
out of control on
the mic device.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.626
He was singing a song, and
like, I don't know what he's

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.827
gonna do next.
- Ders.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.030
No, video will,
that's a great idea.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.633
I don't know, it would've
been cool if it was a robot.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.869
Video will, video
will, what's up.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.571
- Mr. Nate Dogg, are you there?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.609
I just have but one question
for you Mr. Nate Dogg.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.077
How do I make it into heaven?

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.880
(loudly groaning)

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.783

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.986 line:0%
Ay-yay.
