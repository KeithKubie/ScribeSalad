00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.550
Sixty years later, the audacity of a painting
like this,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.639
by Jackson Pollock, still has the power,

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.680
I think, to astound us.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.220
You have this sense of an artist breaking
out

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.080
into territory that had not been tried before.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.980
What Pollock was doing was so extreme,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.250
in terms of the painting tradition, that I
think

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.340
even he himself felt somewhat bewildered by
it.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.000
And one of my favorite Pollock stories is
this:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.730
When he was at his studio in the Springs in
Long Island,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.530
and asked his wife, Lee Krasner, to come look
at

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.469
what he had done, he asked her, "Is this a
painting?"

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.199
Not, "Is this a good painting?"

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.219
Or, "Is this a great painting?"

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.440
He wasn't even sure that what he had made,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.460
whatever it was, was a painting.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.450
The feeling of being at a dawn of a new age,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.660
the dawn of an age that followed one in which,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.390
basically, civilization had almost destroyed
itself,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.860
was uppermost -- either consciously or unconsciously
--

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.390
for all of these artists.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.930
The boldness of what these artists were trying
to do,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.400
by transplanting the center of the Avant Garde

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.170
from Paris to New York, needed to be evident

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.320
in how they made their paintings.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.780
Each of them invented, essentially,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.710
a new tactic for how to make a painting.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980
And nobody more so than Jackson Pollock,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
who departed from the idea of using a brush
a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.350
nd making brush strokes to paint a scene --

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.530
and instead, with the wooden tip of the brush,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.390
either fling or drip or spread or ooze the
painting

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.150
across the canvas in these ecstatic,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.420
dramatic, slow, fast, wavy straight --

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.250
(There's no end of the adjectives you could
use.)

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.660
-- lines that fill it from corner to corner,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.840
from top to bottom, left to right.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.690
Another famous anecdote about Jackson Pollock

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.159
concerns the time that the artist Hans Hoffman

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.980
asked him if he liked to paint nature.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.430
And, supposedly, Pollack's reply to him was,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090
"I am nature."

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.099
And whereas that story may or may not be true,

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.459
and certainly plays on Pollock's reputation

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.840
as having been very gruff,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.129
and not a man of many words at all,

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.159
it does convey something essentially true

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.840
about Abstract Expressionism.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.010
That the topic that most interested these
artists

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.459
was themselves, and in more general terms,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.299
the human being.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.650
So the interest was the energy of a person,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.599
the psyche of a person,

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.209
the values or the principles of a person,

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.159
the physical presence of a person.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.109
When you look at a painting by Jackson Pollock,

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.650
there's no way that you can think of it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.959
just being made by fingers and hands.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.310
Indeed, it's hard for you not to imagine

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.139
your own body moving, leaping, dancing, straddling,

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.290
juggling around the canvas on the floor.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.950
This energy is what sets Pollack apart

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.920
from almost any other artist.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.461
It's almost hard to believe that the painting

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.939
is not moving while you're looking at it.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.999
And, of course, the reason is that it's your
eye --

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.760
your eye is moving --

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.080
and maybe your body is even moving too,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.989
as you go from side to side of the room

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.200
to take in the full expanse of the picture.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.250
And as you try to dig in to the picture,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.780
and figure out where one line starts and stops,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.349
or which layer is on top of another,

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.209
or where the blurry areas of paint get interrupted,

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.650
or interrupt the lines, you also realize

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.730
that there are all sorts of different kinds
of paint --

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.639
some shiny, some matte, some even metallic.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.400
And in a painting such as Full Fathom Five,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.420
you realize it's not just paint,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.829
but it's things that are embedded in it,

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.940
whether it's keys or coins or bits of trash.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.280
This is the world he's brought into

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.340
the swirl of that surface.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.300
And the paint has the power to engulf

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.810
the other materials in the atmosphere that
it's creating.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.340
For all of these works,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.310
Pollack did not start out with a sketch.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.990
He did not start out with some kind of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.190
precalculated plan of where the painting would
go.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.790
And in that way, we think about Pollock paintings

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.560
very much as precedents to a lot of art

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.030
which has since then been called 'performance
art' --

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.470
because as he was making a painting,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.140
the artist was, in a sense, a performer.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.300
He was not somebody fulfilling a preconceived
plan.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.000
He was somebody engaged in a spontaneous

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.470
set of actions whose results would be

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.410
as much a surprise to him as to anybody else.
