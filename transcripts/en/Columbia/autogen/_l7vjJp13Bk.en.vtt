the anatomy of the brain he knew that

the anatomy of the brain he knew that
 

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.990
the anatomy of the brain he knew that
there were four lobes frontal temporal

there were four lobes frontal temporal
 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.830
there were four lobes frontal temporal
parietal and occipital but he also knew

mental functions each lobe must contain
a number of different functions so he

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:37.660
a number of different functions so he

a number of different functions so he

began to assign functions to different
 

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.480
began to assign functions to different

with it so I see this as a parallel

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:11.310
with it so I see this as a parallel
 

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:15.950

we're going to begin to have some really
 

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.840
we're going to begin to have some really
useful treatments for that there are so

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:50.850
useful treatments for that there are so
 

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:52.640
useful treatments for that there are so
many promising avenues despite the
