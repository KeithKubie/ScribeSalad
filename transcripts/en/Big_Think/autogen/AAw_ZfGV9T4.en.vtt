religious and social values we tend to
be drawn to somebody who can give us the

childhood certainly plays a role and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860
childhood certainly plays a role and
 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.990
childhood certainly plays a role and
we're now beginning to find some

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000
we're now beginning to find some
 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.450
we're now beginning to find some
biological things that draw you to some

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460
biological things that draw you to some
 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.160
biological things that draw you to some
people rather than another new data

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170
people rather than another new data
 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.319
people rather than another new data
shows that women with a particular

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329
shows that women with a particular
 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.330
shows that women with a particular
immune system are drawn to men who have

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340
immune system are drawn to men who have
 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.710
immune system are drawn to men who have
an opposite immune system so there's a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720
an opposite immune system so there's a
 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.960
an opposite immune system so there's a
lot of factors priming plays a role

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970
lot of factors priming plays a role
 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.150
lot of factors priming plays a role
proximity plays a role there's many

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160
proximity plays a role there's many
 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.180
proximity plays a role there's many
factors in who you love who you choose

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
factors in who you love who you choose
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.970
factors in who you love who you choose
but I began to even you can walk into a

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980
but I began to even you can walk into a
 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.530
but I began to even you can walk into a
room and everybody is from your

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540
room and everybody is from your
 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.000
room and everybody is from your
background same general level of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010
background same general level of
 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.350
background same general level of
intelligence same general level of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360
intelligence same general level of
 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.090
intelligence same general level of
clothes and you don't fall in love with

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
clothes and you don't fall in love with
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.490
clothes and you don't fall in love with
all of them so why is it that we're

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500
all of them so why is it that we're
 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.920
all of them so why is it that we're
almost chemically pulled to one person

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930
almost chemically pulled to one person
 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.069
almost chemically pulled to one person
rather than another so I wanted to see

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079
rather than another so I wanted to see
 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.410
rather than another so I wanted to see
if I could figure out the role of basic

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
if I could figure out the role of basic
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.080
if I could figure out the role of basic
body chemistry and so I looked through a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090
body chemistry and so I looked through a
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.379
body chemistry and so I looked through a
whole lot of biological data and there's

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:16.389
whole lot of biological data and there's
 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.419
whole lot of biological data and there's
a lot of chemicals in the brain but most

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429
a lot of chemicals in the brain but most
 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.059
a lot of chemicals in the brain but most
of them keep the eyes blinking or help

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069
of them keep the eyes blinking or help
 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.289
of them keep the eyes blinking or help
with swallowing in order to keep the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299
with swallowing in order to keep the
 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.749
with swallowing in order to keep the
heart beating etc not many of them are

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759
heart beating etc not many of them are
 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.289
heart beating etc not many of them are
linked with with personality traits for

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299
linked with with personality traits for
 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.389
linked with with personality traits for
chemicals actually six chemicals are

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399
chemicals actually six chemicals are
 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.300
chemicals actually six chemicals are
related to personality traits so I wrote

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
related to personality traits so I wrote
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.010
related to personality traits so I wrote
down on separate sheets of paper all

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020
down on separate sheets of paper all
 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.539
down on separate sheets of paper all
those traits associated with the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549
those traits associated with the
 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.029
those traits associated with the
dopamine system the serotonin system the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039
dopamine system the serotonin system the
 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.069
dopamine system the serotonin system the
testosterone system and the last being

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079
testosterone system and the last being
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.260
testosterone system and the last being
the estrogen and the oxytocin system and

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270
the estrogen and the oxytocin system and
 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.469
the estrogen and the oxytocin system and
then I decided I would create a

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479
then I decided I would create a
 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.620
then I decided I would create a
questionnaire to see to what degree you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
questionnaire to see to what degree you
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.379
questionnaire to see to what degree you
express these four basic biological

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:52.389
express these four basic biological
 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.269
express these four basic biological
systems we all express all of them but

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279
systems we all express all of them but
 

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.679
systems we all express all of them but
we express some more than others and

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689
we express some more than others and
 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.379
we express some more than others and
then I would watch on this dating site

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389
then I would watch on this dating site
 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.529
then I would watch on this dating site
chemistry dot-com and see not only what

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539
chemistry dot-com and see not only what
 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.050
chemistry dot-com and see not only what
your chemistry was but who you were

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060
your chemistry was but who you were
 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.779
your chemistry was but who you were
naturally drawn to and as it turns out

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789
naturally drawn to and as it turns out
 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.760
