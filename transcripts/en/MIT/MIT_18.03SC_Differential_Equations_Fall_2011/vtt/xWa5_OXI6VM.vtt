00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.636
Okay, that's,
so to speak,

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:09.642
the text for today.
The Fourier series,

00:01:09.642 --> 00:01:14.387
and the Fourier expansion for f
of t,

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:19.765
so f of t, if it looks like
this should be periodic,

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:25.353
and two pi should be a period.
Sometimes people rather

00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:29.571
sloppily say periodic with
period two pi,

00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:37.098
but that's a little ambiguous.
So, this period could also be

00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:42.013
pi or a half pi or something
like that as well.

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:47.356
The an's and bn's are
calculated according to these

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:51.202
formulas.
Now, we're going to need in

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:56.010
just a minute a consequence of
those formulas,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.673
which, it's not subtle,
but because there are formulas

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:06.482
for an and bn,
it follows that once you know f

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:10.221
of t,
the an's and bn's are

00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:15.454
determined.
Or, to put it another way,

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:20.269
a function cannot have two
different Fourier series.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.895
Or, to put it yet another way,
if f of t,

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:30.087
if two functions are equal,
you'll see why I write it in

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:35.374
this rather peculiar form.
Then, the Fourier series for f

00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:40.000
is the same as the Fourier
series for g.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.699
And, the reason is because if f
is equal to g,

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:49.143
then this integral with an f
there is the same as the

00:02:49.143 --> 00:02:52.390
integral with a g there.
And therefore,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.124
the an's come out to be the
same.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.799
In the same way,
the bn's come out to be the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.789
same.
So, the Fourier series are the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.635
same, coefficient by
coefficient, for f and g.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:10.762
Now, my ultimate goal-- let's
all put down the argument since

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:14.863
there are formulas,
since we have formulas for an

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:19.482
and bn.
Now, a consequence of that is,

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:23.868
well, let me first say,
what I'm aiming at is you will

00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:29.000
be amazed at how long it's going
to take me to get to this.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.780
I just want to calculate the
Fourier series for some rather

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.230
simple periodic function.
It's going to look like this.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.280
So, here's pi,
and here's negative pi.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.895
So, the function which just
looks like t in between those

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:49.109
two, so, it goes up to,
it's a function,

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.994
t, more or less,
goes up to pi here,

00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:54.467
minus pi there.
But, of course,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:59.000
it's got to be periodic of
period two pi.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.160
Well, then, it just repeats
itself after that.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.969
After this, it just does that,
and so on.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.832
It's a little ambiguous what
happens at these endpoints.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:12.132
Well, let's not worry about
that for the moment,

00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:15.082
and frankly,
it won't really matter because

00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:19.015
the integrals don't care about
what happens in individual

00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:21.683
points.
So, there's my f of t.

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:24.774
Now, I, of course,
could start doing it right

00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:27.021
away.
But, you will quickly find,

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.954
if you start doing these
problems and hacking around with

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:34.465
them, that the calculations seem
really quite long.

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:37.134
And therefore,
in the first half of the

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:41.418
period, the first half of the
period I want to show you how to

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:47.071
shorten the calculations.
And in the second half of the

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:50.928
period, after we've done that
and calculated this thing

00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:54.000
successfully,
I hope, I want to show you how

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.500
to remove various restrictions
on these functions,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.000
how to extend the range of
Fourier series.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.270
Well, one obvious thing,
for example,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.738
is suppose the function isn't
periodic of period two pi.

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.756
Suppose it has some other
period.

00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:10.837
Does that mean there's no
formula?

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:13.234
Well, of course not.
There's a formula.

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:16.450
But, we need to know what it
is, particularly in the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.036
applications,
the period is rarely two pi.

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:21.621
It's normally one,
or something like that.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.522
But, let's first of all,
I'm sure what you will

00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:29.000
appreciate is how the
calculations can get shortened.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.962
Now, the main way of shortening
them is by using evenness and

00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:39.908
oddness.
And, what I claim is this,

00:05:39.908 --> 00:05:44.898
that if f of t is an
even function,

00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:51.165
remember what that means,
that f of negative t is equal

00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:57.199
to f of t.
Cosine is a good example,

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.538
of course, cosine nt;
are all these

00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:07.992
functions are even functions.
If f of t is even,

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:16.000
then its Fourier series
contains only the cosine terms.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.424
In other words,
half the calculations you don't

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:26.731
have to do if you start with an
even function.

00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:31.566
That's what I mean by
shortening the work.

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:37.462
There are no odd terms,
or let's put it positively.

00:06:37.462 --> 00:06:42.510
All the bn's are zero.
Now, one way of doing this

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.776
would be to say,
well, y to the bn zero,

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:47.623
well, we've got formulas,
and fool around with the

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:50.412
formula for the bn,
and think about a little bit,

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:53.608
and finally decide that that
has to come out to be zero.

00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:56.629
That's not a bad way,
and it would remind you of some

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.000
basic facts about integration,
about integrals.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.477
Instead of doing that,
I'm going to apply my little

00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:08.417
principle that if two functions
are the same,

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:12.447
then their Fourier series have
to be the same.

00:07:12.447 --> 00:07:16.208
So, the argument I'm going to
give is this,

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:20.507
so, I'm going to try to prove
this statement now.

00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:25.791
And, I'm going to use the facts
on the first board to do it.

00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:30.000
So, what is f of minus t?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.213
Well, if that's equal to f of
t, then in terms of the

00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:39.145
Fourier series,
how do I get the Fourier series

00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:44.102
for f of minus t?
Well, I take the Fourier series

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:48.717
for f of t, and substitute t
equals minus t.

00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:51.452
Now, what happens when I do
that?

00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:56.752
So, the Fourier series for this
looks like a zero over two

00:07:56.752 --> 00:08:02.201
plus summation what?
Well, the an cosine nt,

00:08:02.201 --> 00:08:06.847
that does not change
because when I change t to

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:11.250
negative t,
the cosine nt does

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.815
not change, stays the same
because it's an even function.

00:08:15.815 --> 00:08:20.625
What happens to the sine term?
Well, the sine of negative nt

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:25.190
is equal to minus the
sine of nt.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.000
So, the other terms,
the sine terms change sign.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.278
So, all that's the result of
substituting t for negative t

00:08:34.278 --> 00:08:36.680
and f of t.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.283
On the other hand,
what's f of t itself?

00:08:40.283 --> 00:08:43.886
Well, f of t itself is what
happened before that.

00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:48.014
Now it's got a plus sign
because nothing was done to the

00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:50.791
series.
Well, if the function is even,

00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:54.769
then those two right hand sides
are the same function.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.222
In other words,
they're like my f of t equals g

00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:02.276
of t. And therefore,

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:06.561
the Fourier series on the left
must be the same.

00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.661
In other words,
if these are equal,

00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.126
therefore, these have to be
equal, too.

00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:17.229
Now, there's no problem with
the cosine terms.

00:09:17.229 --> 00:09:20.602
They look the same.
On the other hand,

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:23.520
the sine terms have changed
sign.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.626
Therefore, it must be the case
that bn is always equal to

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:34.636
negative bn for all n.
That's the only way this series

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:39.654
can be the same as that one.
Now, if bn is equal to negative

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:43.396
bn,
that implies that bn is zero.

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:46.798
Zero is the only number which

00:09:46.798 --> 00:09:51.051
is equal to its negative.
And so, by this argument,

00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:54.963
in other words,
using the uniqueness of Fourier

00:09:54.963 --> 00:09:59.046
series, we conclude that if the
function is even,

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:05.000
then its Fourier series can
only have cosine terms in it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.189
Now, you say,
hey, that's obvious.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.842
The cosine, that's just a point
of logic.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.761
But, this is a mathematics
course, after all.

00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:14.818
It's not just about
calculation.

00:10:14.818 --> 00:10:18.267
Many of you would say,
yeah, of course that's obvious

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:21.385
because cosines are even,
and the sines are odd.

00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:24.039
I say, yeah,
and so why does that make it

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.963
true?
Well, the cosine's even.

00:10:25.963 --> 00:10:29.744
Plus t into minus t,
and what you are proving

00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:33.784
is the converse.
The converse is obvious.

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.791
Yeah, obvious,
I don't care.

00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.507
If the right-hand side is the
sum of the functions,

00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:43.373
well, so is the left.
But I'm saying it the other way

00:10:43.373 --> 00:10:45.529
around.
If the left is an even

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:49.246
function, why does the
right-hand side have to have

00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:53.185
only even terms in it?
And, this is the argument which

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:56.084
makes that true.
Now, there is a further

00:10:56.084 --> 00:11:00.024
simplification because if you've
got an even function,

00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:03.146
oh, by the way,
of course the same thing is

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:06.269
true for the odd,
I ought to put that down,

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:09.093
and so also,
if f of t is odd,

00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:14.000
then I think one of these
proofs is enough.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.059
The other you can supply
yourself.

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:20.953
That will imply that all the
an's are zero,

00:11:20.953 --> 00:11:25.033
even including this first one,
a zero,

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:28.000
and by the same reasoning.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.791
So, an even function uses only
cosines for its Fourier

00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:44.956
expansion.
An odd function uses only

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:45.950
sines.
Good.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.928
But, we still have to,
suppose we got an even

00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:53.273
function.
We've still got to calculate

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:56.528
this integral.
Well, even that can be

00:11:56.528 --> 00:11:59.964
simplified.
So, the second stage of the

00:11:59.964 --> 00:12:04.123
simplification,
again, assuming that we have an

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:07.378
even or odd function,
and by the way,

00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:11.000
[LAUGHTER].
Totally unauthorized.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.638
So, if f of t is even,
what we'd like to do now is

00:12:34.638 --> 00:12:43.872
simplify the integral a little.
And, there is an easy way to do

00:12:43.872 --> 00:12:49.829
that, because,
look, if f of t is an even

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:57.872
function, then so is f of t
cosine nt,

00:12:57.872 --> 00:13:02.900
is also even.
Imagine, we could make little

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.571
rules about an even function
times an even function is an

00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.520
even function.
There are general rules of that

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.256
type, and some of you know them,
and they are very useful.

00:13:13.256 --> 00:13:15.419
But, let's just do it ad hoc
here.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.368
If I change t to negative
t here,

00:13:18.368 --> 00:13:21.318
I don't change the function
because it's even.

00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:24.595
And, I don't change the cosine
because that's even.

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:28.528
So, if I change t to negative
t, I don't change the function.

00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:32.198
Either factor that function,
and therefore I don't change

00:13:32.198 --> 00:13:36.000
the product of those two things
either.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.195
So, it's also even.
Now, what about an even

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:48.618
function when you integrate it?
Here's a typical looking even

00:13:48.618 --> 00:13:52.948
function, let's say,
something like,

00:13:52.948 --> 00:13:56.412
I don't know,
wiggle, wiggle,

00:13:56.412 --> 00:13:59.876
again.
Here's our better even

00:13:59.876 --> 00:14:02.721
function.
All right, so,

00:14:02.721 --> 00:14:08.412
minus pi to pi,
even, even though the t-axis is

00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:14.053
somewhat curvy.
So, there is an even function.

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:17.817
The point is that if you
integrate an even function from

00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:21.102
negative pi to pi,
I think you all know even from

00:14:21.102 --> 00:14:24.524
calculus you were taught to do
this simplification.

00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:27.604
Don't do that.
Instead, integrate from zero to

00:14:27.604 --> 00:14:31.662
pi, and double the answer.
Why should you do that?

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:35.780
The answer is because it's
always nice to have zero as one

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.827
of the limits of integration.
I trust to your experience,

00:14:39.827 --> 00:14:43.585
I don't have to sell that.
Minus pi is a particularly

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:47.703
unpleasant lower limit of
integration because you are sure

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:50.377
to get in trouble with negative
signs.

00:14:50.377 --> 00:14:54.641
There are bound to be at least
three negative signs floating

00:14:54.641 --> 00:14:57.242
around.
And, if you miss one of them,

00:14:57.242 --> 00:15:01.000
you'll get the wrong signs of
answer.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.994
The answer will have the wrong
sign.

00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:08.700
So, the way the formula from
this simplifies is that an,

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.550
instead of integrating from
negative pi to pi,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.598
I can integrate only from zero
to pi, and double the answer.

00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:22.304
So, our better formula is this.
If the function is even,

00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:26.240
this is the formula you should
use: zero to pi,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.288
f of t cosine nt dt.

00:15:31.288 --> 00:15:35.590
Of course, I don't have to tell

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.351
you what bn should be because bn
will be zero.

00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:42.109
And, in the same way,
if f is odd,

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:45.786
the same reasoning shows that
bn-- of course,

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:50.466
an will be zero this time.
But it will be bn that will be

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:55.481
two over pi times the integral
from zero to pi of f of t sine

00:15:55.481 --> 00:16:00.412
nt dt.

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:03.947
Maybe we'd better just a word

00:16:03.947 --> 00:16:06.097
about that since,
why is that so?

00:16:06.097 --> 00:16:08.985
If it's odd,
doesn't that mean things become

00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:10.865
zero?
If you integrate an odd

00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:14.089
function like that,
the integral over minus pi to

00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:17.111
pi, you get zero.
Well, but this is not an odd

00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:19.328
function.
This is an odd function,

00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:22.955
and this is an odd function.
But the product of two odd

00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:26.447
functions is an even function.
Odd times odd is even.

00:16:26.447 --> 00:16:29.470
I said I wasn't going to give
you those rules,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.828
but since this is the one which
trips everybody up,

00:16:32.828 --> 00:16:38.000
maybe I'd better say it just
justbecause it looks wrong.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.218
Right, this is odd.
That's odd.

00:16:40.218 --> 00:16:43.620
Think about it.
If I change t to negative t,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.430
this multiplies by
minus one.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.610
This multiplies by minus one.
And therefore,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.270
the product multiplies by minus
one times minus one.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.302
In other words,
it multiplies by plus one.

00:16:57.302 --> 00:17:01.000
Nothing happens,
so it stays the same.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.815
Why does nobody believe this,
even though it's true?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:08.107
It's because they are thinking
about numbers.

00:17:08.107 --> 00:17:12.521
Everybody knows that an odd
number times an odd number is an

00:17:12.521 --> 00:17:15.663
odd number.
So, I'm not multiplying numbers

00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:20.152
here, which also I'll put them
in boxes to indicate that they

00:17:20.152 --> 00:17:22.172
are not numbers.
How's that?

00:17:22.172 --> 00:17:25.912
Brand-new invented notation.
The box means caution.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:31.000
The inside is not a number,
it's the word odd or even.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.489
It's just a symbolic statement
that the product of an odd

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:39.338
function and an odd function is
an even function.

00:17:39.338 --> 00:17:43.026
Even times even is even.
What's odd times even?

00:17:43.026 --> 00:17:47.837
Yes, it has to get equal time.
Obviously, something must come

00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:49.440
out to be odd,
right.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.610
Okay, so, now that we've got
our two simplifications,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.095
we are ready to do this
problem.

00:17:56.095 --> 00:18:00.104
Instead of attacking it with
the original formulas,

00:18:00.104 --> 00:18:04.835
we are going to think about it
and attack it with our better

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:11.181
formulas.
So, now we are going to

00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:19.909
calculate the Fourier series for
f of t.

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:29.181
The first thing I see,
so f of t is our little thing

00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:32.272
here.
Well, first of all,

00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:35.621
what kind of function is it:
odd, even, or neither?

00:18:35.621 --> 00:18:38.099
Most functions are neither,
of course.

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:40.510
But, fortunately in the
applications,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.988
functions tend to be one or the
other.

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:46.136
Or, they can be converted into
one to the other.

00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:49.551
Maybe if I get a chance,
I'll show you a little how,

00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:52.833
or the recitations will.
So, this function is odd.

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:55.244
Okay, half the work just
disappeared.

00:18:55.244 --> 00:18:57.521
I don't have to calculate any
an's.

00:18:57.521 --> 00:19:01.772
They will be zero.
So, I only have to calculate

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:04.810
bn, and I'll calculate them by
my better formula.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.291
So, it's two over pi times the
integral from zero to pi,

00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:11.962
and what I have to integrate,
well, now, finally you've got

00:19:11.962 --> 00:19:14.430
to integrate something.
From zero to pi,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.886
this is the function,
t.

00:19:15.886 --> 00:19:18.734
So, I have to integrate t times
sine of nt dt.

00:19:18.734 --> 00:19:22.658
Okay,

00:19:22.658 --> 00:19:25.632
so this is why you learned
integration by parts,

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:29.177
one of many reasons why you
learned integration by parts,

00:19:29.177 --> 00:19:32.974
so that you wouldn't have to
pull out your little calculators

00:19:32.974 --> 00:19:36.731
to do this.
Okay, now, let's do it.

00:19:36.731 --> 00:19:39.066
So, it's two over pi.

00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:42.605
Let's solve that away so we can
forget about it.

00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:47.048
And, what's then left is just
the evaluation of the integral

00:19:47.048 --> 00:19:50.286
between limits.
So, if I integrate by parts,

00:19:50.286 --> 00:19:54.503
I'll want to differentiate the
t, and integrate the sign,

00:19:54.503 --> 00:19:57.289
right?
So, the first step is you don't

00:19:57.289 --> 00:20:02.039
do the differentiation.
You only do the integration.

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:05.900
So, that integrates to be
cosine nt over n,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.523
more or less.
The only thing is,

00:20:08.523 --> 00:20:11.874
if I differentiate this,
I get negative sine nt

00:20:11.874 --> 00:20:15.662
instead of,
so, I want to put a negative

00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:19.377
sign in front of all this.
And, I will evaluate that

00:20:19.377 --> 00:20:21.635
between the limits,
zero and pi,

00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:25.350
and then subtract what you get
by doing both things,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.556
both the differentiation and
the integration.

00:20:28.556 --> 00:20:33.000
So, I subtract the integral
from zero to pi.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.522
I now differentiate the t,
and integrate.

00:20:35.522 --> 00:20:37.540
Well, I just did the
integration.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.630
That's negative cosine nt over
n.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.027
You see how the negative signs
pile up?

00:20:43.027 --> 00:20:45.738
And, if this is negative pi
instead of zero,

00:20:45.738 --> 00:20:48.702
it's at that point when it
starts to lose heart.

00:20:48.702 --> 00:20:52.360
You see three negative signs,
and then when you substitute,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.144
you're going to have to put in
still something else negative,

00:20:56.144 --> 00:21:01.000
and you just have the feeling
you're going to make a mistake.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.156
And, you will.
Okay, now all we have to do is

00:21:05.156 --> 00:21:09.974
a little evaluation.
Let's see, at the lower limit I

00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:12.997
get zero, here.
Let's right away,

00:21:12.997 --> 00:21:16.209
as two over pi.
At the lower limit,

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:18.382
I get zero.
That's nice.

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:23.105
At the upper limit,
I get minus pi over n times the

00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:26.506
cosine of n pi.

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:31.041
Now, once and for all,
the cosine of n pi--

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:35.576
If you like to make
separate steps out of

00:21:35.576 --> 00:21:39.921
everything, okay,
I'll let you do it this time,

00:21:39.921 --> 00:21:43.754
--
-- but in the long run,

00:21:43.754 --> 00:21:48.101
it's good to remember that
that's negative one to the n'th

00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.762
power
The cosine of pi is minus one .

00:21:51.762 --> 00:21:55.652
The cosine of two pi is plus
one,

00:21:55.652 --> 00:22:00.000
three pi, minus one,
and so on.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.210
So, at the upper limit,
we get minus pi over n,

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:11.440
oh, I didn't finish the
calculation, times the cosine of

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.896
n pi,
which is minus one to the n'th

00:22:17.896 --> 00:22:22.993
power.
And now, how about the other

00:22:22.993 --> 00:22:26.278
guy?
Shall we do in our heads?

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:32.961
Well, I can do it in my head,
but I'm not so sure about your

00:22:32.961 --> 00:22:37.669
heads.
Maybe just this once we won't.

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:41.405
What is it?
It's plus sine nt,

00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:44.697
right?
So, I combined the two negative

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:50.124
signs to a plus sign by putting
one this way and the other one

00:22:50.124 --> 00:22:53.505
that way.
And then, if I integrate that

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:58.487
now, it's sine nt divided by n
squared,

00:22:58.487 --> 00:23:02.792
right?
And that's evaluated between

00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:05.384
zero and pi.
And of course,

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:09.273
the sign function vanishes at
both ends.

00:23:09.273 --> 00:23:14.857
So, that part is simply zero.
And so, the final answer is

00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:19.045
that bn is equal to,
well, the pi's cancel.

00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:23.931
This minus combines with those
n to make one more.

00:23:23.931 --> 00:23:30.014
And so, the answer is two over
n times minus one to the n plus

00:23:30.014 --> 00:23:35.000
first power.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.461
And therefore,
the final result is that our

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:46.183
Fourier series,
the Fourier series for f of t,

00:23:46.183 --> 00:23:53.206
that funny function
is, the Fourier series is

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:56.587
summation bn,
which is two,

00:23:56.587 --> 00:24:04.000
put the two out front because
it's in every term.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.436
There's no reason to repeat it,
minus one to the n plus first

00:24:10.436 --> 00:24:16.122
power over n times the sign of
nt.

00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:19.877
That's summed from one to

00:24:19.877 --> 00:24:23.954
infinity.
Let's stop and take a look at

00:24:23.954 --> 00:24:28.137
that for a second.
Does that look right?

00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:32.000
Okay, here's our function.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.324
Here's our function.
What's the first term of this?

00:24:48.324 --> 00:24:54.331
When n is one,
this is plus one.

00:24:54.331 --> 00:25:00.044
So, the first term is sine t.

00:25:00.044 --> 00:25:04.924
What's the next term?
When n is two,

00:25:04.924 --> 00:25:08.096
this is negative.
So, it's minus one to the third

00:25:08.096 --> 00:25:11.069
power.
So, that's negative one over

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:13.778
two.
So, it's minus one half sine

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:17.346
two t,
and then it obviously continues

00:25:17.346 --> 00:25:21.112
in the same way plus a third
sign three t.

00:25:21.112 --> 00:25:24.812
Now, watch carefully because
what I'm going to say in the

00:25:24.812 --> 00:25:27.587
next minute is the heart of
Fourier series.

00:25:27.587 --> 00:25:31.287
I've given you that visual to
look at to try to reinforce

00:25:31.287 --> 00:25:34.789
this, but it's really very
important, as you go to the

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:38.158
terminal yourself and do that
work, simple as it is,

00:25:38.158 --> 00:25:42.207
and pay attention now.
Now, if you think

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.485
old-fashioned,
i.e.

00:25:43.485 --> 00:25:47.321
if you think taylor series,
you're not going to believe

00:25:47.321 --> 00:25:50.303
this because you will say,
well, let's see,

00:25:50.303 --> 00:25:53.784
these go on and on.
Obviously, it's the first term

00:25:53.784 --> 00:25:57.761
that's the important one.
That's two sine t.

00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:00.886
Now, the derivative,
two sine t, sine t would

00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:06.000
exactly follow the pink curve.
Sine t would look like this.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.146
Two sine t goes up
with the wrong angle.

00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:12.538
The first term,
in other words,

00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:15.647
does this.
It's going off with the wrong

00:26:15.647 --> 00:26:18.518
slope.
Now, that's the whole point of

00:26:18.518 --> 00:26:22.186
Fourier series.
Fourier series is not trying to

00:26:22.186 --> 00:26:27.049
approximate the function at zero
at the central starting point

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:31.937
the way Taylor series do.
Fourier series tries to treat

00:26:31.937 --> 00:26:35.077
the whole interval,
and approximate the function

00:26:35.077 --> 00:26:38.083
nicely over the entire interval,
in this case,

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:40.421
minus pi to pi,
as well as possible.

00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:44.430
Taylor series concentrates at
this point, does it the best it

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.567
can at this point.
Then it tries,

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:49.306
with the next term,
to do a little better,

00:26:49.306 --> 00:26:52.513
and then a little better.
The whole philosophy is

00:26:52.513 --> 00:26:55.519
entirely different.
Taylor series are used for

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:59.528
analyzing what a function of
looks like which you stick close

00:26:59.528 --> 00:27:04.079
to the base point.
Fourier series analyze what a

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:07.162
function looks like over the
whole interval.

00:27:07.162 --> 00:27:10.316
And, to do that,
you should therefore aim to,

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:14.116
so the first approximation is
going to look like that,

00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:16.841
going to have entirely the
wrong slope.

00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:21.000
But, the next one will subtract
off something which sort of

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.652
helps to fix it up.
I can't draw this.

00:27:23.652 --> 00:27:27.811
That's why I'm sending you to
the visual because the visual

00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:31.324
draws them beautifully.
And, it shows you how each

00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:34.407
successive term corrects the
Fourier series,

00:27:34.407 --> 00:27:40.000
and makes the sum a little
closer to what you started with.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.970
So, the next guy would,
let's see, so it's 2t.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:50.602
So, I'm subtracting off,
probably I'm just guessing,

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:56.898
but I don't dare draw this.
I haven't prepared to draw it,

00:27:56.898 --> 00:28:02.752
and I know I'll get it wrong.
So, okay, your exercise.

00:28:02.752 --> 00:28:07.059
But, it'll look better.
It'll go, maybe,

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:12.029
something like,
let's see, it has to end up...

00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:17.000
some of it gets subtracted
off...

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.184
I don't know what it looks
like.

00:28:20.184 --> 00:28:25.116
When you use the visual at the
computer terminal,

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:32.000
I've asked you to use it three
times on a variety of functions.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.714
I think this is maybe even one
of them.

00:28:34.714 --> 00:28:38.500
Notice that you can set the
parameter, you can set the

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.500
coefficients independently.
In other words,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.214
you can go back and correct
your works, improving the

00:28:45.214 --> 00:28:48.714
earlier coefficients,
and it won't affect anything

00:28:48.714 --> 00:28:51.857
you did before.
But, the most vivid way to do

00:28:51.857 --> 00:28:55.500
it is to try to get,
visually, by moving the slider,

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.642
to try to get the very best
value for the first coefficient

00:28:59.642 --> 00:29:05.212
you can, and look at the curve.
Then get the very best value

00:29:05.212 --> 00:29:09.558
for the second coefficient and
see how that improves the

00:29:09.558 --> 00:29:11.770
approximation,
and the third,

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.982
and so on.
And, the point is,

00:29:13.982 --> 00:29:18.328
watch the approximations
approaching the function nicely

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:22.832
over the whole interval instead
of concentrating all their

00:29:22.832 --> 00:29:26.940
goodness at the origin the way a
Taylor series would.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.654
Now, there is still one
mathematical point left.

00:29:30.654 --> 00:29:35.000
It's that equality sign,
which is wrong.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.973
Why is it wrong?
Well, what I'm saying is that

00:29:38.973 --> 00:29:43.830
if I add that the series,
it adds up to f of t.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.744
Now, it almost does but not
quite.

00:29:46.744 --> 00:29:50.806
And, I'd better give you the
rule, the theorem.

00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:56.016
Of all the theorems in this
course that aren't being proved,

00:29:56.016 --> 00:30:01.226
this is the one that would be
most outside the scope of this

00:30:01.226 --> 00:30:05.465
course, the one which I would
most like to prove,

00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:12.000
in fact, just because I'm a
mathematician but wouldn't dare.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.259
The theorem tells you when a
Fourier series converges to the

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:22.339
function you started with.
And, the essence of it is this.

00:30:22.339 --> 00:30:26.261
If f is continuous,
is a continuous function,

00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:30.540
let's give the point,
it's confusing just to keep

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.768
calling it t.
If you like,

00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:37.938
call it t, but I think it would
be better to call it t zero

00:30:37.938 --> 00:30:44.000
just to indicate I'm
looking at a specific point.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.136
So, if the function is
continuous there,

00:30:48.136 --> 00:30:54.393
the value of f of t is
equal to, the Fourier series

00:30:54.393 --> 00:30:59.378
converges, and it's equal to its
Fourier series,

00:30:59.378 --> 00:31:05.000
the sum of the Fourier series
at t zero.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.410
And, the fact that I can even
use the word sum means that the

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.350
Fourier series converges.
In other words,

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.907
when you add up all these guys,
you don't go to infinity or get

00:31:16.907 --> 00:31:20.288
something which just oscillates
around crazily.

00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:22.787
They really do add up to
something.

00:31:22.787 --> 00:31:26.021
Now, if f is not continuous at
t zero,

00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:28.814
this emphatically will not be
the case.

00:31:28.814 --> 00:31:32.268
It will definitely not,
but by far, the kinds of

00:31:32.268 --> 00:31:36.678
discontinuities which occur in
the applications are ones like

00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:39.986
in this picture,
where the discontinuities are

00:31:39.986 --> 00:31:44.836
jump discontinuities.
They are almost always jump

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.147
discontinuities.
And, in that case,

00:31:47.147 --> 00:31:49.392
in other words,
they are isolated.

00:31:49.392 --> 00:31:53.336
The function looks good here
and here, but there's a break.

00:31:53.336 --> 00:31:57.483
Typically, electrical engineers
just don't leave a gap because

00:31:57.483 --> 00:32:02.846
they like, I don't know why.
But electrical engineer,

00:32:02.846 --> 00:32:09.606
and others of his or her ilk
would draw that function like

00:32:09.606 --> 00:32:16.367
this, like a rip saw tooth.
Even those vertical lines have

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:21.704
no meaning whatever,
but they make people look

00:32:21.704 --> 00:32:24.906
happier.
So, if f has a jump

00:32:24.906 --> 00:32:30.244
discontinuity at t zero,
and as I said,

00:32:30.244 --> 00:32:36.411
that's the most important kind,
then f of t,

00:32:36.411 --> 00:32:42.104
then the Fourier series adds up
to, converges to,

00:32:42.104 --> 00:32:46.848
it converges,
and it converges to the mid

00:32:46.848 --> 00:32:52.736
point of the jump.
Let me just write it out in

00:32:52.736 --> 00:32:55.374
words like that,
the midpoint of the jump.

00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:58.397
That's the way we'll be using
it in this course.

00:32:58.397 --> 00:33:02.000
There's a notation for this,
and it's in your book.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.572
But, those of you who would be
interested in such things would

00:33:07.572 --> 00:33:11.318
know it anyway.
So, let's just call it the

00:33:11.318 --> 00:33:14.790
midpoint of the jump.
So, if I ask you,

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.627
to what does this converge?
In other words,

00:33:18.627 --> 00:33:22.190
this series,
what this shows is that the

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.666
series, I'll write it out in the
abbreviated form,

00:33:26.666 --> 00:33:32.148
summation minus one to the n
plus one over n sine nt,

00:33:32.148 --> 00:33:39.000
what's the sum of the series?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.989
What is it?
Let's call this not 

00:33:41.989 --> 00:33:44.766
little f of t.
Let's call it capital F of t.

00:33:44.766 --> 00:33:46.474
I want to know,

00:33:46.474 --> 00:33:48.894
what's the graph of capital F
of t?

00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:53.094
Well, the initial thing is to
say, well, it must be the same

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:56.298
as the graph of the function you
started with.

00:33:56.298 --> 00:34:00.000
And, my answer is almost,
but not quite.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.180
In fact, what will its graph
look like?

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:09.570
Well, regardless of what
definition I made for the

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:16.170
endpoints of those pink lines,
this function will converge to

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.690
the following.
From here to here,

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.980
I'll draw it.
I won't put in minus pi's.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.829
I'll leave that to your
imagination.

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:33.000
So, there's a hole at the end
here.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.324
In other words,
the end of the line is not

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:39.162
included.
And, the end of this line,

00:34:39.162 --> 00:34:43.864
regardless of whether it was
included to start with or not,

00:34:43.864 --> 00:34:46.540
it's not now.
And here, similarly,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:51.081
I start it here with a hole,
and then go down parallel to

00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:53.189
the function,
t, slope one.

00:34:53.189 --> 00:34:57.081
And now, how do I fill in,
so the missing places,

00:34:57.081 --> 00:35:00.000
this is the point,
pi.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.191
This is the point,
negative pi,

00:35:02.191 --> 00:35:05.112
and there are similar points as
I go out.

00:35:05.112 --> 00:35:08.252
Well, since the function is
continuous here,

00:35:08.252 --> 00:35:12.050
the Fourier series will
converge to this orange line.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.825
But here, there's a jump
discontinuity,

00:35:14.825 --> 00:35:17.235
and therefore,
the Fourier series,

00:35:17.235 --> 00:35:20.960
this function converges to the
midpoint of the jump,

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.640
in other words,
to here.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.758
This function,
in other words,

00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:28.629
converges to this very
discontinuous looking function,

00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:33.011
and rather odd how these points
are, I say, but in this case,

00:35:33.011 --> 00:35:37.028
I can prove to you that it
converges here by calculating

00:35:37.028 --> 00:35:41.423
it.
Look, this is the point,

00:35:41.423 --> 00:35:44.855
pi.
What happens when you plug in t

00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:50.105
equals pi?
You get everyone of these terms

00:35:50.105 --> 00:35:53.942
is zero, and therefore the sum
is zero.

00:35:53.942 --> 00:36:00.000
So, it certainly converges,
and it converges to zero.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.422
Now, that's a general theorem.
It's rather difficult to prove.

00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:07.974
You would have to take,
again, an analysis course.

00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:12.107
But, I don't even get to it in
the analysis course which I

00:36:12.107 --> 00:36:14.644
teach.
If I had another semester I'd

00:36:14.644 --> 00:36:17.327
get to it, but I can't get
everything.

00:36:17.327 --> 00:36:21.460
Anyway, we're not going to get
to it this semester to your

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.360
infinite relief.
But, you should know the

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.622
theorem anyway.
People will expect you to know

00:36:27.622 --> 00:36:32.710
it.
Well, that was half the period,

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:39.054
and in the remaining half,
you're going to stay a long

00:36:39.054 --> 00:36:43.003
time today.
Okay, no, don't panic.

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:47.193
I have to extend the Fourier
series.

00:36:47.193 --> 00:36:54.374
Okay, let me give you the hurry
up version indicating the two

00:36:54.374 --> 00:37:00.000
ways in which it needs to be
extended.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Extension number one --

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.020
The period is not two pi,
but two times,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:24.309
I'll keep the two just to make
the formulas look as similar as

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:29.154
possible to the old ones.
The period, let's say,

00:37:29.154 --> 00:37:34.000
instead of two pi,
is two times L.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.417
Now, I think you know enough
mathematics by this point to

00:37:37.417 --> 00:37:40.164
sort of, I hope you can sort of
shrug and say,

00:37:40.164 --> 00:37:42.788
well, you know,
isn't that just kind of like

00:37:42.788 --> 00:37:44.741
changing the units on the
t-axis?

00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:46.877
You're just stretching.
Yeah, right.

00:37:46.877 --> 00:37:49.258
All you do is make a change of
variable.

00:37:49.258 --> 00:37:52.981
Now, should we make it nicely?
I think I'll give you the final

00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:56.643
answer, and then I'll try to
decide while I'm writing it down

00:37:56.643 --> 00:38:00.000
how much I'll try to make the
argument.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.527
First of all,
the main thing to get is,

00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:11.555
if the period is not pi but L,
what are the natural versions

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:18.227
of the cosine and sine to use?
Use the natural functions.

00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:23.826
Natural has no meaning,
but it's psychologically

00:38:23.826 --> 00:38:26.805
important.
In other words,

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:33.000
what kind of function should
replace that?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.411
I'll certainly have a t here.
What do I put in front?

00:38:37.411 --> 00:38:40.550
I'll keep the n also.
The question is,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.858
what do I fix?
What should I put here in

00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:47.506
between in order to make the
thing come out,

00:38:47.506 --> 00:38:52.257
so that it has period 2L?
You probably should learn to do

00:38:52.257 --> 00:38:56.753
this formally as well as just
sort of psyching it out,

00:38:56.753 --> 00:39:00.485
and taking a guess,
or memorizing the answer.

00:39:00.485 --> 00:39:03.709
If this is the t-axis,
here is t and L,

00:39:03.709 --> 00:39:08.761
zero and L.
What you want to do is make a

00:39:08.761 --> 00:39:14.380
change of variable to the u-axis
where the axis is the same.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.809
This is still the point.
But, L, now,

00:39:17.809 --> 00:39:21.238
on the u coordinate,
has the name pi.

00:39:21.238 --> 00:39:26.952
Now, so I'm just describing a
change of variable on the axis.

00:39:26.952 --> 00:39:31.523
What's the one that does this?
Well, when t is L,

00:39:31.523 --> 00:39:37.003
u should be pi.
So, t should be L over pi.

00:39:37.003 --> 00:39:39.134
When u is pi,

00:39:39.134 --> 00:39:43.785
t is L, and vice versa.
How about expressing u in

00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:49.695
terms, well, then u is equal to
pi over L times t.

00:39:49.695 --> 00:39:52.795
That's the backwards form of

00:39:52.795 --> 00:39:58.802
writing it, or the forward form,
depending upon how you like to

00:39:58.802 --> 00:40:05.466
think of these things.
Okay, so the cosine should be

00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:10.725
pi over L times t,
in order that when t be L,

00:40:10.725 --> 00:40:16.223
it should be like cosine of n
pi,

00:40:16.223 --> 00:40:19.928
which is what we would have
had.

00:40:19.928 --> 00:40:25.665
So, if t is equal to L,
in other words,

00:40:25.665 --> 00:40:32.000
where is this from?
What am I trying to say?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.806
That's the function.
This one is probably a little

00:40:36.806 --> 00:40:40.436
easier to see.
Where is this one zero?

00:40:40.436 --> 00:40:46.126
The sine functions that we used
before was zero at zero pi,

00:40:46.126 --> 00:40:50.050
two pi, three pi.
Where is this one zero?

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:54.857
It's zero at zero.
When t is equal to L,

00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:58.487
it's zero.
When t is equal to 2L,

00:40:58.487 --> 00:41:03.000
so, this is the right thing.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.129
So, it's zero.
It's periodic,

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:08.628
and it's zero plus or minus L
plus or minus 2L.

00:41:08.628 --> 00:41:11.746
And, in fact,
formally you can verify that

00:41:11.746 --> 00:41:15.397
it's periodic with period 2L.
So, in other words,

00:41:15.397 --> 00:41:19.656
we want a Fourier expansion to
use these functions as the

00:41:19.656 --> 00:41:22.698
natural analog of what would be
up there.

00:41:22.698 --> 00:41:26.957
So, the period of our function
is 2L, and the formula is,

00:41:26.957 --> 00:41:32.945
I'll give you the formula.
It's f of t equals

00:41:32.945 --> 00:41:38.400
identical summation,
an, except you'll use these as

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:45.163
the natural functions instead of
cosine nt and sine

00:41:45.163 --> 00:41:49.854
nt. So, n pi t over L

00:41:49.854 --> 00:41:54.981
plus bn, okay,
I'm tired, but I'll put it in

00:41:54.981 --> 00:42:00.000
anyway, n pi t over L.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.990
Yeah, but of course,
what about the formulas for an?

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.611
Somebody up there is watching
over us.

00:42:08.611 --> 00:42:13.798
Here are the formulas.
They are exactly what you would

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:19.474
guess if somebody said produce
the formulas in ten seconds,

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:24.660
and you'd better be right,
and you didn't have time to

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.009
calculate.
You say, well,

00:42:27.009 --> 00:42:32.000
it must be, let's do the cosine
series.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.982
Okay, let's not do a cosine.
So, it's one over L

00:42:36.982 --> 00:42:41.352
times the integral from negative
L, in other words,

00:42:41.352 --> 00:42:45.197
wherever you see an L,
wherever you see a pi,

00:42:45.197 --> 00:42:50.354
just put an L times the f of t
cosine, and now we'll use our

00:42:50.354 --> 00:42:52.889
new function,
not the old one.

00:42:52.889 --> 00:42:57.609
I submit that's an easy,
if you know the first formula,

00:42:57.609 --> 00:43:01.280
then this would be an easy one
to remember.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.000
All you do is change pi to L
everywhere.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.933
Except, you got to remember
this part.

00:43:09.933 --> 00:43:15.143
Make it a function periodic of
period 2L, not 2pi.

00:43:15.143 --> 00:43:18.120
And similarly,
bn is similar.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.586
It looks just the same way.
And, how about,

00:43:22.586 --> 00:43:28.752
and the same even-odd business
goes, too, so that if f of t,

00:43:28.752 --> 00:43:33.962
for example,
is even, and has period 2L,

00:43:33.962 --> 00:43:38.959
then the function,
then the best formula for the

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:45.146
an will not be that one.
It will be two over L,

00:43:45.146 --> 00:43:49.341
and where you integrate only
from zero to L,

00:43:49.341 --> 00:43:51.000
f of t cosine.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.083
So, now, the bn's will be zero,
and you'll just have positive,

00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:08.080
etc.
for L.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.963
As I say, this is important
case, particularly if the period

00:44:13.963 --> 00:44:18.750
is two, in other words,
if the half period is one

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:24.235
because in the literature,
frequently one is used as the

00:44:24.235 --> 00:44:27.526
standard normal reference,
not pi.

00:44:27.526 --> 00:44:33.808
Pi is convenient mathematically
because it makes the cosines and

00:44:33.808 --> 00:44:39.690
sines look simple.
But, in actual calculation,

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:45.767
it tends to be where L is one.
So, usually you have a pi here.

00:44:45.767 --> 00:44:49.952
You don't have just nt.
Well, I should do a

00:44:49.952 --> 00:44:55.730
calculation, but instead of
doing that, let me give you the

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.520
other extension.
Fortunately,

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:04.000
there are plenty of
calculations in your book.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.715
So, let me give you in the last
couple of minutes the other

00:45:10.715 --> 00:45:14.884
extension.
This is going to be a very

00:45:14.884 --> 00:45:21.599
important one for us next time.
Typically, in applications,

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:24.957
well, I mean,
the first thing,

00:45:24.957 --> 00:45:30.284
periodic functions are nice,
but let's face it.

00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:37.000
Most functions aren't periodic,
I have to agree.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.668
So, all this theory is just
about periodic functions?

00:45:40.668 --> 00:45:42.361
No.
It's about functions.

00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:46.524
Really, it's about functions
where the interval on which you

00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:48.782
are interested in them is
finite.

00:45:48.782 --> 00:45:52.168
It's a finite interval,
not functions which go to

00:45:52.168 --> 00:45:54.990
infinity.
For those, you will have to use

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.671
Fourier transforms,
Fourier transforms,

00:45:57.671 --> 00:46:02.306
not Fourier series.
But, if you are interested in a

00:46:02.306 --> 00:46:06.844
function on a finite interval,
then you can use Fourier series

00:46:06.844 --> 00:46:11.457
even though the function isn't
periodic because you can make it

00:46:11.457 --> 00:46:13.540
periodic.
So, what you do is,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.483
if f of t is on,
let's take the interval from

00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.864
zero to L.
That's a sample finite

00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:22.245
interval.
I can always change the

00:46:22.245 --> 00:46:25.518
variable to make the interval
from zero to L.

00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:29.908
I can even make it from zero to
one, but that's a little too

00:46:29.908 --> 00:46:34.000
special.
It would be a little awkward.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.399
So, if a function is defined on
a finite interval,

00:46:38.399 --> 00:46:43.696
the way to apply the Fourier
series to it is make a periodic

00:46:43.696 --> 00:46:47.018
extension.
Now, since I have so little

00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:52.315
time, I'm just going to get away
with murder by just drawing

00:46:52.315 --> 00:46:55.907
pictures.
So, let me give you a function.

00:46:55.907 --> 00:47:01.294
Here's my function defined on
zero to L, colored chalk if you

00:47:01.294 --> 00:47:05.291
please.
Let's make it the function t

00:47:05.291 --> 00:47:09.056
squared,
and let's make L equal to one.

00:47:09.056 --> 00:47:13.066
That function is not periodic.
If I let it go off,

00:47:13.066 --> 00:47:17.322
it would just go off to
infinity and never repeat its

00:47:17.322 --> 00:47:20.268
values, except on the left-hand
side.

00:47:20.268 --> 00:47:25.015
But, I'm not even going to let
it be on the left hand side.

00:47:25.015 --> 00:47:29.762
It's only defined from zero to
one as far as I'm concerned.

00:47:29.762 --> 00:47:35.000
Okay, that function has an even
periodic extension.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.715
And, its graph looks like this
extended to be an even function.

00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:44.126
Okay, now, that means from zero
to negative L,

00:47:44.126 --> 00:47:48.157
you've got to make it look
exactly as it looked on the

00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:51.504
right-hand side.
Otherwise, it would be even.

00:47:51.504 --> 00:47:54.622
And now, what do I do?
Well, now I've got,

00:47:54.622 --> 00:47:59.109
from minus L to L.
So, all I'm allowed to do is

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:03.156
keep repeating the values.
In other words,

00:48:03.156 --> 00:48:06.704
apply the theory of Fourier
series to this guy,

00:48:06.704 --> 00:48:10.484
use a cosine series because
it's an even function,

00:48:10.484 --> 00:48:14.263
and then everything you want to
do, you say, okay,

00:48:14.263 --> 00:48:16.654
all the rest of this is
garbage.

00:48:16.654 --> 00:48:20.125
I only really care about it
from here to here.

00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:24.829
And, that's what you will plug
into your differential equation

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:28.223
on the right-hand side,
just that part of it,

00:48:28.223 --> 00:48:33.258
just this part of it.
How about the odd extension?

00:48:33.258 --> 00:48:37.290
What would that look like?
Okay, the odd extension,

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:41.564
here I start like this.
And now, to extend it to be an

00:48:41.564 --> 00:48:44.870
odd function,
I have to make it go down in

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:49.306
exactly the same way it went up.
And, what do I do here?

00:48:49.306 --> 00:48:53.661
I have to make it start
repeating its values so it will

00:48:53.661 --> 00:48:57.290
look like this.
So, the odd extension is going

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:01.000
to be discontinuous in this
case.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.071
And, what's the Fourier series
going to converge to?

00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:07.785
Well, in each case,
to the average,

00:49:07.785 --> 00:49:12.175
to the midpoint of the jump,
and the odd extension looks

00:49:12.175 --> 00:49:16.007
like this, and this will give me
assigned series.

00:49:16.007 --> 00:49:18.607
Okay, you've got lots of
problems to do.
