I know this sounds real dumb, but Polar Bears
are bears right? So why don't they hibernate

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.000
in the winter?

Howdy kids, Trace here with the bear necessities
for DNews! Polar bears live in the Arctic

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.109
Circle, which might cause you to assume it's
the long days which keep these fuzzy ursas

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.560
from enjoying a long winter's nap, but science
believes otherwise. Hibernation is a strange

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.449
business, it's not the same as sleeping. Science
is still figuring out how to properly define

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.210
hibernation -- as all animals do it a little
differently.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.120
Hibernation is a way to conserve energy during
the months of the year when food for some

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.999
animals grows scarce. Bears, groundhogs and
chipmunks jump to mind first, but some fish,

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.789
reptiles, birds and bats also experience it
in some way. During hibernation, breathing

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.399
and heart rate slow, metabolism plummets and
body temperature follows that trend too.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.529
It's sort of like a natural state of suspended
animation! Hibernating animals are going through

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:05.259
physiological changes, whereas sleeping animals
are maintaining normal physiology, but changing

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.810
their mental state. It's very difficult to
wake up a hibernating animal, and doing so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.689
takes SO much energy it wouldn't go back under
again. Seriously, the arctic ground squirrel's

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.270
body temperature gets so low, the neurons
of its brain are incapable of firing. Bears

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.640
aren't "true hibernators," because they don't
shut down like that -- but they don't need

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.969
food or water all winter, which is a mark
of hibernation as well. And they don't poop

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.450
or pee. Nope. Not even once.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.490
Polar bears don't hibernate, but the females
CAN go 240 days without food. During this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.270
time, they commonly lose around 1.7 pounds
per day (0.77 kg) and birth cubs. They escape

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.579
the harsh winter by "denning" or building
a hollow in the snow. Meanwhile the males

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.020
hunt or stalk seals and other prey, in what's
called "walking hibernation," meaning their

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.549
body temperature remains normal but their
metabolic rate slows down.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.789
A study in Genome Biology and Evolution compared
the genetic code of hibernating brown and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.700
black bears to that of the non-hibernating
polar bears to find out how they can do that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.210
without curling up to sleep. Within the DNA,
researchers discovered polar bears have genes

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.019
which ramp up nitric oxide production. Nitric
oxide tells the polar bear's body to stop

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.730
breaking down fat into energy, and instead
convert it directly to heat in a process called

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.830
adaptive or non-shivering thermogenesis. Basically,
polar bears have a thermostat to keep them

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.230
warm and help conserve energy in response
to their current diet or environment.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.720
For the record, panda bears, sun bears, sloth
bears of Asia and spectacled bears of South

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.220
America also do not hibernate -- mainly, like
with the polar bear -- because there's no

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.739
season lack of food. Sorry brown and black
bears... Go sleep it off.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.049
