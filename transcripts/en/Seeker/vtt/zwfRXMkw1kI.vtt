00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.200
When planets are destroyed they form an asteroid
belt, between Mars and Jupiter there is an

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:14.400
asteroid belt… was there a secret planet
there?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.920
A few weeks back, we talked about how the
Death Star could blow up the planet of Alderaan

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.410
resulting in the formation of an asteroid
belt.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.390
And that got me thinking…

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.850
WE have an asteroid belt…

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.700
I wasn't the only one: on twitter, viewer
Shawn Pitts asked: do you think that OUR asteroid

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.970
belt was a planet once.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910
And if it was, how big was it?

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.251
The Asteroid Belt, which strangely doesn't
have a name, it's just called "The Asteroid

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:40.320
Belt" or "Main Asteroid Belt," sits between
2 and 4 astronomical units from the Sun past

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260
Mars and before Jupiter.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.300
It's comprised of millions of space rocks
ranging in size from small pebbles to the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.880
largest known asteroid Ceres; which is 600
miles in diameter.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.770
So was there a planet there?!

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.240
From what we know of the birth of our solar
system, no… there never was, but ALMOST.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.070
Gravity is the support structure for the formation
of celestial bodies.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.140
Gravity pulls material together so it can
form stars, moons, planets, galaxies…

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.850
Too little or too much and they won't form;
and that area between Mars and Jupiter is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.850
the latter.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.270
Too much gravitational interference caused
it to become a bunch of rocks instead of a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.510
pretty little planet.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.630
Physics dictates how far away those bodies
have to be from each other to maintain stable

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.630
orbits.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.030
This was discovered in the late 18th century
by J.E. Bode, and is called the Titus-Bode

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
Law.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.780
Essentially, each planet's orbital period,
is equal to the period of the sun's rotation

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.020
and distance of the furthest reaches of their
orbit.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.700
According to this mathematical equation, there
SHOULD be a planet in between Mars and Jupiter,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.710
and a planet TRIED to form but Jupiter's massive
gravity tore it asunder.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.710
It just couldn't do it.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.950
Of course, we know that NOW, but from the
18th and into the 19th century, people believed

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.090
they simply hadn't spotted the elusive planet
yet.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.409
And then in 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi discovered
Ceres!

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.049
He believed Ceres might be a comet, but it
didn't have a 'coma' the gas and dust that

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.270
surrounds a comet.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.519
A bit over a year later, a German named Heinrich
Olbers discovered another small object on

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.599
the same orbit he called 2 Pallas.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.189
Eventually, as more of these were discovered
astronomers knew there was no planet in this

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.549
fifth orbit, but instead… what they called
asteroids.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.079
Despite what conspiracy theorists may say
on the internet; these billions of little

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.159
asteroids never formed into a planet.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.930
Instead, the gravitational forces of our solar
system kept it as bit of rock and dust.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.450
But, since Shawn Pitts wanted to know how
large a PLANET would be if it DID happen to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090
form, I figured we could give a guess.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.010
Today, Ceres, comprises one-third of the mass
of the whole asteroid belt.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.010
If you were to glomp the mass of the whole
belt onto Ceres, you'd STILL have less mass

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.200
than our moon does!

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.569
Dr. Ian O'Neill, space producer for DiscoveryNews
says our moon would still be 26-times more

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.549
massive than this super-Ceres.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.389
More like super tiny.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.170
Asteroids DO occasionally fly by Earth, which
some would call, "a close shave," but if you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.919
