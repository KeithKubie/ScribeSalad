DEREK SLATER: Hi, I'm
Derek Slater.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.700
And I'm a Policy Manager on
Google's public policy team,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.080
where I work to defend
the open internet.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.690
The video you just saw comes
from a campaign we launched

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.030
just a few weeks ago called
"Free and Open," which we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.730
launched on our site,
google.com/takeaction,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.870
encouraging users all around the
world to defend the free

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.060
and open internet.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.070
Later this week, we're going
to talk about one threat to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.500
the open internet where some
governments are trying to use

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.210
a treaty conference in Dubai
to increase censorship and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.030
regulation.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.160
But first, before we dive into
that policy, we want to talk a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.860
little bit about some other
ways that we're helping to

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.130
defend the internet, and really
empowering users with

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.660
tools they can use to
defend the internet.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.060
And we have here with
me two guests.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.650
We'll start with Dominic Hamon,
who is going to tell

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.830
you a little bit about
Measurement Lab, a project

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.720
we've been supporting to empower
users with tools to

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.840
measure their broadband
internet connection.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440
DOMINIC HAMON: So yeah, I'd love
to talk about M-Lab, or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.520
Measurement Lab.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.950
The first thing to do is
to describe what it is.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.065
Because I'm sure there's
a lot of people out

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.620
there who don't know.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.260
It's a collaboration between
a number of companies and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.360
researcher-driven.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.780
It empowers internet users,
researchers, and regulators

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.960
with freely-accessible open data
coming from open-source

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.810
tools, initially about network
performance, but also with

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.480
some very interesting
information about network

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.900
neutrality and keeping
the internet open.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.540
So M-Lab's founding principle
is one of openness.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.750
And that means making room
for real science.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.970
So it allows us to have
independent peer-reviews on

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.060
data, reproduction of
existing results.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.480
We can build on top of existing

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.370
research that's out there.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.965
And it gives us long-term
validity and credibility.

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.720
And the way that we do this is
we have a publicly documented

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.440
server platform that is
completely open-source.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.410
We have experiments built
by researchers that are

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.690
completely open-source.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.790
And all of the data gets
pushed publicly, freely

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.100
available for anyone to
analyze and dig into.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.620
And as I have on a slide here,
showing you where all of the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.030
servers are around the world.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.280
And as you can see, we're
globally distributed.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.810
There's a few places we haven't
quite got to yet.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.860
But we're working--

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.860
as we see users wanting to be in
those areas, we're starting

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.480
to build those up as
much as we can.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.582
So the M-Lab platform, to give
a brief overview, consists of

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:21.530
some measurement tools.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.860
These are the experiments that
are built by researchers.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.970
And they run against the
platform, against these

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.620
globally-distributed servers.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.210
And then all of the data is
pushed into a number of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.410
backends, like a Google Cloud
Storage and BigQuery.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.710
And this allows end-users, like
policymakers, analysts,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.230
other researchers, and end-users
of the internet to

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.070
look into what the state
of the internet

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.730
is on a global scale.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.010
And when I say data, we
have a lot of data.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.590
It is completely
public domain.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.080
There's a bunch of ways
to access the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.840
data, through web APIs.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.250
There is the raw data, which
we've collected about 630

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.730
terabytes since January 2010.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.160
It's completely non-aggregated.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.650
There's been no processing
done at all.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.630
It's just there to
be looked at.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.370
And that comes from about
200,000 tests

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.200
running every day.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.769
As well as that, we've formatted
some in a slightly

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.959
easier to access, SQL-like
interface.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.310
And there we have 700 billion
rows of data to dig into,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.650
which includes some
geolocation data.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.620
So you can start to look
at the data by

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.380
country, by city, by ISP.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.740
We have some future plans.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.430
Making the data collection
easier to use, putting more

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.540
and more data into BigQuery, and
rolling out some standards

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.910
for data collection, as well, so
that not only us, but other

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.590
platforms that are collecting
data, can be cross-correlated.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.730
We're also looking at extending
the server platform

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.110
to more places.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.530
And basically, we want M-Lab to
be the go-to platform for

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.470
network measurement
and analysis.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.240
There's a couple of interesting
visualizations of

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.390
the data that I think it would
be good to dig into.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.530
The first was this one
that was built by--

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.210
looking at a tool
called Glasnost.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.250
And Glasnost looks at what's
called traffic shaping, which

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.650
is when ISPs will change the
priority on certain data going

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.990
through their networks,
sometimes positively,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.460
sometimes negatively.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.020
And this research on this map
shows that across the world,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.160
the amount of traffic shaping
that is going on

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.270
for different protocols.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.030
And so you can break
it down to HTTP.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.560
And you can see which countries
are manipulating

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.500
HTTP traffic.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.110
And similarly, you can do the
same for, say, email, and a

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.770
bunch of other things.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.800
You can dig in by clicking on
a country, as well, and

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.920
looking at different providers
and how much they're

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.340
manipulating the traffic.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.100
Now this isn't always negative,
I should stress.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.270
They are sometimes prioritizing
the traffic.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.970
But this is very interesting for
end-users to understand,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.040
for example in the US, which
providers are manipulating

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.290
data in which ways.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.810
Also, we can look
at performance.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.900
Again, to enable end-users to
understand what they're

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.630
getting compared to
other people.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.190
So here, just looking at this
chart of download throughput,

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.550
we can compare everything
around the world.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.940
We can break down by country.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.460
So here we have the United
States and Sweden for

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.290
comparison.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.190
We can compare down to region
as well, which in the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.130
US means per state.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.100
So, for example,
if I can find--

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.250
let's not do all countries.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.390
Let's say, the United States
And we can say, California

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.180
versus, say, Iowa.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.130
And we can just look at the
download throughput there.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.610
There's a bunch of other
things that we

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.490
can look at as well.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.960
And the nice thing about this
is that we can also look at

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.270
other statistics.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.020
For example, if we wanted
to look at the download

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.090
throughput versus the upload
throughput to see who gets the

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.730
better balance, we can break
this down like this.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.230
We can also look at how many
tests were run in terms of the

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.050
size of the dots.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.170
So then you start to get an idea
of how you can really dig

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.570
into the data, Rhode Island
looking particularly good for

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.820
upload throughput.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.620
And the nice thing about this
is, as well, you can look at

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.470
changes over time.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.700
And as I said, this is all
coming from the public data

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.880
that's been collected
on M-Lab.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.650
Now because this is
freely-available, one of the

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.600
things that would be great is to
have developers really dig

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.880
into this data.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.790
We have a lot of researchers
who are very interested in

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.330
building tools and generating
experiments

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.190
and generating data.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.250
And some researchers are also
looking at analyzing the data

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.280
across some of these
experiments.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.060
But any developer could jump
into this and build some

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.270
really interesting
visualizations and get out

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.650
some very interesting
conclusions about what the

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.175
state of the internet
actually is.

00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:55.860
And I would love to hear from
any developers that want to

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.060
dig into this data, and
would happily help

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.580
them figure that out.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.150
So that's the overview
of M-Lab.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.060
DEREK SLATER: So, Dominic, all
of the data comes from users

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.450
running tests on the website?

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.380
Or where do they go to
run these tests?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.840
DOMINIC HAMON: They can go to
measurementlab.net, which has

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.650
a link to all the experiments
that are run.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.040
Some of them are applications
that can be installed.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.330
Some of them run through
the web browser.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.950
It's really a per-experiment
thing.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.760
DEREK SLATER: People run tests
on speedtest.net or other

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.750
sorts of platforms.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.290
What are the key differences for
researchers or for people

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.100
who are looking to
analyze the data,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.580
compared to those platforms?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.890
DOMINIC HAMON: Yeah, that's
actually a really good point,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.200
so thank you for asking.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.080
So speedtest.net is great for
figuring out what your

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.640
internet looks like.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.360
One of the things that we don't
get with speedtest.net

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.810
is the open methodology.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.700
So it's not entirely clear
exactly how that

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.630
data is being produced.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.270
It's also a little trickier
to get a hold of the raw,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.200
unaggregated data.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.375
I know that the lot of
researchers work with Ookla,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.920
who produce Speedtest.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.960
And they do share their data.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.525
And they do share their
methodology.

00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:09.850
But it's a little harder
for everyone to get in

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.060
there and do that.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.410
So one of the things that we
pride ourselves on is that we

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.100
have a lot of unaggregated
data.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.070
And it's completely open.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.360
And because all of the tools
are open-source, and the

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.290
platform is open-source, the
methodology is, therefore,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.530
open and freely-available for
anyone to dig into and to

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.900
criticize, if need be.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.470
DEREK SLATER: What's something
that's surprised you as you've

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.070
gotten to work with data,
or play around with it?

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.380
Something that stood out as
you've dug into it yourself?

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.665
DOMINIC HAMON: Well, one of the
interesting things that

00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:46.410
I've been working on recently is
looking at the geolocation

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.630
of all of our tests, where
they're coming from.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.645
And the reason for that is to
try and determine where it

00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:53.750
would be good to build new
servers, to make sure that we

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.230
have really good coverage
around the world.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.050
And so I've been working on a
visualization that plots all

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.900
of the tests as pixels
on a map.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.410
And one of the interesting
things that came out of that

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.600
was that we have 16 million,
12 million tests a month,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.760
something like that.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.680
And yet, there are giant
dark spots on the map.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.130
There are certain countries
where there is just no data

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.830
coming out of that.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.280
And it's not clear if that's
because the data is being

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.760
blocked on the way out or
because people there are not

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.130
running the tests on the
platform or we just don't have

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.270
awareness there.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.190
One of things that does surprise
me the other way,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.240
though, is that there's a
lot of very small and

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.880
out-of-the-way countries that
are doing an awful lot of

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.860
tests, many, many more
than I would expect.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.700
And so that gives us a clue of
where to put other servers.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.810
But it's also just really
interesting to see how broadly

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.950
spread this is, in terms of
people wanting to know what

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.411
the state of their
internet is.

00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:52.130
DEREK SLATER: That's great.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.850
So we've now talked about
Measurement Lab.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.350
One tool for empowering users
with a way to understand what

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.970
the quality and speed of their
broadband connection is so

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.500
they can make informed choices
and so that researchers,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.210
innovators, policymakers can
make informed decisions about

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.630
broadband internet access.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.560
Now we're going to turn things
over Dorothy Chou, who's going

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.520
to look at another set of
transparency tools.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.060
This set looks at Google's
Transparency Report, which

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.800
she'll tell you about.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.325
It has to do with removal
requests and data requests

00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:24.720
that are made to Google from
governments and others.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.510
Dorothy, we'll hand
it over to you.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.660
DOROTHY CHOU: Thanks, Derek.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.560
So as Derek was saying, I work
on the Transparency Report,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.650
which is a site that shows when
Google is asked to remove

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.040
information, like a YouTube
video or a blog post from our

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.010
services, or when we're asked
to hand over user data to

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.430
different governments.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.890
Overall, we see a really
disturbing trend, which is

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.550
that governments that censor the
internet have gone up from

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.830
about four governments
about 10 years ago to

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.060
42 governments today.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.560
And 150 different countries have
basically been home to

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.250
our services.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.290
And at that rate, more than 25%
of our services have been

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.530
blocked at any given time.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.660
So this is a really big
concern for us.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.800
And we've created this report
precisely to help people track

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.080
these different types of
trends to access to

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.540
information online.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.760
So for those of you don't know
what the Transparency Report

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.360
is, I'm going to give a brief
overview and then talk a

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.650
little bit about the update we
just released last month, as

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.230
well as how we want to move
forward and how you guys can

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.960
all engage with that.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.040
So the Transparency Report
has three basic parts.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.870
It has Traffic, Removal
Requests, and

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.530
then User Data Requests.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.160
So if you take a look at the
page I'm showing right now,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.200
that shows the traffic, which
is the availability of our

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.130
services in about 150 different

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.870
countries around the world.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.010
You can see right now on the
homepage when Syria went

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.170
completely offline last week.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.190
You can also see the different
trends around the Arab Spring

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.140
early last year, particularly
with Egypt and Libya, as well

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.450
as certain things about
infrastructure.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.490
So for example, when a
70-year-old woman in Armenia

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.960
decided to scavenge copper and
cut the cable that carried the

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.230
internet between Georgia and
Armenia and then cut off the

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.950
internet access to both
of those countries

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.730
for about six hours.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.680
And there are also some
encouraging trends, like when

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.430
Myanmar decided to lift their
ban on foreign news sites, and

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.270
when YouTube became accessible
for the first

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.060
time in quite a while.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.970
And this traffic tool is
actually updated in real time.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.380
So you can follow along.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.090
And if you wanted to see if
Blogger was available in the

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.630
UK yesterday or today, you could
do that really easily.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.170
Our second feature is called
Removal Requests, where we

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.210
show the number of times we're
asked by governments or

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.870
copyright owners to remove
information, like search

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.670
results, YouTube videos, or blog
posts from our services.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.530
And what this really shows is
some interesting trends.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.660
For example, our Government
Requests Report, which I'm

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.630
showing right now, shows
different trends about the

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.670
effects of laws on our products
and services and

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.710
whether or not you can access
different types of

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.820
information.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.670
Sometimes it can lead to some
unintended consequences on the

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.390
free flow of information.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.040
For example, in Brazil,
there's a very broad

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.190
defamation law that sometimes
will cause more requests to be

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.530
removed under the category of
defamation, which you can see

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.510
accounts for the vast majority
of the requests that we've

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.560
received since July 2010.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.290
And this tool updated
every six months.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.020
We also recently launched a
copyright feature this year

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.980
that shows the number of search
results that copyright

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.330
owners or organizations that
represent them ask us to

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.450
remove because they allegedly
link to infringing content.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.440
And this is updated
every 24 hours.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.420
And what you can see is that
from the time we started

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.510
reporting this information
back in July 2011-- or

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.870
recording it this way--

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:53.120
we went from just over 100,000
URLs being removed every week,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.550
all the way to more than 2.5
million different URLs being

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.470
removed on a weekly
basis, recently.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.190
So it's really important to be
looking at this tool to figure

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.140
out different data points when
it comes to copyright

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.380
regulation.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.390
And this tool is updated
every 24 hours.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.380
We also have a third feature
which shows the number of

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.450
times that governments have
asked us to hand over user

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.230
information in different
criminal cases.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.830
And you can see that you can
sort this in different ways.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.460
For example, you can sort it by
the number of requests, the

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.220
percentage of times where we
produced either some data that

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.650
they requested or all of it, as
well as how many people or

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.940
accounts were specified and
affected by these requests.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.880
Last month in particular, we
actually released new data for

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.520
both government requests to
remove information or to get

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.920
user information.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.990
And the interesting thing
about this particular

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.060
reporting period is that
we saw government

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.930
surveillance on the rise.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.990
Since we started reporting about
government surveillance

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:04.060
or government access to user
information in 2010, we've

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.770
actually seen the number of
user information requests

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.650
almost double in that
time period.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.440
And that's really concerning
to us.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.250
And I'll share some more
anecdotes to basically

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.940
illustrate my point.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.810
So you can see on this page that
the US continues to top

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.960
the list of countries that
make user data requests.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.140
And it's clear that basically
the law that governs access to

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.490
user information, which was
passed in 1986-- and that's

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.090
well before any of us were
using the internet in the

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.080
capacity that we are today--

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.400
hasn't really kept up with how
users are engaging online.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.240
And it doesn't really provide
the types of protections we'd

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.240
like to see in place
for users.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.310
And we're hoping that these
numbers help contribute to a

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.980
conversation about how to update
that law in order to

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.110
uphold individual rights to
privacy while also ensuring

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.860
that governments have
the legal tools they

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.890
need to fight crime.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.770
You can also see that 16
different EU countries made

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.190
1/3 of all of the user data
requests that we received

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.750
earlier this year.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.079
And out of the top 10 countries
that have requested

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.410
data, five of them
are from Europe--

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.200
France, Germany, the UK,
Italy, and Spain.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.290
Interestingly, in Asia you
can see that India is the

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.650
second-highest government
requesting user information.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.430
And that accounts for more than
10% of all the user data

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.400
requests we received in the
first six months of this year.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.950
And you can also see that out
of the top 10 countries that

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.000
made user data requests, only
one of them, Brazil, is in

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.770
South America.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.200
On the government requests for
removal side, we actually saw

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.220
that if you look at it over
time, the request to remove

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.110
content from our services
has been largely flat.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.540
But it has actually spiked in
this particular reporting

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:53.790
period in the first half of
2012, when we got just less

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:58.640
than 2,000 requests to remove
information from our services.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.950
And all of this stuff
is actually

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.430
available in download form.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.230
So you can actually download
these different data sets in

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.320
CSVs and play around with
them and see different

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.950
visualizations.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.830
What we're really hoping to
do with this data is to

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.970
contribute to a public
conversation about how

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.090
different laws and government
behaviors influence access to

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.970
information online.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.820
Many of the laws, we believe,
that are in place are actually

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.450
unintentionally resulting in
overbroad censorship or

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:24.950
surveillance.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.510
So it's important to really
look at the data as

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.080
governments are creating
these different laws.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.220
And we're hoping that policy
makers can actually see what's

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.880
happening through Google
Services, and adjust and

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.370
reform those laws to make sure
they're actually relevant and

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.400
effective and working in
the public interest.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.120
So finally, what do we need
to actually move forward?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.760
Well, we would love if
governments would be more

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.920
transparent about when and why
they want us to block access

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.670
to different information or
request user information.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.570
An important part of democracy
is that people are really able

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.580
to hold these governments
accountable.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.890
And so that if they want to
change the law, they can do so

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.420
democratically.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.920
The harm is really coming when
there's no checks or balances.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.140
And there's some danger of scope
creep when there is lack

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.490
of disclosure.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.820
For example, we really worked
hard on a document called the

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.150
Stockholm Principles, which
you can actually find at

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.070
stockholdprinciples.org.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.230
And it offers some basic
guidelines about different

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.080
types of government transparency
reporting.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.730
And we really need more
leadership to commit to that.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.610
And it's mostly because the
effects of these laws that

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.120
directly impacts censorship and
surveillance are really

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.760
quickly becoming entrenched.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.120
And so we need the public to
know and be more engaged on

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.180
these issues and confirm if
those laws and policies are

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.660
actually working in their
best interests.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.150
And the only way we can do
that is through more

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.600
transparency.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.990
And to that end, we'd actually
love for more companies to

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.470
join this effort as well, so we
can get a better picture of

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.200
what's actually going online.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.970
Our view is pretty limited
and incomplete.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.060
We can only see what's happening
on Google Services.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.780
And so we need more
data points.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.450
So for example, a government
could issue us two requests in

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.150
a reporting period, but another
company 1,000, and you

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.670
really wouldn't be able
to see the difference.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.830
So we're hoping that more and
more companies do that.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.000
And recently, I think four
different companies have

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.930
really stepped up to the plate
and joined us in that effort,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.830
including Twitter and Dropbox.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.470
And then finally, we really
need more researchers and

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.300
developers like you all to look
at our data, download

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.510
those CSVs, really take a look
at it and build on top of it,

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.790
and find the different trends
that you can see, and really

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.030
call things out like they are.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.000
There's no way that we can move
forward in this effort

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.600
without you all.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.930
So I really encourage
you to do that.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:33.362
DEREK SLATER: Great.

00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:34.660
Thanks, Dorothy.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.460
And just a couple questions
about the report.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.900
When did Google start, and you
start working on this?

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.520
DOROTHY CHOU: We started
publishing the information for

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.490
government requests
in spring of 2010.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.450
DEREK SLATER: What was the
initial motivation to sort of

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.170
open up the kimono and tell
people a little bit more about

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.270
what was going on?

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.130
DOROTHY CHOU: Well, I think we
started to see more and more

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.430
requests come in from different
governments, to both

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.770
remove information from our
services and also for user

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.230
information.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.290
And we were thinking, unless we
are more open about this,

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.100
people aren't going to
understand the collateral

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.620
effects of these different
laws that

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.690
are around the world.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.860
And so we wanted to provide them
with that data point to

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.030
basically decide, is this
actually working the way I

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.650
want it to?

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.530
And if not, how do I
change that law?

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.290
How do I fix it?

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.380
And how do I become a part of
that political process?

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.910
DEREK SLATER: And what else--
so, developers can go and play

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.990
with the CSVs to visualize the
data, look for trends there.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.470
What else can the developer
community do to make an impact

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.020
in this effort?

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.060
Are there the other tools that
you think, gosh, I wish

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.090
somebody was building this to
help users or help others

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.935
really understand what the
nature of this issue is?

00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:36.960
DOROTHY CHOU: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.610
So there's a site called
herdict.org.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.550
And it's a more of a crowdsource
tool that allows

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.090
users to report, this site isn't
working for me, or I

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.150
can't access it from
a given country.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.550
And we would love to see
developers take those

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.790
different data sources that
are available online, like

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.600
herdict, like our report, like
Twitter's report, for example,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.930
and put those all together to
create a better picture of

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.200
what information flows
look like online.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.700
We don't really have that
collaborative reporting

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.330
feature yet.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.400
So anything that developers
can do to bring those

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.022
information data points
together, that would be great.

00:22:10.022 --> 00:22:12.240
DEREK SLATER: Well, that brings
us to the end of this

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.100
episode of "Free and Open."
We've got to learn about some

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.220
ways that users can understand
how their broadband internet

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.240
connection works and what sort
of requests that government or

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.330
others are making to
remove content or

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.130
disclose data on the web.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.740
Hope here is that we can
empower more users to

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.210
understand what's going on and
through transparency, help

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.740
have a richer conversation
about the

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.680
future of the internet.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.620
Tomorrow we'll be back to talk
a bit about entrepreneurship

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.720
on the free and open internet.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.370
But that's it for
today's episode.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:23:28.767
