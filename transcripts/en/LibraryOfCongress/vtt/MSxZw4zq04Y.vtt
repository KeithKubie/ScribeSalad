00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.000
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good afternoon,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.200
and welcome to the African
Middle East Division

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.550
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb I'm
the chief of the division

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.630
and I'm delighted to
see you all here.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.510
I always do a little spiel before
which is I talk about, our division

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.410
and I do so because
we're also recorded.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.360
So it's important.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.790
As you know, many of you know
we're made up of three sections,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.680
there's the African, the Hebraic
and the Near East sections.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.790
And we're responsible for 78
countries from around the world,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.540
extending from the whole
Near East, Central Asia,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
the [inaudible] the whole content
of Africa and North and Sub Sahara.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.970
And we go up sometimes
even up to China,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.740
deal with some communities there.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.030
And of course we collect,
material from all over the world.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.350
So, we are also very active
in developing collections

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.730
in greeting visitors coming from
all the countries that I mentioned

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.500
and the different regions.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.520
We organize programs,
symposia, workshops,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.720
we also organize exhibits.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.750 position:56%
And in 2012, for example we
celebrated 100 years of Hebraic here

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.670
at the library, with a
wonderful exhibit entitled Words

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.310 position:56%
Like Sapphires, 100 years of
Hebraica at the Library of Congress.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520
And then many of you know
Peggy Pearlstein [phonetic],

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.720
she used to be the head of the
Hebraica section, and Sharon,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.920
and Brenner, and many
others were involved

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.140
in putting the exhibit together.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.650
We also invite scholars and experts
who have researched and done work

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650
in areas of responsibility to
share with us their thoughts,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740
their research, their findings.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.210
So that we come out enriched
from, the proceedings.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.030
And we celebrate heritage month.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.700
In February it's Black
History month,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.700
in March it's Norooz,
the Persian New year.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.160
And in May we always celebrate
Jewish-American heritage month.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.130
So I wish to thank the
Jewish Genealogy Society

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.450
of Greater Washington and
the Jewish Historical Society

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.300
of Greater Washington
for partnering with us

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.570
in the celebration at the library.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.540
And not only this year,
but for several years past.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.730
Today's program with Dr. Janette
Silverman, who is a past resident

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.430
of the Jewish Genealogy Society,
will address a historical issue.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.980
She will be talking about
one of her projects,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.450
that focuses on the family
history of the Blumenthals

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.800
of the Upper Lower
Peninsula of Michigan.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.150
And now to introduce the program

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.940
and the speaker is our
own Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.190
a senior reference librarian
in the Hebraic section

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.980 position:56%
of the African Middle East Division.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.280
Sharon.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.990
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz:
Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.200
Good afternoon welcome
to the African

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.090
and Middle Eastern reading room.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.730
On behalf of the Jewish Genealogy
Society of Greater Washington

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.830
and the Jewish Historical
Society of Greater Washington,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.630
and the Hebraic section,
let me thank you all

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.700
for coming to today's program.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.090
In celebration of Jewish-American
heritage month.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.720
As you heard, I'm Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.660
I'm a reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.290
The Hebraic section marks its
beginnings in 1912 with the receipt

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.290 position:56%
of 10,000 Hebrew books and pamphlets
whose purchase was made possible

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.670
by a gift from New York
Philanthropist, Jacob Schiff.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.870
From those humble beginning
our collections have grown

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.000
to around 250,000 items in Hebrew
Yiddish Ladino, Judeo-Persian

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.440
and other Hebraic script languages.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.070
And our holdings also include
an important collection

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.700
of [inaudible]books.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.190
The sections holdings are
particularly strong in the areas

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.620
of Bible [inaudible] liturgy,
Hebrew language and literature,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.130
responsa and Jewish history.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.860 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.500
and to bring people
into the library.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.280 position:56%
And one way we do that is by
holding lectures and having programs

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.140
such as the one we are
hosting here today.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.790
Before I introduce today's
speaker, it is my pleasure

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.800
to call upon Dr. Eugene Alpert,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.440
president of the Jewish Genealogy
Society of Greater Washington.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.790
And one of today's
programs co-sponsors

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.510
to say a few words
about the society.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.130
[ Applause ]

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.630
&gt;&gt; Eugene Alpert: Thank
you, Sharon it's my pleasure

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.250
to be here this afternoon.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.780
And I'm going to speak
very briefly let you know

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.340
that the Jewish Genealogy Society
of Greater Washington is composed

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.810
of about 250 members, and
we were founded in 1980.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.710
Our mission is to,
discover, document,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.260
and share the family history of
people who have Jewish backgrounds.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.980
And we meet about 10 months a year,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.900
in fact Janette was giving
a presentation yesterday

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.880
on the Ukrainian special interest
group of Jewish Gen. And I want

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.990
to welcome you all here this
afternoon, if you're interested

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.700
in joining and learning
more about the association,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.640
I've got some brochures
on the back table there.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.510
So thank you again, all for coming.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.420
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Thank
you very much Dr. Alpert

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.800
and now a word about our speaker.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.490
Dr. Silverman has been involved

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.390
in Jewish genealogical
research for 35 years.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.550
Currently, she is a senior
genealogist, research manager

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.570
and ancestry pro genealogist.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.220
Previously she has worked in
Jewish education, published widely

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.350
in genealogy and been a frequent
speaker at conferences and meetings

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.650
in the United States and Israel
speaking on such topics as,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.480
personalizing Jewish
history using archival

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.240
and digital databases for research.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.840
Ellis Island mythology and using
mobile books and [inaudible]

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.250
as genealogical resources.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.030
Dr. Silverman is the co-chair

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.600
of the IAJGS Conference being
held in August in Seattle.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.370
She has suggested that her
love of genealogy has its roots

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.890
in her father's love
of history and Judaism

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.620
and her mother's love
of jigsaw puzzles.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.440
Her presentation today will
discuss methodology and resources

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.650
for doing genealogical research.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.570
She will be sharing her own
family research as a case study.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.190
Before I turn the podium
over, however, I must mention

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.220
that this event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.760
There will be a formal question
and answer period after the lecture

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.170 position:56%
at which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.570
Please be advised, that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.390
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.100 position:56%
By participating in the question
and answer period you are consenting

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.580
to the library's possible
reproduction

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.530
and transmission of your remarks.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.510
And now, please join me in
welcoming Dr. Janette Silverman.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.280
[ Applause ]

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.580
&gt;&gt; Janette Silverman:
Thank you, everyone.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.490
I'm absolutely thrilled
and delighted

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.970
to have been asked here today
and to be standing before you

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.220
in such an amazing space.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.330
I hope you'll forgive a brief
introduction written on a napkin

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.580
that I figure dif Lincoln could get
away writing the Gettysburg Address

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.580
on an envelope, although this
isn't anywhere near as erudite,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.890
it's a napkin from the cafeteria
at the [inaudible] office.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.840
In the brief time I have
available today, I plan to share

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.450
with you the example, of
one northern Michigan family

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.060
as an illustration of
the methods and sources

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.420
of historical genealogical research

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.050
and the micro stories
that it produces.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:39.890
As Sharon indicated, whoops,
sorry, as Sharon indicated,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.920
my talk today is about my
own personal family history.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.070
A question about advancing
the slides,

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.690
is it just on the, is
it on the computer?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.750
Oh, okay, great, thank you.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.080
So I should preface by
comments by saying to you,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.220
that I ask more questions
than I answer.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.810
Some of this is going to be
due to the lack of time today,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.570
but mostly it's because I
haven't found the answers yet.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.410
As in many genealogical research
projects, for each tidbit

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:24.220
of information that's discovered
two or more questions arise.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.520
In the course of this research I
utilized many different resources,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.500
I visited the Michigan
State Library in Lansing

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.470
and a local library in Standish.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.840
I spoke on the phone and
via email with volunteers

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.240
at the West Branch Ogemaw County,
Michigan Historical Society

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.790
and the Au-Gres Historical
Society in Arenac County.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.920
And I visited countless archival
resources on the internet.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.680
As every genealogist knows, when
there's a branch of the family

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.930
about which little
or nothing is known

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.250 position:56%
that absolutely must be researched
nature abhors a vacuum a genealogist

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.040 position:56%
of a course an empty leaf on a tree.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.920 position:56%
In this case, the space was a branch
on the tree belonging the family

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.010
of my partner, Robert Clinton.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.100
And the appropriate place of
course to start, as we all know,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.900
is by interviewing family.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.430
So my starting point was Robert's
mother, Phyllis Blumenthal

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.390
who was born and lived most of
her life actually all of her life,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.180
sorry, in the Detroit area.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.840
As the oldest living person
on her side of the family,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.250
I was hoping that she
knew family stories.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.640
I began the research project
in 2005 by asking her questions

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.940 position:56%
about her father Isadore Blumenthal.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.780
He died in 1976, I was hoping

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.860
that she would know
something about his family.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.690
When I asked her, she said
the family was estranged.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.050
That's not very helpful is it?

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.270
So I started with a few facts
that Phyllis could provide.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:13.130 position:56%
Phyllis was born in 1924 in Detroit,
her father Isadore was born in 1895

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.000
in Standish, Arenac
county, Michigan.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.610
The family was German
and they owned a store.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.830
Isadore's father's name was
Samuel and his mother was Dorah,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.490
and Isadore had two
siblings, Hannah and Albert.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.770
Not an awful lot of information,

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.870
but at least a local
and a couple of names.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.840
In years gone by, without archival
resources on the internet and ways

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.110
to find and connect with people,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.370
resolving this would have
been almost impossible,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.740
certainly without having people
on the ground in Michigan

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.790
who could look through
the resources there.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.720
But today, research
is much different.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.440
And yet sometimes it's
still necessary to get away

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.180
from the computer and
pay a personal visit.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.150
I was able to visit the cemetery

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.710
where Phyllis' grandparents
Samuel and Dorah, were buried.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.830
Although photos of gravestones
are sometimes available,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.420
through digital resources, how many

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.070
of you have used digital
resources to look at gravestones?

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.900
So you know what I'm talking about,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.920
you know that there's
some great resources

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.090
out there including Joe Bar
the Jewish Gen online worldwide

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.460
burial records.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:38.490
Find a grave, Jewish
data.com and other resources.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.400
But I like, when I can
to visit a cemetery.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.560
I encourage everybody
that can do that, to do it

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.670
and to take photographs
while you're there.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.800
If you can't of course, the next
best thing is a photo online or one

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.700
that the cemetery can send you.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.400
Some cemeteries will respond to a
phone call by sending you a photo,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.540
some require a letter, a written
letter along with payment,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.660
generally under $25 to
send you a photograph.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.980
To take and send the photograph.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.100
Now the Hebrew on the stones,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.680
sometimes can give you some
interesting information.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.520
The Hebrew on these stones
includes the names of the deceased

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.710
and their father's
names, typical things

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.740
to find on a Jewish tombstone.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.990
This also includes their
death dates, the English,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.500
the Arabic numeral that you
see on the gravestones are only

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.850
of the year of their deaths.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.830
But the Hebrew gives us the
date of their deaths too.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:52.560 position:56%
Now, sometimes the Hebrew dates are
off by a day from the English dates,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.190
has anybody encountered that?

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:00.370
The, if the Hebrew data is off by a
day from the English date it means

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.820
that they died after dark,
on that English date.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.610
So that sometimes gives you a
useful piece of family history,

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.440 position:56%
something else to fill in the blanks

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.750
about how your ancestors
lived or died.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:22.270 position:56%
In one case I found a tombstone
whose English date was 11 months off

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.970
from the Hebrew date,
different year,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.160
different month, different date.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.390
Turned out, that the stone cutters
had cut the date of the unveiling

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.620
of the stone in the English date.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.760
And the Hebrew date was
the correct date of death.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.320
I only found that out
by doing some research,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.600 position:56%
pulling a death certificate,
checking on the Steve Morse website.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.270
Is everybody familiar with
the Steve Morse website?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.440
Steve Morse has a phenomenal
website that, links you to,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.100
it's called One-Step and
it links you to things

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.540
like Ellis Island and
other ship manifest.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:10.850
But for this purpose, what it
does is it gives you a translation

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:17.320
between Gregorian and Julian dates,
between Hebrew and Gregorian dates.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.790
And it's a wonderful
resource, check it out.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.540
If you just Google Steve Morse
you'll get there eventually.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:33.610
Now, we often think that the people

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.760
that we're researching
have unique names.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.320
But chances are there were other
people living in that same place

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.860
at that same time that
shared their names.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.160
So the information

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.040
on the gravestones
becomes even more important

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.800
with the addition of
the father's name.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.780
You can often put together
an entire generation

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.920
because you know the father's
name and this comes into play

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:05.720 position:56%
in a little while when I, tell you
about people with the same sir names

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:12.660
that we, whose relationship we
needed to be able to determine.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.580
Now when I began my research, I
attacked the questions by visiting,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.570
first the state library in
Lansing using databases online,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.590
Googling people and
places on the internet,

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.690
making several phone calls,
and working with individuals

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.550
through exchanges of
information via email.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.850
And my questions at the
beginning were really basic,

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.350
where was Standish, Michigan?

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.000
I had absolutely no idea.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.420
I'm a New Yorker, what do
I know about the Midwest?

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.460
What kind of store did they have?

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.860
How and when did they get
from Standish to Detroit?

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.460
And were there other
relatives in Standish?

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.550
More questions arose
as I began my research.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.490
But these were just
the beginning ones.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.170
I'm not going to walk you
through my research step by step

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.070
because it would not
only be tedious for you

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.700
but it would probably take just as
long for me to do that as it did

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.990
for me to do the research.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.050
But I am going to tell you
the story of the Blumenthals,

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.210
or at least as much of
it as I've found to date.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.760
There's still much left to
be discovered and in fact,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.920 position:56%
now that I think about it, I
realized how little I actually know.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.740
I'm not beginning at the beginning,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.200
because that would be beyond
the scope of this discussion

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.640 position:56%
but rather I'm going to start with a
brief mention that in 1881 the first

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.530
of three Blumenthal
brothers left Europe.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.930
Their names were Bernard,
Phillip, and Samuel.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.320
Now remember I said the
family was from Germany,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.050
how many of your families
came from Germany, anybody?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.160
Do you know where in
Germany they came from?

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.460
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible response]

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.760
&gt;&gt; Janette.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.340
Silverman: In Berlin.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.640
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible response].

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.220
&gt;&gt; Janette Silverman: Berlin
and Pomerania, anybody else?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.920
You know I didn't know
anything about German research.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.750
I still don't know.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.680
Because these people
weren't from Germany.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:15.630
That caused me pause, and I needed
to regroup and figure this out.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.920
It seems that the Blumenthal
family was from Courland.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.350
Not Lativa, not Germany.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.850
Courland was originally settled

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.940
by German knights although it
was never owned by Germany.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.000
But the inhabitants thought
of themselves as German.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.080
Not documented was the
arrival of the oldest

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.790
of the three brothers Bernard
in 1881 at the age of 20.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.490
He very likely sailed
into New York harbor

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.370
but no evidence has been
found yet to prove that.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.440
And frankly, I hate
having these kinds of gaps,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.240
those of you who know me
know that I really hate this.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.440 position:56%
But there's nothing to be done
about it except to keep researching.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.310
Those of you who are engaged in any
sort of genealogical research know

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.750
that this passion becomes
an obsession.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.930
And is never ending.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.100
Ship manifest often have lots of
wonderful information on them,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.290
but some of the early manifests
only had lists of names.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.760
So it's really impossible
to figure out if the people

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.120
that you're looking up are
really the people you want

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.420
to be looking up.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.790
Because it's only a name,
sometimes it's an age,

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.280
it may have a generic country but
not any more information than that.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.230
Later, ship manifests will give
you, oh the name and address

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.380
of the person and the
country that they left.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.270
The name and address of the person
they're destined to be going to,

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.440
their occupation, and
other useful information

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.050
but not the earlier ones.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:57.230
And there are many, many resources
online that can provide images

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.700
of ships and details
about specific sailings.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.400
You can get there looking
at the Steve Morse website,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.060
you can get there on
the ship's list.com

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.800
and libertyellisfoundation.org,
olive tree genealogy

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.150 position:56%
and of course the National Archives
and Records of Administration, NARA.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.740
Now, our documented story begins
in July 1882 with the arrival

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.580
in New York of the
youngest of the brothers,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.950
17 year-old Samuel Blumenthal
on board the SS Cimbria.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.550
No evidence has been found to date
of whether Samuel joined Bernard

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:39.560
in New York or went to join
him, out west or if he remained

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.030
in New York waiting for the arrival
of the third brother, Phillip.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:49.080
In 1883 Phillip Blumenthal arrived

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.760
in New York onboard the SS Grecian
Monarch departing from London.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.430
He was 23 years old, and like
Samuel, his occupation was listed

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.050
on the ship manifest as laborer.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.400
You can see that his country
of origin was noted as Germany,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:13.210
that would be this column there.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.690
Now Bernard started out in
Traverse City, Michigan,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:21.570
and I've circled Traverse City in
green for those of you who like me,

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.490
have no frame of reference
with Michigan.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:30.860
And his brothers probably
joined him there, but again,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.380
I don't know that piece
of information.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.190
The lumber industry was
in full swing in the 1800s

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.410
and there were supplies of
all sorts that were needed.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:44.320
In Traverse City, the brothers may
have been supplying the lumbermen

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.160
with equipment.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.100
One of the really phenomenal
things available

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.250
through the internet is access to
digital archives and the ability

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.140
to search them in the
blink of an eye.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.340
The Library of Congress, this
institution has an amazing store

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.280
of historical photographs
among many other things.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.230
And this is from the
Library of Congress archives.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:13.540
Now from 1881 until 1885
the brothers worked in

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.830
and around the Traverse City area,
by 1885 they had left Traverse City

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.840
and settled in West Branch.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.380 position:56%
That was a distance of about 90
miles, probably several days journey

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.310
in the 1880s by horseback
or horse and carriage.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.970
They may have visited there
as their territory expanded

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:40.900
and noticed business
opportunities in a growing town.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.150
Other than that I have
no idea why they went

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.300
from Traverse City to West Branch.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.150
Hopefully one of these
days I'll find

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.810
that missing piece of information.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.660
According to records from the
West Branch Ogemaw County,

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.230
Michigan Historical Society,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.000
Bernard opened a dry
goods store there in 1885.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.850
And this is his first
store, the New York store.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:14.450
By 1887 either that store
had closed or been renamed,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.860
or Phillip had opened his
own store, the Chicago store.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.050
They're working their
way around the country.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:31.130
In 1890, Bernard Blumenthal married
Sophia Frank in Ogemaw County,

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.780
marriage records are wonderful
sources of information,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.210
it gives names of the parents
of the bride and groom.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.470
It gives you an idea of where
they might have been living,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.400
a little snapshot in time.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.890
By 1892 a second Blumenthal
family was living

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.420 position:56%
on the lower peninsula, in Standish.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.220
Standish and West Branch are
both within that large circle,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.950
and it's slightly less than
30 miles from West Branch.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.990
Probably a day's journey by horse.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:14.020
Marcus Blumenthal, this was the
family that was now in Standish.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.240
Marcus Blumenthal and his
family survived a fire in 1892

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.080
as reported in the local newspaper.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.960
Although most of the local
newspapers I used are not available

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.430
through digital searches,
online, I was able to get a number

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.900
of items through gen web links.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.390
And a wonderful archivist
in Arenac County,

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:40.070
who sent me many, many
items by email.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.980
Many of the online archives
have different selections

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.910
of newspaper collections
including genealogy bank,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.560
the archives belonging
to individual newspapers,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.460
newspapers.com and
fultonhistory.com.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.710
When you're looking for newspaper
articles about a particular place

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.080
or a time, you, just like
other searches, you don't want

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.280
to restrict yourself
to just one resource.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.180
You want to use as many
as you've got access to,

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.770
because they all have
slightly different things.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:17.170 position:56%
And the searches are different on
each of the websites that you go to.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:21.900
So you might come up with different
results even though say two

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.890
different archives have
the same newspapers,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.030
because of the way the searches are
configured you might have different

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.380
results by the end.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.600
In August, 1894 Samuel
Blumenthal identified

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.530
on this marriage record
as both Solomon and Sam.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.870
Married Dorah Gordon in New York.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.050
Samuel was born in Courland,

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.770
I see this on his marriage
record, right here.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.410
His parents were Israel
and Hannah Gordon,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.700
their names are also on here.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.610
And he resided in West
Branch, Michigan.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.070
Now Hannah's parents
were Adolph Gordon

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.440
and Hannah Drakman [phonetic],
and she too was born in Courland

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.170
but was residing n New York.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.780
Now other documents about
Hannah, about Dorah,

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.140
indicated that she might
have been born in New York,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.460
I've never found proof of her birth
in either Courland or New York.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.780
So it's just one of those
other mysteries still waiting

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.080
to be resolved.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.590
I also haven't found
any information to prove

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.500
or disprove whether her
father Adolph Gordon,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.370
and Samuel's mother Hannah
Gordon, were related.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.230
But like many other
European Jewish families,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.180
they likely could have been.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:48.110
Jewish families have a habit of
marrying within the families,

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.330
first and second cousin
marriages are very typical

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.580
within different areas.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.800
Chances are that some of
you may be missing a pair

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:05.310
of great grandparents,
because of cousin marriages.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.910
Something that's very
typical when you're looking

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.760
through Jewish genealogical
resources to find

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:18.960 position:56%
that you can't find one set of great
grandparents and then you discover

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.560 position:56%
that you were just looking in the
wrong place because they were there.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.380
But they were hidden because
of their other relationships

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.750
to each other.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.510
Copies of New York City, records,

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.190
vital records such as this marriage
record are available primarily

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.730
in two places the New York
City Municipal Archives

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.490
on Chambers Street, and
through the microfilm collection

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.370
at the Family History
Library in Salt Lake City.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.010
But there are indexes to these that
are available in many other places,

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:55.220
including familysearch.org
and ancestry.com.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.780
Now after their marriage in New
York, Dorah and Samuel returned

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.310
to West Branch at least
for a short while.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:12.360
By October 1895, on the same page
in Standish, remember they were

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.710
in West Branch now
they're in Standish.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:21.340
This page records the
birth of Israel Blumenthal

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.870
who later changes his
name to Isadore.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:30.650
You can see the date here in 1940
when that change was made official.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:37.550
And just a couple of lines above
that, is Stella Blumenthal.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.640
Stella's Marcus' daughter,
we read about the fire,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.390
with Marcus Blumenthal's
family, Stella's his daughter.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:54.980
Some of the unanswered questions
are why did they, why did Samuel

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.090
and Dorah move to Standish?

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.790
And what was the relationship

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:05.270
between Stella Blumenthal's
parents and Isadore's parents?

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:12.950
The 1897 Michigan Business
Directory lists two Blumenthals

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.750
with dry goods stores in Standish.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.690
Harry and Samuel, who's Harry?

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.890
Who's Marcus with a general store?

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.650
I mean it's the same
Marcus that we saw

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.220
in the other records but who is he?

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.330
To date, many documents
referring to both Harry

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.450
and Marcus have been located but
in none of them is there any way

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.420
to establish a familiar
relationship between them.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.500
Or for that matter,
between them and Isadore.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:47.620
Now as an aside, Marcus was not
a brother of Bernard, Phillip,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.160
and Samuel, they're
father was Israel

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.190
and Marcus' father
was Hyam [phonetic].

00:29:53.190 --> 00:30:00.470
One of the many documents I haven't
found to date, and there's a lot

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.360
of documents I haven't found.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.340
Is the marriage record of
Phillip Blumenthal and Sara Hill.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:13.950
Who by 1892, when their
daughter is Estella who is born,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.590
were already married,
and this is a 1900 census

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.250
from West Branch Village,
Ogemaw County.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:25.370
Phillip Blumenthal and his family
and that gave me the information

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.030
about how old their daughter was.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.830
So when the likelihood
was of their marriage,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.390
sometime before she
was born, probably.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:41.700
The 1900 census also shows
Samuel and his family,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.810
they were living in Standish.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.760
And the U.S. Census is
available through many websites,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.970
some of them are free, some of
them are subscription based.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.810 position:56%
And each of the archival collections
is searchable through an index based

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.920 position:56%
on transcriptions of the data that's
included in the original document.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.790
Some of the transcriptions
vary in the type

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:08.690
of information that's
extracted from the census.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.190
Since these resources do
their own transcriptions

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.350
or have their own unique algorithms
for searching, you often have

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.920
to do searches in multiple
resources.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.510
So if you're looking for a
census record in one resource

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.990
and you don't find it, go look
for it in another resource.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.860
Sooner or later you're bound to
find it, through an index or,

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.010
if you don't find it through
an index, go look page by page,

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:40.490
find the ED, the enumeration
districts

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.100
through Steve Morse's website

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.930
where he's got a handy
little tool to figure it out.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.370
And go page by page.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:53.070
It may be tedious, but it's
definitely worth it and sometimes

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.490
when you're going page by
page, you'll find things

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.760
that you didn't even think of
finding, like other relatives.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:09.560
Meanwhile back in West Branch, the
store went through several changes

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.010
and in the early 1900s became
Blumenthal and Company.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.310 position:56%
This picture of the Blumenthal store
as well as the earlier pictures are

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.500
from the Ogemaw County
Historical Society's archive.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.720
Remember I said that for every
answer there were a couple more

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:32.690
questions, well, in October
1905 newspaper reported

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:37.580
that cousin Helen Blumenthal from
Chicago was visiting the family.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.560 position:56%
Now remember one of the earlier
stores was called the Chicago Store,

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.990
maybe that was acknowledging
the existence

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.400
of a family in Chicago, maybe not.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.710
But, who was she?

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.240
The only Helen Blumenthal I've
been able to find and connect

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.750
to the family was born in 1896
and she was Bernard's daughter.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:03.750
She certainly wasn't visiting
from Chicago by 1905 when the rest

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.800
of her family was still
living in West Branch.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.100
I don't know who she was.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.970
Like I said, it's a
never ending project.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:17.640
As verified by an August
1906 society note

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.480
in the Arenac newspaper, the
Standish Blumenthals, that's Samuel

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.180
and Dorah and the West
Branch Blumenthals,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.400
Samuel's brothers Bernard
and Phillip stayed in touch.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.970
A 1909 photo from the historical
society archives shows Bernard,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.340 position:56%
his wife Sophia, and their children.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.030
I love this picture.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.620
It doesn't look like any of
my other family pictures.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:51.100
I'm always saying that we all
have the same set of pictures,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.630
maybe with just different
faces overlaying them.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.710
But they all look the
same, this doesn't look

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.280
like any other picture I have.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.210
So maybe there's actually
two pictures floating around,

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.270
not just the one that I thought.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:11.950
On the 1910 census, living in
Standish we find Samuel, Dorah,

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.450
and their three children
Isadore, Hannah, and Adolph.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:18.440
And just three doors away
we see Harry Blumenthal

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.510
who we first encountered in
the 1897 business directory,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.040
and an Adolph Blumenthal.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.000
Both of them are boarders.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.870
Harry was 39 years old and
Adolph was 29 years old,

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.390
and they were born in Russia.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.220
They were probably born in Russia,

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.890
the same way that the other
Blumenthals were born in Germany.

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.990
I think that they were
all really from Courland,

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.920
which may have been
considered part of Germany

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.350
because it was settled that way.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.960
It certainly had more right to
be considered part of Russia

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.650
because I think it probably was, at
least for a brief period of time,

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.380
part of the Russian Empire.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.920
Now by 1912 Sam and
Harry Blumenthal,

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.440
had established a dry
goods store together.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.200
Remember the question, who's Harry?

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.020 position:56%
I still don't have an answer for it.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.070
I just have the question.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.420
But now they're in
business together.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:22.530
One of the delights
in doing this sort

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.020
of research is locating
oddities this is

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.330
about the oddest thing
I've ever found.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.640
It's a 1912 English
sparrow certificate issued

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.730
to Adolph Blumenthal,
now I don't know

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:39.420
if the Adolph is the
Adolph living with Harry

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.580
or the Adolph who was Samuel's son.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:50.010
But there was a bounty for killing
two pests, sparrows and rats.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:56.080
And this is Adolph's
certificate, he's entitled,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:03.190
it looks like 92 cents for his
46 sparrows, 2 cents a sparrow.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:08.290
And delivered, they
weren't just taking his word

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.610
for it, can you imagine?

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.130
Going around killing
them, collecting them,

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:18.890
and then bringing them, I wonder
if they were stored in the ice box.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.210
Now, by 1919 Isadore
was living in Detroit.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.720
This is evidenced by his marriage
to Minnie Stein [phonetic].

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.940
They lived in the Detroit metro
area the rest of their lives.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.400
They had two daughters,
Elaine and Phyllis.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.360
Elaine had no children,
Phyllis had three children.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.920 position:56%
And Isadore died, as I said earlier,
in 1976 after a long illness.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.630
His daughters, well growing
up didn't spend much time

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.930
with their West Branch cousins,

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.660
although Phyllis had
some recollections

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.120
of Martin, Phillip's son.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.430
She didn't remember the names
of any of the other people,

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.010
that were living in West Branch.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.030
She didn't even realize that
there were people living

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.900
in West Branch who
were related to her.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.480
It's not clear when Samuel
and Dorah moved to Detroit,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:22.360
but by 1920 that's
where the family was.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:31.910
Now, Detroit, all the way down
here, is 140 miles from Standish

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.770
and 160 miles from West Branch.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:44.570
It's a really long, drive,
possibly trains ran back and forth.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:51.670
But however the transportation
method was, at that point,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.650
the families up in the
peninsula and the family

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.380
in Detroit certainly
weren't spending a great deal

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.680
of time together.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.750
Now Phillip and his family stayed
in West Branch, as did Bernard

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:14.390 position:56%
and his family, and there's the 1920
census with both of the families

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.790
and their children on there.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.720
The children of the three
brothers did not all remain

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.070
in Michigan through time.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:26.530
Samuel's three children
stayed in the Detroit area.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.760
This is the original family
group, so we've got Israel

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.700
and Hannah Gordon back in Courland,
and their three sons Phillip,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.490 position:56%
Bernard, and Samuel and their wives.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.060
Bernard had married early,

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.350
he married a woman named
Anna Grabowski [phonetic],

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.800
who probably died, and then
he remarried Sophia Frank.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.180
And we looked at information
about Sophia and Bernard earlier.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.440
And Phillip, as I'd
said, married Sara Hill.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.550 position:56%
These are the descendents of each
of the families, many of whom stayed

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.600
in Detroit but others left.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:12.030
So Phillip's daughter,
Dorothy, and her husband Albert,

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:17.220
settled in West Chester
county, New York by 1927.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.770
In 1930 it was clear
that Dorothy's brother,

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:26.160
Isadore was living with
Dorothy and Albert.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:37.510
And, as far as I knew, Isadore
never married, or so I thought.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.030 position:56%
As I was preparing for today's talk,

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:45.520
all of the research
is ever changeable.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.390
There's stuff coming in from
the most unexpected places.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.140
So I'm preparing this talk,

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.190
I thought I was done,
and I got an email.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:01.400
And the email identified the writer

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:08.810
as a descendant of, an
Ira Mark Blumenthal.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.720 position:56%
Ira Mark Blumenthal, son of Phillip.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.820
Well I know who all of
Phillip's children were.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.900
Who's Ira mark Blumenthal?

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.180
The only person he could possibly
be is Isadore who I lost track

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.290
of after the 1930 census.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.690
He stayed in New York,
he became Ira Mark.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:36.200
Now I need to do a little more
research to fill in the blanks.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.460
I know that Martin never married,

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.300
I know that Hazel married
this guy Monty.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:47.350
I know that Estella married Arthur,
and these were their children.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.010
But I didn't have any
information about Isadore.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:56.280
Now I need to go back and
find Ira Mark, not Isadore.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:03.170
To do that I'll look in the
1940 census, I'll take a look

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.770
at some city directories
and some phone books.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.410
Since I know from this relative of
his that he was living in New York,

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.770
I'll also try checking out
New York City marriage records

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.650
and maybe even some death records.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.250
And see what I can find.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:24.400
There's got to be something,
everybody leaves a trace,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.420
it's just how difficult it
is to find those traces,

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.980
those shadows of people's lives.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:39.940
Now, this is Bernard's family
and Bernard's daughter Della,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.370
and her husband John Jacob Rueben
[phonetic]left Michigan shortly

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.130
after their 1918 marriage
and settled in Toledo, Ohio.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.690
The rest of Phillip's and Bernard's
children stayed in Michigan.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.330
Hannah married Yale Roberts and as
far as I know they had no children.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:09.000
But I guess if I can find
that there was something more

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.750
to Isadore maybe there's something
else that I haven't uncovered

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:22.060
about Hannah and Yale although,
I think I know, who knows.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.730
Anything is possible.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:32.790 position:56%
Adolph who also was named, was known
as Albert, so we've got Israel known

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:39.070
as Isadore, and Isadore
known as Ira,

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.690
and now an Adolph known as Albert.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:50.790
He married Reuben in 1923 and they
also stayed in the Detroit area,

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:55.260
they ultimately had two
daughters Ada Ruth and Joyce.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.020
Ada has three sons and they
no longer live in Michigan,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.500
they're family's settled in North
Carolina, Florida, and Arizona.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.980
And Joyce lives in
Canada and has one son.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:10.560
During the course of this research,
I met an awful lot of relatives

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.680
that nobody in the part of the
Blumenthal family that I knew,

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.250
knew of, including when I
did a talk about the family

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:27.170
up in the West Branch Ogemaw County
Historical Society two years ago.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:33.140
We had met, I had met, via email,
another one of the descendants,

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.420
a grandchild or a great
grandchild of one of the,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.110
of either Phillip or Bernard.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.850
I forget which now, and
he came to that talk.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:46.470
And so at that talk I was
able to introduce two cousins,

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:52.760
who had never heard of
each other before that day.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.110
It's one of the more
exciting things that happens

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.730
as you're doing research.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.540
How many of you have
wound up meeting relatives

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.380 position:56%
that you'd never heard of before,
never imagined through the research?

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.160
Isn't it great?

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.110 position:56%
I've found, over the years that
although I used to get, unbelievably

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:17.020
and amazingly excited when I found
my own relatives and I still do.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.980
I get just as exited if I
met other people's relatives.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:25.920 position:56%
I'm indiscriminate about how excited
I get doing genealogical research.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:32.460 position:56%
So I have a bunch of questions left.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.460 position:56%
Who was Helen Blumenthal of Chicago?

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.990
How are Harry, Marcus, and Adolph
Blumenthal of Standish related

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.370
to Samuel, Phillip, and Bernard?

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.750
Or even to each other?

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.090
I know that Marcus, Harry,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.950
and Adolph are not all
brothers, two of them are.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.340
I could tell that from
gravestones and death records,

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.210
but I have no idea what
the relationship is.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:03.580
I suspect, that if I can ever
figure this out, that I'll find

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:07.070
that their fathers were either
brothers or first cousins,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:12.240
there's enough names between
the, between the families,

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.300
between Marcus' children, Samuel,
Phillip, and Bernard's children.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.020
There's enough names that are the
same or similar to make me think

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.040
that they're all being
named after the same people.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.520
I'm making an assumption here,

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.420
but perhaps it's not
a, correct assumption.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.660
I'm assuming that everybody knows

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.190
about eastern European
naming patterns,

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.540
eastern European Jewish
naming patterns.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:43.190
But I'm seeing a couple of heads
shaking, so eastern European Jews,

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.750
as opposed to Sephardic Jews,

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.380
rarely name their children
after living relatives.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.440
Children are generally named
after deceased relatives,

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:59.730
and what'll happen is say you've
got children, their parents die,

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.130
they've got children
so grandchildren.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.520
And all of a sudden you've
got flurry of kids in a family

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.290
that all have the same name.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.390
They're all named after
grandparents who died.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:19.550
You can track death dates of people
based on naming patterns based on,

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.250
children who all of a sudden
are carrying their names.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:25.120
That helps you identify
when people died

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.530
and find additional
family information.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.160
If you don't have birth
dates of people but you know

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.980
who they were named after,
you can also sometimes figure

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.830
out when they were born which
helps you isolate the resources

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:44.920
that you need to be investigating
as you do more family research.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:52.750
I also don't yet know how Philip
arrived in the United States,

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.230
I'm sorry, how Bernard
arrived in the United States.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.610
I don't know the year he arrived,
I don't know where he came into,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.760
probably New York, but I
don't know that for sure.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.130
I don't know how the brothers
got from New York to Michigan,

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.850
if they went in together, or if
they all joined the pioneering

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.810
first arrival.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:19.840
And I don't know why, they
went from New York to Michigan.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.790
All of those things bother me.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:24.950
Sleepless nights bothering.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:28.440
Sometimes waking up at 4 o'clock in
the morning with an inspiration of,

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.530
I've got to go look for this there.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.860
Running to the computer
and at 4 o'clock

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.870 position:56%
in the morning, doing some research.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:41.480
Now some of you are smiling or
giggling, you've been there,

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.870
you know what I'm talking about.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:47.470
Genealogist dreams.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:54.080 position:56%
So I'd be really remised if I
didn't make some comments about some

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.950
of the resources I used during
the course of this project.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:01.190
In 2005 I sent an email to
the West Branch public library

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.850
seeking assistance.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.390
Because in addition
to everything else,

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:10.050
genealogy is very much a networking
effort, someone sent a copy

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.700
of my inquiry to Louann
Zetltle [phonetic],

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.850
the president at that time, of
the Ogemaw Historical Society.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:23.600
Who entered into now a decade
long, correspondence with me.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.180
We've talked over the
phone, we've emailed.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:33.060
And in 2014, 9 years after I
started this, right after a visit

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.960
to West Branch where I introduced,

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.940
as I said two Blumenthal
descendants to each other.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.810 position:56%
We visited Standish in Arenac County
and met with Joann Gulo [phonetic]

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:45.560
of Au Gres Michigan and
I apologize to Joann

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.070 position:56%
if I've mispronounced her last name.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.410
And if I've mispronounced
the town, she's a volunteer

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:57.390
at the Standish Historical Society
and in the years since that visit,

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:01.950
she has scanned and emailed me
every document that she found

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:03.890
in the society's archives.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.510
And in the courthouse,
and the newspaper,

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.240
that pertain to the
Blumenthal family.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.380 position:56%
Most of that archive isn't digitized

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.510
and although it's really well
organized ,thanks to the efforts

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:20.680
of Joann and other volunteers,
it's not all indexed or digitized.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:27.820
Of course, online my most common
resources are ancestry.com,

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.700
jewishgen.org, family search,
the Library of Congress,

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:37.160
The National Archives, and many
other online archival resources.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.570
All of which paid a big
part in this project as well

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.490
as in many other research
projects I'm involved in.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:47.900
And I thank you all for
letting me do this today.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.550 position:56%
Pardon, there was some
instructions about asking questions.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.510
Okay, I'll repeat the questions.

&gt;&gt; Janette Silverman:
Thank you, thank you.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.440
So I just received some
advice that number one,

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.880
that my number one question
who is Helen Blumenthal

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.660
of Chicago should really go
at the bottom of the list,

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:57.220 position:56%
because social editors in newspapers
receiving phone calls about visitors

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.790
and other items to be put in
often couldn't hear very clearly

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.130
on the phones party lines and such.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.240 position:56%
And they have taken notes, scribbled
notes about the name of a person

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.850
who was coming to visit and
where they were coming from.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:15.370
And may not have been able
to read handwriting correctly

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:19.140
so I might want to just relegate
that, search for Helen Blumenthal

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.980
to the bottom of the list and
assume that okay, it was somebody

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.360
that was coming to visit
the Blumenthal family.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:33.510
But maybe [inaudible] from
[inaudible] and leave it at that.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.490
Thank you.

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.510
Yes, Gene?

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:48.420
&gt;&gt; Janette Silverman: Yeah, so
one of the great resources online

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:53.200
and I'm sorry that I failed to
mention it, the Michigan Jewish,

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:58.220
Historical archives has
digitized all of their journals

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:03.440 position:56%
and there are a couple of articles
in there about Jews in Traverse City

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.320
and I don't remember the exact
number, but there were Jews

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.300
in Traverse City back then.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.350 position:56%
But there is no mention at all in
any of these, in any of the journals

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.240
that I read, and I read
through almost all of them

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.800
and it's quite an extensive
collection, didn't find any mention

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.160
at all of the Blumenthal family.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.740
There was, Traverse
City is on the water,

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.580
and barges are coming in and out.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.730
There were a number of stores
that had opened there to be able

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.750
to supply lumber workers and
I supposed, also the fur trade

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:43.930
and other, trading goods.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:50.640
So there was a community of sorts,
I suspect from what I've read

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.340
that the Blumenthal brothers
didn't have a store per say there,

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.750
but they were peddlers.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.420
And they may have been
picking up goods and going

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:03.030
around to the different camps
and trading there and coming back

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.340
to town, perhaps supplying
the stores with some goods,

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.180
that they had gotten in
exchange for the goods

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.100
that they brought up there.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.900
So.

in the research that I've done.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:28.880
And I didn't see any similarities
in the names that I was looking

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.640
at in Traverse City
and back in Courland.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.600
The resources that I used
for the Courland portion

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:43.410
of this research was from
the, Lativa SIG on Jewish Gen,

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.310
the Latvian special interest group
which has done an amazing job

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.880
with transcriptions of
records from Courland.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.760
And there's a lot of
information that's online

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:02.830
through Jewish Gen. The Latvian
government had their vital records

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:09.460
revisions lists, conscription
lists and tax records all online

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.510 position:56%
through the Latvian government site.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.680
I'm happy to send any of you

from France who very regretfully
died suddenly a couple of years ago,

has done a phenomenal
transcription of the vital records

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.250
from the Latvian archives,
from Courland.

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.830
And, those are available,

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:43.250 position:56%

in comprehensive transcriptions,
from those.

So the vital records themselves have
very little additional information

going to tell you the language

that they're in, and I'm
going to get it wrong.

but I won't swear to God.

And wasn't able to work for
a large portion of his life.

Samuel retired not too long after
arriving in New York, in Detroit,

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.950
but they maintained
stores until he retired.

And I understand from
family stories,

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.660
that when he retired
he was fairly well off,

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.600
had a driver that took him around.

number of family stories.

he sold the store in Standish,

came to Detroit to retire but
I found some other documents

had, he was not retired

arrivals, it's just lists.
