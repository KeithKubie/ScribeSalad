00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.310
SPEAKER: In Android
Studio 2.2, we've

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.050
greatly improved
the Visual Layout

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.760
Editor, including built-in
support for ConstraintLayout.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.480
ConstraintLayout
is a great new way

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
to define complex
layouts without the need

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
for nested view hierarchies,
thanks to a flexible constraint

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.320
system.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.450
It's available in the
Support Repository,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.780
and works all the way
down to API level 9.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.350
To install it in Android
Studio, open the SDK manager

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.060
and select both the
ConstraintLayout

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.790
for Android and Solver
for ConstraintLayout

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.990
from the SDK Tools tab.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.590
To use it in your project,
add the dependency

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.360
and build a gradle.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.330
Now, create a new layout file
with the ConstraintLayout

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.690
as the root view.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.050
Notice that, in
Android Studio 2.2,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.600
the Layout Editor gained
a few new features,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.310
such as the
Blueprint mode, which

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.760
you can use alongside the
Design view if you wish.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430
On the right side
of the screen, you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.960
can see the redesigned
View Inspector.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.210
Here, you can switch between
the commonly-used View

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.520
properties, and the full list.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.410
The Inspector also includes
ConstraintLayout-specific

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.730
layout attribute editors, which
I'll show you in a moment.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.930
First, let's start by dragging
an image view from the palette

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.670
onto the blueprint.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.550
You can see that every
view in a ConstraintLayout

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.990
has four handles on the sides--
top, right, bottom, and left.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.700
Views that inherit
from Text view

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.070
also have a baseline handle.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
To position views
relative to each other,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.450
you can click and
drag from one handle

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.550
to another of the same type.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.950
Here, I'm placing a
Text view in the layout

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.360
and aligning it to the
right of the Image view

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.590
by creating a constraint
from the left handle.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm also aligning
these views vertically

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.210
by adding a top constraint.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.430
The views are still a
bit too close together,

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.770
so you can adjust the margin
by dragging the Constraint

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.280
view in Design Preview, or I
can use the Properties window

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.600
on the right.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.980
That looks better.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.770
The only thing that remains
is positioning our views

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.900
inside the parent container.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.314
By enabling the Show Constraint
Settings in the toolbar,

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.730
I can see that
there are currently

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.540
no constraints pointing to
the outer edges of the layout.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.160
My two views would
simply get moved

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.830
to position zero at runtime.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
By connecting the top and left
handles to the parent edges,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.110
I can specify how
I want to position

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.150
the views in the container.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.800
What if I want to
center a view instead

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.890
of gluing it to the left or
right side of the screen?

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.680
I'll create a new Text view,
and center it horizontally

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.610
within the layout by connecting
both sides to the parent.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.830
You can see the view now
has constraints pulling it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.210
both ways.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.850
Because ConstraintLayout
can't satisfy both constraints

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.090
at the same time, the
view remains centered.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.380
If you now look at
the Properties window,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.250
you can see a slider
called Horizontal Bias.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.890
By changing the percent
value using the slider,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.290
I can influence the
strength or weight

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.240
of each constraint,
which results

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.460
in moving the view slightly
to the left or right.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.300
You can also change the desired
width and height of a view

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.110
by cycling through three modes--
Wrap Content, Fixed Size,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.000
and Match Constraint.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.700
You shouldn't be using Match
Parent in ConstraintLayout,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.680
and use Match
Constraints instead,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.990
which basically means
that the view can grow up

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.120
to the available
space while still

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.700
satisfying its constraints.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.710
To remove a constraint,
click on one

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.860
of the sides of the box shown
in the Properties window,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.370
or click on a handle
in the Design view.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.280
You can also delete all
constraints on a single view

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.790
by clicking here, or remove
all constraints and the layout

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.770
using the button in the toolbar.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.130
We're continuously improving
both runtime performance as

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.100
well as editor capabilities,
so always make sure

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.010
that you update to the newest
version in the SDK Manager

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.720
and your build files.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.610
And check out our
code lab and article

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.680
on "Medium" for more advanced
ConstraintLayout examples.
