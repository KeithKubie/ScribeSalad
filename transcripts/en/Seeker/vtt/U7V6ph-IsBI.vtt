00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.870
Alcohol is older than the Great Pyramid at
Giza, Machu Picchu, the Roman

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.940
Colosseum, Taj Mahal and the
Great Wall of China combined. And while

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:19.689
it's not considered one of the wonders of
the world, maybe it should be.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.920
Alcohol, or more accurately, ethanol; is a
simple enough chain of carbon and hydrogen

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.519
with an oxygen thrown in for good measure,
but it is most definitely humanity's favorite

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.630
neurotoxin. Anywhere we've been, we make alcohol,
or bring it with us. It's a social lubricant,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.060
liquid courage, and a constant companion.
It just gets along with us so well!

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.460
When ethanol enters the body some leeches
in through mucous membranes, but the lion's

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.600
share of it travels through the stomach to
the small intestine, to be absorbed into the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.210
bloodstream. Ethanol is water-soluble, so
once in the bloodstream there's no stopping

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.650
it. Like a drunk Westchester teen it parties
at every stop on the train to drunktown; skin

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.760
and organ tissues, heart muscles, brain cells…
Alcohol pals it up with them all. In the brain,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.730
it binds with a molecule called glutamate;
a neurotransmitter that normally keeps neurons

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.830
excited so they can fire on all cylinders.
Once bound, your brain slows as your neurons

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.480
become less excited. It also activates GABA
receptors -- the famous GABA molecule is another

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.800
neurotransmitter and needless to say, since
the receptors are active, the brain doesn't

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.400
make more GABA, without GABA, you feel calmer
and sleepy. This continues until the liver

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.520
is able to metabolise it and get it out of
the blood.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.409
No matter how you get the alcohol in your
body, this long process is how you get drunk.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.250
Though being human we obviously found new
and horrifying ways to jump the line. Inserting

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.260
drugs into the rectum has been done for millennia,
and was a popular way to take tobacco for

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.850
a while, but still, don't try it. Alcohol
enemas, what the hyped-up media called butt

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.670
chugging, bypasses the body's natural poison
detection and metabolization systems -- getting

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.159
people WAY too drunk WAY too fast. It's super
dangerous. Alcohol inserted into the body

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.140
via an alcohol enema isn't processed by the
digestive system and can cause alcohol poisoning,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.370
and even death. Not to mention if you DO live,
you can have anal pain, tenesmus -- or the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.530
feeling to GO a lot, and colonic bleeding.
Vodka-soaked tampons are along this same vein

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.980
(no pun intended) with the mucosal membranes
becoming irritated and burning from alcohol

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.340
contact.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.130
But that doesn't stop people from trying things,
OHHHHH no. Palcohol is a powder-like alcohol

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.500
legalized in the U.S. in March of 2015, and
then banned in some places shortly thereafter.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.740
We talked about it on DNews, remember? No?
Come subscribe so you don't miss it for next

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.180
time. Palcohol is made to be dissolved in
water, but it could ALSO be snorted -- which

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.180
is the worry for some legislators though there
doesn't seem to be much evidence that anyone

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.430
other than one VICE reporter actually did
it. The reason snorting it would make sense,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.810
from a drunks perspective, is because you
wouldn't have to wait the few minutes for

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.849
the alcohol to hit the stomach, and then small
intestine. The blood vessels in the nose are

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.459
close to the skin, and if the ethanol is absorbable
-- BOOM. Direct line to the blood. Palcohol

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.370
HIGHLY discourages this practice, and the
description by the VICE reporter should too.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.819
Ouch. But ,if you're trying to get to the
blood, why not go right to the source? Cause

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.720
some people do.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.550
A 1999 Oxford Journal study looked into people
who injected alcohol directly into their bloodstream,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.879
and although they didn't die, there was burning
pain. Three case studies looked at people

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.599
who admitted to injecting vodka, sherry, whiskey,
and one guy even tried beer. But they weren't

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.069
the first. Victorians were famous for gettin'
crunk. A man named H.C. Dalton injected whiskey

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.709
-- not ethanol mind you, whiskey -- under
the skin of patients suffering from morphine

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.019
poisoning. This guy was mixing a deadly cocktail
for sure. Of course, he wasn't trying to get

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.050
the man drunk; it wasn't his first rodeo;
he'd used whiskey injections in the past to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.610
keep patients alive and kicking. Funny story,
this was all described by the 1911 Montreal

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.300
Medical Journal, and alcohol was listed as
a stimulant (but it's not. It's a depressant).

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.459
Gives a whole new meaning to "doing a shot,"
doesn't it?

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.739
And now, the ultimate, breathable booze, has
been invented. You don't need to inject, snort,

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.099
butt-chugg or even drink it. Instead, just
breathe air at this bar in London called Alcoholic

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:30.449
Architecture. When vaporized alcohol is present
in the air, and it intoxicates your lungs,

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:38.849
your skin and is even absorbed through the
EYEBALLS -- bypassing the liver going direct

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.509
to blood and HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING FROM
THIS VIDEO!? What the hell, man?

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.240
According to a doctor consulted by the Associated
Press, “This has the potential to cause

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.330
serious side effects as well as brain damage
in the developing young brain.” They even

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.930
make people wear ponchos so they don't absorb
too much too quickly.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.770
Overall, a study of over 2300 adults found
innovative alcohol use EXTREMELY RARE. Only

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.240
1.1 percent of people surveyed ever done any
of these things. So when you see it in the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.569
media, raise your glass, and toast their hype.
Maybe we should all just stick to drinking

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:34.269
alcohol with our mouths, the way it was intended.
