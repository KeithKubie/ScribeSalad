00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This has the correct behavior, but it's a really foolish way to compute the union of two s.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The reason for doing this is to show you the kind of things that can go wrong

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if you just cut and paste code you find without understanding it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're doing a lot more work than the original union would have been.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Of course, we could have done this as we have it and got the correct result

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by replacing res here with just b.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Searching for code is a good starting point often,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it's rarely a good ending point, and there's a lot of reasons not to do this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The first is that you might be violating copyrights

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or if you're taking code that is done under certain license.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Well, now, that license might impact the code that you're writing and the uses of it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
These are things to be very careful about.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The other reason and the one that I am emphasizing today

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
is that you're really missing opportunity to learn something new.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One of the best things about looking at other code is that you can learn from it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And the final reason is that the code that you find might be broken

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
just because something is on the internet--you've probably learn this already--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
not everything that you find on the internet is true and correct.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This does not mean that we shouldn't be searching for code

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and trying to find ways people have solved the problem that we want to solve.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But it does mean that we should be more careful with what we find

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
than just cutting and pasting it into our code.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's go back and look at the code that we found

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and there are several things in this code that we might not be familiar with

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
if all you've seen so far is CS101.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The most interesting one is set, and set is used twice

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
as well as this bar operator between two sets.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We might guess that well that's doing some sort of union operation

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
because if this does what it should, it is taking the union of two sets

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's figure out more about what set means

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Here's some choices. This is definitely a subjective question.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I'll suggest that I think two of these are good answers.
