00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:01.592
Voiceover:We've already used

00:00:01.592 --> 00:00:04.008
a transformation matrix
to transform one point,

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:05.688
what I want to do in this video,

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:07.712
is transform a series of points.

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.243
So, I have these position vectors,

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.176
p1, p2, and p3,

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:13.608
and I've plotted them right over here.

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.624
And you can imagine them to even be

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:18.128
vertices of a triangle

00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:19.528
that looks something like this

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.680
(that's one side, that's another side,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.936
and that's another side, right like that)

00:00:23.936 --> 00:00:25.632
and what I'm curious about is

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:30.192
what happens if I transform
these three points?

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:31.448
And like the last video,

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.464
I could apply this transformation matrix

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:35.160
separately to each of them

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.904
to see what they transform into,

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.696
or instead I could take
this transformation

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:44.448
matrix, and multiply it times a

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:48.528
matrix composed of these position vectors,

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:50.184
so let me do that...

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:54.472
Let me take my transformation matrix,

00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:57.432
let me copy and paste that.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:01.496
So, copy and paste.

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:04.344
So, I'm going to take
my transformation matrix

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:07.136
and I am going to multiply that

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:10.944
by a matrix that has all three of these

00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:13.552
position vectors in it,

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.344
where each of the columns of this matrix

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:17.408
is going to be one of
these position vectors.

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:21.200
So, the first one is 2, 1.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.040
Then we have -2, 0

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.472
Then we have 0, 2.

00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:31.920
So, one way you could think about it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.560
is we're taking our transformation matrix

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.376
and we're multiplying it

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:43.584
by a matrix that is composed of

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:48.496
the first column is position vector 1,

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:51.720
the second column is position vector 2,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.224
and the third column is position vector 3.

00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:02.064
Now, what is this going to give us?

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:06.744
Well, this is a 2x2 matrix.

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:12.856
We're multiplying it by a 2x3 matrix,

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:16.200
so matrix multiplication
is defined over here

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.048
because the number of columns here

00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:20.256
is the same as the number of rows here.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:25.512
And it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:31.416
So, it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:34.728
So, 2 rows and 3 columns,

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.904
which we could imagine represents

00:02:36.904 --> 00:02:41.584
three new position vectors.

00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.624
So, what's this going to be?

00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:45.256
Let's go step by step.

00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:46.800
So, this first entry,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.184
first row, first column,

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:49.776
is this row times this column,

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:52.144
so 2x2 which is 4,

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:55.272
plus 1 plus 1, so it's 4 plus 1

00:02:55.272 --> 00:02:57.970
so this is going to be 5.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.979
Let me do it in a different color.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.954
-1 times 2 is -2.

00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:11.826
plus 2 times 1 plus 2,

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:15.554
that's -2 plus 2 which is 0.

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:17.402
So, we already see it transformed

00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:20.114
2,1 to 5,0.

00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:23.042
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:27.122
So if we consider this p1,

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:30.978
we consider this p1 prime,

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:33.618
p1 after our transformation.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.122
Now, let's go to p2.

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:39.210
2 times -2 is -4,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.074
plus 1 times 0, so it's -4 plus 0,

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:45.970
which is just -4.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.514
And then -1 times 2 is positive 2,

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:52.786
plus 2 times 0, which
is just going to be 0.

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:55.298
So it's going to be positive 2 plus 0,

00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:57.490
which is just 2.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.994
So, -4, 2. Negative 1, 2, 3, 4 comma 2.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.682
Right over here.

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.626
So this is p2

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:10.626
This was p2 right over here.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.882
This is p2 prime.

00:04:12.882 --> 00:04:17.731
This is position vector p2 prime.

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.786
Or the position that position vector p2

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.138
prime would specify.

00:04:22.138 --> 00:04:25.218
And then finally, let's look at p3.

00:04:25.218 --> 00:04:27.986
So we have 2 times 0,

00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:29.986
which is 0, plus 1 times 2,

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.730
so that's zero plus 2 or just 2,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.746
and then we have -1 times 0, which is 0.

00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.730
plus 2 times 2 is four.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.962
So, we get the point 2, 4.

00:04:41.962 --> 00:04:44.730
So, 2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4...

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.794
we go right over here.

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:49.882
So, this is p3 right over here.

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:54.676
This is p3 prime.

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:56.378
And so something interesting has happened.

00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:58.338
We now have the vertices you could imagine

00:04:58.338 --> 00:05:00.762
of a new triangle.

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:03.826
Of a new triangle that
looks something like this.

00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:08.634
That looks something like this.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:10.882
So, what you can imagine is...

00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:12.490
Actually, let me draw it...

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.762
Let me draw our new one
with this blue color.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:17.970
so we can see it a little better.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.666
So we went from that smaller triangle,

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.010
we went from that smaller triangle

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.738
to the larger one, this is the smaller one

00:05:27.738 --> 00:05:29.418
right over here.

00:05:29.418 --> 00:05:31.538
That's our smaller triangle

00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:33.474
to the larger one,

00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:35.266
or another way you could think of it,

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.346
this entire triangle was transformed,

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:39.530
and right now we only
transformed the vertices,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.962
but it actually turns out,

00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:42.202
and I'm not proving this video,

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:43.490
that if you transformed-

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.434
if you took any of these
points on this triangle,

00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:47.018
it would have transformed to a

00:05:47.018 --> 00:05:51.146
corresponding point on
this larger triangle.

00:05:51.146 --> 00:05:53.026
And what's neat about this is hopefully

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:54.354
you're starting to appreciate

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.714
the power of a transformation matrix.

00:05:57.714 --> 00:05:59.738
And hopefully you're
starting to appreciate

00:05:59.738 --> 00:06:02.186
why this is useful as you
start to think about things

00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:05.298
like computer games and animation,

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.418
because what transformation matrixes

00:06:07.418 --> 00:06:08.506
allow us to do,

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:10.410
and this is what these computer programs

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.594
allow us to do -

00:06:11.594 --> 00:06:13.682
view things from different perspectives,

00:06:13.682 --> 00:06:15.826
what they're actually
doing under the covers,

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:18.026
is they're using transformation matrixes,

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.442
and they're multiplying
them times coordinates,

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:22.602
in order to get new coordinates based on

00:06:22.602 --> 00:06:25.146
the position or the
perspective of the player,

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:27.930
or the position or the
perspective of the camera,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.490
or the virtual camera in
a computer graphics world.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.002
So two, I guess, several neat things here,

00:06:35.002 --> 00:06:37.202
is we haven't just
transformed a point now,

00:06:37.202 --> 00:06:38.690
we've transformed three points,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.322
which could represent the
vertices of a triangle,

00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:43.170
and you see it as this kind of expansion

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.706
and rotation that seems to have happened

00:06:48.706 --> 00:06:51.586
when we used this transformation matrix.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:53.322
If we use a different
transformation matrix,

00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:55.442
we would have a different transformation

00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:57.410
and not only did we do it,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.858
but we saw that we could
do it with multiple

00:06:59.858 --> 00:07:02.066
position vectors as the same time.

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:03.938
I could have done it independently

00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:05.218
and gotten the same result,

00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:06.378
but this is hopefully

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:08.202
starting to show you the power

00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:10.130
of matrixes, and why
it also could be useful

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.266
in things like computer
graphics and animation

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:14.213
and things like that.
