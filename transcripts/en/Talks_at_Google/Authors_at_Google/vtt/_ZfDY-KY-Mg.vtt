00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
&gt;&gt; Announcer: Welcome to New York.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:07.950
It is my profound pleasure to welcome Dr.
Susanna Grannis, author of Hope Amidst Despair.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.139
I am very happy that she's here.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.999
Reason why she was here is I was on the AIDS
walk this spring and I fell into the step

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.080
with a guy who was walking by himself as well
and we started talking about where we work.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.289
Of course I gave him the Google spiel about
what you can say and what you can't say.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.470
And he said, "Well, I work for this charity
and this charity does these things."

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.400
And what his charity does is go and help aid
children who are orphaned by the AIDS pandemic

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.480
in Africa grow up in strong communities.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.590
And I was so moved by that I invited Dr. Grannis
who was the founder of this group to come

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.820
and speak to Google today.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.539
Because I think it's very important as member
of the Google community to understand that

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.699
one person can affect change.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.510
And we are in a unique position here at Google
to be considered leaders.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.020
And with that, Dr. Grannis.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
[applause]

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Grannis: Thank you very much.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.430
It's really an honor to be here.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.800
For someone of my generation who spent much
of her life in academic world and doing publishing

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.430
and so forth, I was thinking this morning
about Google.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.930
When I was an untenured assistant professor
in the University of Illinois in Chicago I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.741
was under the gun to publish, I remember what
it was like when you went to get a book and

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:42.890
it was gone and there was no record of who
had it or an article was ripped off a journal.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.580
Then later, after all these years later, sitting
in a small farm in Southern Vermont doing

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.190
research and discovering that Google was going
to help me find all kinds of things all over

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.800
the world.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.990
It has been a great pleasure.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.890
So I didn't put Google in my acknowledgments
but I want you to know that Google really

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.039
made a difference in the process of developing
this book Hope Amidst Despair.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:23.459
I have some photographs and some, a few quotes
to give you from my book.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.750
And it really begins with the despair part.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.310
But be patient, it comes to the hope part.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.040
This is a copy of the book.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.019
And it came out and I've been writing on it
for some years, but really it started quite

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.659
a number of years ago when my husband and
I were Fulbright Professors at The University

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.230
of Namibia in 1996.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.840
And during that time, nobody talked about
HIV AIDS.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.370
But it was happening.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.530
When we came back, I began to be concerned
about the children who were, who had lost

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.530
their parents.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.780
What does it mean for children to be alone
especially in societies where you belong matters?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.280
What happens to the children?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.650
And so, in 2003, informally but then in 2004
more formally when we became a 501C, CHABHA

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.999
was born and we supported projects in Libya,
South Africa, Rwanda and Burundi and ultimately

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.450
focused on Rwanda and Burundi.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:39.029
This book includes data from there are five
countries to compare to show that HIV AIDS

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:44.370
pandemic differs by country.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.109
During those years, as I said it was spreading
and here is a photograph of how it was spreading

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.080
across Africa like wildfire.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:08.110
To just to give you some specifics on that
in South Africa where data is kept more accurately,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.780
recording the number of infected women in
prenatal clinics, in 1993, 4.3% of women were

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.190
found to be infected.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.550
By 2005, that had grown to 30.2%.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.250
Why was it growing in such a fast rate?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.630
Well, one of the reasons, I think terrible
time.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.890
Okay, good.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.160
Excuse me.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.950
One of the reasons is because of stigma, silence
and secrecy.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.950
People didn't talk.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.040
As soon as people realized that HIV was spreading,
the transmission occurred and had to do with

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.600
sex, they found it very, very difficult to
talk about it.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.780
That silence and the secrets have also led
to stigma.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.840
And stigma happens to youngsters particularly.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.590
And this is one of several short quotes that
I have about stigma.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:23.560
One of our youngsters whom I call Maria Teresa
said, "My uncle sometimes is like embarrassing

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.940
me, shaming me.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.250
You must have AIDS.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.740
Your mother died of it.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.360
When he talks like that, I don't know what
to do.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.750
I feel it in my heart."

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.080
Another, a boy of 13 said "I don't tell people
I'm infected, because they would stigmatize

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080
me.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080
The leaders here know."

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.460
And I will explain that shortly.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.820
A girl South African girl in school said,
"Even my friend told me she won't eat with

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.000
me again.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.251
One told my right to my face and I've got
AIDS and I should stop coming to school and

00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:56.251
I should just stay home.

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:57.970
I would feel terrible.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.610
Cry deep down.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.350
I would sit alone and cry alone."

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.710
And that loneliness is a pattern of children
who've been stigmatized.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:18.970
[pause]
When children when people are afraid and stigmatized,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.310
they do not choose easily to go and get tested
and to follow up with any counseling or medications

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.730
that are possible.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.040
And just this morning I read an editorial
in the Kenyan paper of a man talking about

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.150
how reluctant he was to get tested until after
actually a child was born.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.870
It isn't something in the past.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.110
It continues.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.810
As a result of all of the pandemic and the
spread and so forth, there have been millions

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.110
of orphans to AIDS.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:00.920
Nearly 15 million children in Sub-Saharan
Africa have lost one or both parents to AIDS.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.460
There are strides and there are more and more
people getting antiretrovirals.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:13.220
But still across Sub-Saharan Africa less than
half of the people who need to take the antiretrovirals

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:21.580
get them which means the other half will ultimately
die and many of them are in their productive

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.860
years of their 20s and 30s and are parents
leaving more orphans.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:34.590
So we look to a future of more, not fewer
orphans unfortunately.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:42.490
As children are orphaned, their aunts, their
uncles, their neighbors take them in and poor

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:49.940
families who take in more children with more
mouths to feed become more impoverished.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.780
And these are pictures from Kigali in Rwanda.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:08:00.800
The one on the right indicates the poverty
is related and interacts with unclean water

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.380
and poor sanitation.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:11.180
One way to measure the impact of poverty on
children is to look at the number of children

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.300
who are underweight.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:19.870
In 27% of children across Sub-Saharan Africa
are underweight both affected by HIV AIDS

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.870
and not.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.600
In Burundi, over half the children are stunted.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.770
It's one of the poorest countries and it's
where we have a project.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:38.860
I remember the first time I went there when
I met a boy who was about this tall.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.820
And I usually figure an amp can child is older
than I would assume when looking at an American

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.820
child.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.639
This boy I assumed conservatively perhaps
14, he was almost 17.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:56.019
So these children who are stunted, it affects
their physical development.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:01.139
It also affects their cognitive development.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:08.750
Gender is, as you probably know, a significant
factor in the HIV AIDS pandemic in Sub-Saharan

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.759
Africa.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:18.139
Fully 60% of those living with HIV in Sub-Saharan
Africa are girls and women.

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:25.510
For young women and girls it's particularly
noticeable.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:33.810
In South Africa, while 4.5%of young men between
the ages of 15 and 24 are HIV positive, among

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.470
the equivalent group of young women the rate
is 13.8.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:44.330
So if you were a teacher of secondary students
it could be that three of the girls in your

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.199
class and one of the boys is infected.

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:49.199
How can that be?

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:55.990
It's very complicated this gender differential.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:03.139
Studies of childhood behavior show gender
influence behaviors which is of course true

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:05.689
of all societies.

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:12.740
In South Africa where these studies have been
done, people have noted that girls learn very

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.620
early to be compliant and boys learn very
early to be assertive.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.629
And those behaviors continue.

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:25.829
And it affects behaviors including sexual
behaviors as adults.

00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:33.420
And it isn't just that males believe that
women have no right to refuse sex, which is

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:40.749
the case of 47% of men in Lesotho, but 40%
of women agree to that.

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:46.560
As one South African woman said in a group
context with other women, "I can speak out

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560
here."

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.809
She was in a program for empowering women.

00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:55.810
"I can speak out here but who will defend
me when I am alone with my husband in the

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.980
bedroom?"

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.230
Implicit in that statement is the fear of
violence.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:07.440
And indeed, there is considerable violence.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.839
And I'll tell you an instance in the workshop.

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:15.629
This is the workshop that we did in 2003 sometime
ago.

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:21.019
At a workshop about HIV transmission my husband
and I asked participants to answer whether

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:26.559
or not each situation could result in transmission
from a set we presented.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:30.630
The audience was made up of teachers and secondary
school students.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:37.759
About equal numbers of both: men and women,
girls and boys.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:43.139
Everyone agreed that one could not be infected
through hugging for example.

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:47.160
The place came apart however over one situation.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.379
The man and the women ended up shouting at
each other about this one.

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:55.879
A man goes away to another country for two
months on a special assignment.

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:59.279
When he gets home, he has unprotected sex
with his wife.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.220
Could she become infected?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.869
The women said of course she could.

00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:06.629
The men, no she couldn't become infected.

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:11.269
These men and these women had very different
understandings of the meaning of the disease

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:19.720
and their gendered role and talk across these
misunderstandings is critical.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:26.999
Women are affected in other ways as well.

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:34.860
Many families, many orphans are being brought
up by their grandparents usually the grandmother.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:42.490
Over 50% of orphans in some countries such
as Kenya are brought up by grandparents.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.149
This is a grandmother and granddaughter in
our projects and they're doing very, very

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:48.149
well.

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:50.810
You can see this is a nice, neat house.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.730
This child is well-cared for.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.449
That is not always the case.

00:12:54.449 --> 00:13:02.730
And it certainly isn't the case when great
poverty and great numbers of children.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.689
I heard of a woman in Uganda who was trying
to raise 13 grandchildren.

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:17.220
And here's an observation we made that underlies
the feelings that these grandparents have.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.999
In a church service in a township outside
Johannesburg we watched a young boy about

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:27.240
four years old and his very aged grandmother,
perhaps it was his great grandmother.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.439
She was urging him to walk across to the other
side of the huge room to join a group of other

00:13:33.439 --> 00:13:35.220
children and teacher.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:40.009
It would mean he would have to walk in front
of a huge crowd of people and he was scared.

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:45.310
She kept urging him to go but he was determined
to stay in safety with her.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:51.630
Finally leaning heavily on a cane, she took
his hand and walked him across to the class.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.759
But we wondered how long that little boy would
have this elderly woman to care for him and

00:13:56.759 --> 00:14:01.579
make him feel safe.

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:06.970
Some children and I don't have reliable figures
unfortunately live in child headed households.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:16.369
And this is a family, the picture was taken
maybe three years ago, perhaps four, three.

00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:22.819
Anyway the older girl and her twin sister
at 16 after their mom had died were given

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:23.819
this house.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:32.990
A little 3-room concrete block house for the
two of them and their two brothers.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:39.999
They no sooner got in the house than they
got in touch with their two young cousins

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:43.259
who had also lost their mother to come and
live with them.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:49.610
And that is the African way as families accept
more and more children and try to help them

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:50.760
out.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:58.910
That little boy, the littlest one next to
the girl with her arm around him was born

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.389
when his mother was sick with AIDS.

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:08.360
And I don't know with that particular child
was infected at birth, but many children have

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.439
been infected at birth such as this baby.

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:16.970
A great deal of effort has gone into reduce
mother-to-child transmission.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.050
And fewer and fewer children are born infected
which is a very good thing.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:29.790
In the U.S. and in northern Europe, it's less
than 1% through the, by giving antiretrovirals

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:35.429
to the mother before and during birth and
following up the baby afterwards.

00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:40.920
And in some hard to reach places which is
an ongoing issue in Sub-Saharan Africa they

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:47.400
have baby and mother packs that the mother
can go home with after birth because they

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:54.429
are losing a lot of children who live so far
away to keep coming back for testing after

00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:56.670
birth.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:02.420
So a lot of effort and good effort has been
put afoot into saving children's lives.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:11.050
And indeed treatment has increased a great
deal.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.389
Clinics have gone up.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:17.420
Antiretrovirals are more and more available.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:23.800
But your chances if you need antivirals when
you get sick depend somewhat, depend largely

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.529
on where you live.

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:32.860
In some countries the claim is that 95% of
the people in Rwanda to be specific, the claim

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:39.290
is that 95% of the people who need antiretrovirals
get them.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:45.050
In Burundi the other country where we have
projects 27% of people who needed them.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.949
And sadly there are reports that Burundi has
lost some of its grants and people who have

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:53.370
been taking antiretrovirals are dying.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:17:00.170
I've seen similar reports of shortages in
newspapers since this came out just in recent

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:08.319
weeks in Malawi and in Zambia and in Uganda,
but theirs may be a problem of distribution.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:16.579
In any case, it is an ongoing problem and
more to that in a moment.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.250
But this picture, let me tell you about it.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:24.010
This is, I interviewed a number of children
and I asked them to draw pictures and I have

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.370
a few in the book and here is Jean's picture.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.150
This is a time that she was proud of.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:37.120
And this begins to show how our emphasis has
been to build resilience in children living

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.130
in this, very difficult circumstances.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.500
Jean is one of nine children.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.830
Her mother is HIV positive and was receiving
free drugs at the time I talked with Jean.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.100
Her picture is about an earlier time.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.400
In her picture her mother sits with her back
to us.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.299
She's just come from the hospital where she
learned of her HIV status.

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:02.600
And Jean said her mother cried for days.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:10.480
She asked help from a neighbor, that elegantly
dressed woman on the left who refused to help.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.390
And after several days Jean went to her association
and consulted one of her leaders who told

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.120
her more about the disease.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.870
So at the bottom you see the four little stick
figures, that's Jean and three siblings talking

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.169
to the figure on the left, the leader.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:31.390
After learning about HIV AIDS from a meal,
Jean came home and told her mother about how

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.070
drugs would keep her alive.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.049
And how all the children would help.

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:41.940
Jean is very proud that she took on the responsibility
of finding out about HIV and helping her mother.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.100
Her mother would live and she, Jean, would
help resolve family problems.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:54.890
But even in the face of this dire diagnosis,
this child is getting strength to move in

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.900
there and help.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:04.610
Another child, this one herself infected.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:10.450
[pause] Sorry.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:17.309
Mary Anthony was 13 when I interviewed her
and a double orphan.

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:22.870
She did several episodes in her picture so
I just pulled this one out.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.419
She said that since she has been taking antiretrovirals
she is no longer sick every day and she shows

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:32.570
the virus leaving her body in the figure above.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.280
The HIV's are the almost human like markings
around the sketched prone figure.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.669
You also see a friend who has come to visit
and is dismayed at her sickness.

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:47.120
Although faulty, it portrays Mary's belief
that the virus is leaving her.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.919
And despite daunting challenging, she goes
to school, she is a very good student and

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:58.960
she participates in a association she belongs
to and looks to a positive future.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.809
But for children like, oh, and I should also
point out in addition to the inequities from

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:10.419
country to country in whether or not people
get antiretrovirals.

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:18.580
Children don't get antiretrovirals at the
same rate as adults.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:27.350
For a number of reasons like people aren't
attending to older children who are infected.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:34.640
The availability of antiretrovirals of course
depends on money and in addition to the shortages,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.210
some of the large donors have leveled off
their funds for HIV AIDS.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:47.640
So we look to a difficult future.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.470
Here's the problem in a nutshell.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:58.389
On the left, those x's represent 7,000 people
newly infected every day.

00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:06.310
On the right are half those who can get on
antiretrovirals in the same period.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:15.220
And actually, that was before the shortages
began to appear.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.010
So the problem lies in prevention.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:24.070
I mean, the answer lies in prevention.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:30.980
Preventing infection in the first place is
the most important part to my mind of facing

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.330
the HIV AIDS epidemic.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.399
There are, ultimately, one day we hope there
will be a vaccine.

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:45.310
And there's a great deal of effort for years
to develop a vaccine.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.840
And that will be the final answer.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:56.279
Unfortunately, the HIV virus is a very wily,
people use that word, wily virus that changes

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.860
over time.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:07.440
So, to grasp it if you will with a vaccine
is an extremely complicated measure.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:15.130
The development of jells for women to apply
which people had great hopes for then the

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:20.410
research showed problematic results and they
pulled all the studies.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:28.529
But recently there's been some positive results
from some initial studies that need to be

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:32.029
followed up.

00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:34.410
And of course there are condoms.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.240
Condoms are both the technical use and the
behavior change.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.380
I'm going, and to my mind, even if there were
vaccine the years it would take to get it

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:52.130
up and running out to the places in Sub-Saharan
Africa where it's needed would be difficult

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.160
to achieve.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.470
So behavior change is essential.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:03.710
Here you see two young leaders of the associations.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:09.549
In Africa, it's very common for people of
like interest to form associations.

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.299
And in fact, register their associations.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:14.380
And have them to be official.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:19.850
It's far more official for example than a
club that we would have here.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:30.269
And we have, CHABHA has four associations
of children infected by HIV AIDS mostly orphan.

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:35.679
The biggest one and the one we were first
associated with is represented by these two

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:36.720
leaders.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.519
It's called Amahoro which is peace.

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:45.950
The young woman is now the vice president
and the young man president of the association.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.580
They are both orphaned, double orphaned.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:55.019
They grew up in the association and then they
were elected by the children to be the president

00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:57.559
and vice president.

00:23:57.559 --> 00:24:04.390
CHABHA holds the associations which CHABHA
support holds workshops to teach youngsters

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:10.600
important things like hygiene, nutrition,
how to grow a garden and so forth but always

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.390
HIV prevention.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:19.799
And I have two observations from two different
workshops on the teaching of HIV prevention

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:28.049
that I want to share with you because they
show you the effective and the ineffective.

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:38.230
So I, the observations from the young man
whom I call Robert here that you see here.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.690
In fact it was the day that that picture was
taken.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.330
I should say that most of these pictures we
have taken on our trips.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:52.230
Some of the better ones like the cover of
the book by a young photographer who's interned

00:24:52.230 --> 00:25:00.210
twice with our project's named Mim Shafer
and I should point that out.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:08.529
Anyway, this is what I saw that day at Robert's
workshop: 28 older youth and Robert was known

00:25:08.529 --> 00:25:10.289
and trusted by all of them.

00:25:10.289 --> 00:25:14.169
He stood at the front with dildo and condoms
on the table before him.

00:25:14.169 --> 00:25:18.759
He and the participants reviewed the facts
of the disease they had learned in school

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:23.179
in an easy give and take with important information
written on the board.

00:25:23.179 --> 00:25:29.159
Then he demonstrated safe use of condoms and
serious questions and discussions followed.

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:35.279
For example, one girl asked whether girls
needed to agree to have sex.

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:41.800
And all agree that girls as well as boys needed
to agree just as they needed to negotiate

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.660
about using a condom.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.330
They learned where to find free condoms and
then Robert pointed out that there were ways

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.929
to show affection other than intercourse.

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:54.750
It was the most amazing serious talk.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:01.750
In fact, in the high school the other day,
I began to show that and there were giggles

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.750
and so forth.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:09.039
But as soon as they heard that and realized
that those youngsters at his workshop were

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:14.580
learning about keeping themselves safe, they
really became quite serious.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.389
Here's the other extreme.

00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:21.700
A nurse was asked to teach about HIV prevention
to a group of 50 youngsters.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:28.509
A man of about 45, he stayed at the head of
the classroom, used no artifacts nor presented

00:26:28.509 --> 00:26:30.659
any charted information.

00:26:30.659 --> 00:26:36.240
He used lecture interspersed with a few questions
mostly about the progression of the disease

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.590
which these youngsters having lived with a
parent who died of it, I didn't put that in

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.529
the book, didn't need to know.

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:45.409
I wish I had.

00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:52.130
He did ask how it's transmitted when one girl
said through sexual intercourse, he agreed.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:57.679
But then he talked about how blood exchanged
when there's a cut.

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:02.320
And in order to protect themselves, he advised
them not to use sharp tools, not to play with

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.399
someone with bloody cuts, and not to touch
someone who is bleeding.

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:14.080
The lesson neither recognized children's familiarity
with AIDS nor provided information on how

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.950
to protect themselves.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:20.159
Despite being a nurse he didn't talk about
sex.

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:27.649
And that is, there are instances of that across
Africa where schools are told they must teach

00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:33.990
HIV prevention and they do, but it is very,
very difficult for many to talk about sex.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.350
And, if you don't know and trust the people
in the room, you're not going to ask the questions.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.200
You're not going to get into the details.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:51.040
Here these youngsters, they know how dangerous
this disease is, and they listen.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:28:02.190
It has been a struggle for Africa for programs
in African Governments to teach young people

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.950
knowledge about the disease.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.100
Knowledge has to come first then behavior
change.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:14.009
But just at the level of knowledge for the
most part fewer than half young people in

00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:22.460
their teenage years understand about HIV that
have what is called "comprehensive knowledge"

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.529
of the disease.

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:32.159
Which means naming two ways that it's transmitted,
naming two ways misconceptions about it and

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:35.789
whether or not you can tell someone's infected
by looking at them.

00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:40.010
Pretty low-level understanding of the disease.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:47.750
In our projects we did a little study and
we found that 89%of them have at least that

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.690
level of knowledge.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:56.799
But of course, having the knowledge is necessary
but not sufficient for preventing.

00:28:56.799 --> 00:29:02.190
So here thus this is the question: where lies
the hope?

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.410
I explained about the associations.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.649
They are led for the most part by these young
leaders such as you saw.

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:19.039
For children in a very bad situations, sometimes
and often a transformation occurs as it did

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:24.049
with this girl pictured at one of the gatherings.

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:30.980
The association children gather every week
for all kinds of activities.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.809
I had seen this girl the year before.

00:29:34.809 --> 00:29:36.990
I'm going to talk about two different times.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.890
The first time I met her she and her sister
lived in a tiny, tiny room.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.169
They had very few objects.

00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:50.490
If you go about counting the objects in your
house, it's like my house beyond belief.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.289
They had almost nothing.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:59.350
Two mats, an empty cooker, one change of clothing
on a rope across the ceiling.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.130
That's pretty much it.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.590
They were not in school and then because they
didn't have money for school.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:10.919
They were shunned, because their mom had died
of AIDS.

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:15.700
They sometimes got food from neighbors, but
the neighbors did not interact with them.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.870
They were totally alone with nothing to occupy
them.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:27.460
And then the association brought them in and
they began to participate in the multifaceted

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.899
activities.

00:30:28.899 --> 00:30:29.899
They went to school.

00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:31.669
They got health cards.

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:36.090
They went to workshops.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.309
The leaders visited with them.

00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:47.100
And here is what they were like a year later.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.630
About 300 young people were participating
in circle games, singing and running, chasing

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.679
one another laughing they had gathered with
others from an association of children for

00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:59.320
a two-day workshop on life skills.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:05.480
They would soon be in a classroom learning
about family, community, and HIV prevention.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.269
I saw several children I knew including two
sisters.

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:13.320
They were transformed from the last time I
seen them, wonderfully transformed.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.429
There they were with arms around other girls,
their friends.

00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:25.279
Then after a few minutes they formed a line
and sang a song about AIDS they had written.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:30.590
It was a plea for cessation of stigma against
children like themselves.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:35.179
More and more of the hundreds of children
gathered around to listen and as they sang

00:31:35.179 --> 00:31:37.639
the girls seemed confident and strong.

00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:42.690
And when they finished everyone clapped with
generous knowing appreciation.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:49.379
And that's the transformation into strength
and resiliency that we have seen.

00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:51.210
Hope lies in many things.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.440
It certainly lies in going to school.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.860
And going to school is complicated.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:05.110
We still do not have universal primary education
though it's been called for since 1934.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:12.360
And even in countries in several Sub-Saharan
Africa that claim to have universal free primary

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.659
education, they don't.

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:22.040
Because the children don't have the money
for shoes, for pencils, for uniforms such

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.320
as these children here.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:30.429
And in many schools even though the government
doesn't approve of it, the schools charge

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:35.499
contributions and chase the children away
if they don't have it.

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:42.139
So getting to school and staying is a very
big problem for these extremely poor children.

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:49.820
And indeed, in Rwanda and Burundi, I just
recently saw these data, about half of the

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.610
children make it to fifth grade, half.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:56.200
They really are working on it.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:02.629
And it's a matter of land and will and classrooms
and teachers and everything you can imagine.

00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:10.240
The story in secondary education is also is
worse because it costs a lot more money.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.409
And in recent years, the price has gone up
and Rwanda.

00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:16.490
It's gone up from 200 to 400.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.249
That's a lot of money for poor families.

00:33:19.249 --> 00:33:21.249
So in our project we do what we can.

00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:27.220
We send as many children to secondary school
as possible but for only a small percentage

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.799
of youngsters in a country in secondary school.

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:35.430
The children in the pper middle class, the
elite, going to secondary school means that

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:42.039
that country is not going to progress in terms
of productivity at the rate that's hoped for

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:47.259
at least I would think so.

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:52.440
One option that we have done and many others
have done is to develop vocational education.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:34:05.879
And you can see [pause] this boy who's learning
to be a mechanic.

00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:14.200
We have other youngsters who've learned to
be cooks, to work in beauty salon, to sew,

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:21.609
to work in hotels and some of them complain
about those being rather low-level skills.

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:31.889
But [pause] often they lead to much more.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:34.800
Here's an example "I could not go to secondary."

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.490
This is a boy who did not want to go in the
program to learn to cook, because that's what

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.859
women do.

00:34:40.859 --> 00:34:44.010
But he was given the option that or no training.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.599
So he took it and he learned to love it.

00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:51.460
"I could not go to secondary school because
I had to support my sisters by working odd

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.580
jobs.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.020
Before I was living day-to-day though now
after hard work and completing my program

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.180
I have a stable job as a cook.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:06.220
I have some food now and can even open an
account at a local bank.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.490
Since my sisters are not in school, I'd like
to be able to put them into school or vocational

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:12.490
training.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:21.140
My mom is sick with HIV so I have no long-term
plans beyond caring for my family."

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.130
So that's a success story.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:29.490
And he became the head cook in the restaurant
where he did his internship.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.450
And now he's the head cook in another restaurant
and doing well.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.380
Not everyone has gotten wonderful jobs like
this, but a number have and we're pleased

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.880
with that.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:50.280
You know, in many of our families certainly
and children have access to the kind of development

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.930
that parents give us and libraries and so
forth.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.450
These children have none.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:59.589
So we really had, it was a wonderful experience
a couple of years ago when we were five of

00:35:59.589 --> 00:36:07.280
us coming at one time to Kigali because we
took visitors and each was made to carry heavy

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.740
suitcase filled with English language books
and we started what we think is the first

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:17.140
English language little library in Rwanda.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:23.569
The school language in the first years children
learn in Kenya, Rwanda and the school language

00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:27.060
for years and years and years has been French.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:35.090
Various reasons historical and commercial
they announced that it would change to English

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:39.359
across the board for the whole country.

00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:44.620
They gave the teachers their 18 months, which
is a very short time to learn a new language

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.980
and to be able to teach in it.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.950
But amazing and the children are just loving
it.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.309
They come and they read the books.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:57.630
And the boy in the middle of the picture on
the left with the dark book that's the dictionary.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:02.670
He's just sitting there reading English words
trying to absorb as much English as they can

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:07.920
because they know that's a doorway to a better
future.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.530
Another way that hope comes is when families
are supported.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:17.849
And we have been able to provide goats for
many families and many families are developing

00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:24.350
kitchen gardens to be, have more sustainable.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.730
Health cards are provided for youngsters.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.630
Here are leaders filling out health cards.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.900
There are home visits that are highly valued
by the children.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.309
In the book I of course talk about CHABHA.

00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:42.190
I also highlight a program in South Africa
called Isibindi.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:49.450
And there, the woman with the shirt of the
yellow letters on it is the young leader,

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:54.560
one of many, from the community who's been
trained whose assigned several families and

00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:00.440
she visits the family in-depth several times
a week teaching the children how to cook,

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:07.430
how to shop and encouraging them to be able
to take care of themselves.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:11.869
The CHABHA model which is represented over
here with one of our leaders and children

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:14.410
he's visiting.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:20.510
That model supports group kinds of activities
more than individual families.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.910
Hope lies in the workshops.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:35.510
And ultimately hope comes through children's
growing sense of they belong somewhere.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:43.760
The loneliness that occurs when they are first
orphaned can disappear as they learn that

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.030
belong with a group.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:49.309
They say that about their associations, "It's
like my family."

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:54.290
And the leaders, "They're like my parents."

00:38:54.290 --> 00:39:04.890
In societies such as many in Sub-Saharan Africa,
a person's self-worth comes less from who

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:10.050
they are as individuals and more from who
they are in connection with others.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:11.530
And you probably have heard the term Ubuntu.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:21.900
I'll read to you Nelson Mandela's words about
Ubuntu because I think it encapsulates what's

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.750
happening as these associations work with
the children.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:32.030
"In Africa we have a concept known as a Ubuntu
based on the recognition that we are only

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.180
people because of other people.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.900
We are all human and the HIV AIDS epidemic
affects us all in the end.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.010
If we discard the people who are dying from
AIDS then we can no longer call ourselves

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.040
people."

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:52.980
I think Mandela would agree that if we said
we discard the children of people who are

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.750
dying from AIDS then we can no longer call
ourselves people.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:04.940
There are two questions that I want to consider
at this point.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:11.059
One is whose responsibility is it to care
for these children?

00:40:11.059 --> 00:40:17.680
Ultimately of course the responsibility lies
in, with the African governments and agencies

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.690
and community organizations.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.780
I believe our role is to help them.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:32.970
CHABHA is a very small organization helping
grassroots projects in Rwanda and Burundi.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:36.230
We don't tell them what they need.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:40.000
We go there and we ask them, "What do you
need?"

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.349
And we negotiate that of course.

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:52.829
But ultimately they are the ones who are going
to provide the children the basics they need,

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:58.690
the psycho-social support that they get, and
the ability to grow up for the future and

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.390
be resilient.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:07.599
More and more African governments are urged
to attend to children.

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:15.850
And one report called Budgeting for Children
in Africa by a group scholars in Africa wrote

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:21.490
this, "There are many reasons why Africa should
invest heavily in children first and foremost

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.260
because it is the right thing to do.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:28.319
Because it's the only way Africa can catch
up with the rest of the world.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:33.790
Because investment in children and youth contributes
to democratic governance and social stability.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.079
And finally because without children society
will die.

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:42.680
So it is about rights, about society, about
economics, about good governance and about

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.740
our future place in the world."

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:51.710
And the children affected by HIV AIDS are
the ones who most need to be helped so that

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:58.420
that and be attended to by governments.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:07.040
Finally, sometimes people ask us and certainly
I know people wonder, "So what's the use of

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.780
a small project like CHABHA when the need
is so huge?"

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:18.330
CHABHA supports the projects that work with
somewhat less than 3,000 people.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.540
It's a drop in the budget of nearly 15 million
children.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:29.790
So, I turn to a story.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.450
Some of you may have heard it.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:36.720
Do you know the star fish story?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.780
It's kind of a metaphor.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.200
And I changed it.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:47.080
It's written, a wonderful book, I think I
have pages and pages of footnotes, but it's

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:55.799
the last one, Loren Eiseley, a book called
The Star Thrower.

00:42:55.799 --> 00:43:00.220
Anyways there are lots of stories but which
is one I adapted.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.720
"A man walking along the beach one day came
over a dune and saw spread as far as the eye

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.280
could see millions of starfish.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:11.720
Ceaselessly picking starfish up one by one
throwing them into the sea, the man asked

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.270
her "Why are you throwing them into the ocean
you'll never be able to get them all?"

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:22.170
And the young woman said "That's true but
the sun is high and the tide is running out

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:27.220
and I can save this one" and she threw another
into the sea, "And this one," and she threw

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.280
another one."

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:38.670
So that is a romantic story it has helped
us at times when we wonder our direction.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:45.599
I have only a short skit of a youngster's
playing in one of their gatherings.

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:49.960
But I think it's appropriate to stop here
and ask for questions or comments or thoughts

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.640
that you may have.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.059
[pause] Yes.

00:43:54.059 --> 00:43:56.480
&gt;&gt;Audience: [inaudible]

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:04.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Grannis: Oh, oh, take the microphone.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:10.210
&gt;&gt;Audience Male #1: Thank you.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:16.830
Well, you were saying about the impact of
the small organizations and I think that what

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:22.869
I've learned about, I've learned a lot about
the HIV AIDS epidemic and the various issues

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:31.579
from CHABHA's work, following it that you
guys are so close to the ground that you understand

00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:36.109
children who do get primary education still
have to bring a wad to have paper to school

00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:38.480
so if they don't get chased from school.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.720
So we need to address that problem.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.799
Not obviously in every individual school,
but at the upper level, the government and

00:44:44.799 --> 00:44:49.170
then you also need to get UNAIDS involved
and you also need to get human rights involved

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.820
in the country.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.690
But you need the on the ground contact to
really understand the impact it's having on

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:02.710
individuals because the large organizations
can't really understand that, but not the

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.710
small.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:04.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Grannis: Absolutely.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:11.900
I saw a TV program soon after my last trip
of many to Rwanda and it was Partners in Health.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.440
Have you ever heard of them?

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.550
Do wonderful work.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.550
Okay?

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:21.069
I'm not, but they announced that in Rwanda
there's universal primary education.

00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:27.349
And I thought, "How do they not know that
that's, it's not universal."

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:32.859
So even a project that is in the country may
not know about children.

00:45:32.859 --> 00:45:40.930
Jesse who's speaking was at that first workshop
that I told about when everyone agreed you

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:44.160
couldn't get HIV from hugging and so forth.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.130
And he has since been doing a great deal of
work including work I've written about in

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:53.980
here with HIV prevention in high schools.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.550
And now takes groups of young people to Rwanda.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.010
I don't know if we have time for you to.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:09.740
His program in high schools is, the youngsters
build their own dramas around real stories

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.970
that they know.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.740
And so, it's like the prevention workshop.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.599
It's very person to person.

00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:20.369
It isn't some far away story about a disease.

00:46:20.369 --> 00:46:22.390
It's what they know and have experienced.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.890
Do you have a question?

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:32.359
&gt;&gt; Audience Male #2: How are these associations
funded and are they cross-tribal or with a

00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:33.359
single tribe?

00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:35.049
&gt;&gt; Dr. Grannis: Oh my goodness.

00:46:35.049 --> 00:46:39.170
Let me deal with the first one.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:48.089
The large one, the workshop they had formed
from young adults who had lost their parents

00:46:48.089 --> 00:46:52.740
both in genocide in Rwanda and from HIV AIDS.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.119
And they were raising their own siblings.

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:56.920
They were the oldest in their families.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:03.450
And they got together to help one another
and then more and more children came and then,

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:04.640
they formed the associations.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.190
They had no money.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:11.660
When I first met them in 2004, they had a
tiny little office, maybe three pieces of

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.700
paper.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.560
They had some benches and they had an old
desk.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.270
And UNICEF had come and said thank you and
left and not helped and no one gave them any

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.120
money.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.980
Because how could such a group write a proposal?

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:33.940
I mean, so we took a risk with them and we've
been working with them ever since.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.600
Another project, the one in [inaudible] in
Nymata outside of Kigali.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.329
I have a quote in here somewhere but I won't
look for it because it'll take too long.

00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:47.000
But the leader said, "We have a association.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.230
We work with the children.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:54.869
We went to the district office and asked them
for money and they didn't give us any.

00:47:54.869 --> 00:47:56.440
But then we heard about Eric and CHABHA.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.150
So they called Eric who was our country director
and they called Eric up and Eric went out

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.319
there.

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:04.070
Actually let me tell you about that story
in funding.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:08.990
We're talking about a very little money that
goes a long, long way.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:13.430
Eric went with the equivalent of $2,000 in
his pocket.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:18.400
And he had asked the leaders to do certain
things that they needed to do to organize.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.250
He went out and they hadn't done it.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.580
And you know Eric.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:27.599
He just pulled up the money and put its back
in his pocket and said sorry you're not getting

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:28.599
the money.

00:48:28.599 --> 00:48:32.430
This was to get more children in school to
do more health work.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:35.640
You're not going to get it until you do these
things.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.290
They watched him go away in his funny little
old car.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.750
Then they came back to town within a week
they had done it.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.760
They got the money.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.549
They were a wonderful project too.

00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:47.010
They really are.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.880
They do wonderful things with children.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.890
Yeah.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:57.340
The other question is a very big question
in Rwanda and Burundi both where both Hutu

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:03.420
and Tutsi groups have they experienced genocide.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:11.350
Rwanda in a very short amount of time and
Burundi over many years.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:19.359
Nobody in, nobody mentions a person's Tribal
or ethnic identity.

00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:22.910
It's really against the law I would say in
Rwanda.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.480
In Burundi I don't know.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.490
I don't hear about it.

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:31.920
I think that as we have found out and I didn't
know this for years, because it's not something

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.390
you talk about that most of the children in
the projects are Hutu.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:40.240
Well, most of the population is Hutu, so that
makes sense.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.850
And some of the leaders are Tutsi.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.390
Not all, by any means.

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.650
Isn't that correct would you say?

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:53.069
David Loewenuguth is the Executive Director
of CHABHA.

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:59.100
He spent nearly a year as a volunteer there
and before that.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.100
So he really knows.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.820
&gt;&gt; David: Well, thank you Dr. Susanna.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:07.349
It was a really wonderful presentation.

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:11.660
The and Jesse could probably answer to this
question a little bit more.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:21.390
The government of Rwanda is focused on really
transitioning to "We are one.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:32.970
We are Rwanda." and leaving behind the tribal
history but that they all recognize is going

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.760
to take generations to accomplish.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:43.630
&gt;&gt;Dr. Grannis: It's very complicated about
its Rwanda's moving forward incredible pace

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:49.289
and there are people saying the human rights
problem is something to be concerned about.

00:50:49.289 --> 00:50:51.789
How does one that is not part of it know?

00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:55.690
I can't claim to, certainly.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.920
So looks like we're finished.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.400
&gt;&gt; Female Audience # 1: Yes [inaudible].

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Grannis: Well, this is five minutes
and I don't know if you have five minutes.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:09.230
It's kind of a silly skit of youngsters and
a gathering with paint on their faces nothing

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.140
to do with the skit.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:16.390
I'll just tell you what it is because you
all have to go back to work, right?

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:21.770
The girl walking in in the jeans is pretending
to be the teacher and the children on the

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:23.599
bench are her students.

00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:24.710
And I'll just show you.

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:31.869
They do a little musical number and they get
her to do the music.

00:51:31.869 --> 00:51:33.700
And then the principal comes.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.640
And she is very mad then she does the music.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:40.580
[video plays]
[children talking in video]

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:59.660
You hear their English?

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.670
She's telling them how to behave when she
leaves the room, okay?

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:10.609
Let me move it ahead.

00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:14.549
Okay.

00:52:14.549 --> 00:53:14.119
This is, boy, I went backwards.

00:53:14.119 --> 00:53:21.780
Okay.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.760
She's starts.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:34.400
Here's the principal.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:54:04.520
[children talking in video]

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:10.400
Here's the district superintendent.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:30.890
[children talking in video]

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:46.250
Well, that's it.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:57.020
The 
minister of education comes and he's got,

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.319
it's Abdul and he's got a suit on.

00:54:59.319 --> 00:55:06.920
And he has put a pillow in his stomach and
he's standing there.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.020
And then ultimately he dances too and the
place comes apart.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.710
And one of the leaders turned to me and said
she didn't approve of that at all.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:23.369
I thought you know when young people run an
association, they know that children should

00:55:23.369 --> 00:55:24.950
be having fun.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:28.790
And the children come to the gatherings have
fun with the leaders.

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:30.810
Anyway, thank you very much.

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:35.710
I'm glad to have been here.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:37.119
[Applause]

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:38.519
[Inaudible]

00:55:38.519 --> 00:55:48.359
&gt;&gt; Announcer: Let me turn this off here.

00:55:48.359 --> 00:55:51.180
One second.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.990
Here, great.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.390
Beautiful.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:56:03.829
Let me turn the monitor off.
