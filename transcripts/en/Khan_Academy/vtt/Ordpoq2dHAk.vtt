00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.250
I want to follow up the last
video on the Sn2 ring opening

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.300
of the cyclohexene oxide.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.560
Because the way I explained
it, it might have been a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.890
little non-intuitive.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.800
Because when we first learned
about Sn2 and Sn1 reactions,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.110
we said, well if you have an
aprotic solvent with an OK

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.690
leaving group, but a really good
nucleophile, you'll have

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.940
an Sn2 reaction.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.090
But if you have a protic solvent
with an excellent

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:39.130
leaving group and a weak
nucelophile, then that would

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.860
lead you to an Sn1 reaction.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.900
All of the ingredients that I
showed you in the last video

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.250
actually were more in
this direction.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.320
This was actually an acid
catalyzed reaction, so it was

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.430
definitely protic.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.020
And then this ring is
strained right here.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.840
This epoxide ring.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.700
And we already protonated this
oxygen, so it was a good

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.820
leaving group.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
And clearly, the water, the
H2O right here, is a weak

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.150
nucleophile.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.940
So if we just went off of the
checklist that we learned

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.750
about when we just explored the
differences between Sn1

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.270
and Sn2 reactions, we probably
would have predicted an Sn1

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.980
reaction here.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.450
We probably would have said the
first step would have been

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.280
that this bond just broke on
its own, and this guy just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.750
left, forming a carbocation.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.330
And only then would the water,
the weak nucleophile, would

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.510
have attacked the carbon.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.920
In that case, it could have
attacked from either side.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.710
Because all of a sudden it would
lose its handedness,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.670
this carbon right here.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.130
But everything I've read-- and
I've actually never performed

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710
this reaction in the
chemistry lab.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.680
But everything I've read
says that this is the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.360
reaction that occurs.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.380
That you actually have this,
I guess you could call it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160
stereospecificity.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.150
The trans version is actually
what predominates.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.730
And actually what is
going on is an Sn2.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.130
So my best explanation is that
this is really more of, you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.520
could call it an Sn2
like reaction.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640
Because it really meets the
checklist more for an Sn1 in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.270
terms of what the
reactions are.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.160
But because the end product
is actually selective, you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.090
actually end up with the trans,
as opposed to both the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.290
cis and the trans.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.630
We're assuming that an Sn2 type

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.270
reaction must have occurred.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.540
But I really wanted to
make this clear.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.870
Because it really kind of goes
against the grain of our

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.370
checklist of predicting whether
an Sn1 or an Sn2

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.150
reaction would occur.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.730
The reason why, at least in my
mind, I think that the Sn1

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.930
reaction maybe didn't occur is,
in order for it to occur,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.570
this carbocation
needs to form.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.370
And that carbocation
is secondary.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.530
It's not tertiary.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.550
So it's maybe just not
quite stable enough.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.880
Now Sn1 reactions can
occur with epoxides.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.380
I'll show you two examples.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.450
So if I have-- let me draw
two examples here.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.890
So this is ethane.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.500
If I just did a double bond
here, it would be ethene.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.640
But if I have these bonded
to an oxygen,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.403
this is ethylene oxide.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.100
And once again, if this was an
alkene, it would be called

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.260
either ethene-- that's actually
the official name,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.780
but some people call
it ethylene.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.880
And so the common name
for this is ethylene.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.300
Actually I spelled it wrong.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.960
It's ethylene, not with
the-- ethylene oxide.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.930
I've even seen on the web a
couple of times, people call

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.410
this ethene oxide.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.140
Which, in some ways, would
be more consistent.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.920
Let's say on one hand, we have
ethene oxide, and let's say on

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.060
the other hand, we
have something

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.310
that looks like this.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.130
Let me try my best to draw it.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.680
We have something that
looks like this.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.180
And so this part, if we just
look at the main chain.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.970
You could either view
this as a propane.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.100
Or having three carbons.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.170
1, 2, 3.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.030
And then a methyl breaking
off of it.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.310
But this y shape, where you
have four carbons here, is

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.625
usually called isobutyl.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:14.500
So you could call this
isobutylene oxide.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.399
So let's call this isobutylene
oxide.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.149
That's what you're more
likely to see.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.279
Isobutylene oxide.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.860
And remember, they
just pretend like

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.200
this is a double bond.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.950
That's where we get the
isobutylene oxide.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.240
But then to make it clear that
it's really not a double bond,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.660
that there's really an oxygen
in there, it's really not an

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.850
alkene, you put the
oxide there.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.680
Now let's think about the
different reactions that might

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.270
occur if we have a nucleophile
in either situation.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.470
So if we have a nucleophile
over here for the ethylene

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.820
oxide, either of these carbons
are primary carbons.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.430
So if you have a carbon
right here.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.830
Let me draw all of its bonds.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.930
It's bonded to one
other carbon.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.840
It's bonded to a hydrogen, and
another hydrogen right there.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.380
So it's a primary carbon.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.110
It would not be a stable
carbocation.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.530
So in this case, you would
definitely predict that an Sn2

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.310
reaction would have to occur
with this epoxide.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.900
That the nucleophile would
attack back here.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.470
And then this electron would be
taken back by the oxygen.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.750
And that would open the ring.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.900
So this would be an
Sn2 situation.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.220
And in my mind, this
is pretty clear.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.720
But in this situation,
you do have a primary

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.500
carbon right here.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.190
It's only bonded to
one other carbon.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.850
But over here, you have
a tertiary carbon.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.460
It's bonded to 1,
2, 3 carbons.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.390
So this would be a stable
carbocation.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.980
So in this circumstance, you
would actually expect that

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.130
this epoxide ring is so
strained, that the first step

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.410
is that the oxygen would
just take the electron.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.530
The oxygen would just
take the electron.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.480
And then you're left
with something

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.620
that looks like this.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.380
Let me do it in the same
colors, so it's clear.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.640
You would be left
with something

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.680
that looks like this.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.280
And now, since it took the
electron, just like that.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.240
Or actually, maybe let
me take a step back.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.450
It has to be very good
leaving group.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.430
It wouldn't necessarily just
take the electron right there.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.660
The first step in order to make
this a good leaving group

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.720
would be if you maybe had a
water around, or something

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.260
that it could take, or some type
of acid, that it could

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.740
take a hydrogen proton from.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.120
So the first step is it would
take a hydrogen proton.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.170
Let me do this a little
bit neater.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.600
It would take a hydrogen
proton.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.530
So it would give an electron to
a hydrogen proton, so that

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.560
it becomes a good
leaving group.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.150
So now our molecule
looks like this.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.910
Do it in the same colors.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.130
Our molecule will
look like that.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.960
That's our carbon.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.720
And now this is an oxygen
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.510
And now this has a
positive charge.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.880
This now will just be a water.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.920
I won't draw it anymore.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.070
And now this is an excellent
leaving group.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.060
Tertiary carbon.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.330
This is classic Sn1.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.830
Classic Sn1 reaction.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.270
So this guy can essentially
leave. And then we are left

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.750
with down here-- let me
draw it over here.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.580
We're left with something that
will look like this.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.930
We have our carbon
bonded, not to

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.300
hydrogens, to other carbons.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.230
So these are carbons
over here.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.960
And then this carbon is
bonded to this OH.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.750
We now have an alcohol.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.390
And this is now a carbocation.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.900
And now this is ready to be
attacked by even a weak

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.330
nucleophile.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.540
Even a weak nucleophile
could attack this.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.220
So when you have a tertiary
carbon in your epoxide ring,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100
look for an Sn1 reaction.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.470
But if you have anything less,
as far as I can tell, based on

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.010
the reactions that I've looked
at in multiple books-- if you

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.530
have secondary or primary
carbons, it seems like Sn2 is

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.860
going to be more likely to
break your epoxide ring.
