[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.466
-Material design is alive,
and it lives in a world a lot

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:14.332
like ours, a world that's
responsive, natural, aware,

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:16.320
and intentional.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.480
Material design uses responsive
animation to create energy.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.020
When you take an action,
feedback is immediate,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.160
and it never keeps you waiting.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.030
Motion adapts to the distance
an element needs to travel,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.050
focusing on how fast
something needs to move,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.870
rather than how long it
should take to get there.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.680
Motion should feel
natural, moving the way

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.750
things do in the real world.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200
Nothing should
instantly start or stop.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.600
Elements and motion have
momentum and take time

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.800
to speed up and slow down.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.621
They respond to
forces like gravity,

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.860
moving in curved paths,
instead of in straight lines.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.942
Material is also aware
of the world around it.

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:54.400
The way something
enters the screen

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.005
can affect the movement
of everything else.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.900
Elements can push other
elements out of the way,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.126
or attract them.

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:04.799
Above all, material
isn't random.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.390
There's a purpose
behind every animation.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.830
Motion guides you.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.990
It keeps you focused
on what's important

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.670
and makes sure you
don't get lost.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.110
It also hints at how
something might react,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.840
even before it's triggered.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.040
Whether your brand
is fun and playful,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.590
or serious and straightforward,
using the motion principles

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.190
for material design can help
you produce a quick, clear,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.478
and cohesive experience.

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:32.442

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.645
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.890
Thank you.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.400
Hi.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.191
I'm John Schlemmer.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.430
I'm the motion lead on
the Material Design team

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.886
here at Google.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.260
I authored the
new motion section

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.385
that can be found in the
material design guidelines

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.016
at design.google.com.

00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:57.790
And before that, I also led
the motion efforts for apps

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.005
like Inbox and Calendar.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.540
So I'm here to talk to
you about motion design.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.800
Motion is becoming more and
more prominent in apps today.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
And it's really one of
the key giveaways of what

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.341
makes a high quality app.

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.340
And it's also one of the
main components of what

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.775
makes material, material.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.550
So we touched on some motion
in our design guidelines

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.685
when we introduced material
at I/O about two years ago.

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.560
Now, there are over a
million material design

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.900
apps in the Play Store.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.360
And it's really exciting to
see how designers and engineers

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.640
have been using the system.

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:40.180
These new motion guidelines
that were released last week

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.760
go really in-depth
and, hopefully,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.660
provide solutions to
many of the challenges

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.000
that you've been
facing around motion.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.875
Advanced animation in
UI is still, generally,

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.264
a pretty new thing.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:51.680
And we really wanted to try
to capture what works and what

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.920
doesn't.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.380
It's really hard to
describe or pinpoint

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.500
what exactly doesn't feel right
when a transition isn't working

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.320
the way you thought it would.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.260
What's worse, motion can be
abused, just like Photoshop

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.000
filters.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's really easy to go
overboard or spend time

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.982
implementing the wrong thing.

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.690
And that's what these
new material motion

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.940
guidelines will help you with.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.220
We wanted to find a way to
think about how material

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.830
moves, while, at the
same time just thinking

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.440
about general good UX practices,
when it comes to motion.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.940
These guidelines can really
help you get your branded motion

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.750
to feel right-- suggested
durations, easing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.110
curves for different
kinds of movement,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.220
how to choreograph shared
elements between views,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.390
and how material interacts
with other material, and so on.

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:41.640
A common misconception
about motion

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.340
is that it's just about polish.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.240
And it's not really
fair to group all motion

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.664
into just the polish category.

00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:50.080
There are certain
levels of motion

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.160
that are key components
to making a great app,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.910
and it does so much more
than just polish it.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.600
It can guide users
to the next view.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.590
It can convey hierarchy
and spatial relationships

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.420
between both objects
on and off screen.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.670
It can help foreshadow what
a particular gesture might

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.300
trigger before you
actually trigger it.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.090
It can help distract
you, in a good way,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.680
from things like
loading or fetching

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.670
content, things you don't
really want to have noticed.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.980
And of course, it can
add delight and polish.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.610
But by doing that,
all of these things

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.165
together just make a feeling
of a really high quality app.

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:29.540
And if this is
done right, you'll

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.540
be left with a really
solid animation experience

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.612
throughout your app
or family of apps.

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:37.820
So let's take a look at the
Google Calendar animation

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.096
for opening and
closing an event.

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:41.720
Those of you that
probably use Calendar

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.534
will be pretty
familiar with this.

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:44.950
A lot of you
probably don't really

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.970
think about this anymore.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.595
It's just opening
and closing an event.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:49.934
Happens all the time.

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:52.350
But there are a lot of really
subtle things happening here

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.830
to help you understand
hierarchy and order,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.760
to make sure you don't
get lost and using it.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.969
What if this didn't have
an animation at all?

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.760
Without an animation
here, it's really hard

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.670
to tell what was triggered,
where you ended up,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.510
and where the view
that you just left

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.462
lives in relation to this
new view that's there.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:12.920
Loading also stands
out a lot more,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.077
because there's nothing
really there to mask it.

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:18.160
All right, so this is a
pretty extreme comparison.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.701
So let's find an
in-between solution.

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:25.400
Let's look at what this would be
using just a default transition

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.733
and not really taking into
account the new principles we

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:30.270
have.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.530
Sure, it feels a little
better, but it's still not

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.290
really communicating anything.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.677
The view just kind of
slides in from the bottom.

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.885
There's still no relationship
between the object that

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.580
was tapped and the
new view coming in.

00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:45.200
There are a lot of subtleties
in animation techniques used

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.930
to get this calendar transition
to feel just smooth and right.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.242
And today, I'd like to go
over these motion principles.

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:54.700
I'll loop back to this Calendar
transition towards the end,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.850
just to show exactly where
these principles come into play,

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.220
and just how they were
used as building blocks

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.260
to create the
transition we landed on.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.064
So let's dive into
the new guidelines.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:08.730
When writing these
guidelines, we really

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.786
wanted to dig deep and find
out how material moves.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:13.660
And as you saw in the
video at the beginning,

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.770
material in motion
is responsive,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:25.110
its natural, it's aware,
and it's intentional.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.390
And all of these are
definitely loaded words.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.737
There's a lot of meaning
behind each one of them,

00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:31.570
but they're all equally
important principles

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.982
that make up material.

00:06:32.982 --> 00:06:34.690
And I'd like to briefly
go over each one.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.010
First, material is responsive.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.970
And responsive can also mean
a lot of things, especially

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.220
in the world of responsive
design and different screen

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.860
sizes.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.559
It's a pretty overloaded term.

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.725
But when it comes to motion,
it means it immediately

00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.860
and quickly responds
to your touch.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.420
In material, this response is
in the form of an ink ripple

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.520
and a change in elevation,
like when you tap a button.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.430
The ink ripple forms
in the exact location

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.298
that you interacted with it.

00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:08.600
And the element's shadow
signifies that it's actually

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.545
rising to your touch.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:10.760
It's like a form of response.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.410
It also means new
surfaces can quickly

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.380
be created from that
precise touch location

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.490
too, like menus when
you tap an icon.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.880
And it never keeps you waiting.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.721
People use our apps
to get things done.

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.420
The example on the
right is actually

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.950
something you want to avoid.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.140
If it takes too long, it'll
look really old, really fast.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.820
To give you an idea,
typical transitions

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.160
we've used on mobile devices
have about a 300 to 350

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.247
millisecond duration.

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:45.080
That's pretty quick.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.976
That's a third of a second.

00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:49.350
But it's also not
a duration that

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.110
should be used for everything.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.060
It totally depends on how
far something needs to travel

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.800
or how much change is.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.300
Tablet screens, for
example may need

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.230
to have a slightly
longer duration,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.980
like 400 to 450
milliseconds, to make up

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.610
for that overall
greater distance

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.985
that it actually
needs to travel.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.950
Smaller screens,
like on a watch,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.870
obviously need to move
really short distances.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.470
It's a pretty small screen.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.065
These are often in the range
of 150 to 200 milliseconds.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.580
On web, durations
and animations,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.524
in general, are treated
a little differently.

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:26.440
There's a general
perception on web for things

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.100
to just be lightning fast.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.747
And it's because, when
you navigate websites,

00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:32.580
there's usually no
transition that takes you

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.080
from one page to the next page.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.600
Most websites aren't cohesive
app-like experiences.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.386
So when you do have one of
those cohesive experiences,

00:08:42.386 --> 00:08:44.010
you still want your
transitions to feel

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.968
like they belong on the
web, like they're still

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:48.420
lightning fast.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.860
Inboxes on web, for example,
uses 150 millisecond duration

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.085
in its main opening and
closing email transition.

00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:57.205
Well, on mobile, it actually
uses 300 millisecond.

00:08:57.205 --> 00:08:59.495
That means the web durations
are twice as fast, even

00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:00.620
though the screen's bigger.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.970
Sometimes, animations need
to be modified a bit too,

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.230
to account for these
faster transitions.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.585
Implying an object
needs to make a big move

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:14.530
or expands into a
bigger card is actually

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.050
different than
physically drawing

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.114
each frame of that animation.

00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:20.530
There's a bit of
magic that motion

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.859
can imply that kind of
lets your imagination fill

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:23.900
in the in-between frames.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.277
Another thing to keep in mind
is staggering content in a view.

00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:33.610
Staggering a list of grid
items as they travel on screen

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.850
is a pretty common practice.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.290
And it can look
really good, too.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.120
But each item should have
a very, very short delay

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.126
between entrances.

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.560
You definitely do not
want to wait for each item

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.020
to finish entering, before
getting the next one in there.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.167
Otherwise, especially
for longer list items,

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.500
you're going to be waiting a
long time for that last one

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.080
to populate.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.920
We found it's best to begin
each staggered transition no

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.630
more than 20 to 25
milliseconds apart.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.210
It's short, but it makes sense.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.970
And I'll get more
into staggering orders

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.150
and choreography later on.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.800
So let's look at
the next principle.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.200
Material is natural.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.950
The movement of
material is inspired

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.180
by forces in our real world, so
things like gravity, friction,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.440
momentum, and so on.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.316
Momentum is a pretty big one.

00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:28.690
Nothing in our
world can actually

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.200
instantly start or stop.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.166
It depends on weight
and surface friction.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.040
So it only makes sense
for on-screen material

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.469
to follow these same rules.

00:10:38.469 --> 00:10:40.510
This is where our fine-tuned
easing curves really

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.170
come into play.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.920
Easing is used to add
acceleration and deceleration

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.260
to any type of movement.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.440
What's more, our easing curves
are actually asymmetrical.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.881
This means that each end
of the curve is different.

00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:55.880
Let's see how this affects
some of the curves we

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880
cover in the guidelines.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.500
The material standard
curve is used for objects

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.630
moving from one
on-screen location

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.620
to another on-screen location,
and also transforming

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.250
from one size to another size.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.290
Easing is at both
ends of the curve,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.607
but it accelerates a little
bit faster than it slows down.

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:17.690
This gives the feeling
that it's really energetic.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.030
It's really excited to
get to the next spot.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.670
It leaps into
motion, but it still

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.430
needs to take some
time to slow down.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.820
The deceleration curve is used
for objects entering the screen

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.160
from an offscreen location.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.549
The acceleration is instant.

00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:35.840
Since this is the part that
actually happens offscreen,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.620
you don't see it.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.954
The gradual deceleration matches
that of the standard curve.

00:11:41.954 --> 00:11:44.370
This gives the illusion that
it's zooming in at full speed

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.767
from somewhere off the screen.

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:47.600
And we don't really
care where it came from,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.850
we just care where it ends up.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.000
The acceleration curve is used
for objects exiting the screen.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.530
The acceleration is gradual,
just like the standard curve.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.265
But the deceleration is instant,
since this is now the part

00:12:02.265 --> 00:12:03.080
that you don't see.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.690
This gives the illusion
that it's zooming out

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.690
of the screen at full
speed, and we don't really

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.523
care where it stops.

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.550
Another concept
we're introducing

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.140
is what we call arc motion.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.780
Forces like gravity can affect
how an object moves up or down.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.220
This results in objects moving
in slightly curved paths,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.402
instead of in straight lines.

00:12:27.402 --> 00:12:28.860
Doing this makes
diagonal movements

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.125
feel a little less robotic
and a little more natural.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.980
This concept is also represented
in transforming surfaces.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.180
So by slightly offsetting
the width and height

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.830
transformation, you get the same
kind of curved expansion path.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.855
And when objects inside of
the surface use the same path,

00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:50.430
it results in a really nicely
choreographed transition.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.102
And I'll get to that in a bit.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.220
Next, material is aware.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.120
It's aware of objects around
it, behind it, in front of it,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.257
and even within it.

00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:06.340
This allows for a really
nice choreographed motion

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.000
that involve a lot of different
UI elements at the same time.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.154
As elements
transition into view,

00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:14.820
they take into account
the relationships

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.700
with other objects
around them, and they

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.940
move in a way that
demonstrates this hierarchy.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.410
This kind of connected movement
gives a really nice story

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.590
about where these objects
live and, hopefully,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.131
a better understanding of how
the app is actually structured.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.190
Surfaces can also push other
surfaces out of the way.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.640
So if you're familiar with
material's elevation story,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.290
it describes how each object
is at a different elevation.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.470
So it only makes sense
that, if two cards are

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.257
on the same elevation, and
one happens to expand or move,

00:13:47.257 --> 00:13:49.340
it would actually need to
push that other card out

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.070
of the way to make room for it.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.790
Either that, or it would need
to rise above that other card,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.591
so it doesn't need to
push it out of the way.

00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:00.420
The important thing
to note here is

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.310
material can't pass
through other material.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.661
It knows it needs to do
something to make room for it

00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:06.160
to move.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.190
Another concept of awareness
is a form of magnetism.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.850
This can be a really
powerful mechanism

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.430
in interaction design.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.510
And it can really help
define relationships

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.950
and signify whether
or not objects

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.491
are able to interact
with each other.

00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:28.270
In this example, that circle is
able to interact with the other

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.835
smaller circles around it.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:33.860
And as it approaches each
one, they're able to attach.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.430
Once they move
away, they detach.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.130
It kind of makes you
feel like the UI is

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.200
doing its best to understand
what you want to do.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.270
So last, let's get
into intention.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.370
Everything material
does is intentional.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.184
Every movement has a purpose.

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:55.725
And its purpose is
to guide you, it's

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:58.141
to make sure you don't get
lost when you're using the app.

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.380
The best way to do
this, we've found,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.525
is to have common shared
elements between views.

00:15:04.525 --> 00:15:07.180
If you're animating from
a transition from point A

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.860
to point B, there's
more often than not

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.460
a common shared element
that's present in both views.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.730
In this case, we have the
avatar in the collapsed card

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.420
and also in the expanded card.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.610
All the other content
changes, but the avatar

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.332
is what stays consistent here.

00:15:26.332 --> 00:15:27.790
So when we make
this transition, we

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.780
keep this visible at all times.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.040
The avatar acts as
the focal point,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.530
and it guides you
to the next view,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.690
right where your
attention should end up.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.440
So when we pair this with the
asymmetrical width and height

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.100
transformation of
the card's surface

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.470
and add that curved
path to the avatar,

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.130
we get this really nice,
natural expansion and collapse.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.990
So as a warning,
though, it's really easy

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.730
to go overboard here.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.130
What if you have a lot of
elements in both views?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.620
If you have too
many, your focus is

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.275
pulled in 100
different directions,

00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:04.275
and it's really hard to
pinpoint what exactly it

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:07.040
was you needed to follow.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.095
It's OK not to keep
every element consistent.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.470
And the example on the left
is a good way to handle this.

00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:19.410
So we touched on staggering
the entrance of elements

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.040
a little earlier.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.330
We talked about how to quickly
stagger multiple elements.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.190
But the order in which
they appear on screen

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.166
is just as important.

00:16:28.166 --> 00:16:29.990
The idea is to
guide your attention

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.375
in one fluid direction.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.630
A single column with stagger
is pretty straightforward.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.770
Top to bottom usually
makes the most sense here.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.910
There's usually not a reason
you should veer from this.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.940
Changing this up feels
pretty unnatural,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.870
and you're scattered
in different directions

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.549
throughout the stagger.

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.590
It also doesn't really
help your hierarchy story.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.020
Having everything appear
on screen at the same time

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.020
isn't exactly that
much better either.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.540
Staggering grid views is
a little more complicated.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.140
It might not actually be
what you'd expect at first.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.005
If you have a grid view with
multiple columns and rows,

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:10.380
you want to look
at the treatment

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.614
of the grid as a
whole and present it

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:15.260
in a nice diagonal motion,
instead of introducing row

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.760
by row.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.800
If you stagger an entire row
before starting the next one,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.286
you get this kind of zigzag
of attention guidance.

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.869
Plus, it actually takes longer,
if you have a pretty big grid,

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.390
to get to that
bottom right corner.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.100
If you stagger from the top
left to the bottom right

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.971
of the whole grid, you get this
really nice constant direction

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.845
from start to finish.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.210
Another material
intention is to let

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.680
you know what's going to
happen before it happens.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.000
This comes in handy
with gestures a lot.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.170
For example, if you're using an
app where your key interaction

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.857
is to swipe things
away, what happens

00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:56.190
when you run into an item
that you can't actually swipe?

00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:00.480
You want to add
resistance to that item

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.420
to signify that
it's not available.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.230
Resistance has to do
with how much that

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.910
object moves in relation
to how far you drag it.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.650
That way, the user
immediately knows

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.980
what they're trying to do
isn't available here, even

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.430
before they complete the swipe.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.325
The items that can be
swiped have no resistance

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:22.257
and are much easier
to move around.

00:18:22.257 --> 00:18:24.590
It's kind of like it's inviting
you to interact with it.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.130
So those are the four
principles of material motion:

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.409
responsive, natural,
aware, and intentional.

00:18:35.409 --> 00:18:36.950
By following these
guidelines, you're

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.305
left with transitions that
have a few key characteristics.

00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:41.930
And this is actually
a really great way

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.429
to judge whether
or not you ended up

00:18:43.429 --> 00:18:45.310
doing the right thing
for your motion design.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.440
The transitions are quick.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.660
Things happen fast, so the
user doesn't have to wait.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.480
The animation on the left users
our suggested durations, which

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.390
is about 350 milliseconds.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.860
The one on the right, doesn't.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.770
It's about 600 milliseconds.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.189
It still looks nice,
but it's pretty slow.

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.730
It's only a third
of a second longer,

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.340
but you can see how
big of a difference

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.923
it makes, especially if you're
doing this over and over again.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.526
Next, the transitions are clear.

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.650
This plays on the guided
focus and natural behavior

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.614
of material a little bit.

00:19:26.614 --> 00:19:29.030
In the animation on the left,
you can really easily follow

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.590
the path of the expanding card.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.630
The one on the right isn't
really that easy to follow.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.960
It's fast, so it follows
that, but your focus

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.140
is shifted in like
every direction.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.560
Providing a clear focus
really goes a long way here.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.880
Lastly, the transitions
are cohesive.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.190
So here are three apps that
do very different things,

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.290
but all of them follow
these motion guidelines.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.290
Motion can really
unify experiences

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.720
throughout a family of apps
and make them feel related.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.940
So let's go back to
that calendar transition

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.710
from the beginning.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.350
Now that we know what we're
looking for, we can identify

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.280
this transition and why it
feels right, and compare it

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.630
to a simple slide-in,
or no transition at all.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.230
First, it's responsive.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.790
We have that ink splash,
signifying that we tapped it.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.130
And we have that nice shadow
coming from behind the chip

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.004
to signify elevation.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.510
Next, it's natural.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.225
So we have these nice easing
curves and arc motion going

00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:38.350
throughout that transition.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.880
Third, it's aware.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.390
It knows that it needs to
lift above the other chips

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.230
to make room for it.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.730
But it also knows what is at
that new elevation it just

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.770
moved to, like that
app bar at the top.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.720
It collides with the app
bar to push it off screen,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.165
and it pulls it back down
when it collapses again.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.190
Last, it's intentional.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.050
We use a shared element, the
event image in this case,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.794
to guide you to the
top of the next view,

00:21:15.794 --> 00:21:17.460
exactly where you
should end up looking.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.992
It completes the
story of hierarchy.

00:21:22.992 --> 00:21:24.450
And the other
objects around it are

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.116
choreographed in a way that kind
of follows this motion with it.

00:21:30.447 --> 00:21:32.780
So that's how these principles
built our view transition

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.330
in Calendar.

00:21:36.085 --> 00:21:38.710
But let's not forget the polish
details I talked about earlier.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.494
These are still important.

00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:43.660
Add in some animation where
the user might enjoy it,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.734
or might not expect it,
like changing the icon

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:47.900
of a button when you tap it.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.000
Reaching Inbox 0 is a
pretty big achievement,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.894
so let's make a big
deal about it, right?

00:21:55.894 --> 00:21:57.560
Maybe it'll encourage
you to keep it up,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.935
which is, coincidentally, how
we want you to use the app.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.430
Or maybe you want to call
out a new feature in an app,

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.045
like adding pit stops to Maps.

00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:09.670
And you really want to show off
all of the different things you

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.750
can do with it, without having
a bunch of paragraphs of text

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.804
to explain it.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.510
Error states are another
really fun place to do this.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.760
So an error is never really
something you want to see.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.877
But honestly, this kind of
makes you feel better about it.

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:32.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:34.500
So with all that said, I'm
going to wrap up a little early.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.583
I encourage you to check
out the motion guidelines

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:37.614
at design.google.com.

00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:39.680
They're found in the
material design resources

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.930
when you go there.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.060
It covers everything I talked
about today and a lot more.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.421
And I'm really excited to see
what everybody comes up with.

00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:49.170
If you'd like to have
a chat about motion,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.550
or anything else
design-related for that matter,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.420
there's a material design
sandbox south of here,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.605
in that direction.

00:22:55.605 --> 00:22:57.230
I'm going to head
over there right now.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.314
But it's the end
of the day, so I

00:22:59.314 --> 00:23:01.480
don't think we're going to
do anymore reviews today.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.870
But I am going to be there,
along with my other co-workers,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.992
Thursday and Friday.

00:23:07.992 --> 00:23:09.700
And since we're there
for the whole show,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.990
giving design reviews, I
figured it's a great place

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.930
to have a conversation, instead
of having a formal Q&amp;A here.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.670
So I definitely
encourage you to come by,

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.253
if there any questions you want
to have answered about motion.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.860
And also, congratulations
on surviving your first day

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.690
at I/O. Right?

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.280
Thanks, so much.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.250
