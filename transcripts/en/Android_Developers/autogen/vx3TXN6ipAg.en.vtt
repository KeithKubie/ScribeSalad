now snack bars are like a coordinator

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:00.149
now snack bars are like a coordinator
 

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:03.800
now snack bars are like a coordinator
layout friendly toast message so your

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:03.810
layout friendly toast message so your
 

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.840
layout friendly toast message so your
toast message kind of shows up

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:05.850
toast message kind of shows up

some technical difficulties so I had to
 

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.220
some technical difficulties so I had to
reboot my computer when a dyno I was

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:13.930
right so the way that you make a snack
 

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.760

bar is similar to a toast message you

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:17.770
bar is similar to a toast message you
 

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.500
bar is similar to a toast message you
have your before this you will have done

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:22.510
have your before this you will have done
 

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.840
have your before this you will have done
a get view by ID for your snack bar or

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:24.850
a get view by ID for your snack bar or
 

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.910
a get view by ID for your snack bar or
if you're using a butter knife or

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920
if you're using a butter knife or
 

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.720
if you're using a butter knife or
something like that somehow to get the

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:30.730
something like that somehow to get the
 

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.300
something like that somehow to get the
the widget for your snack bar and you

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.310
the widget for your snack bar and you
 

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.240
the widget for your snack bar and you
call make with your message and then the

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.250
call make with your message and then the
 

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.010
call make with your message and then the
duration of how long you want to show

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:38.020
duration of how long you want to show
 

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.310
duration of how long you want to show
and then show if you want to add an

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320
and then show if you want to add an
 

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.740
and then show if you want to add an
action to that you would add the

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:43.750
action to that you would add the
 

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.510
action to that you would add the
function call to set action with an

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:45.520
function call to set action with an
 

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.380
function call to set action with an
onclicklistener

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:46.390
onclicklistener
 

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.200
onclicklistener
and a color for that text to show up and

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.210
and a color for that text to show up and
 

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.140
and a color for that text to show up and
let's see if we're loaded yeah we're

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.150
let's see if we're loaded yeah we're
 

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.840
let's see if we're loaded yeah we're
cool reloaded all right so um so this is

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:00.850
cool reloaded all right so um so this is
 

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.830
cool reloaded all right so um so this is
why I was talking about with a

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:01.840
why I was talking about with a
 

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.710
why I was talking about with a
coordinator layout where we have a view

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720
coordinator layout where we have a view
 

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.510
coordinator layout where we have a view
with and expanded app bar here and we

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:09.520
with and expanded app bar here and we
 

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.460
with and expanded app bar here and we
have a recycler view of elements and

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:13.470
have a recycler view of elements and
 

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.050
have a recycler view of elements and
coordinator layout automatically knows

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:16.060
coordinator layout automatically knows
 

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.710
coordinator layout automatically knows
to scroll up and compress that collapse

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720
to scroll up and compress that collapse
 

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.740
to scroll up and compress that collapse
bar view for us we don't really have to

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:22.750
bar view for us we don't really have to
 

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.410
bar view for us we don't really have to
do all that much but to say this is what

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:25.420
do all that much but to say this is what
 

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.600
do all that much but to say this is what
the expanded size should be this is what

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:27.610
the expanded size should be this is what
 

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.090
the expanded size should be this is what
the compressor size should be and it

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.100
the compressor size should be and it
 

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.640
the compressor size should be and it
knows when to scroll either just the

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:32.650
knows when to scroll either just the
 

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.690
knows when to scroll either just the
list or the list and the app bar any

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.700
list or the list and the app bar any
 

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.440
list or the list and the app bar any
questions before I move on all right

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.450
questions before I move on all right
 

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.770
questions before I move on all right
cool all right so next thing we talk

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:43.780
cool all right so next thing we talk
 

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.810
cool all right so next thing we talk
about is bold graphic design this is the

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:45.820
about is bold graphic design this is the
 

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.440
about is bold graphic design this is the
part of the material design spec that

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:48.450
part of the material design spec that
 

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.800
part of the material design spec that
comes from great print design so the

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:52.810
comes from great print design so the
 

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.329
comes from great print design so the
first thing is the gestalt laws are

00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:54.339
first thing is the gestalt laws are
 

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:57.180
first thing is the gestalt laws are
grouping and this is kind of a trick

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.190
grouping and this is kind of a trick
 

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.060
grouping and this is kind of a trick
from your brain for how you perceive the

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.070
from your brain for how you perceive the
 

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.560
from your brain for how you perceive the
world so for instance in this room I can

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.570
world so for instance in this room I can
 

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.620
world so for instance in this room I can
see that there are a bunch of kids on

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:07.630
see that there are a bunch of kids on
 

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.230
see that there are a bunch of kids on
the side bunch of young adults so I

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240
the side bunch of young adults so I
 

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.410
the side bunch of young adults so I
might assume that they are related that

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:13.420
might assume that they are related that
 

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.300
might assume that they are related that
they're from the same school because

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:15.310
they're from the same school because
 

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.850
they're from the same school because
they're wearing the same thing and

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860
they're wearing the same thing and
 

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.949
they're wearing the same thing and
that's kind of what the gestalt law

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959
that's kind of what the gestalt law
 

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:20.430
that's kind of what the gestalt law
group

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440
group
 

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.430
group
do based off of proximity or similarity

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440
do based off of proximity or similarity
 

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.480
do based off of proximity or similarity
your mind kind of makes assumptions on

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:26.490
your mind kind of makes assumptions on
 

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.640
your mind kind of makes assumptions on
how things are and and tries to bring

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:29.650
how things are and and tries to bring
 

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.960
how things are and and tries to bring
order to a chaotic world so for a quick

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:33.970
order to a chaotic world so for a quick
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.010
order to a chaotic world so for a quick
example we have two views up here the

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.020
example we have two views up here the
 

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:44.490
example we have two views up here the
one on the far right is it looks like

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:44.500
one on the far right is it looks like
 

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.010
one on the far right is it looks like
it's a bunch of avatar type images

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:47.020
it's a bunch of avatar type images
 

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.130
it's a bunch of avatar type images
circular images with rectangles next to

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.140
circular images with rectangles next to
 

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.530
circular images with rectangles next to
it just as I was mentioned before

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:52.540
it just as I was mentioned before
 

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.170
it just as I was mentioned before
because all of the circular images are

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.180
because all of the circular images are
 

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.200
because all of the circular images are
similar I would it would be easy to

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.210
similar I would it would be easy to
 

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.790
similar I would it would be easy to
assume that those are the same type of

00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800
assume that those are the same type of
 

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.500
assume that those are the same type of
image tools might be an avatar for a

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:01.510
image tools might be an avatar for a
 

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.770
image tools might be an avatar for a
person and the rectangles are equally

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:04.780
person and the rectangles are equally
 

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.050
person and the rectangles are equally
similar there probably a description for

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.060
similar there probably a description for
 

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.680
similar there probably a description for
a person and because the regular

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:10.690
a person and because the regular
 

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.450
a person and because the regular
rectangular ones are close to the

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:12.460
rectangular ones are close to the
 

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.760
rectangular ones are close to the
avatars they're probably related they're

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:14.770
avatars they're probably related they're
 

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.100
avatars they're probably related they're
probably describing the avatar

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.110
probably describing the avatar
 

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.030
probably describing the avatar
there's a lot more than that but that's

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040
there's a lot more than that but that's
 

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.320
there's a lot more than that but that's
all I want to give you so I didn't bore

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.330
all I want to give you so I didn't bore
 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.830

transition manager was introduced in

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:32.850
transition manager was introduced in
 

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.300
transition manager was introduced in
KitKat 4.4 it allows creation to

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.310
KitKat 4.4 it allows creation to
 

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.000
KitKat 4.4 it allows creation to
transition in code or XML and it does an

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.010
transition in code or XML and it does an
 

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.950
transition in code or XML and it does an
insane amount of the heavy lifting for

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960
insane amount of the heavy lifting for
 

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.310
insane amount of the heavy lifting for
you have any of you guys ever had to

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320
you have any of you guys ever had to
 

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.650
you have any of you guys ever had to
wire up an animation by yourself in

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:45.660
wire up an animation by yourself in
 

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.550
wire up an animation by yourself in
Android ok so you guys know my pain of

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:49.560
Android ok so you guys know my pain of
 

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.430
Android ok so you guys know my pain of
using like the old way in object

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440
using like the old way in object
 

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.290
using like the old way in object
animator and property animators and

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:54.300
animator and property animators and
 

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.770
animator and property animators and
stuff like that so here is kind of an

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:57.780
stuff like that so here is kind of an
 

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.840
stuff like that so here is kind of an
example that I did that only took a

00:25:59.840 --> 00:25:59.850
example that I did that only took a
 

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.390
example that I did that only took a
couple lines of code and basically when

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400
couple lines of code and basically when
 

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.990
couple lines of code and basically when
you click the button it shuffles the

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000
you click the button it shuffles the
 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.020
you click the button it shuffles the
image off of the screen so that actually

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.030
image off of the screen so that actually
 

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.420
image off of the screen so that actually
is doing a lot of stuff there so the

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.430
is doing a lot of stuff there so the
 

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.800
is doing a lot of stuff there so the
first thing is doing is capturing the

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:15.810
first thing is doing is capturing the
 

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.770
first thing is doing is capturing the
start state of all the views then

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:18.780
start state of all the views then
 

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.610
start state of all the views then
capturing the end state and it's

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:21.620
capturing the end state and it's
 

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.620
capturing the end state and it's
creating and creating an animator to

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:24.630
creating and creating an animator to
 

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.470
creating and creating an animator to
interpolate between the two and then

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480
interpolate between the two and then
 

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.230
interpolate between the two and then
based off of what type of transition

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240
based off of what type of transition
 

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.330
based off of what type of transition
type I set it's going to say okay using

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340
type I set it's going to say okay using
 

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.720
type I set it's going to say okay using
that those values let me make this

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:35.730
that those values let me make this
 

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.860
that those values let me make this
animation so this is the code that I use

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:39.870
animation so this is the code that I use
 

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.500
animation so this is the code that I use
to do that so I have a slide transition

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:42.510
to do that so I have a slide transition
 

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.650
to do that so I have a slide transition
and I set the slight edge to the top of

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:45.660
and I set the slight edge to the top of
 

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.970
and I set the slight edge to the top of
the screen so it's going to slide things

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980
the screen so it's going to slide things
 

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.610
the screen so it's going to slide things
off the top of the screen and then down

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620
off the top of the screen and then down
 

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.430
off the top of the screen and then down
here in transition manager I say I tell

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440
here in transition manager I say I tell
 

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.850
here in transition manager I say I tell
it to begin a delay transition and it's

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860
it to begin a delay transition and it's
 

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.280
it to begin a delay transition and it's
using that slide and then I do all the

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.290
using that slide and then I do all the
 

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.770
using that slide and then I do all the
things that I'm going to do to the to

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:00.780
things that I'm going to do to the to
 

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.660
things that I'm going to do to the to
the view in this case it's just telling

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:02.670
the view in this case it's just telling
 

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.430
the view in this case it's just telling
the image to disappear so instead of

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440
the image to disappear so instead of
 

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.980
the image to disappear so instead of
just fading off the screen it's going to

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:06.990
just fading off the screen it's going to
 

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.780
just fading off the screen it's going to
use that slide and slide up the top

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:08.790
use that slide and slide up the top
 

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.780
use that slide and slide up the top
slide off the top

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:10.790
slide off the top
 

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.919
slide off the top
there are a bunch of transition types

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:12.929
there are a bunch of transition types
 

00:27:12.929 --> 00:27:15.860
there are a bunch of transition types
that were introduced in API 19 and API

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:15.870
that were introduced in API 19 and API
 

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.480
that were introduced in API 19 and API
21 I showed you slide by default if you

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:20.490
21 I showed you slide by default if you
 

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.520
21 I showed you slide by default if you
don't set a transition it's going to use

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:22.530
don't set a transition it's going to use
 

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.169
don't set a transition it's going to use
Auto transition which will use a

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179
Auto transition which will use a
 

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:27.169
Auto transition which will use a
combination of like sliding and I think

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179
combination of like sliding and I think
 

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:29.090
combination of like sliding and I think
exploding and fading and stuff like that

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100
exploding and fading and stuff like that
 

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.230
exploding and fading and stuff like that
it kind of has a set of things that it

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240
it kind of has a set of things that it
 

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.030
it kind of has a set of things that it
will kind of automatically move the

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.040
will kind of automatically move the
 

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.140
will kind of automatically move the
things off the screen activity

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.150
things off the screen activity
 

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.330
things off the screen activity
transitions when you're moving between

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340
transitions when you're moving between
 

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.070
transitions when you're moving between
activity this is another place where you

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080
activity this is another place where you

can have instructive motion to guide

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:45.390
can have instructive motion to guide

your user by having a specific
 

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.140
your user by having a specific
transition when they go into or out of a

transition when they go into or out of a
 

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.600
transition when they go into or out of a
specific activity so if you have

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:53.610
specific activity so if you have
 

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.039
specific activity so if you have
activity a and activity B when you when

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:47.799
 
okay okay the question was it seems like

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:47.809
okay okay the question was it seems like
 

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:51.940
okay okay the question was it seems like
it could be really jarring if there if

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:51.950
it could be really jarring if there if
 

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.769
it could be really jarring if there if
there are transitions on both sides and

00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:53.779
there are transitions on both sides and
 

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:57.629
there are transitions on both sides and
if you have a bad exit or a weird enter

00:28:57.629 --> 00:28:57.639
if you have a bad exit or a weird enter
 

00:28:57.639 --> 00:28:59.619
if you have a bad exit or a weird enter
the answer is yes

00:28:59.619 --> 00:28:59.629
the answer is yes
 

00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:10.659
the answer is yes
there certainly can be a question REE

00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:10.669
there certainly can be a question REE
 

00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:12.369
there certainly can be a question REE
comment was do you have to keep them

00:29:12.369 --> 00:29:12.379
comment was do you have to keep them
 

00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:13.959
comment was do you have to keep them
looking saying there are a couple things

00:29:13.959 --> 00:29:13.969
looking saying there are a couple things
 

00:29:13.969 --> 00:29:17.769
looking saying there are a couple things
that you can do like something I'm going

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:17.779
that you can do like something I'm going
 

00:29:17.779 --> 00:29:21.549
that you can do like something I'm going
to mention in this library here shared

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559
to mention in this library here shared
 

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:24.249
to mention in this library here shared
element transitions you can basically

00:29:24.249 --> 00:29:24.259
element transitions you can basically
 

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:28.599
element transitions you can basically
say I want this object or these groups

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:28.609
say I want this object or these groups
 

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:31.419
say I want this object or these groups
of objects that exist in this view and

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:31.429
of objects that exist in this view and
 

00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:35.259
of objects that exist in this view and
also exist in this view to move to

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:35.269
also exist in this view to move to
 

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:38.889
also exist in this view to move to
transition so a good way to show it to

00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:38.899
transition so a good way to show it to
 

00:29:38.899 --> 00:29:49.169
transition so a good way to show it to
you is just an example here so we have a

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:49.179
you is just an example here so we have a
 

00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:58.740
you is just an example here so we have a
headed here

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:58.750
 
 

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.700
 
it's okay

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:02.710
 
 

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.409
 
coordinated motion Oh Harris sorry about

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:05.419
coordinated motion Oh Harris sorry about
 

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:09.580
coordinated motion Oh Harris sorry about
that okay so here's one for a shared

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:09.590
that okay so here's one for a shared
 

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.070
that okay so here's one for a shared
activity a shared element transition so

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080
activity a shared element transition so
 

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.140
activity a shared element transition so
I have these sets of avatars and if I

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.150
I have these sets of avatars and if I
 

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.480
I have these sets of avatars and if I
click one of them it's going to make a

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:16.490
click one of them it's going to make a
 

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:23.440
click one of them it's going to make a
transition into the next view and that

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.450
transition into the next view and that
 

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.049
transition into the next view and that
one's was slightly different because

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:26.059
one's was slightly different because
 

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:27.700
one's was slightly different because
that wasn't inter or accident that was

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:27.710
that wasn't inter or accident that was
 

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.250
that wasn't inter or accident that was
just a yeah a share transition I'm

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.260
just a yeah a share transition I'm
 

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.909
just a yeah a share transition I'm
basically seeing this set of objects

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919
basically seeing this set of objects
 

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:36.850
basically seeing this set of objects
that I have existed in this screen and

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:36.860
that I have existed in this screen and
 

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.039
that I have existed in this screen and
exist in this next screen so I want them

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:39.049
exist in this next screen so I want them
 

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:40.450
exist in this next screen so I want them
I want you to figure out how to

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.460
I want you to figure out how to
 

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.220
I want you to figure out how to
transition between the two states

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.230
transition between the two states
 

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.990
transition between the two states
so this is another place where it kind

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000
so this is another place where it kind
 

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.780
so this is another place where it kind
of automatically does things for you so

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:46.790
of automatically does things for you so
 

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:47.950
of automatically does things for you so
this would be a way where you would

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960
this would be a way where you would
 

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.470
this would be a way where you would
avoid having to think of how is a going

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480
avoid having to think of how is a going
 

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.789
avoid having to think of how is a going
to transition how is B going to

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799
to transition how is B going to
 

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:54.640
to transition how is B going to
transition and just stick to these are

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:54.650
transition and just stick to these are
 

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.620
transition and just stick to these are
the important parts of a that should

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:56.630
the important parts of a that should
 

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:02.250
the important parts of a that should
transition over to B these are fragments

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:02.260
transition over to B these are fragments
 

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:09.130
transition over to B these are fragments
yeah and let me pull up that code for

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.140
yeah and let me pull up that code for
 

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.940
yeah and let me pull up that code for
you have this code those coordinated

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:15.950
you have this code those coordinated
 

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:23.990
you have this code those coordinated
motion

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000
 
 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.350
 
yep question

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360
 
 

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.270
 
a question was is there a limit of total

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:32.280
a question was is there a limit of total
 

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.630
a question was is there a limit of total
transitions you can have no there is not

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640
transitions you can have no there is not
 

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.539
transitions you can have no there is not
but you should try to do as few as

00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:38.549
but you should try to do as few as
 

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:41.390
but you should try to do as few as
possible like you should try to do just

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:41.400
possible like you should try to do just
 

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.380
possible like you should try to do just
enough to kind of move things along just

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:45.390
enough to kind of move things along just
 

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.180
enough to kind of move things along just
because one of the things you'll notice

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:47.190
because one of the things you'll notice
 

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.500
because one of the things you'll notice
if you have a person who has a really

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:51.510
if you have a person who has a really
 

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:55.100
if you have a person who has a really
old phone there the Trent it might lag

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:55.110
old phone there the Trent it might lag
 

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.770
old phone there the Trent it might lag
on their phone if if you have like 15

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:57.780
on their phone if if you have like 15
 

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.560
on their phone if if you have like 15
transitions firing off good question

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:00.570
transitions firing off good question
 

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:10.240
transitions firing off good question
thanks for asking that and just okay so

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.250
thanks for asking that and just okay so
 

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.430
thanks for asking that and just okay so
here's this code right here that kind of

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440
here's this code right here that kind of
 

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.280
here's this code right here that kind of
controlled it you have a shared element

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:16.290
controlled it you have a shared element
 

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:22.270
controlled it you have a shared element
enter transition and this one only set

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.280
enter transition and this one only set
 

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:30.080

imposing wait wait oh so there's a

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.090
imposing wait wait oh so there's a
 

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.390
imposing wait wait oh so there's a

sets the inter transition in this

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020
sets the inter transition in this
 

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:40.400
sets the inter transition in this
example and it just has a simple boolean

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:40.410
example and it just has a simple boolean
 

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.100
example and it just has a simple boolean
check of should it move on a curve or

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.110
check of should it move on a curve or
 

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.930
check of should it move on a curve or
should just be a straight motion back

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940
should just be a straight motion back
 

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.120
should just be a straight motion back
and that's another thing that I didn't

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.130
and that's another thing that I didn't
 

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.230
and that's another thing that I didn't
mention before you should try to move

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240
mention before you should try to move
 

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.210
mention before you should try to move
things on curves as much as possible

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:52.220
 
 

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:57.430
 
going back to slides did that quickly on

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440
going back to slides did that quickly on
 

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.530
going back to slides did that quickly on
interpolators this also goes with

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:00.540
interpolators this also goes with
 

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.890

a bunch that exist in android these are

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440
a bunch that exist in android these are
 

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.600
a bunch that exist in android these are
kind of the three that you should

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:14.610
kind of the three that you should
 

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:19.700
kind of the three that you should
probably use at the most and you can

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:19.710
probably use at the most and you can
 

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.350
probably use at the most and you can
kind of notice like if you have a long

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360
kind of notice like if you have a long
 

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.750
kind of notice like if you have a long
duration of 300 milliseconds it makes

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760
duration of 300 milliseconds it makes
 

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.600
duration of 300 milliseconds it makes
your app look like it's slow but if you

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:26.610
your app look like it's slow but if you
 

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.669
your app look like it's slow but if you
have something like 300 it looks zippy

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679
have something like 300 it looks zippy
 

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.490
have something like 300 it looks zippy
and fast so generally you should try and

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500
and fast so generally you should try and
 

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.850
and fast so generally you should try and
keep your transitions to be about 300

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:36.860
keep your transitions to be about 300

good so you should think about your

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159
good so you should think about your
 

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:52.519

content first and not your device you
 

00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:55.190

shouldn't and what I mean by that is you
 

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.799
shouldn't and what I mean by that is you
shouldn't code for a specific device and

moving from a smaller screen to your
 

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:04.200
moving from a smaller screen to your
bigger screen you can reveal more of the

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.210
bigger screen you can reveal more of the
 

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.549
bigger screen you can reveal more of the
other content that you were showing on

00:35:06.549 --> 00:35:06.559
other content that you were showing on
 

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:08.680
other content that you were showing on
the smaller screen so you might do a

the smaller screen so you might do a
master-detail view where you show

00:35:11.729 --> 00:35:11.739
master-detail view where you show
 

00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:14.259
master-detail view where you show
multiple fragments on the screen you can

00:35:14.259 --> 00:35:14.269
multiple fragments on the screen you can
 

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:17.229
multiple fragments on the screen you can
also reflow the content to just use more

00:35:17.229 --> 00:35:17.239
also reflow the content to just use more
 

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.239
also reflow the content to just use more
of the screen or if neither of those

00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:19.249
of the screen or if neither of those
 

00:35:19.249 --> 00:35:23.170
of the screen or if neither of those
work you can just kind of expand the

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:23.180
work you can just kind of expand the
 

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.950
work you can just kind of expand the
white space around your content and

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960
white space around your content and
 

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.450
white space around your content and
dividing is the opposite of revealing

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:28.460
dividing is the opposite of revealing

just splitting your your UI into

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:30.710
just splitting your your UI into
 

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:36.219
just splitting your your UI into
multiple fragments so to implement your

00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:36.229
multiple fragments so to implement your
 

00:35:36.229 --> 00:35:37.690
multiple fragments so to implement your
breakpoints you should be using your

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:37.700
breakpoints you should be using your
 

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.749
breakpoints you should be using your
qualifiers like landscape and portrait

00:35:40.749 --> 00:35:40.759
qualifiers like landscape and portrait
 

00:35:40.759 --> 00:35:43.660
qualifiers like landscape and portrait
and the ones at the bottom are for

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:43.670
and the ones at the bottom are for
 

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.769
and the ones at the bottom are for
specific densities you should not use

00:35:47.769 --> 00:35:47.779
specific densities you should not use
 

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:50.739
specific densities you should not use
the small medium large qualifiers

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:50.749
the small medium large qualifiers
 

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:52.269
the small medium large qualifiers
because those are really fuzzy and

00:35:52.269 --> 00:35:52.279
because those are really fuzzy and
 

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:57.190
because those are really fuzzy and
caused problems and that was it as far

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200
caused problems and that was it as far
 

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.709
caused problems and that was it as far
as content I have but definitely open

00:35:59.709 --> 00:35:59.719
as content I have but definitely open
 

00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:02.829
as content I have but definitely open
for questions so
