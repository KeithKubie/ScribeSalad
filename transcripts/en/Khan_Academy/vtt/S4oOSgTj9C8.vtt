00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.360
Welcome back.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.290
We're doing part b and part
of problem number two.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.660
And it says, use a trapezoidal
sum with 3 subintervals to

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.390
estimate the average number
of people waiting in line

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.030
during the first 4 hours.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.840
And so I just took the data
they gave, graphed it.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.560
I did that in the last video.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.880
And so, use trapezoidal sum
with 3 subintervals to estimate

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.140
the average number of people--
that sounds very complicated.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470
Like boy, I don't-- that
sounds-- yeah, you know, I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.260
didn't learn trapezoidal
sums, or however you

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.910
want to think about it.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.770
It could be very confusing.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.350
And frankly, I haven't taken
calculus in 20 years.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.720
But you really just have to
think about what they're

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.370
saying, and it's
not that daunting.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.300
So what's the average
value of a function?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180
And you learned
this in calculus.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.660
You might not remember it.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.020
So let's say the average value
of f is equal to essentially--

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.860
let's say, between 2 points, b
and a-- it's the difference

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.230
between the 2 points divided by
the area under the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.780
curve of f of x.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.840
From a to b.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.190
Right?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.470
That's, I think they call
that the second fundamental

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.300
theorem of calculus.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.180
Or corollary to the fundamental
theorem of calculus, whatever.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.140
But it makes sense.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.700
Right?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.790
The average value of a function
is equal to the area under the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.210
curve divided by, you
could kind of say, the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.350
base of the figure.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.260
Right?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.820
Because another way to think
about it, if you just took the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.930
average value of the function--
so if the function was, say,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.310
this, and you just multiplied
that average value times the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.660
base, you would get the
same area as the integral.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.550
That's another way to view it.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.460
You could rewrite
this as b minus a.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.540
The base times the average
value is the same thing as

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.655
the area under the curve.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.490
So that's another
way to view it.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.670
So let's just apply that here.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.670
Let's use the trapezoidal sum
to figure out the area under

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
this curve, or an estimate of
the area under l of t, and then

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.750
we can divide by b minus a.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.810
Or in that case,
b is 4, a is 0.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.880
And we'll have the average
value of-- over the first 4

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.500
hours-- of the people in line.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.760
So let's do that.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.350
Let me erase it.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.530
We're actually not going
to use an interval.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.120
We're going to use a
trapezoidal sum to

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.030
estimate the integral.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.610
So it says, 3 intervals.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.390
It says a trapezoidal sum
with 3 subintervals.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.570
Well, I see, there's 3 very
natural subintervals here.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.560
And let me draw them.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.030
So this is one.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.750
Actually let me-- I'll
draw the dotted lines.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.370
This is one subinterval.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.600
This is another subinterval.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.160
And there we have it.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.130
We have three trapezoids.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.860
We have this one, we
have this one, and we

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.300
have this trapezoid.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.150
So we essentially just have
to figure out the area of

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.230
each of these trapezoids.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.430
Let me see if I can draw that
a little bit-- I drew them

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.080
in different colors, just so
you can see the trapezoids.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.660
So this trapezoid goes goes
from-- oh, I don't know

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.560
if I'm doing this right.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.550
Let's see.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.220
I'll use a line tool.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.565
So 1 trapezoid here, and
another trapezoid there.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:11.690
And then another
trapezoid there.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.480
And I just need to figure out
the areas of each of these

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.160
trapezoids, and that's my
estimate of the area under the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860
curve of l of t, from 0 to 4.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.480
And then I just divide
it by 4, and I'm done.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.870
Part b.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.170
So what's the area of
this first trapezoid?

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110
Well, what do you do to find
an area of a trapezoid?

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.900
It's the base.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.520
So this area of the trapezoid
right here, this first

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.980
one, is the base.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.240
Which is just 1.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.380
1 times the average
of the two heights.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.690
Right?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.830
So it's the average.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.470
Right here it's 120,
and this is 156.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.570
So what's the average
of 120 and 156?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.230
Well, the average of 120
and 156-- let's see.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.810
We get 276 divided by 2 is 138.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.380
So it's 1 times 138
or it's just 138.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.870
That's the area of
that trapezoid.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.090
What's the area of this
trapezoid right here?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.430
This bigger one?

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.320
Well, its base is 2, right?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.750
1, 2.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.450
Its base is 2.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.060
And what's the average value?

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.470
Well, it's going to
be the average value

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.670
between 156 and 176.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.230
Or the average value between
this height and this height.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.210
That's an easier one, right?

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.456
166 is right in between
those two, and we

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:27.050
don't have to do much.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.650
So it's 2 times 166.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.110
Sorry, 166, not 1.66.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.130
And finally, what's the average
value of this trap-- or what's

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.240
the area in this trapezoid?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.260
Well, the base is 1, right?

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.180
It's going from 3 to 4.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.930
1 times the average value.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.380
So 176 and 126.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.520
So that is 1/2
times-- what's 176?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.430
Let me use a calculator, just
so I don't make any mistakes.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.180
Trusty TI-85 emulator.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.130
Let's see.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.880
176 plus 126.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.980
Enter.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.710
Divided by 2, is equal to 151.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.090
So this area right here
is 1 times 151, or 151.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.550
So what's the total area?

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.530
It's just going to be the
sum of these 3 trapezoids.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.340
So it's the sum of
those 3 trapezoids.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:39.880
So it's going to be 138
plus 2 times 166 plus 151.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.050
So that's the total area
under those trapezoids.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.400
But then they ask us,
well, what's the average

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.480
value of the function?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.690
Well, the average value is just
the area divided by the base.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.020
The base is 4, right?

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.900
From noon to 4:00 p.m.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.520
or from time equals
0 to time equals 4.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.610
So we just divide
this value by 4.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.670
So divided by 4, we get 155.25.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.125
So they say, use a trapezoidal
sum with 3 subintervals to

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:10.550
estimate the average number of
people waiting in line during

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.060
the first 4 hours that the
tickets were on sale.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.110
So the answer to
part b is 155.25.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.940
They don't tell us to round it
or anything, so I'm assuming

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.620
that's, you know, if we're
saying the average number of

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.720
people, I guess we can
have a fraction there.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.375
So that's reasonable.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.630
Let's see, what part are we?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.270
We're on part c.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.970
OK.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.300
So part c.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.940
I think that's going to
use this graph, too.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.240
So let me erase at
least this top part.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.230
The top part I can erase.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.280
I can erase this,
I can erase that.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.370
I want to erase all the
unnecessary things.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.550
Let me see if I can-- let's
see, I can erase all of that.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.770
Just want to make it
as neat as possible.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.820
I think this graph is going
to come in useful in part

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.470
c, by just glancing at it.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.810
OK.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.760
That's good enough, I think.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.510
OK, let's do part c.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.680
Let me copy and paste it.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.070
Part c.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.050
OK, copied it.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.005
Edit, paste.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.600
OK.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.940
For t is greater than 0,
is less than 9, right?

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.840
What is the fewest number
of times at which l prime

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.340
of t must be equal to 0?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.020
Give a reason for your answer.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.180
So l prime of t, that's
the derivative of this.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.780
When I connected these dots,
I just kind of wanted to

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.640
get a shape of the curve.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.430
But it's really a curve.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.090
It's not like this sharp
edged line, right?

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.880
And how do we know
it's a curve?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.370
Because it's differentiable.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.360
It's continuous.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.620
It's actually twice
differentiable.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.800
Which tells us the
derivative is continuous.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.070
So the real graph of this is
going to look something--

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.630
you know, let me do it in
a bold color like magenta.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.390
You know, it might look
something like this.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.990
I don't know, a curve and
then it maxes out at

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.880
some point, comes down.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.530
Then it comes up like this.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.750
And then it, maybe it
maxes out, and it

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.190
comes down like that.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.480
It'll be a curve, right?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.190
Anyway, they say, what is the
fewest number of times that l

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.940
prime of t must be equal to 0?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.100
Well, what happens when l
prime of t is equal to 0?

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.560
That means that we are at
a local minima or a local

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.470
maxima, or sometimes
an inflection point.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.170
But we don't know
that for sure.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.610
But at minima and maxima point,
we know for sure that l

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.400
prime of t is equal to 0.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.630
And so we can just eyeball it.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.870
We could look at this graph and
we could say, well, you know,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.280
there has to be a minima point
someplace in this range.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.550
Right?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.280
Between here and here.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.620
So, you know, the way I
drew it, it looks like

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.980
the slope is 0 there.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.740
And between here and here, it
looks like the slope is also

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.420
going to have to bottom
out at some point.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.930
Like there.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.380
And then there's a maximum
point right-- someplace in

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.590
this range, and it's
going to max out.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.410
So when I just eyeball it, I
say, well, I have 2 maximum

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.040
points, and one minima point,
so the slope is going to equal

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.750
0 at at least 3 points, right?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.520
But they tell us, give us
a reason for your answer.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.210
Give us a reason.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.950
And my reason-- and actually,
you could use Rolle's Theorem

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.090
or the mean value theorem, but
the simplest reason is that

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:31.210
here we have 3 sign changes
in the average velocity.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.820
Or the average, not the
average velocity, the

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.290
rate-- the l of t.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.300
We're not doing velocity
in this problem.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.770
So from here-- let me
use a thicker line.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.390
Use yellow.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.680
So from here to here,
we have a sign change.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.890
From here to here, we
have a sign change.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.400
And from here to here, we
could have a sign change.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.040
So what I would write down at
the AP exam, is, I was like,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.300
well, the function is twice
differentiable, which means

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.360
its derivative is continuous.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.620
So let me write down
the important points.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.975
So derivative is continuous.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.380
And we have 3 sign changes
in the derivative, right?

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.080
The derivative is positive over
this interval, or at least

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.480
its average is positive,
then it goes negative.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.130
So at some point, since the
derivative is continuous-- it

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.930
doesn't jump around-- it had
to be positive someplace

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.760
in this range.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.690
And you can be more formal
when you write it.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.140
It had to be negative
someplace in this range.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.160
So there had to be a sign
change, and so it had

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.680
to pass through 0.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.160
And that same argument could
be used between here and

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.030
here, and here and here.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.490
And that's my answer.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.260
And I will continue part d in
the next video, because I'm

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.570
already over 10 minutes.
