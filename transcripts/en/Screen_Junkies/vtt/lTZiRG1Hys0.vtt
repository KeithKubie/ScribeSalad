00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.100
From the studio who brought you Ratatouille,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.960
WALL-E,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.220
and Up,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.120
comes the movie that paid for all of them:

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.480
Toys

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.080
I- I mean, CARS.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.240
Cruise into Radiator Springs,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.120
a town full of fun, friends, and adventure!

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.460
Just don't ask where all the humans are, because we're either extinct,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.880
murdered by our cars,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.000
Or we merge with them to become some kind of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.600
unholy man-car hybrid!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.500
Hmmm....

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.580
Probably shouldn't think too hard about that.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100
Moving on!

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.440
Pixar built an empire out of beautiful, emotionally

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.680
real tightly-plotted masterpieces!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.120
And Cars is almost all of those things!

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.000
As this above average kids movie never reaches Pixar's highest highs,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.320
but it's better than people give it credit it for.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420
I mean, you know, it's not flawless...

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.940
Lightning is... kind of a jerk.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.280
Sally: It looks awful!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.980
Lightning: Now it matches the rest of the town.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920
The catchphrases are kind of annoying.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.980
Lightning: KACHOW!!

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.980
Chick: KACHIGA!!! KACHIGA!!!!

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.760
Huh.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.900
I guess we really don't have that much to say about the first Cars movie.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.740
Can we just do Cars 2 instead?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.360
*EPIC REWIND IN PROGRESS*

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.220
That's better.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.360
From the studio who brought you Ratatouille,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.260
WALL-E,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.280
and Up...

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800
comes a tedious cash-grab dumpster fire

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.440
that's Pixar's worst movie by a long shot.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.200
Cars 2!

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.240
You liked Cars well enough...

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.560
but since your kids loved it,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.300
Pixar's going full Minions!

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.520
And making a sequel about the side character they can relate to.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.460
Because kids are dumb.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.060
This is your fault, parents.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.220
Why didn't you just buy them more Ratatouille merchandise?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.280
Oh.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.180
You remember Lightning,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.060
Sally,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.140
and the rest of the gang at Radiator Springs.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.560
Or forget about them, because it's Mater's time to shine!

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.820
Mater: That's funny, right there.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.000
Spin way too long with this annoying southern truck,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.660
played by non-southern comedian Daniel Whitney,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.680
who pretends to be a dumb hick named Larry the Cable Guy,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.120
who pretends to be this buck-toothed truck version of Larry the Cable Guy.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.960
It's like a turducken of fake idiots pretending to be even bigger faker idiots!

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.580
After Lightning's simple story of learning to slow down and appreciate life,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.740
Get ready for a confusing plot, about a car who creates an alternative fuel,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.080
Just to make alternative fuel look bad.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.220
But no amount of logic will stop Mater from visiting as many playsets and accessories as possible!

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.420
No matter how many forced misunderstandings it takes to get there!

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.600
Mater: You know I'm just a tow truck, right?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.880
Finn: Right... and I'm just in the import-export business.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.880
He just told you he's not a spy.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.140
Mater: My line of work is towing and salvage.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.440
Finn: Right, and Ms. Shiftwell's, is designing iPhone apps.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.840
Really? Again??

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.200
Mater: Agent? You mean like an insurance agent?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.380
Like, like a good neighbourrr, Mater is thereeee!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.840
See? He's not a spy!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.580
Mater: I'm not a spy!!

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.040
I've been trying to tell you that the whole time!

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500
Why is no one listening to him??

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.160
So buckle up for a movie responsible for some of Pixar's firsts,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.320
Like...

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.020
Their first sequel to stretch a thin comic relief character into a whole movie,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.560
First time they weren't nominated for a Best Animated Feature Oscar,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.140
And the first time they went full blown 'Rotten' on Rotten Tomatoes.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.760
Or as this moron would say:

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.500
Mater: Rotten Tomaters!

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.120
I mean, do they even have tomatoes in Cars' world?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.160
I guess they must eat food,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160
'cause, they have those giant tongues.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160
But it seems all they do is just drink gas.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.020
Unless gas is their blood?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
Except Mater mistakes wasabi for ice cream,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.720
which means they HAVE ice cream.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720
But, the cows in this universe are tractors,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.920
So, do they like, milk the tractors?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.920
Does your car model determine your species?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.200
Your class?

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.180
Your ethnicity?

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.760
Like do cop cars have to be cops?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
Or can a race car be a janitor if he wants to?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.520
And how are cars born?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520
This car has a mom!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520
Francesco: My mamma, is right here.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.800
What's the difference between boy and girl cars?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.200
Do cars have sex?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200
And how??

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.280
Are headlights BEWBS?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.480
Girl Cars: KACHOW!!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780
And how do cars die?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.860
If they keep replacing their parts are they like, immortal?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.800
There's a car Pope, so, is there, Cartholicism?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800
What kind of car was Jesus?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.160
Sarge is a veteran,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.740
which means there were car wars.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.960
Was he in Car-nam?

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.360
What kind of car was Hitler??

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.360
Is the engine the brain or the heart?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360
What's the difference between a doctor and a mechanic?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.720
If they open their door, do all their guts fall out?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.380
Why do cars even HAVE door handles in a world with no humans driving them??

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.600
Except this car has eyes in her headlights,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.400
and a steering wheel and seats,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.640
oh geez, they DID kill us all!!

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.640
They just evolved, and covered it all up!

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.680
DAMN YOU DIRTY BRAKES, DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.620
Oh wow, we're really sidetracked there.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.000
Where was I again?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.820
Oh yeah!

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.000
Starring: Cars! Money!

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.420
Announcer: A hundred and ninety-nine laps and baby, it all comes down to this!

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.900
Man, NASCAR is really boring.
