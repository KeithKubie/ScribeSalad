00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:03.640
NARRATOR 1: In September of
2012, thousands of people

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.620
took to the streets of
Chicago during a NATO summit,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.070
to rally against war, economic
greed, climate change,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.780
and government corruption.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.810
During the protests, one group
stood out among the rest.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.700
Dressed in all
black, their faces

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.425
covered, identities
hidden from both police

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.740
and photojournalists.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.260
So first off, black bloc
is not a specific group.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.300
It's a tactic used by groups of
protesters all over the world.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.100
That group was one
of the reasons street

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.370
photographer Ryan Williams
went Into the heart

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.650
of the protest that day.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.880
RYAN WILLIAMS: People that
are doing black bloc tactics

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.025
always have black bandanas.

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:42.880
They always have some
kind of face covering.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.999
Sometimes they're wearing
sunglasses, or hats, or masks.

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.290
They always wear black clothes.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.780
And they don't have
to be anarchists.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.460
They don't have to be violent.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.170
They're not always intent
on destroying property.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.540
What they are intent on is
preserving their anonymity,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.890
so that they can directly
confront police, or authority

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.940
figures, or make bold statements
about the particular situation

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.714
that they're protesting,
without fear of persecution.

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.130
NARRATOR 1: And
it turns out, they

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.030
were right to be wary of police.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.613
RYAN WILLIAMS: In
the city of Chicago,

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:19.930
we've had a lot of revelations
over the past several years

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.190
of police surveillance
on ordinary citizens,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
police using
technology to intercept

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.180
cellphone communications without
a warrant, police monitoring

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.382
texts, and chats, and other
private communications.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.340
NARRATOR 1: This particular
protest started out

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.370
organized and permitted.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.100
At the center were Iraq and
Afghanistan war veterans,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.720
who marched to the NATO
summit and threw their medals

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.720
over the police barricade.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.240
The whole scene was
very reminiscent

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.010
of the Vietnam War protests
of the '60s and '70s.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.265
But there seemed to be a
shift once that was over.

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:53.640
RYAN WILLIAMS: I
think the permit

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.780
had been approved 'till
let's say like 11 am,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.550
or noon, or something like that.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.900
And then everybody
had to disperse.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.050
And nobody dispersed.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.915
They all just stood there
and refused to leave.

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.290
NARRATOR 1: Police stood their
ground, ready for anything

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.360
to happen.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.110
And according to
Ryan, they were armed

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.870
with tear gas, rubber bullets,
water cannons, and batons.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.130
But the protesters in black
didn't stand down either.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.935
Until all hell broke loose.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.980
Both sides started pushing
against each other.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.320
Protesters picked up a barricade
and threw it at the police.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.410
The police made arrests
and used their batons

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.700
against protesters.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.260
But still the protesters
refused to step down.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.899
But just as fast as it started,
it seemed to disappear.

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.440
RYAN WILLIAMS: It
was lightning fast.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.680
They came, they made
their statement,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.870
they pushed, and
then they dispersed.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.840
NARRATOR 1: Protests involving
black bloc tactics don't always

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.610
end so peacefully, with many
continuing on into vandalism

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.040
and violence.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.450
But every protest
is different, as is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.030
each individual protester.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.460
RYAN WILLIAMS: Certainly these
protesters are real people,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.530
just like everybody else.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.750
They're people's brothers,
and sisters, and mothers,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.840
and fathers, and children.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.280
And they're people's
grandparents,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.380
and people's teachers,
and some of them

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.071
are police officers themselves.

00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.070
NARRATOR 1: And that is
why Ryan took his camera

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.390
to the streets that day, to give
a face to a faceless movement

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.430
and to get a hell of a
photo series in the process.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.740
RYAN WILLIAMS: It really
felt like a moment

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.240
when there were a lot of things
that had been floating around

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.100
in people's heads finally
coming to the surface,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.780
and in a very public, highly
visible, very creative, very

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.810
colorful, and very loud way.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.480
NARRATOR 1: Other
protesters recently

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.580
took to the streets of London
to rebel against gentrification.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.172
To find out more about that,
check out this episode.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:54.630
NARRATOR 2: The protesters are
an anti-gentrification group

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.846
called the [BLEEP] Parade.

00:03:55.846 --> 00:03:57.970
The group launched their
campaign against the store

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.730
because they felt it
symbolized a bigger

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.880
problem in London, and indeed
in many other metropolises

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.824
around the world.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:05.740
NARRATOR 1: And as always,
