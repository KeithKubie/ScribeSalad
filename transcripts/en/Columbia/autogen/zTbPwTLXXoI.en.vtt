insensible analysis of non design data

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690
insensible analysis of non design data
 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.090

right so data come from design
 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.890
right so data come from design
experiments are one thing but the kind

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900
experiments are one thing but the kind
 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.000
experiments are one thing but the kind
of data that I think we're mostly

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010
of data that I think we're mostly
 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.530
of data that I think we're mostly
talking about here are fraught with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540
talking about here are fraught with

at Purdue I want to then talk a bit
about life cycle models and I think

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
about life cycle models and I think
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.200
about life cycle models and I think
there's there's different types of life

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210
there's there's different types of life
 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.080
there's there's different types of life
cycle models that really are relevant to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
cycle models that really are relevant to
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.400

cycle models that I've observed then I
 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.719
cycle models that I've observed then I
want to get into the the topic of the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
want to get into the the topic of the
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.580

really that's designed to look at how

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289
really that's designed to look at how
 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.950
really that's designed to look at how
can librarians have an impact in this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960
can librarians have an impact in this
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.630
can librarians have an impact in this
new world of data how can we take the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
new world of data how can we take the
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520
new world of data how can we take the
the knowledge and skills &amp; expertise

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530
the knowledge and skills &amp; expertise
 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.529
the knowledge and skills &amp; expertise
that we have that we've used for

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
that we have that we've used for
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.210
that we have that we've used for
centuries with with books and with

centuries with with books and with
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.430
centuries with with books and with
journals and apply this to this emerging

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440
journals and apply this to this emerging
 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.770
journals and apply this to this emerging
evolving world of data so do discuss at

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
evolving world of data so do discuss at
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.540
evolving world of data so do discuss at
librarians have in terms of organizing

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
librarians have in terms of organizing
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.970
librarians have in terms of organizing
and managing and disseminating and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
and managing and disseminating and
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.280
and managing and disseminating and
preserving materials what to what extent

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
preserving materials what to what extent
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.990
preserving materials what to what extent
do they apply to this new world of data

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
do they apply to this new world of data
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.330
do they apply to this new world of data
and how can we engage in researchers to

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340
and how can we engage in researchers to
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.920
and how can we engage in researchers to
help them as they explore this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
help them as they explore this
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.380
help them as they explore this
particular area through through

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
particular area through through
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.210
particular area through through
increasing demands and increasing

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
increasing demands and increasing
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.759
increasing demands and increasing
pressures to do more with their data and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769
pressures to do more with their data and
 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.610
pressures to do more with their data and
so in order to do this if we're to be

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620
so in order to do this if we're to be
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.110
so in order to do this if we're to be
successful we really have to have an

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
successful we really have to have an
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.780
successful we really have to have an
understanding of the current situations

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
understanding of the current situations
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.729
understanding of the current situations
of researchers we have able to talk with

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739
of researchers we have able to talk with
 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.340
of researchers we have able to talk with
them and to figure out where they are

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350
them and to figure out where they are
 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.350
them and to figure out where they are
and what we can do to interact with them

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360
and what we can do to interact with them
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.060
and what we can do to interact with them
how can we connect them with the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070
how can we connect them with the
 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.650
how can we connect them with the
information resources and tools that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
information resources and tools that
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.330
information resources and tools that
they need to do the work that they're

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
they need to do the work that they're
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.039
they need to do the work that they're
now expected to do with their data and

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049
now expected to do with their data and
 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.600
now expected to do with their data and
one of the things that we've done it /

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
one of the things that we've done it /
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.550
one of the things that we've done it /
do is to devise something called the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560
do is to devise something called the
 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.130
do is to devise something called the
data curation profile toolkit this is an

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140
data curation profile toolkit this is an
 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.289
data curation profile toolkit this is an
interview protocol where librarians will

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299
interview protocol where librarians will
 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.660
interview protocol where librarians will
go and talk to researchers about the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
go and talk to researchers about the
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.860
go and talk to researchers about the
work they do and there's there's sort of

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
work they do and there's there's sort of
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.289
work they do and there's there's sort of
three overarching themes that come out

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299
three overarching themes that come out
 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.150
three overarching themes that come out
of a completed profile we get

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160
of a completed profile we get
 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.740
of a completed profile we get
information about the individual data

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
information about the individual data
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.390
information about the individual data
set including information about its

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400
set including information about its
 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.000
set including information about its
lifecycle from the point of view of the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010
lifecycle from the point of view of the
 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.530
lifecycle from the point of view of the
researcher and that's a really important

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540
researcher and that's a really important
 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.270
researcher and that's a really important
point that will emphasize a bit later on

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
point that will emphasize a bit later on
 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.949
point that will emphasize a bit later on
on my presentation we get an

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959
on my presentation we get an
 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.210
on my presentation we get an
understanding of the current management

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220
understanding of the current management
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.100
understanding of the current management
practices for the data that are being

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110
practices for the data that are being
 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.630
practices for the data that are being
done by the researcher how are they

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640
done by the researcher how are they
 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.950
done by the researcher how are they
managing and administer

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960
managing and administer
 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.170
managing and administer
working with the data and we get a sense

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180
working with the data and we get a sense
 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.790
working with the data and we get a sense
of the unmet needs that the researcher

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800
of the unmet needs that the researcher
 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.340
of the unmet needs that the researcher
have we we have a sense of what would

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350
have we we have a sense of what would
 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.020
have we we have a sense of what would
the research are like to do with the

data or it's required to do with the
 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.590
data or it's required to do with the
data that they're not able to or don't

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600
data that they're not able to or don't
 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.970
data that they're not able to or don't
feel confident in at the moment so

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980
feel confident in at the moment so
 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.950
feel confident in at the moment so
capturing those unmet needs is all part

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960
capturing those unmet needs is all part
 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.290
capturing those unmet needs is all part
of a data creation profile as well both

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300
of a data creation profile as well both
 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.910
of a data creation profile as well both
the interview protocol and completed

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
the interview protocol and completed
 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.470
the interview protocol and completed
data curation profiles are available

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
data curation profiles are available
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.730
data curation profiles are available
from our website which is data curation

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740
from our website which is data curation
 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.630
from our website which is data curation
profiles org so from the data curation

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640
profiles org so from the data curation
 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240
profiles org so from the data curation
profile as I mentioned we generate an

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
profile as I mentioned we generate an
 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.280
profile as I mentioned we generate an
individual life cycle as purported by

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
individual life cycle as purported by
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.500
individual life cycle as purported by
the researcher and so this is an example

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510
the researcher and so this is an example
 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.790
the researcher and so this is an example
of one of those from a particular

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800
of one of those from a particular
 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.710
of one of those from a particular
profile that I've developed and you can

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720
profile that I've developed and you can
 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.880
profile that I've developed and you can
see there's a fair amount of complexity

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890
see there's a fair amount of complexity
 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.320
see there's a fair amount of complexity
here and I know that you probably can't

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330
here and I know that you probably can't
 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.990
here and I know that you probably can't
read the actual text here but it's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000
read the actual text here but it's
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.220
read the actual text here but it's
comprised of a number of different

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230
comprised of a number of different
 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.350
comprised of a number of different
components it's comprised of the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360

datastage again as articulated by the
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.890
datastage again as articulated by the
researcher so how does the researcher

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
researcher so how does the researcher
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.750
researcher so how does the researcher
interpret the stages that his or her

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760
interpret the stages that his or her
 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.700
interpret the stages that his or her
data moves through this information

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710
data moves through this information
 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.380
data moves through this information
about outputs what is the result of each

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390
about outputs what is the result of each
 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.600
about outputs what is the result of each
stage some information about file size

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610
stage some information about file size
 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.580
stage some information about file size
and the number of files information

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590
and the number of files information
 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.140
and the number of files information
about the formats and the different

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150
about the formats and the different
 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.790
about the formats and the different
formats as they switch through the data

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800
formats as they switch through the data
 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.640
formats as they switch through the data
life cycle and then some notes about the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650
life cycle and then some notes about the
 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.670
life cycle and then some notes about the
particular stage in general to give a

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680
particular stage in general to give a
 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.320
particular stage in general to give a
description of the stage and what

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330
description of the stage and what
 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.700
description of the stage and what
happens and how the researcher

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
happens and how the researcher
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.500
happens and how the researcher
interprets that and I refer to this as

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510
interprets that and I refer to this as
 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.150
interprets that and I refer to this as
the individual data life cycle model

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160
the individual data life cycle model
 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.250
the individual data life cycle model
this is really hyper localized to a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260
this is really hyper localized to a
 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.780
this is really hyper localized to a
particular data set into a particular

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790
particular data set into a particular
 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.210
particular data set into a particular
research lab the goal here really is to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220
research lab the goal here really is to
 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.710
research lab the goal here really is to
capture that information from the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720
capture that information from the
 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.780
capture that information from the
researcher and to use it to inform our

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790
researcher and to use it to inform our
 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.420
researcher and to use it to inform our
services and in interactions with that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430
services and in interactions with that
 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.030
services and in interactions with that
researcher but there's also something

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040
researcher but there's also something
 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.230
researcher but there's also something
called what I've referred to as

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240
called what I've referred to as
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.000
called what I've referred to as
organizational life cycle models so a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010
organizational life cycle models so a
 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.960
organizational life cycle models so a
number of libraries and other

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970
number of libraries and other
 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.120
number of libraries and other
institutions are now offering their data

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130
institutions are now offering their data
 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.950
institutions are now offering their data
services they're kind of aggregating up

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960
services they're kind of aggregating up
 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.630
services they're kind of aggregating up
from the individual data life cycles

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640
from the individual data life cycles
 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.820
from the individual data life cycles
they see to come up with a life cycle

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
they see to come up with a life cycle
 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.830
they see to come up with a life cycle
that's meant to cover a large number of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
that's meant to cover a large number of
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.060
that's meant to cover a large number of
researchers or a large number of

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070
researchers or a large number of
 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.010
researchers or a large number of
disciplines this is an example from the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020
disciplines this is an example from the
 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.180
disciplines this is an example from the
University of Virginia library's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190
University of Virginia library's
 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.920
University of Virginia library's
scientific data Consulting Group they

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930
scientific data Consulting Group they
 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.690
scientific data Consulting Group they
came up with this and they've used this

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700
came up with this and they've used this
 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.680
came up with this and they've used this
as a means to develop their services and

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690
as a means to develop their services and
 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.480
as a means to develop their services and
to communicate those services with

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490
to communicate those services with
 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.650
to communicate those services with
people who may be interested in using

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660
people who may be interested in using
 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.250
people who may be interested in using
them and finally there's something that

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260
them and finally there's something that
 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.050
them and finally there's something that
I refer to as the community life cycle

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060
I refer to as the community life cycle
 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.180
I refer to as the community life cycle
model so communities of practice that

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190
model so communities of practice that
 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.620

are out there such as data one such as
 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.910
are out there such as data one such as
the life cycle model that we're using as

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920
the life cycle model that we're using as
 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.770
the life cycle model that we're using as
the basis for our conversations today

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780
the basis for our conversations today
 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.830
the basis for our conversations today
these are put out by communities to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
these are put out by communities to
 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.719
these are put out by communities to
share best practices

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729

goals and aspirations that we have with
 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.790
goals and aspirations that we have with
regards to the data and representing

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800
regards to the data and representing
 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.089
regards to the data and representing
that in a life cycle model fashion and I

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099
that in a life cycle model fashion and I
 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.709
that in a life cycle model fashion and I
think it behooves us at this point to

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719
think it behooves us at this point to
 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.989
think it behooves us at this point to
sort of stop and ask ourselves what is

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:04.999
sort of stop and ask ourselves what is
 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.670
sort of stop and ask ourselves what is
the benefit of a life cycle model why

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680
the benefit of a life cycle model why
 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.829
the benefit of a life cycle model why
are we clustering ourselves around the

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:08.839
are we clustering ourselves around the
 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.089
are we clustering ourselves around the
use of life cycle models how do they

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099
use of life cycle models how do they
 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.279
use of life cycle models how do they
help us well I think there's a couple of

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289
help us well I think there's a couple of
 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.450
help us well I think there's a couple of
different things that I can come up with

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460
different things that I can come up with
 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.450
different things that I can come up with
in your mileage may vary here about why

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460
in your mileage may vary here about why
 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.369
in your mileage may vary here about why
life cycle models can be of use it helps

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379
life cycle models can be of use it helps
 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.070
life cycle models can be of use it helps

stages of things and it provides a
 

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.309
stages of things and it provides a
framework for us to develop services and

framework for us to develop services and

that people involved in providing these

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659
that people involved in providing these
 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.779
that people involved in providing these
services have a shared understanding of

what it is we're trying to do as well as

services but I also think it's important
 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.269
services but I also think it's important
for us to understand some of the

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:19.279
for us to understand some of the
 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:20.829
for us to understand some of the
limitations of life cycle models and

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:20.839
limitations of life cycle models and
 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.959

doing this as well so I have the quote

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:22.969
doing this as well so I have the quote

here all models are wrong but some are

here all models are wrong but some are
useful I do think lifecycle models are

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:26.689
useful I do think lifecycle models are
 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.540
useful I do think lifecycle models are
very useful but I don't think we should

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550
very useful but I don't think we should
 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.639

be blind to their potential limitations
 

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.139
be blind to their potential limitations
and I think some of those limitations

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:32.149
and I think some of those limitations
 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.209
and I think some of those limitations
are that they reflect the interest

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:34.219
are that they reflect the interest

for some reason you have to go back and

for some reason you have to go back and

up to that ideal that we're putting out
 

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:53.460
up to that ideal that we're putting out
there in our life cycle models and so

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:53.470
there in our life cycle models and so
 

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.470
there in our life cycle models and so
and with that in mind I'm going to take

and with that in mind I'm going to take
 

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.250
and with that in mind I'm going to take

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.120
moving on to data collection data is
acquired or collected in some fashion

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.130
acquired or collected in some fashion
 

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.470

there's usually from the folks that I've
 

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.420
there's usually from the folks that I've
talked to some sort of stage where data

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:57.430
talked to some sort of stage where data
 

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.960
talked to some sort of stage where data
is processed it's it's filtered or

00:09:59.960 --> 00:09:59.970
is processed it's it's filtered or
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.490
is processed it's it's filtered or
manipulated in some way to then prepare

it for analysis they this is where the
 

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.340
it for analysis they this is where the
search question the data is analyzed to

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:08.350
search question the data is analyzed to
 

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.019
search question the data is analyzed to
try to answer that research question and

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:10.029
try to answer that research question and
 

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:11.280
try to answer that research question and
to generate value for that particular

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.290
to generate value for that particular
 

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.220
to generate value for that particular
researcher but all of this is done with

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:14.230
researcher but all of this is done with
 

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.259
researcher but all of this is done with
sort of the uber stage in mind with

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:16.269
sort of the uber stage in mind with
 

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:19.620
sort of the uber stage in mind with
publishing the paper that is driving the

publishing the paper that is driving the
 

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.210
publishing the paper that is driving the
data life cycle from the researchers

data life cycle from the researchers
 

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.579
data life cycle from the researchers
that I've talked to and oftentimes they

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:23.589
that I've talked to and oftentimes they
 

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.519
that I've talked to and oftentimes they
will include publication as a stage in

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:26.529
will include publication as a stage in
 

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:27.990
will include publication as a stage in
their life cycle when I asked them to

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000
their life cycle when I asked them to
 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.400
their life cycle when I asked them to
describe the life cycle of their data

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.410
describe the life cycle of their data
 

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.050

publish my data in fact I publish them

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.130
publish my data in fact I publish them
 

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.519
publish my data in fact I publish them
in figures and tables in the article

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:35.529

itself and that constitutes data

00:10:37.319 --> 00:10:37.329
itself and that constitutes data
 

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:40.560
itself and that constitutes data
publishing in my mind and so I think we

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:40.570
publishing in my mind and so I think we
 

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.540
publishing in my mind and so I think we
need to be aware that this is sort of a

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.550
need to be aware that this is sort of a
 

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.060
need to be aware that this is sort of a
very narrow path that that folks are

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.070
very narrow path that that folks are
 

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.530
very narrow path that that folks are
going down in the current environment

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:46.540
going down in the current environment
 

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.259

assure is done I don't see this so it's
 

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.040
assure is done I don't see this so it's
not described to me by researchers as a

not described to me by researchers as a
 

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.290

separate and distinct stage it's not
 

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.699

and assurance goes through those initial

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.350
and assurance goes through those initial
 

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.680

four stages of the data life cycle but

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:04.690
four stages of the data life cycle but
 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.420
four stages of the data life cycle but
assurance is done in a very narrow

assurance is done in a very narrow
 

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.790
assurance is done in a very narrow
context it's assuring that the data can

initial architecture for deepen what is
 

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.110
initial architecture for deepen what is
it going to look like how is content

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120
it going to look like how is content

going to then be replicated out to the

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039
going to then be replicated out to the
 

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:03.649
going to then be replicated out to the
other nodes what's that framework look

00:19:03.649 --> 00:19:03.659
other nodes what's that framework look
 

00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:05.509
other nodes what's that framework look
like and they started off an exercise

00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:05.519
like and they started off an exercise
 

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.090
like and they started off an exercise
where each repository created a strawman

architecture if they were in charge what
 

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.869
architecture if they were in charge what
it would look like and then over the

00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:11.879
it would look like and then over the
 

00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:14.119
it would look like and then over the
course of successive weeks they worked

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:14.129
course of successive weeks they worked
 

00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:15.919
course of successive weeks they worked
through each of those proposals and came

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:15.929
through each of those proposals and came
 

00:19:15.929 --> 00:19:18.049
through each of those proposals and came
up with a final design for deepen which

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059
up with a final design for deepen which
 

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.129

publishing the paper from a data
 

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.290
publishing the paper from a data
perspective we see that it's a little

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.300
perspective we see that it's a little
 

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.440

bit short-sighted and often with the

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.450
bit short-sighted and often with the
 

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.420
bit short-sighted and often with the
data that's the beginning when you

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.490
data that's the beginning when you
publish the paper or near the beginning

I should say so I think that was an
interesting observation as well and that

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:04.390
interesting observation as well and that
 

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.260

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.000
I think that reminds me a little bit of
our discussions earlier this morning

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.010
our discussions earlier this morning
 

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.359
our discussions earlier this morning
where we're talking about how the

00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:30.369
where we're talking about how the
 

00:42:30.369 --> 00:42:34.000
where we're talking about how the
benefits really need to be apparent to

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.010
benefits really need to be apparent to
 

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:38.160
benefits really need to be apparent to
the researchers who are out there and

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.170
the researchers who are out there and
 

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.829
the researchers who are out there and
finally Jake mentioned that they we need

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839
finally Jake mentioned that they we need
 

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:44.650
finally Jake mentioned that they we need
to work earlier with researchers during

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:44.660
to work earlier with researchers during
 

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.569
to work earlier with researchers during
the life cycle I thought that was really

00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:46.579
the life cycle I thought that was really
 

00:42:46.579 --> 00:42:48.510
the life cycle I thought that was really
a great observation

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520
a great observation
 

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.390
a great observation
Steve Morales talked about the deep end

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400
Steve Morales talked about the deep end
 

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.340
Steve Morales talked about the deep end
how they're organizing a federated

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:53.350
how they're organizing a federated
 

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.890
how they're organizing a federated
system of repositories and how they've

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:55.900
system of repositories and how they've
 

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.200
system of repositories and how they've
got over 50 universities already

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.210
got over 50 universities already
 

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.740
got over 50 universities already
involved and they've identified five

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:01.750
involved and they've identified five
 

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.430
involved and they've identified five
replicating nodes and the challenges as

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440
replicating nodes and the challenges as
 

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.410
replicating nodes and the challenges as
well such as the challenges for

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:07.420
well such as the challenges for
 

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.190
well such as the challenges for
succession rights these the challenge

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200
succession rights these the challenge
 

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.340
succession rights these the challenge
for sustainability models the will

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.350
for sustainability models the will
 

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.090
for sustainability models the will
facilitate long-term preservation and

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:17.100
facilitate long-term preservation and
 

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.620
facilitate long-term preservation and
how they really need to focus on the

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:19.630
how they really need to focus on the
 

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.830
how they really need to focus on the
costs as well as the potential revenues

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:22.840
costs as well as the potential revenues
 

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:27.690
costs as well as the potential revenues
in order to move forward in this and I

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:27.700
in order to move forward in this and I
 

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.210
in order to move forward in this and I
think some of the things that I saw very

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:30.220
think some of the things that I saw very
 

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.280
think some of the things that I saw very
valuable in this is that one of their

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:32.290
valuable in this is that one of their
 

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.290
valuable in this is that one of their
goals is to improve efficiency of data

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:34.300
goals is to improve efficiency of data
 

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.950
goals is to improve efficiency of data
stewardship and as well to improve the

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960
stewardship and as well to improve the
 

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.180
stewardship and as well to improve the
funding opportunities so that they can

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:41.190
funding opportunities so that they can
 

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:45.660
funding opportunities so that they can
enable long-term our data access and

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:45.670
enable long-term our data access and
 

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.000
enable long-term our data access and
then finally Linda BB she talked to us

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.010
then finally Linda BB she talked to us
 

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.460
then finally Linda BB she talked to us
about easing the burden of the

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.470
about easing the burden of the
 

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:56.010
about easing the burden of the
supplemental materials and she observed

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:56.020
supplemental materials and she observed
 

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.350
supplemental materials and she observed
how the new technologies have given us

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:58.360
how the new technologies have given us
 

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.500
how the new technologies have given us
great affordances all these new

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:01.510
great affordances all these new
 

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.540
great affordances all these new
capabilities but at the same time

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:03.550
capabilities but at the same time
 

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.120
capabilities but at the same time
they've brought new challenges with them

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:06.130
they've brought new challenges with them
 

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.990
they've brought new challenges with them
and resulted in she mentioned lack of

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000
and resulted in she mentioned lack of
 

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.380
and resulted in she mentioned lack of
standards some abuses extensive growth

hanging out there was a problem that

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:20.320
hanging out there was a problem that
 

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.580
hanging out there was a problem that
needs to be addressed she also offered

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:23.590
needs to be addressed she also offered
 

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:26.280

technical considerations and I thought

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.070
technical considerations and I thought
 

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.870
technical considerations and I thought
it was great that she and ended her talk

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880
it was great that she and ended her talk
 

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.660
it was great that she and ended her talk
saying that she hopes it would be

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:42.670
saying that she hopes it would be

research life cycle which brings me to

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:47.860
research life cycle which brings me to
 

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.490
research life cycle which brings me to
another observation and that I think

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500
another observation and that I think
 

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.100
another observation and that I think
when we hear about these different

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:55.110
when we hear about these different
 

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.930
when we hear about these different
systems the network's the tools that are

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:57.940
systems the network's the tools that are
 

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.020
systems the network's the tools that are
all being developed well we have to

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:01.030
all being developed well we have to
 

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:05.760
all being developed well we have to
remember that we've seen this before in

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:05.770
remember that we've seen this before in
 

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.970
remember that we've seen this before in
the development of mis systems for

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:08.980
the development of mis systems for
 

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.570

systems as well we're all these

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:14.950
systems as well we're all these
 

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.920
systems as well we're all these
different groups are all developing

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:16.930
different groups are all developing
 

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.730
different groups are all developing
their own little silos if you will and

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740
their own little silos if you will and
 

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.550
their own little silos if you will and
these are great that they're doing this

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:23.560
these are great that they're doing this
 

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.230
these are great that they're doing this
but I think we also need to think about

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240
but I think we also need to think about
 

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.980
but I think we also need to think about
ways to integrate them so that in the

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:28.990
ways to integrate them so that in the
 

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.100
ways to integrate them so that in the
end the researchers will have choices

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.110
end the researchers will have choices
 

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.460
end the researchers will have choices
and the other parties in the process as

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:35.470
and the other parties in the process as
 

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:38.250
and the other parties in the process as
well will have choices and not just

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:38.260
well will have choices and not just
 

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:39.780
well will have choices and not just
choices that they have to make at the

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:39.790
choices that they have to make at the
 

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.970
choices that they have to make at the
beginning which repository am I going

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:41.980

with which network which tools but give

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920
with which network which tools but give
 

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.980
with which network which tools but give
them choices so that they will have

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:46.990
them choices so that they will have

data life cycle so if they change their

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280
data life cycle so if they change their
 

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.700
data life cycle so if they change their
minds later they can say no I'm no

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:53.710
minds later they can say no I'm no
 

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.830

thought the life cycle models were

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:33.940
thought the life cycle models were
 

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.060
thought the life cycle models were
fascinating I mean I'm seeing their

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.070
fascinating I mean I'm seeing their
 

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.050
fascinating I mean I'm seeing their
thinking about that from the perspective

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:37.060
thinking about that from the perspective
 

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.420
thinking about that from the perspective
of a researcher and like you said

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.430
of a researcher and like you said
 

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.100
of a researcher and like you said
research is very messy and I was trying

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.110
research is very messy and I was trying
 

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.040
research is very messy and I was trying
very hard to fit what i do into that and

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.050
very hard to fit what i do into that and
 

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.390
very hard to fit what i do into that and

analyze one of those models you showed
and in the analysis itself generates

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160
and in the analysis itself generates
 

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.790
and in the analysis itself generates
data yeah and actually one of the key

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800

it up into a container that's going to
be put into the other replicating nodes

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:08.300
be put into the other replicating nodes
 

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.480
be put into the other replicating nodes
and so we're looking at text we're

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:10.490
and so we're looking at text we're
 

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.300
and so we're looking at text we're
looking at research traditional archive

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:12.310
looking at research traditional archive
 

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.650
looking at research traditional archive
data for libraries that they normally

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:14.660
data for libraries that they normally
 

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.540
data for libraries that they normally
used to be in their archives we're

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:16.550
used to be in their archives we're
 

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.680
used to be in their archives we're
looking at multimedia it's just it's not

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:20.690
looking at multimedia it's just it's not
 

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:22.480
looking at multimedia it's just it's not
going to be specific to any one kind of

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:22.490
going to be specific to any one kind of
 

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:24.700
going to be specific to any one kind of
data although certain disciplines are

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:24.710
data although certain disciplines are
 

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.560
data although certain disciplines are
further advanced in other words they're

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:26.570
further advanced in other words they're
 

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.970
further advanced in other words they're
dead their data is really ready to go

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:27.980
dead their data is really ready to go
 

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.470
dead their data is really ready to go
into long-term preservation and other

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480
into long-term preservation and other
 

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.840
into long-term preservation and other
disciplines the data probably isn't

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:31.850
disciplines the data probably isn't
 

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.940
disciplines the data probably isn't
ready yet so I don't know if they

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:33.950
ready yet so I don't know if they
 

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.510
ready yet so I don't know if they
is your question or not yeah it takes

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520
is your question or not yeah it takes
 

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.210
is your question or not yeah it takes
some thought to figure out exactly what

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:43.220
some thought to figure out exactly what
 

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.380
some thought to figure out exactly what
you're going to be able to host you

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:44.390
you're going to be able to host you
 

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.910
you're going to be able to host you
can't you just can't be completely

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920
can't you just can't be completely
 

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.579
can't you just can't be completely
agnostic so you know there are types of

00:51:48.579 --> 00:51:48.589
agnostic so you know there are types of
 

00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:51.220
agnostic so you know there are types of
medical images that you know maybe a

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.230
medical images that you know maybe a
 

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.930
medical images that you know maybe a
file type that you can score store on a

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:52.940
file type that you can score store on a
 

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.480
file type that you can score store on a
disk but that file type in in that

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:55.490
disk but that file type in in that
 

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:59.050
disk but that file type in in that
format is useless to anybody so I think

00:51:59.050 --> 00:51:59.060
format is useless to anybody so I think
 

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.700
format is useless to anybody so I think
it takes a bit more thought than just

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:00.710
it takes a bit more thought than just
 

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:01.750
it takes a bit more thought than just
saying you're agnostic well we're going

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760
saying you're agnostic well we're going
 

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.950
saying you're agnostic well we're going
to start with the low-hanging fruit

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960
to start with the low-hanging fruit
 

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.510
to start with the low-hanging fruit
first of all I mean it's for example

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.520
first of all I mean it's for example
 

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.400
first of all I mean it's for example
only one of the five replicating nodes

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:06.410
only one of the five replicating nodes
 

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.010
only one of the five replicating nodes
right now is can handle medical research

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:09.020
right now is can handle medical research
 

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.660
right now is can handle medical research
data I think chronopoulos is the only

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:10.670
data I think chronopoulos is the only
 

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.300
data I think chronopoulos is the only
one that's approved for medical data at

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:13.310
one that's approved for medical data at
 

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:14.380
one that's approved for medical data at
this point so we're obviously can't be

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:14.390
this point so we're obviously can't be
 

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.329
this point so we're obviously can't be
taking in medical data until there's

00:52:16.329 --> 00:52:16.339
taking in medical data until there's
 

00:52:16.339 --> 00:52:18.130
taking in medical data until there's
HIPAA compliance e across at least three

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:18.140
HIPAA compliance e across at least three
 

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.770
HIPAA compliance e across at least three
nodes and so what you'll mean this these

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:20.780
nodes and so what you'll mean this these
 

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.700
nodes and so what you'll mean this these
things will come out in the

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:21.710
things will come out in the
 

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.079
things will come out in the

00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:25.180
conversations that are going to start up
really this week back and forth to find

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:25.190
really this week back and forth to find
 

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.650
really this week back and forth to find
out what are the right communities and

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:26.660
out what are the right communities and
 

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.870
out what are the right communities and

not going to start with all the data

00:52:39.819 --> 00:52:39.829
not going to start with all the data
 

00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:41.650
not going to start with all the data
right now but our goal would be that as

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:41.660
right now but our goal would be that as
 

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.050

hundreds of terabytes at night I mean

00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:56.660
hundreds of terabytes at night I mean
 

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.470
hundreds of terabytes at night I mean
that's we put some stress on the system

00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480
that's we put some stress on the system

the columns I think for most of you

00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839
the columns I think for most of you
 

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:13.569
the columns I think for most of you
that's why uh well my my questions

00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:13.579
that's why uh well my my questions
 

00:53:13.579 --> 00:53:16.089
that's why uh well my my questions
actually very very similar the last one

00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:16.099
actually very very similar the last one
 

00:53:16.099 --> 00:53:20.650
actually very very similar the last one
but just also for Steven yeah because I

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:20.660
but just also for Steven yeah because I
 

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.140
but just also for Steven yeah because I
think with the the metadata with the

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:23.150
think with the the metadata with the
 

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.599
think with the the metadata with the
data description a couple of things with

00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:25.609
data description a couple of things with
 

00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:28.660
data description a couple of things with
people's experience one of my colleagues

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:28.670
people's experience one of my colleagues
 

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.420
people's experience one of my colleagues
describes it with a lot of tech people

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:31.430
describes it with a lot of tech people
 

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.290
describes it with a lot of tech people
they equate storage with access instead

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:35.300
they equate storage with access instead
 

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.660
they equate storage with access instead
of the metadata so you know having the

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:37.670
of the metadata so you know having the
 

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:39.430
of the metadata so you know having the
metadata in the description for access

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440
metadata in the description for access
 

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.160
metadata in the description for access
and also that yeah the disciplines are

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:42.170
and also that yeah the disciplines are
 

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.980
and also that yeah the disciplines are
very very different and how you describe

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:44.990
very very different and how you describe
 

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.210
very very different and how you describe
the data social science what

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220
the data social science what
 

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.740
the data social science what
they probably need from the description

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:48.750
they probably need from the description
 

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.080
they probably need from the description
in the metadata very different from

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:51.090
in the metadata very different from
 

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.130
in the metadata very different from
science data so yet it just seems like I

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140
science data so yet it just seems like I
 

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.570
science data so yet it just seems like I
mean you kind of talked a little bit

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:56.580
mean you kind of talked a little bit
 

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.220
mean you kind of talked a little bit
about what your plans are but yeah if

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:58.230
about what your plans are but yeah if
 

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:03.380
about what your plans are but yeah if
you had a lot of of what you know your

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:03.390
you had a lot of of what you know your
 

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.750
you had a lot of of what you know your
committees and stuff to do that sort of

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760
committees and stuff to do that sort of
 

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.339
committees and stuff to do that sort of
thing I think that's very very important

00:54:07.339 --> 00:54:07.349
thing I think that's very very important
 

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:10.339
thing I think that's very very important
for us being able to access it and find

00:54:10.339 --> 00:54:10.349
for us being able to access it and find
 

00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:18.080
for us being able to access it and find
it in the future hi im sue moon sake

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:18.090
it in the future hi im sue moon sake
 

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:19.910
it in the future hi im sue moon sake
from University of Illinois I have a

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920
from University of Illinois I have a
 

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.349
from University of Illinois I have a
kind of follow-up question myself so

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359
kind of follow-up question myself so
 

00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:26.000
kind of follow-up question myself so
from what I heard it seemed that you are

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.010
from what I heard it seemed that you are
 

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.790
from what I heard it seemed that you are
basically doing kind of beat level

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800
basically doing kind of beat level
 

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.130
basically doing kind of beat level
preservation so basically what is

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140
preservation so basically what is
 

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.349
preservation so basically what is
ingested in the system is given back to

00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359
ingested in the system is given back to
 

00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:37.460
ingested in the system is given back to
the user but that I mean that kind of

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:37.470
the user but that I mean that kind of
 

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:39.920
the user but that I mean that kind of
beat level preservation has been

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:39.930
beat level preservation has been
 

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:42.520
beat level preservation has been
discussed in the last 15 years as not

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:42.530
discussed in the last 15 years as not
 

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:46.010
discussed in the last 15 years as not
really solving the problems with digital

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020
really solving the problems with digital
 

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.330

that when data is is collected when it's

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140
that when data is is collected when it's
 

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.350
that when data is is collected when it's
produced that there's some amount of

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:33.360
produced that there's some amount of
 

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.960
produced that there's some amount of
money that stays with that data for the

sharing going forward that's that's the
 

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.710

we've been called upon to bring that

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740
we've been called upon to bring that

question out to the researchers is what

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220
question out to the researchers is what
 

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:35.690
question out to the researchers is what
would motivate you to set aside some of

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700
would motivate you to set aside some of
 

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:39.140
would motivate you to set aside some of
your funding for your data to be

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:39.150
your funding for your data to be
 

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.560
your funding for your data to be
accessed in the future for sharing and

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:42.570
accessed in the future for sharing and
 

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.390
accessed in the future for sharing and
preservation once you're done with it

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400
preservation once you're done with it
 

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.260
preservation once you're done with it
and if that answer is nothing is going

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.270
and if that answer is nothing is going
 

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.210
and if that answer is nothing is going
to motivate me to set aside some of my

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220
to motivate me to set aside some of my
 

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.580
to motivate me to set aside some of my
funding for preservation and access I'd

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:52.590
funding for preservation and access I'd
 

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:55.100
funding for preservation and access I'd
like to hear that if something would

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:55.110
like to hear that if something would
 

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.440
like to hear that if something would
motivate you I would love to hear that

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.450
motivate you I would love to hear that
 

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.540
motivate you I would love to hear that
because I think it's a conversation that

00:58:59.540 --> 00:58:59.550
because I think it's a conversation that
 

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:03.890
because I think it's a conversation that
needs to take place anyway I just

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900
needs to take place anyway I just
 

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.560
needs to take place anyway I just
interject here I think what I would like

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:06.570
interject here I think what I would like
 

00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:12.410
interject here I think what I would like
to see is some funding that comes in for

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420
to see is some funding that comes in for
 

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.620
to see is some funding that comes in for
the project that is associated with the

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:15.630
the project that is associated with the
 

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:18.650
the project that is associated with the
long-term preservation stewardship and

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660
long-term preservation stewardship and
 

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.860
long-term preservation stewardship and
access to the data and so if that money

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:21.870
access to the data and so if that money
 

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:24.280
access to the data and so if that money
was earmarked from the beginning for

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:24.290
was earmarked from the beginning for
 

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:28.520
was earmarked from the beginning for
that purpose then we could be assured

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:28.530
that purpose then we could be assured
 

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.030
that purpose then we could be assured
that it would be used for that purpose

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040
that it would be used for that purpose
 

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.850
that it would be used for that purpose
so my name is Garrett Klimek so we run

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:34.860

comment regarding your marketplace right

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.070
comment regarding your marketplace right
 

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.100
comment regarding your marketplace right
you've got to make a marketplace you got

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:46.110
you've got to make a marketplace you got
 

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:48.380
you've got to make a marketplace you got
to make it working for providers and for

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:48.390
to make it working for providers and for
 

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:53.000
to make it working for providers and for
users the people that provide would like

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.010
users the people that provide would like
 

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.940
users the people that provide would like
to sell not pay right so you have to

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:55.950
to sell not pay right so you have to
 

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:58.270
to sell not pay right so you have to
create a marketplace in which users

00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280
create a marketplace in which users
 

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.000
create a marketplace in which users
ultimately willing to pay for access

that is how we trade products on the

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540
that is how we trade products on the
 

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.490
that is how we trade products on the
market the providers get something not

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500
market the providers get something not
 

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.160
market the providers get something not
pay for something so you have to develop

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.170
pay for something so you have to develop
 

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:12.530
pay for something so you have to develop
some some infrastructure where that is

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540
some some infrastructure where that is
 

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.230
some some infrastructure where that is
actually a similar to an economy that

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240
actually a similar to an economy that
 

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:27.200
actually a similar to an economy that
works quite well

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.210
 

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.240
bob chennai was the original respondent

but anyway I do have a questions partly
I think something Jake said talking

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:37.660
I think something Jake said talking
 

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.690
I think something Jake said talking
about the data life cycle from the

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:39.700
about the data life cycle from the
 

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.250
about the data life cycle from the
viewpoint of the individual researcher

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:41.260
viewpoint of the individual researcher
 

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.440

but I'm just curious if you have

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.450
but I'm just curious if you have
 

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.090
but I'm just curious if you have
comments and thoughts about the

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:45.100
comments and thoughts about the
 

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.970
comments and thoughts about the
community data life cycle I mean we're

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:47.980
community data life cycle I mean we're
 

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.130
community data life cycle I mean we're
talking when we're talking at the level

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:50.140

do you see you know the individual model

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.030
do you see you know the individual model
 

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.350
do you see you know the individual model

preservation it you know is very

preservation it you know is very
difficult I I don't think it's

difficult I I don't think it's

this the second big issue that hasn't
really been been brought up very much

but is very related to cost is the
 

01:12:43.749 --> 01:12:45.449
but is very related to cost is the
question of of what are we actually

because I'm trying to get people to to
 

01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:09.169
because I'm trying to get people to to
to think about preserving things in

01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179
to think about preserving things in
 

01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:12.029

know if we tried to preserve and curate

01:13:34.199 --> 01:13:34.209
know if we tried to preserve and curate
 

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:36.119
know if we tried to preserve and curate
to the highest level everything that

to the highest level everything that
 

01:13:36.129 --> 01:13:38.369
to the highest level everything that
came out we would simply bankrupt the

came out we would simply bankrupt the

you know I've thought of the question

you know I've thought of the question
 

01:13:46.599 --> 01:13:49.229
you know I've thought of the question
but not the answer is is how do we

01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:49.239
but not the answer is is how do we
 

01:13:49.239 --> 01:13:52.770
but not the answer is is how do we
choose what we invest our our limited

choose what we invest our our limited

sense so that's not our policy our

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.679
talking this morning about using peer
review to help us go through these

01:14:19.679 --> 01:14:19.689
review to help us go through these
 

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:22.469
review to help us go through these
things it specifically is targeted to

01:14:22.469 --> 01:14:22.479
things it specifically is targeted to
 

01:14:22.479 --> 01:14:24.270
things it specifically is targeted to
take the community norms into account

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280
take the community norms into account
 

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:31.699
take the community norms into account
yeah

01:14:31.699 --> 01:14:31.709
 

01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:34.169
probably follow on to some of those but

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:34.179
probably follow on to some of those but
 

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:36.270
probably follow on to some of those but
in terms of in terms of the demand and

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280
in terms of in terms of the demand and
 

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.129
in terms of in terms of the demand and
actual usage of this data may be

01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:38.139
actual usage of this data may be
 

01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:39.209
actual usage of this data may be
something you could speak to some of the

01:14:39.209 --> 01:14:39.219
something you could speak to some of the
 

01:14:39.219 --> 01:14:41.370
something you could speak to some of the
better examples of maybe it's categories

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:41.380
better examples of maybe it's categories
 

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.489
better examples of maybe it's categories
of use in terms of replication of a

01:14:44.489 --> 01:14:44.499
of use in terms of replication of a
 

01:14:44.499 --> 01:14:46.469
of use in terms of replication of a
certain study or or using the data for a

01:14:46.469 --> 01:14:46.479
certain study or or using the data for a
 

01:14:46.479 --> 01:14:47.939
certain study or or using the data for a
new study but I mean what kind of

01:14:47.939 --> 01:14:47.949
new study but I mean what kind of
 

01:14:47.949 --> 01:14:50.159
new study but I mean what kind of
outrage or was there any reaction when

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:50.169
outrage or was there any reaction when
 

01:14:50.169 --> 01:14:52.199
outrage or was there any reaction when
the journal no longer started accepting

01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:52.209
the journal no longer started accepting
 

01:14:52.209 --> 01:14:54.209
the journal no longer started accepting
or stopped accepting the supplemental

01:14:54.209 --> 01:14:54.219
or stopped accepting the supplemental
 

01:14:54.219 --> 01:14:55.770
or stopped accepting the supplemental
materials and I feel like a lot of these

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:55.780
materials and I feel like a lot of these
 

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.259
materials and I feel like a lot of these
uses of the data probably can drive the

01:14:58.259 --> 01:14:58.269
uses of the data probably can drive the
 

01:14:58.269 --> 01:14:59.909
uses of the data probably can drive the
prioritization of what needs to be

01:14:59.909 --> 01:14:59.919
prioritization of what needs to be
 

01:14:59.919 --> 01:15:01.709
prioritization of what needs to be
captured so are there stories like that

01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719
captured so are there stories like that
 

01:15:01.719 --> 01:15:08.520
captured so are there stories like that
yet I don't really think so there was a

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:08.530
yet I don't really think so there was a
 

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:11.219
yet I don't really think so there was a
big buzz when the journal stopped but

01:15:11.219 --> 01:15:11.229
big buzz when the journal stopped but
 

01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:13.140
big buzz when the journal stopped but
the truth is I think most of their data

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:13.150
the truth is I think most of their data
 

01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:15.359
the truth is I think most of their data
are already being deposited in other

01:15:15.359 --> 01:15:15.369
are already being deposited in other
 

01:15:15.369 --> 01:15:19.259
are already being deposited in other
repositories um and and now it's just

01:15:19.259 --> 01:15:19.269
repositories um and and now it's just
 

01:15:19.269 --> 01:15:27.120
repositories um and and now it's just
sort of a historical no so my question

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:27.130
sort of a historical no so my question
 

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.159
sort of a historical no so my question
is kind of in between the idea of a

01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:29.169
is kind of in between the idea of a
 

01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:31.290
is kind of in between the idea of a
business model and the kind of services

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:31.300
business model and the kind of services
 

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.750
business model and the kind of services
that you provide so I mean given the

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760
that you provide so I mean given the
 

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.379
that you provide so I mean given the
fact that we there are cloud storage out

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:37.389
fact that we there are cloud storage out
 

01:15:37.389 --> 01:15:39.529
fact that we there are cloud storage out
there you know I'm just thinking about

01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:39.539
there you know I'm just thinking about
 

01:15:39.539 --> 01:15:43.770
there you know I'm just thinking about
Amazon s3 this kind of already used in

01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:43.780
Amazon s3 this kind of already used in
 

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.620
Amazon s3 this kind of already used in
the academic community kind of cloud

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:46.630
the academic community kind of cloud
 

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:48.540
the academic community kind of cloud
storage with replication and all these

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:48.550
storage with replication and all these
 

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:50.729
storage with replication and all these
kind of things what would be the benefit

01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:50.739
kind of things what would be the benefit
 

01:15:50.739 --> 01:15:53.659
kind of things what would be the benefit
of people coming to you instead of using

01:15:53.659 --> 01:15:53.669
of people coming to you instead of using
 

01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:55.830
of people coming to you instead of using
this kind of services that are already

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840
this kind of services that are already
 

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.949
this kind of services that are already
are out there and have well established

01:15:58.949 --> 01:15:58.959
are out there and have well established
 

01:15:58.959 --> 01:16:04.560
are out there and have well established
infrastructure and and so on and given

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:04.570
infrastructure and and so on and given
 

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:06.870
infrastructure and and so on and given
the fact that this idea was proposed and

01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880
the fact that this idea was proposed and
 

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.270
the fact that this idea was proposed and
sixty libraries came together instantly

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280
sixty libraries came together instantly
 

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.370
sixty libraries came together instantly
and said we need to do this with full

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:11.380
and said we need to do this with full
 

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.179
and said we need to do this with full
knowledge of what Amazon's providing

01:16:14.179 --> 01:16:14.189
knowledge of what Amazon's providing
 

01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:16.469
knowledge of what Amazon's providing
there's probably a lot of hands in here

01:16:16.469 --> 01:16:16.479
there's probably a lot of hands in here
 

01:16:16.479 --> 01:16:18.299
there's probably a lot of hands in here
that could talk to these specific needs

01:16:18.299 --> 01:16:18.309
that could talk to these specific needs
 

01:16:18.309 --> 01:16:19.739
that could talk to these specific needs
I don't know if we need to go down that

01:16:19.739 --> 01:16:19.749
I don't know if we need to go down that
 

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:21.779
I don't know if we need to go down that
tangent right now but we're certainly

01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:21.789
tangent right now but we're certainly
 

01:16:21.789 --> 01:16:25.020
tangent right now but we're certainly
not competing against somebody in the

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:25.030
not competing against somebody in the
 

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:26.459
not competing against somebody in the
realm of Amazon three this is a

01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:26.469
realm of Amazon three this is a
 

01:16:26.469 --> 01:16:28.830
realm of Amazon three this is a
community people the university

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840
community people the university
 

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.270
community people the university
community wants to own their own

01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280
community wants to own their own
 

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.799
community wants to own their own
solution they want to control how this

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:34.809
solution they want to control how this
 

01:16:34.809 --> 01:16:37.259
solution they want to control how this
works for the long term as part of their

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:37.269
works for the long term as part of their
 

01:16:37.269 --> 01:16:40.379
works for the long term as part of their
core mission of preserving the academic

01:16:40.379 --> 01:16:40.389
core mission of preserving the academic
 

01:16:40.389 --> 01:16:43.139
core mission of preserving the academic
record so it's not really just about who

01:16:43.139 --> 01:16:43.149
record so it's not really just about who
 

01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.649
record so it's not really just about who
can provide

01:16:43.649 --> 01:16:43.659
can provide
 

01:16:43.659 --> 01:16:45.989
can provide
I'd the best bit level preservation at

01:16:45.989 --> 01:16:45.999
I'd the best bit level preservation at
 

01:16:45.999 --> 01:16:48.270
I'd the best bit level preservation at
the best price that's really not where

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280
the best price that's really not where
 

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.799
the best price that's really not where
we're working and there are a couple of

01:16:49.799 --> 01:16:49.809
we're working and there are a couple of
 

01:16:49.809 --> 01:16:51.719
we're working and there are a couple of
hands that probably answered me yeah I

01:16:51.719 --> 01:16:51.729
hands that probably answered me yeah I
 

01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:54.120
hands that probably answered me yeah I
mrs. Bennett Blumenthal i'm here at

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.130
mrs. Bennett Blumenthal i'm here at
 

01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:57.479
mrs. Bennett Blumenthal i'm here at
columbia university and run a data

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:57.489
columbia university and run a data
 

01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:59.759
columbia university and run a data
library but that i think that the

01:16:59.759 --> 01:16:59.769
library but that i think that the
 

01:16:59.769 --> 01:17:02.629
library but that i think that the
precise issue is that the cloud the

01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639
precise issue is that the cloud the
 

01:17:02.639 --> 01:17:07.080
precise issue is that the cloud the
cloud the cloud is not about digital

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:07.090
cloud the cloud is not about digital
 

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:10.350
cloud the cloud is not about digital
preservation it's actually precisely the

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360
preservation it's actually precisely the
 

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.149
preservation it's actually precisely the
opposite of that it's only interested in

01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159
opposite of that it's only interested in
 

01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.770
opposite of that it's only interested in
things at the moment it's a

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:13.780
things at the moment it's a
 

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.229
things at the moment it's a
computational service they'll keep the

01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239
computational service they'll keep the
 

01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:18.029
computational service they'll keep the
data as long as you pay them i mean they

01:17:18.029 --> 01:17:18.039
data as long as you pay them i mean they
 

01:17:18.039 --> 01:17:19.979
data as long as you pay them i mean they
throw it away immediately when you stop

01:17:19.979 --> 01:17:19.989
throw it away immediately when you stop
 

01:17:19.989 --> 01:17:23.399
throw it away immediately when you stop
which is not digital preservation in any

01:17:23.399 --> 01:17:23.409
which is not digital preservation in any
 

01:17:23.409 --> 01:17:26.429
which is not digital preservation in any
sense this is rob cordell on oklahoma

01:17:26.429 --> 01:17:26.439
sense this is rob cordell on oklahoma
 

01:17:26.439 --> 01:17:29.609
sense this is rob cordell on oklahoma
university libraries in fact in the

01:17:29.609 --> 01:17:29.619
university libraries in fact in the
 

01:17:29.619 --> 01:17:31.529
university libraries in fact in the
conversations were having with doris

01:17:31.529 --> 01:17:31.539
conversations were having with doris
 

01:17:31.539 --> 01:17:33.390
conversations were having with doris
space which is one of the agencies

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400
space which is one of the agencies
 

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.319

working with DPN we are in fact looking

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:37.329
working with DPN we are in fact looking
 

01:17:37.329 --> 01:17:39.870
working with DPN we are in fact looking
at how some commercial service providers

01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880
at how some commercial service providers
 

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.699
at how some commercial service providers
might integrate with a long-term digital

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:41.709
might integrate with a long-term digital
 

01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:43.589
might integrate with a long-term digital
repository so for example maybe not

01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:43.599
repository so for example maybe not
 

01:17:43.599 --> 01:17:46.290
repository so for example maybe not
amazon s3 but amazon glacier which is

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:46.300
amazon s3 but amazon glacier which is
 

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.390
amazon s3 but amazon glacier which is
actually a service that is being offered

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400
actually a service that is being offered
 

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.640
actually a service that is being offered
by amazon could be a solution the key

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:50.650
by amazon could be a solution the key
 

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:52.589
by amazon could be a solution the key
thing however is you need to have a

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:52.599
thing however is you need to have a
 

01:17:52.599 --> 01:17:54.870
thing however is you need to have a
layer on top of that which provides some

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880
layer on top of that which provides some
 

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.020
layer on top of that which provides some
level of packaging and metadata and the

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:58.030
level of packaging and metadata and the
 

01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:59.939
level of packaging and metadata and the
key aspect of DPN is that it doesn't

01:17:59.939 --> 01:17:59.949
key aspect of DPN is that it doesn't
 

01:17:59.949 --> 01:18:01.859
key aspect of DPN is that it doesn't
rely on any one piece of technology and

01:18:01.859 --> 01:18:01.869
rely on any one piece of technology and
 

01:18:01.869 --> 01:18:03.719
rely on any one piece of technology and
ain't no one particular vendor in terms

01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:03.729
ain't no one particular vendor in terms
 

01:18:03.729 --> 01:18:05.640
ain't no one particular vendor in terms
of how you store it that's a very active

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:05.650
of how you store it that's a very active
 

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:07.140
of how you store it that's a very active
research conversation it's something

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:07.150
research conversation it's something
 

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.489
research conversation it's something
that we're talking about with with deep

01:18:08.489 --> 01:18:08.499
that we're talking about with with deep
 

01:18:08.499 --> 01:18:11.310
that we're talking about with with deep
