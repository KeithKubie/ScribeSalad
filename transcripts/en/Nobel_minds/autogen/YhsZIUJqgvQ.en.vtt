application was difficult to predict it

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
application was difficult to predict it
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.020
application was difficult to predict it
depends on the markets and on all these

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030
depends on the markets and on all these
 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.600
depends on the markets and on all these
aspects that for for me I did not know

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610
aspects that for for me I did not know
 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.970
aspects that for for me I did not know
the main goal was not to develop a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980
the main goal was not to develop a
 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.830
the main goal was not to develop a
sensor but when we found this effect

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
sensor but when we found this effect
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
sensor but when we found this effect
then the context was also that at that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390
then the context was also that at that
 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.140
then the context was also that at that
time similar sensors were already in

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150
time similar sensors were already in
 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.000
time similar sensors were already in
preparation for the application in our

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010
preparation for the application in our
 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.310
preparation for the application in our
test drives I was always wondering why

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320
test drives I was always wondering why
 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.180
test drives I was always wondering why
do why do the planets orbit around the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
do why do the planets orbit around the
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:50.310
do why do the planets orbit around the
Sun before people came to me oh it is

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320
Sun before people came to me oh it is
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.389
Sun before people came to me oh it is
used in iPod mp3 players so I didn't

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
used in iPod mp3 players so I didn't
 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.970
used in iPod mp3 players so I didn't
know about that so this is a very

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980
know about that so this is a very
 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.069
know about that so this is a very
important application I think because

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079
important application I think because
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.959
important application I think because
these players are used everywhere

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969
these players are used everywhere
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.600
these players are used everywhere
there's a huge application but of course

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610
there's a huge application but of course
 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.899
there's a huge application but of course
at some point probably there will be no

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
at some point probably there will be no
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.179
at some point probably there will be no
more improvement everything has physical

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189
more improvement everything has physical
 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.859
more improvement everything has physical
limits because it allows the application

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869
limits because it allows the application
 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.639
limits because it allows the application
of GMR first so are these the extension

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649
of GMR first so are these the extension
 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.889
of GMR first so are these the extension
of the Alex technology to mobile

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899
of the Alex technology to mobile
 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.580
of the Alex technology to mobile
electronics iPods awesome and also

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590
electronics iPods awesome and also
 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980
electronics iPods awesome and also
medical applications I have seen

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
medical applications I have seen
 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.139
medical applications I have seen
recently now if you know giamatti

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149
recently now if you know giamatti
 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.539
recently now if you know giamatti
encephalopathy do with the detection of

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549
encephalopathy do with the detection of
 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.980
encephalopathy do with the detection of
the magnetic field

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
the magnetic field
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.060
the magnetic field
and it's also nice to get some applause

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070
and it's also nice to get some applause
 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.360
and it's also nice to get some applause
that's always nice you are confirmed

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370
that's always nice you are confirmed
 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.000
that's always nice you are confirmed
that you know this is was the right way

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010
that you know this is was the right way
 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.060
that you know this is was the right way
to do something and we have arrived at

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070
to do something and we have arrived at
 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
to do something and we have arrived at
something so many things to find to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
something so many things to find to
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.149
something so many things to find to
discover this is a good part of physics

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159
 
 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.219
