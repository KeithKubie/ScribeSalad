00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.550
Ooooohhhhmmmm-oh, excuse me!

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:13.390
I was just enhancing my brain… through meditation!

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.530
Greetings my fellow level-5 laser lotuses,
Julian here for DNews and I have some info

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.630
for you to reflect upon.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.449
A research team from the University of Singapore
announced this week that they have observed

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.589
actual quantitative and qualitative physiological
effects of meditation.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.620
Moreover, the effects are radically different
depending on how meditation is practiced.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.680
Maria Kozhevnikov and Dr. Amihai studied four
groups of practiced meditators from Thailand

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.410
and Nepal; Two groups practiced meditation
from the Theravada schools of Buddhism, the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.600
other two were experienced in Vajrayana meditations.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.980
The researchers monitored electrocardiographic
(that’s your heart) and electroencephalographic

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.629
(that’s your brain) responses and also gave
the groups cognitive tasks.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.149
What they discovered was the Theravada meditation
had a calming effect, which makes sense.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.720
Theravada is the oldest surviving form of
Buddhism, it literally translates to, “The

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.040
Teachings of the Elders,” and its meditations
focus on tranquility and abstract understanding

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.940
to be free of suffering and stress.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.640
It’s no coincidence then that EKGs showed
an increase in High Frequency activity in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.340
the heart when the subjects were meditating
compared to when they were at rest.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.130
More High Frequency activity is associated
with the activation of the parasympathetic

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.250
nervous system, which calms calms us and stimulates
digestion and sexual arousal.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.961
On the other hand, practitioners of the Vajrayana
school saw a decrease of the High frequency

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.160
component of their heart rate variability
when they were meditating, meaning they had

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
activated the sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.990
The sympathetic nervous system is complementary
to the parasympathetic; it stimulates the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.660
flight or flight response by stimulating the
release of hormones like norepinephrine and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.990
epinephrine, better known as adrenaline.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.660
This challenges the previous notion that meditation
could only be used for relaxation.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.560
Even better, the Vajrayana subjects performed
better on the cognitive tasks.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.940
And not just a little better; the effect was
instant and dramatic after just one session.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.000
Theravada, meanwhile, didn’t improve performance
on the same tasks.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.970
The researchers note that Vajrayana takes
years of practice, and plan to study if just

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.840
using some basic elements from it can have
the same effect.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160
So this means if you need to psych yourself
up to do well on a test or job interview,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.980
maybe you should meditate?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.280
And when you need to calm down again after,
a different kind of meditation can bring you

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
back down again.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.480
There are even more benefits of meditation.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.700
Check out Laci breaking it down for you here.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.270
Maybe it’ll help you heal now that she’s
no longer on the team.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.280
I know, I miss her too.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.450
And do you meditate?

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170
What have you noticed from your own experiences?

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.410
Let us know in the comments.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.819
Until then, let’s keep chasing enlightenment
through science, and I’ll see you next time

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:49.830
on DNews.
