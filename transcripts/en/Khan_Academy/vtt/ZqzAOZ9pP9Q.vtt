00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's do some solid
geometry volume problems.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.290
So they tell us, shown
is a triangular prism.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.879
And so there's a couple of types
of three-dimensional figures

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:09.920
that deal with triangles.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.810
This is what a
triangular prism looks

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.630
like, where it has a
triangle on one, two faces,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.880
and they're kind of separated.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.449
They kind of have
rectangles in between.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.740
The other types of triangular
three-dimensional figures

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.600
is you might see pyramids.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.100
This would be a
rectangular pyramid,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.340
because it has a rectangular--
or it has a square base,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.470
just like that.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.410
You could also have
a triangular pyramid,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.350
which it's just literally
every side is a triangle.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.150
So stuff like that.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.858
But this over here is
a triangular prism.

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:42.970
I don't want to get too much
into the shape classification.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.820
If the base of the
triangle b is equal to 7,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.110
the height of the
triangle h is equal to 3,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.230
and the length of the
prism l is equal to 4,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.384
what is the total
volume of the prism?

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:58.300
So they're saying that
the base is equal to 7.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.960
So this base, this right
over here is equal to 7.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.800
The height of the
triangle is equal to 3.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.730
So this right over here, this
distance right over here,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.540
h, is equal to 3.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.300
And the length of the
prism is equal to 4.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.680
So I'm assuming it's
this dimension over here

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.210
is equal to 4.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.070
So length is equal to 4.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.350
So in this situation, what
you really just have to do

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.610
is figure out the area of
this triangle right over here.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.830
We could figure out the
area of this triangle

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.490
and then multiply it by
how much you go deep,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.790
so multiply it by this length.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.416
So the volume is going to be
the area of this triangle-- let

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:39.290
me do it in pink-- the
area of this triangle.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.180
We know that the
area of a triangle

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.590
is 1/2 times the base
times the height.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.530
So this area right
over here is going

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.172
to be 1/2 times the
base times the height.

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:53.630
And then we're
going to multiply it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.590
by our depth of this
triangular prism.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.500
So we have a depth of 4.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
So then we're going to
multiply that times the 4,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.970
times this depth.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.919
And we get-- let's
see, 1/2 times 4 is 2.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.580
So these guys cancel out.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.780
You'll just have a 2.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.835
And then 2 times 3 is 6.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:18.450
6 times 7 is 42.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.459
And it would be in some
type of cubic units.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.500
So if these were in-- I
don't know-- centimeters,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.750
it would be centimeters cubed.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.610
But they're not making us focus
on the units in this problem.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.580
Let's do another one.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.440
Shown is a cube.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.090
If each side is of
equal length x equals 3,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.890
what is the total
volume of the cube?

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.680
So each side is equal length
x, which happens to equal 3.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.540
So this side is 3.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.910
This side over here,
x is equal to 3.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.900
Every side, x is equal to 3.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.400
So it's actually
the same exercise

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.465
as the triangular prism.

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:52.840
It's actually a
little bit easier

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.965
when you're dealing with
the cube, where you really

00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:58.500
just want to find the area of
this surface right over here.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.250
Now, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.350
This is just a
square, or it would

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.930
be the base times the height.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.630
Or essentially the same,
it's just 3 times 3.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.180
So the volume is going to be the
area of this surface, 3 times

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.575
3, times the depth.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.060
And so we go 3 deep, so times 3.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.430
And so we get 3 times
3 times 3, which is 27.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.840
Or you might recognize
this from exponents.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.270
This is the same thing
as 3 to the third power.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.300
And that's why sometimes,
if you have something

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.490
to the third power,
they'll say you cubed it.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.740
Because, literally, to
find the volume of a cube,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.050
you take the length of one side,
and you multiply that number

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.680
by itself three times, one
for each dimension-- one

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.850
for the length, the
width, and-- or I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.172
guess the height, the
length, and the depth,

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:50.880
depending on how you
want to define them.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.344
So it's literally just
3 times 3 times 3.
