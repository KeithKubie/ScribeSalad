I really wanted to come to Camp Kesem so
I could meet other kids whose parents

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.480
have cancer. I just really wanted
to come here and see what it was like to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.699
talk to other kids
whose had experience like me. Everybody

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.080
has had a parent with cancer, just kind
of makes me excited because I fit in a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.960
lot more in this camp than other camps
because we all can share something

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.560
together, talk about it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.320
I know what it's
like to grow up with a sick parent or

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.160
without a parent because I myself lost
my father to brain cancer when I was six

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.230
years old
and it's a really unique experience and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.510
I think that Camp Kesem provides those
children with a community that is really

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.860
unique.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.760
I've been amazed by the ability of these
campers to share so openly their

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.920
experiences and their ability to connect
with other campers who are 10 years

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.340
older than them. It's been all I wanted
and more to see this family develop.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.780
Harvard students are all really involved
and passionate about the activities that

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.530
they participate in and I think that's
because the Harvard community is one

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.000
that is very involved and active in
giving back to their community and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.080
serving the world. I found that a lot of
the friends that I've made at Harvard

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.030
were willing to donate or willing to
dress up in tutus with us and it's been

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.140
a great experience for me to see that
happen because we want the word of Camp

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.090
Kesem to spread. Camp is awesome. We get
to go swimming, we get to do arts and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.649
crafts, get to do all sorts of things. I
keep having to remind myself I'm a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.640
counselor not a camper. I get sucked into
all of these activities too.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.200
Camp Kesem means magic in Hebrew and I
think that's exactly what we've created

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.510
at our Harvard chapter. I think the camp is
pretty awesome. I like this camp I definitely

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.520
want to come back next year, it's a very fun camp.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:37.099
I was only me and that's the way I'll be
yes that's the way I'll be I enjoy being

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.320
an oyster.
