[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:10.290
SELIM EDDE: So good
afternoon, good morning,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.850
and good evening to our Googlers
and whoever is watching us

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.690
across the world.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.290
I have the immense pleasure
this afternoon here

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.780
in Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.720
to welcome her Excellency, Noura
Al Kaabi, Minister of Culture

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.347
and Knowledge Development
for the United Arab Emirates.

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:31.430
NOURA AL KAABI: Thank you.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.482
Thank you, Selim.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.110
SELIM EDDE: I would like
to introduce properly

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.010
Her Excellency.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.720
So if you don't mind,
I have to read this,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.830
because it's so special.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.000
NOURA AL KAABI: Thank you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.370
SELIM EDDE: So Her
Excellency Noura bint

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.080
Mohammed Al Kaabi was appointed
as UAE Minister of Culture

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.920
and Knowledge Development
in October 2017--

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.397
so a little bit over a year.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:02.230
NOURA AL KAABI: Yep.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.680
SELIM EDDE: And as Minister
of Culture and Knowledge

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.500
Development, Her Excellency is
responsible for the promotion

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.380
of the UAE cultural
fields on both

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.280
a national and
international level.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.030
So in addition to her
ministerial responsibility,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.930
Her Excellency is President
of Zayed University.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.090
She also holds the
position as Chairwoman

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.800
of the Media Zone Authority
in Abu Dhabi and twofour54,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.190
the home of media and
entertainment in Abu Dhabi.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.560
She is Chair of Abu
Dhabi Media Company

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.260
and Chair of ADNEC, Abu Dhabi
National Exhibition Company.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.670
She is also on the board of
the UAE National Media Council.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.268
You see why I had
to read all this.

00:01:51.268 --> 00:01:52.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.140
And she was previously,
as well, Minister

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.640
of State for the Federal
National Council of the UAE,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.800
which is the equivalent
of the parliament.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.840
NOURA AL KAABI:
Parliament-- yes.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.580
SELIM EDDE: And
her claim to fame

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.990
is not only due to her
ministerial positions.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.010
I have to also
share this with you.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.410
Because Her Excellency
is the first UAE

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.780
national to be ranked
in "Foreign Policy"

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.390
magazine's top 100
global thinkers list.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.890
And--

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.140
NOURA AL KAABI: It's outdated.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.842
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:30.930
SELIM EDDE: It's still relevant.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.190
And in 2014, she
was named as one

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.310
of the Forbes' Middle East's
30 most influential women

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.780
in government.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.150
Her role in growing the
UAE's media industry

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.450
was recognized by America
Abroad Media in 2015.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.940
And she was named as
one of the 20 most

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.370
powerful women in
global television

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.060
by the Hollywood
Reporter in 2016.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.470
And she has been a World
Economic Forum [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.710
young global leader since 2014.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.650
So with this, I can't
tell you how excited

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.620
we are, as Googlers, to have
you here in our modest office

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.210
here in Dubai.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.590
And we are really
looking forward

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.807
to this encounter with you.

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:15.890
NOURA AL KAABI: Thank you.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.598
Thank you, Selim.

00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:19.960
It's such a pleasure
and honor to be here.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.460
And also, thank you
for the picture.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.100
I was looking for a
10-years challenge picture.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.950
So that would work.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.490
That would work.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.690
It was in my old
office in twofour54.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.730
And yeah-- Selim, again,
you've been a great supporter

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.230
of what we're doing.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.660
I remember last Feb, during
the Future of Culture retreat

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.733
that we had under the beautiful
dome of Louvre Abu Dhabi.

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:47.650
SELIM EDDE: Memorable.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.900
NOURA AL KAABI: We talked
about the future of culture.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.780
SELIM EDDE: Yes.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.440
NOURA AL KAABI: And
this is what we're

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.810
doing, where we are right
now-- talking to you,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.640
talking to individuals here
in such a beautiful office.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.680
You are the future.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.610
And I believe we are
in the right place.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.630
SELIM EDDE: Thank you.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.460
So as you know, this
is Talks for Google.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.720
And it's broadcasted
all over the world.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.959
So the audience really is
curious to know a little bit

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.649
more about Noura Al Kaabi,
Her Excellency, your life,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.279
your journey.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.220
NOURA AL KAABI: OK.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.020
SELIM EDDE: So if you don't mind
telling us a little bit more

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.190
how it all started.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.500
NOURA AL KAABI:
OK-- so of course,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.040
I'm born here in the UAE.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.850
I've lived my whole life here.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.860
And I studied in the
UAE, except for a year

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.630
in the United States.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.040
It was during my junior high.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.900
It was a year where--

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.740
it defined the way I see
a totally new culture.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.020
We in the UAE--

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.372
being here, the closest
culture to us is either--

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.330
of course, the Arab
culture is the closest one.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.750
But you have the Indian culture.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.000
You have the European culture.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.660
The American was kind of
a further down the road.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.710
And back then, it
was the mid '90s,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.360
so there wasn't
mobile phones yet.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.680
And we weren't that
interconnected, such as today.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.580
And that was the
period of time where

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:21.490
I got to know Oprah, the
OJ Simpson Bronco chase--

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.170
what else?

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.670
Many--

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.260
SELIM EDDE: On live TV.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.030
NOURA AL KAABI: On live TV.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.180
SELIM EDDE: On live TV.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.805
NOURA AL KAABI: And
I was like, this

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:27.520
is what happens when someone
just flees from a place

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.020
to another.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.930
Anyway-- so it was such an
exciting time to be there,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.570
to meet different people, and
to know a different culture.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.190
And I think that also was
a kind of a tipping point,

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.510
in terms of the way we interact
with different nationalities.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.290
We are in the UAE.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.123
We do interact with
different nationalities.

00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:50.820
But sometimes, it's kind
of a bubble when you're

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.800
in the States, even till today.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.780
With the news you
see, the fashion,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.850
whatever you're
consuming-- it is very much

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.020
tailored towards that market.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.740
Coming back to
the UAE, I decided

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.930
to study computer science.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.455
And after a year, I said,
this is not the major I want,

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:11.080
because I was--

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.980
SELIM EDDE: We're
learning something now.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.230
NOURA AL KAABI: My
mother hated my decision,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.170
because she wanted
me to finish--

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.825
she was heading a school
for a good 30 years.

00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:22.700
And I was a student--

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.620
SELIM EDDE: She
was the headmaster.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.078
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah, she was
the headmaster of the school.

00:06:26.078 --> 00:06:27.180
She has the teacher.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.860
I was in her school
for six years.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.300
And before that, I studied
three years in a private school.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.730
And all of a sudden, I
see myself in her school.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.630
And the reason why is because
I was writing Arabic from

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.820
left to right instead
of right to left.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.030
So my mother didn't
notice my genius part.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.990
She noticed that there is a
threat to the Arabic language.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.960
So anyway-- I went
to the public school.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.820
I'm very thankful,
because it really

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.616
helped my Arabic language.

00:06:59.616 --> 00:07:01.490
SELIM EDDE: Interesting.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.210
NOURA AL KAABI: So after
changing the major,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.610
I studied management information
system at the UAE University

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.230
in Al Ain.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.570
After that, my father was like--

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.710
he is a military person.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.590
And for him, he doesn't
accept someone just

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.050
doing nothing at home.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.640
And he was like, Noura,
you need to start working.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.340
My first job was in
a military hospital,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.350
just in an IT
department-- helpdesk--

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.420
fixing printers and
whatever it is--

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.242
on and off switching,
resetting PCs and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:31.568
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.450
The exciting part was learning
about the hospital management

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.780
information system.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.880
So in the beginning
of 2002, it was just

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.130
something that was new.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:49.970
And replacing papers
with automation

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.080
is fairly new back then.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.850
After that, I've pursued
another career, which

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.900
is in the clean energy sector.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.120
So I worked in Dolphin Energy
for a good 3 and 1/2 years.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.400
SELIM EDDE: Dolphin-- the
major energy company in--

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.700
NOURA AL KAABI: Abu Dhabi--

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.210
SELIM EDDE: --Abu Dhabi.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.127
NOURA AL KAABI: --yes.

00:08:07.127 --> 00:08:11.460
And it was more to do with
training and development.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.890
Because again, with my
career, it's funny enough.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.350
Going to Dolphin Energy,
I wanted to be in IT.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.140
Yet, at my first
day I was supposed

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.760
to go to the IT department.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.160
And the HR lady
said, you know what?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.760
We have a vacancy
for just three weeks

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.490
in training and development.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.340
And I just want you to help
me manage that department.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.909
So instead of three
weeks, it was three years.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.010
Not planned-- yet, I
was thankful for it.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.810
Because also, I realized
that dealing with people,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.060
interacting with people,
understanding their career

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.730
progression-- whether they're
on the fields or in office--

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.230
was something that
is interesting.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.190
Fast forward-- I
had a phone call

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.610
from my previous boss, His
Excellency Khaldoon Al Mubarak.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.190
We were just talking
about-- what is next?

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.720
And what's next was a new
media city at Abu Dhabi.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.610
So what does fascinate me--
and this is where I got into--

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.930
after getting out of
the elevators here

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.450
in your beautiful offices,
the map with [INAUDIBLE]----

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.560
characters that we grew
up watching, enjoying,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.850
being inspired of.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.330
And I asked myself a question.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.210
I said, did we stop
creating content?

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.220
Because I end up
still watching content

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.280
that is not necessarily Arabic.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.970
So channel 33 was a channel
that I enjoyed back then.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.970
SELIM EDDE: That was the
English channel, right?

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.030
NOURA AL KAABI: That was
the English Channel here--

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.870
SELIM EDDE: In the UAE.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.190
NOURA AL KAABI: --in the UAE.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.710
And my favorite movies
were movies that

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.930
are not Arabic necessarily.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.610
But I enjoyed some Arabic drama.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.960
SELIM EDDE: Can I ask
your favorite movie?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.377
NOURA AL KAABI:
Well, back then it

00:10:02.377 --> 00:10:08.180
was "The Goonies," of
course, "ET," "Star Wars,"

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.260
and some animation.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.100
I loved the dubbed animation.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.710
Yet, it's dubbed.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.863
Where is your content?

00:10:16.863 --> 00:10:18.030
So this is what inspired me.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.580
I said, OK.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.680
Let's work on Media City-- its
twofour54, focusing on content,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.470
in 2008.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.190
SELIM EDDE: So we
were all intrigued

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.680
when we looked at your resume--

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.390
MIS or computer science
and minister of culture.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.553
So you've sort of told us how
it actually came together.

00:10:34.553 --> 00:10:36.470
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah,
it's nice that those are

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.290
different phases in my career.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:45.360
And media was a good
segue to be in culture.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.440
Yes-- there was an
intervention being the Minister

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.590
of Federal National
Council Affairs, which

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.420
was a year and a half.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.160
And the reason why
is because also I

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.770
was appointed parliament
member for four years.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.480
And during that
time, I got appointed

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.670
to just change the seat
from being a member

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.930
to represent the government
for a year and a half.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.388
So when the post happened with
being a minister of culture,

00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:13.110
I said, OK, I think
I'm in my element

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.140
right now, when it comes
to doing what I'm doing.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.840
SELIM EDDE: Wonderful--
so accelerating career

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.180
that really went
very, very quickly

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.960
from working in a hospital, if
I understand, to HR, et cetera.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.710
I have a question.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.870
Where is the inflection
point where you really

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.672
felt that things were
accelerating more

00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:34.380
than [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.380
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah--

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.200
2008 upwards.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.700
So--

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.100
SELIM EDDE: What happened?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.340
NOURA AL KAABI: 10 years ago.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.260
SELIM EDDE: What
was the moment you--

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.650
NOURA AL KAABI:
It was twofour54.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.370
So it was working in twofour54.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.250
And I remember, I was
just managing the center

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.970
that we make sure
that any company that

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.200
comes from outside the UAE to
Abu Dhabi, they feel like home.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.670
This is a very easy setup.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.640
And I've learned a lot
from even being here--

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.870
Dubai Internet City,
Media City, because it

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.230
started before Abu Dhabi.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah-- so that was
the point where--

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.350
it was a tough five
years from 2008--

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.350
fast forward five years.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.570
Because-- just trying
my best to build myself.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.020
I had great mentors,
a great CEO,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.140
who helped me to take
it to the next level.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.750
SELIM EDDE: Great.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.875
I researched a little bit.

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.570
I did a little bit of homework.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.120
I read that you received
that phone call when

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.005
you were in Formula One racing.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:35.880
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.740
SELIM EDDE: And you
were attending, right?--

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.917
the Formula One?

00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:41.750
NOURA AL KAABI: Yes.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.292
SELIM EDDE: And they
announced to you

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:46.997
that you'd been nominated to
the Federal National Council.

00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:47.830
NOURA AL KAABI: Yes.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.610
SELIM EDDE: And
at that point, it

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.250
was some kind of a life change.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.600
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah--

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.325
that was the federal door.

00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:58.950
And I remember getting
that phone call.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.970
I was like, OK.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.790
It's either I sit and enjoy and
watch the race and see Hamilton

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.140
winning and get everyone-- my
mom was there and my sisters--

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.008
or tell them now.

00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.050
So I said, you know what?

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.430
Let's just watch the race.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.480
We're done.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.050
We had a quick dinner.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.980
I got into the car.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.550
I said, oh, by the way,
I got a call and XY.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.980
SELIM EDDE: Your
father and mother

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.270
must have been very
proud at that time.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.020
NOURA AL KAABI: They
played a strong role,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.730
in terms of making sure that we
choose what we want to study,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.520
what we want to major in.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.880
For them, the only no-no
was getting low grades.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.200
That was the only
thing, which is normal.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.690
But other than that, they give
us the full freedom of support.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.300
SELIM EDDE: Hint-hint
to four parents

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.950
in the room or listening.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.783
NOURA AL KAABI: Now,
it's totally different.

00:13:51.783 --> 00:13:53.120
Now, the kids can lecture you.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.620
So--

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.870
So I'm not sure this is--

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.120
I think, the list of accepting
things is more than--

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.910
SELIM EDDE: Yes, I know
something about that.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.795
So family is very important
in the Arab culture.

00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:07.670
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.330
SELIM EDDE: And maybe
this is a segue way

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.990
to ask you the question
about the United Arab Emirate

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.620
culture.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.460
We all know, we have
such a rich heritage

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.510
as Arabs in the
United Arab Emirates.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.820
I wanted, maybe, you to
share with the audience--

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.390
what is unique about the
United Arab Emirates?

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.850
NOURA AL KAABI: Well,
I know I'm Emirati

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.180
and I'm a government official.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.920
Yet, I feel, by even
traveling outside of the UAE--

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.920
whether it's in the region,
outside the region--

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.920
I do understand the difference.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.470
And when I say, a
difference, it's

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.610
not a difference that
happens just by day.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.770
It's the consistent practice,
since the Founding Father

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.350
Sheikh Zayed, of the
country's inception,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.000
of how he welcomed
different nationalities,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.620
how we got different expertise.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:15.630
I grew up in a school where
more than 50% of my classmates

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.600
were from Arabic countries.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.840
And my accent or
dialect wasn't Emirati.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.570
So when I was done from
my elementary school

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.040
to high school, my high school
had more percentage of Emiratis

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.830
than Arabs, because
of the neighborhood.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.850
And they're like, are
you sure you're Emirati?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.070
And I was like, yes, I am.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.890
But it's just, also, I grew up
with different nationalities.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.460
They were my best friends.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.090
And then, looking at even
the way the companies

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.630
are here in the UAE.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.480
I don't mind if my
boss was not Emirati.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.630
I don't mind working
with a non-Emirati.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.430
We would rather learn and
thrive and do our best.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.300
And I feel, that
was a message that

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.440
was instilled by the late
founding father and founding

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.898
fathers of the UAE.

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:08.440
And it's a continuation
of what we're

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.540
doing in the way we do
business, in the way we

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.568
are in the restaurants, and
the way we are in schools.

00:16:15.568 --> 00:16:22.060
It happens to be part
of our Emirati identity,

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.740
that we welcome
different nationalities

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.350
and we live with
different nationalities.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.760
It's the Year of
Tolerance in the UAE.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.800
And I feel, how we can take
it, also, to the next level--

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.750
especially that we are
living in a world that

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.430
is unfortunate in some places.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.410
And we need to revisit
our values of how

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:49.070
we can do our best and
forget what differentiates us

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.480
and unite each other, instead of
the horrible things that we're

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.020
seeing.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.590
SELIM EDDE: Indeed--
so thank you

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:02.320
for sharing this personal
view of the UAE culture.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.650
We all travel.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.378
And for the people who live
in Dubai or United Emirates,

00:17:07.378 --> 00:17:08.920
when we travel
abroad, everyone talks

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.109
about the tallest building
in the world, which

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.569
is a feat by itself definitely.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.839
Or they talk about
the Seven Star hotel.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.440
And they talk about the
large malls and all that.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.710
It's not only about this.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.890
It's much more than that.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.765
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah.

00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:25.990
SELIM EDDE: Although, I would
say that, for me, having

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.695
my kids growing up in a
city where the tallest

00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:30.070
building in the
world was built--

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.080
this changes their
mindset and makes

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.550
them believe that
anything is possible.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.020
So there is this also.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.473
And it's highly appreciated
in the UAE culture, if I may.

00:17:39.473 --> 00:17:40.390
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah--

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.515
SELIM EDDE: If I may as a--

00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:43.720
NOURA AL KAABI: --this
is what keeps us busy.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.970
SELIM EDDE: So you have this--

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:45.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.730
NOURA AL KAABI: And everything--
when do you want it ready?

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.440
Oh, by yesterday.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.990
Oh-- just wanted to know,
when is my deadline?

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.330
And it's always-- if it's
today, it's yesterday.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.100
So I think that, by
itself, is also--

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.130
it's kind of the culture, Selim.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.430
Again, I hate comparing.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.280
But this is where, sometimes,
in certain cultures--

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:15.010
OK, we've started looking
at work differently.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.360
It's your whole day.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.250
Yet, you need to also
give yourself a break.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.300
You need to have time
for your family, workout,

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.830
yoga-- whatever it is.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.020
But it's just how
it's essential to also

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.150
be available and committed.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.670
And I think that's what also
differentiates us from others,

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.640
because there is always--

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.930
we feel it's a competition.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.510
We feel it's a good
competition to do better.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.010
SELIM EDDE: Yes-- so our
values behind the essence

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.370
of the culture-- there are some
strong values, like commitment

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.580
and tolerance and welcoming.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:55.892
We all know that 80%
are expats in the UAE.

00:18:55.892 --> 00:18:57.850
This is for our international
audience as well.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.450
And we live peacefully.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.680
And--

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.357
NOURA AL KAABI: I think, we--

00:19:04.357 --> 00:19:05.690
SELIM EDDE: --work side by side.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.240
NOURA AL KAABI:
Yeah, we talk a lot

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:14.530
about the percentage of the
Emiratis and the non-Emiratis.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:20.290
Yet, I feel proud that
there's this achievement

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.220
of-- and a united Arab
Emirates is not because of just

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.020
the Emirati.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.232
It's because of the Emirati
accepting the other,

00:19:28.232 --> 00:19:30.190
because of the Emirati
working with the others,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.760
because the Emirati helping
other companies to set up

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.840
and take it to the next level.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.170
So I feel, it's luckily
not looking into borders.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.980
And that is something
that defines the values

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.540
that we work on.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.670
SELIM EDDE: Brilliant--
let me push a little bit

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.210
further this point.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:56.140
Because the cynical people would
say that I have my culture.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.280
You have your culture.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.190
Therefore, we're different.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.300
And then 15 minutes
later, they'll be arguing.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:10.020
And then some other
bad things happen.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:15.130
OK-- so it could be misused
as a way to differentiate

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.223
and divide people.

00:20:16.223 --> 00:20:17.140
NOURA AL KAABI: Mm-hm.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.270
SELIM EDDE: Your message
is a very strong one

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.900
about unifying-- the culture
unifying people coming

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.760
from various places.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.723
Can you just--

00:20:25.723 --> 00:20:26.640
NOURA AL KAABI: Sure--

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.040
we've been living in a
culture that is multicultural.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.710
And we tend to consume content
that is not necessarily Arabic.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.640
We also have people
working with us.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.350
And we're working with people
who see our culture in a way.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.990
And we see their
culture in a way.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.440
And at the end of
the day, it's just

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.760
the way of how the
more different cultures

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.550
you have is the more enriched
you are in your own city.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.150
What defines a vibrant city
is the different cultures,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.490
the different--

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.820
I don't know-- the way they
dress, the food, the art,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.370
the music.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.630
And we always curious.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.160
We always want to enjoy
music, not necessarily it's

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.720
only Arabic music.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.380
Or we want to enjoy food--
not necessarily it's

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.980
Arabic food or Emirati food.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.860
So you see culture,
getting people

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.420
connected in a way
that is different

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.840
than any other sector.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.495
So if it's a political,
if it's economy,

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:42.620
if it's whatever it is, it's the
same people meeting, talking,

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.240
based on the same topics.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.350
When it comes to culture, this
is where it's very enriched.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.905
And this is where us, even
at the Ministry of Culture

00:21:50.905 --> 00:21:52.280
and Knowledge
Development-- we've

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.520
been doing our best to work
with different cultures.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.640
So when the Chinese
president visited the UAE,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.820
we wanted to make sure we
activate the UAE in a way

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.430
that our guests, who are
the Chinese delegations

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.670
and Chinese people working in
the UAE, know more about us.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.350
And again, at the
same time-- how

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.730
the community, Emiratis
or non-Emiratis,

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.300
know about the Chinese
culture-- from food,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.900
from music, from
fashion, from art.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.830
And this is where we
activated the whole city.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.980
And there was also a digital
Chinese radio channel

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.810
that is based here
in Dubai, under ARN,

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.720
that is purely Mandarin.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.250
So by that, you're
enriching and spreading

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.810
the knowledge of a
different culture.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.580
Again, in March, we're going
to have the Zayed-Gandhi

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.290
Exhibition in Abu Dhabi.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.030
Why do we have the Zayed-Gandhi?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.270
Both personalities--
we traced their values,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.550
in terms of leadership,
tolerance, harmony,

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.190
coexistence, humbleness--
and how can we

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.300
also exhibit that in the UAE
and exhibit it in New Delhi

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.980
and India at the same time?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.060
So I feel, with culture--

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.413
yes-- when it's
different, it's rich.

00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:05.330
SELIM EDDE: Fantastic.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.538
NOURA AL KAABI: It doesn't
mean, when it's different,

00:23:07.538 --> 00:23:08.670
it's opposite.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.940
SELIM EDDE: I have to mention
the Louvre in all this--

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.670
the Louvre in Abu
Dhabi, which is--

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.325
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah--

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:14.825
sure.

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.450
SELIM EDDE: If you
have not visited it,

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.680
you have to visit it.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.240
And it talks exactly
about that, where you have

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.470
meeting of cultures, right?

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.303
NOURA AL KAABI: Yes.

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:28.110
What's so beautiful about
the Louvre Abu Dhabi

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.370
is it's created in
a way that it gets

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:36.490
different cultures in same
halls, yet different time

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:36.990
frames.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.670
So it's different time zones,
with more than one culture

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.450
at the same time.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.990
SELIM EDDE: Exactly.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.818
NOURA AL KAABI: And there's also
the Beliefs and the Holy room,

00:23:45.818 --> 00:23:47.110
where you get to see the Torah.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.110
You can see the Bible.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.340
You can see the other
beliefs in one room.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.620
So there is the religion.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.550
There's the art.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.340
There are the different
civilizations.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.330
And this, by itself, defines
the future of a museum.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.500
You get into the museum.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.810
You wait to go to which hall.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.690
But what makes this
a different museum--

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.930
for me, I got to know--

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.900
it's a faster learning
process, for me personally,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.290
to see that in one room,
instead of getting from a hall

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.380
to another.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.960
And I think, the
Louvre Abu Dhabi

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.470
also defines what having
different cultures in one

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.720
place-- how does it look like?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.220
SELIM EDDE: Yes--
and in practice.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.890
NOURA AL KAABI: In
practice-- exactly.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.430
SELIM EDDE: And this is
what's beautiful about it.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.430
NOURA AL KAABI: Exactly.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.530
SELIM EDDE: So you are
the Minister of Culture

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.930
and Knowledge Development.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.660
Everyone is really fascinated by
the knowledge development part,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:38.870
right?

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.780
NOURA AL KAABI: So I'm
developing your knowledge--

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.280
yes.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:42.098 --> 00:24:43.640
SELIM EDDE: We're
learning every day.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.488
NOURA AL KAABI: We are
learning every day.

00:24:45.488 --> 00:24:47.780
SELIM EDDE: And you have this
beautiful infrastructure,

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.230
where great things are
happening in the country.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.630
No pressure-- but what's your
vision, as Minister of Culture?

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.870
NOURA AL KAABI: Well, we're
very much excited by 2019.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.430
It's a year where we're
going to talk more

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:10.490
about our strategy and creative
and cultural index, which

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.470
we announced during
the event that we had

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.720
with His Highness [INAUDIBLE]
bin Rashid in the Louvre

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.740
in February.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.690
So that index, by
itself, also will

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.470
help us measure the creative
and cultural sector.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.770
It's an impactful sector.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.170
Yet, we need to quantify
it and support it.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.450
We are a ministry that
not just regulates.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.040
But also, we want to stimulate
the cultural scene in the UAE.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.020
Creative skills are
skills of the future.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.700
We need to elevate that
in a way that there

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.310
are the right policies
that we should put.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.360
There is also the right way to
attract talents, develop them,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.840
train them.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.040
And this is where we have
our talents policy that we

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.940
will also be working on.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.910
We have many questions of--
what do we have in the UAE?

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.690
Whether it's the
tangible heritage

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.410
or the intangible
heritage, cultural events

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.640
happening-- we're going to
get all of that in something

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.160
called the UAE
Cultural Map, which

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.530
we hope to be a smart
map, such as the Google.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.455
And this is where, also,
we got our residents--

00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:22.955
SELIM EDDE: We
accept the challenge.

00:26:22.955 --> 00:26:25.670
NOURA AL KAABI: --and
tourists to know

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.830
what's happening in a
way that is interactive

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:36.700
and in a way that helps--
also, for any individuals

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.100
who comes to the UAE
for the first time,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.915
they will just talk about
the most popular cities

00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:42.415
or Emirates.

00:26:42.415 --> 00:26:43.190
Is it Dubai?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.760
Is Abu Dhabi?

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.430
Is it Sharjah?

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.790
Yet, we're also
working on activating

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.700
the other cultural centers
in the northern Emirates.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.900
Each emirate has it's niche,
in a way, from an archeology,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.990
from performance, from
filming, from theater.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.520
So how can we activate that
with the right partners?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.520
The Ministry can't do
this work by itself.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.560
We have to work
with our partners,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.740
where they're local
entities or private sector

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.720
again at the same time.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.240
SELIM EDDE: Right-- great.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.230
So the UAE has always
delivered on vision,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.270
in terms of when it comes
to brick and mortar--

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.270
if I may challenge a little bit.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.090
So we've built the
most beautiful hotels,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.360
the tallest building in
the world, et cetera.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.560
How are you going to make
sure-- because a lot of leaders

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:35.030
in our Middle East and North
Africa region have visions.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:39.160
But what happens is that they
fail on the implementation

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.020
part, especially when it comes
to the soft part, like culture.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.240
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.270
SELIM EDDE: So
what is it that you

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:52.650
will be doing to make sure
that you will actually deliver

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.380
on this beautiful vision?

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.320
NOURA AL KAABI: Well, number
one is-- the vision is set.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.720
The strategy is set.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.620
The roadmap's clear.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.830
From that roadmap, we
have, of course, our plans

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.410
and what are we
going to accomplish

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.100
during the upcoming
three to five years.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.510
This is just set.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.490
And this is something that is
approved by our leadership.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.060
And as a ministry, it
is also, how can we

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.760
track such achievements?

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.230
So we do have projects
that we're working on.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.200
And those projects-- how
to ensure this vision

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.560
is being achievable
is-- even for us,

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.470
we worked on a vision
that is achievable.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.340
We worked on a way,
also, to partner

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.810
with different entities--

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.660
local entities, individuals,
private sector--

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.640
to help us achieve what we want
to be achieving in the culture

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.140
sector.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.100
So you said, it's a soft?

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.100
It's a serious business.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.100
It's not just soft.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.560
Why is it a serious business?

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.440
Because you're
looking at developing

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.380
the best policies for culture.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.240
SELIM EDDE: Yes, I--

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.032
NOURA AL KAABI: You
work also on the index.

00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:04.630
That is something
that is not soft.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.130
That's something that's
achievable, measurable.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.560
You're working on talents.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.120
You need a database
to get those talents.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.750
Where are they?

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.010
Are we attracting them?

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.360
Are we discovering them?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.010
Are they in schools?

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.720
Are they graduates?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.870
And some talents
are outside the UAE?

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.760
How can I attract
wonderful people who

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.200
are talented outside the UAE?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.610
The same way we attract
scientists and business

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.840
specialists-- how can we
attract talents and artist

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.180
to have UAE as a base?

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.410
So we make sure, Selim, that
we quantify what we're doing.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:45.320
There are results, which is
a nice art piece, musical--

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.530
whatever it is-- that
can't be measured in a way

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.940
that's quantifiable.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.770
Yet, we're sure that there
is this strategic impact when

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.470
it comes to a youth
culture happening

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.170
in the middle of nowhere and
people wanting to come and see

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:00.830
it.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:05.360
And we do benchmark
the best practices.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:11.540
We make sure, as well,
that quarterly we're

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.120
looking at our
progression and, again,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.480
looking at the UAE government.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:21.290
And I don't think we have
room for just skipping a point

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.400
or skipping something, because
I'll be asked, why didn't we

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:25.982
achieve XY?

00:30:25.982 --> 00:30:27.690
SELIM EDDE: Yes-- may
I ask you a totally

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.260
disinterested question?

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.940
NOURA AL KAABI: OK.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.850
SELIM EDDE: How policy
and technology can

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.245
help you achieve your vision?

00:30:37.245 --> 00:30:38.735
And I must say--

00:30:38.735 --> 00:30:44.000
a vivid moment was last year
in the World Government Summit

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.700
that takes place in
Dubai in February,

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.620
where you were on your panel--

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.830
really, a member of
a panel with Amit

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.680
Sood, who is the head of
our Google Arts and Culture.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.135
And you had a very
interesting debate.

00:30:58.135 --> 00:30:59.010
NOURA AL KAABI: Yeah.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:05.140
SELIM EDDE: OK-- and he talked
about giving people access

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.110
to art and culture,
spreading it, and--

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.600
not only that-- having content.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.090
Because if you have
access without content--

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:13.882
NOURA AL KAABI: Ah.

00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:15.560
SELIM EDDE: And you
need to have context

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.750
curating those pieces of art.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.540
And the last element,
which is typically Amit--

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.590
and I'm sure you
embrace that as well--

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.130
is fun.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.713
He said, you need
to have fun as well.

00:31:26.713 --> 00:31:28.150
NOURA AL KAABI: Absolutely.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.030
SELIM EDDE: And
bringing back the coder

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.690
that your mother
wanted you to be

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.720
or the MIS manager that
you actually became--

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.433
how technology can help bring
your vision into reality?

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.350
NOURA AL KAABI: Sure--

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:47.960
so whatever we do now, we
can't do without technology.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.815
We can't.

00:31:48.815 --> 00:31:50.137
SELIM EDDE: Even in culture?

00:31:50.137 --> 00:31:52.220
NOURA AL KAABI: Even in
culture, whatever policies

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.190
we are working on, it has
to have the future in it.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.940
What's the future?

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.910
Technology platforms--
artificial intelligence

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:02.870
is something that, now,
everyone's talking about it.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.720
But it has been there for the
past-- more than 10 years.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.420
I can say that I
use a Pixel phone.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.240
And it is a true smartphone
than other phones,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:17.570
because it's-- it's just
crazy how a device knows you--

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:23.060
the news and everything and how
everything is interconnected.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:31.010
So it's a way-- how can we work
hand-in-hand with technology?--

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.600
yet again, at the
same time, make

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.040
sure that it's an
enabling policy?

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.860
I personally don't understand
anything that [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.060
the progress of you
building a policy.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.870
Again, at the same time, with
our discussions with Amit--

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:56.660
how it's crucial to have
accessibility to content or art

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.160
content that is and in places
that you don't travel to.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.380
It's an essential
tool for education,

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.070
for building your education.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.580
And I think that, by itself,
also will help our projects

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.160
and will help our story as well.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160
SELIM EDDE: Absolutely.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.535
NOURA AL KAABI:
There is also the

00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:16.550
build of the 3D model of
Palmyra that the Future

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.020
Foundation worked on.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.910
For us, Selim, we are working on
a project of rebuilding Al Nuri

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.220
Mosque in Mosul in Iraq.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.483
And the story of Al Nuri Mosque
is-- unfortunately, it's--

00:33:28.483 --> 00:33:30.650
SELIM EDDE: So it's beyond
the United Arab Emirates.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:33.065
You have a regional
calling as well.

00:33:33.065 --> 00:33:34.690
NOURA AL KAABI: Yes--
a region calling.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:41.880
And for us, the endangered
sites are an important--

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.032
let's say-- element in whatever
we're doing in our ministry,

00:33:46.032 --> 00:33:46.740
to help also to--

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.190
SELIM EDDE: Can you just
expand briefly on this?

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.508
Because in [INAUDIBLE]
in the MENA region,

00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:53.300
in the Middle East and
North Africa region,

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.390
are quite a thing.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.890
NOURA AL KAABI:
Yeah, unfortunately,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.990
most of the places happen
to be a war zone because

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.100
of certain breaches.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.560
And the most important
thing is, where do we

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.530
see the opportunity, when
it comes to culture?--

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.870
and culture that,
also, we're related to.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.270
So when I talk about
rebuilding Al Nuri Mosque--

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.989
and this is a directive we
got from the government,

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.949
to go to Baghdad, announce
rebuilding the mosque.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.219
That will take five years-- and
in partnership with the UNESCO.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.040
And who will help us in
building the Al Nuri Mosque

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.889
are also the youth in Mosul
and the youth in Baghdad.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.350
And you need to
understand, those

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.920
universities-- they used to be
the renaissance of universities

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.850
in the region.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.840
Not anymore-- now, they don't
even have decent scanners so.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.440
How can we utilize the
know-how in rebuilding

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.630
and reconstructing the
mosque and-- again,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:52.880
at the same time getting youth
who are studying archeology

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.940
to understand
using technology?--

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.430
understand using technology
to get lessons from other

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.310
specialized institutions
outside Iraq?

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.230
Or again, at the
same time, also,

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.980
if we can support the
exhibition of Al Nuri Mosque

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.650
in a way that documents
it and makes people

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.310
understand the context of
why do we want to do that--

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.770
there will be more
projects happening,

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:22.460
because unfortunately there
are many endangered sites.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.420
The exciting part is that
there will be jobs and future.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.180
And we can't not have technology
to be part of such rebuilds.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.680
SELIM EDDE: Wonderful-- you
also mentioned the word "youth."

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.150
NOURA AL KAABI: Yes.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.970
SELIM EDDE: And I
think it is critical.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.990
And I know, it's dear
to you, because you

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:44.110
have an army of young people--

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:48.850
you will enlist
them and mobilize

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.540
them to serve the culture
in the vision that you have,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.960
which is beautiful, with
the help of technology

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.710
and policies.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.090
Policies are important, right?

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.215
NOURA AL KAABI: Absolutely.

00:35:59.215 --> 00:36:03.880
And Selim, in the region, there
are more than 50% to 60% youth

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.978
in our region-- in the UAE, 49%.

00:36:05.978 --> 00:36:07.270
SELIM EDDE: Under 25 years old.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.728
NOURA AL KAABI:
Under 25 years old.

00:36:08.728 --> 00:36:10.390
SELIM EDDE: Yeah-- great.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.330
Well, one last
question, which is--

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.450
you have accustomed
us to big things.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.170
So I have to ask the
question, because it's--

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.330
what is the next big thing?

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:27.910
NOURA AL KAABI: Well,
the next big thing is--

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:32.230
we're truly working
towards making sure

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.530
that whatever we do in
the Ministry of Culture

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.270
is something that has an
impact, not just in the UAE,

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.220
but outside the UAE.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.930
The next interesting
thing happening--

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.880
and I consider it
big-- we consider

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.170
it big-- is the Pope's visit
in February, here in the UAE.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.920
It's the first visit of
the Pope in a GCC country.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.730
We're going to celebrate
prior his visit.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:55.900
Everyone is celebrating.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.200
Everyone wants to
go to his mass.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.570
And I think, he is a
personality that embodies values

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.040
that we embody here in the UAE.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.663
So this is the next
big thing happening.

00:37:06.663 --> 00:37:07.830
SELIM EDDE: Quite wonderful.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.538
NOURA AL KAABI: So
it's beginning of Feb.

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:10.315
So-- yeah.

00:37:10.315 --> 00:37:11.565
SELIM EDDE: Thank you so much.

00:37:11.565 --> 00:37:11.920
Please give a--

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:12.986
NOURA AL KAABI: Thank you.

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:13.610
Thank you very much.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.943
SELIM EDDE: --round of applause.

00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:16.310
NOURA AL KAABI: Thank you.
