00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.330
Welcome to the problem with first past the
post voting explained by me, C. G. P. Grey

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.260
The royal family has a problem. But this isn't
just any royal family, these are the lions

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
-- rulers of the jungle since time immemorial.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.320
There are protests over the monarchy's absolute
power and the citizens of the Animal Kingdom

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
want a say in how they are governed.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
Bending to the pressure, Lion has abdicated
his crown and king is to be an elected office.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.279
To ensure a smooth transition -- and because
she is craftier than her husband -- the queen

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.689
lioness is remaining on the throne with the
power to set the rules for all elections in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.099
her kingdom.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.100
She has declared that all citizens get one
and only one vote and that the candidate with

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.300
the most votes wins the crown.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.800
This method of voting is most often called
First Past the Post (awkwardly abbreviated

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.920
as FPTP) or Winner Take All.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.570
This system is simple, fair and logical. Right?

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.590
Actually, no.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.070
It's a terrible, terrible idea.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.070
Why?

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.030
Well, to see the problems with first past
the post, lets watch the first election unfold

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.579
in the Animal Kingdom

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.070
It's an exciting time for the burgeoning democracy
and seven hopeful candidates come forward

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.020
to run and represent their parties. They put
on their best campaigns, citizens head out

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.430
to the polls and the votes are counted. The
results come in as follows:

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890
Turtle gets 9% of the vote.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.150
Monkey gets 18%.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.350
Gorilla gets 19%.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.430
Owl gets 13%.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.430
Leopard gets 20%.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710
Tiger gets 15%.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.710
Snake gets 6%.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.702
Under the rules of First Past the Post, Leopard
is Crowned the winner and she gets to rule

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:17.702
for the length of her term.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:21.450
But take another look at the results, and
you see the first problem with this system:

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.101
minority rule. The vast majority of citizens
-- 80% -- wanted someone else as king, but

00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.750
Leopard still won. There were only seven candidates
in this race but if you imagine that had been

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.180
twenty, she might only gotten 5% of the vote,
but still been elected.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.080
This problem with minority rule is only the
beginning.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.650
The second problem with first past the post
is that, given enough time, it results in

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.360
an inevitable, unavoidable two-party system.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
Why?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.500
To see, lets watch what happens over several
election cycles...

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.280
Leopard has had her term in office and it's
election time in the young democracy. Only

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.000
now, all the citizens of the Animal Kingdom
remember the results from last time.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.580
This information changes how they will behave.
Particularly Snake and Turtle voters -- who

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.119
must face the reality that they backed unappealing,
extremist candidates who don't have a chance

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.119
of winning.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.450
Turtle voters, who were unhappy under Leopard
rule, decided to back the candidate who has

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.340
the best chance winning, Gorilla.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.349
Now snake voters want to vote for Tiger -- who
is the candidate they have the most in common

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.790
with, but they are afraid to because Leopard
is running a negative campaign against her

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.170
competitors.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.760
Snake voters, not liking the idea of Gorilla
rule, vote strategically for Leopard.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.569
The final results look like this, with Leopard
getting 26% of the vote and Gorilla getting

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.800
28, making him the new king.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.170
Snake and Turtle, seeing their dismal results
and the cost of their campaigns decide to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.040
drop out of future races.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.489
What started out as a seven party system is
now down to five.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.900
Fast-Forward to the next election:

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.450
Only five candidates run, and again the voters
remember what happened last time.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.370
In this election, it's Owl voters who recognize
that their candidate cannot win. They are

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.730
centrist voters and less ideological than
the rest of the Animal Kingdom -- as such

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.860
they don't really like either Gorilla or Leopard.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.170
Both Gorilla and Leopard know this, so they
each negative campaigns to capitalize on the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.810
fears of the centrists.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.140
Owl voters split their vote, and are mostly
voting against the candidate they dislike,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.480
rather than supporting the candidate they
do like.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.410
After this election, Gorilla gets 33% of the
vote and leopard gets 34% making her the winner.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.890
Owl, as did Turtle and Snake before her, drops
out of the race.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.160
In the last election we will look at, Monkey
and Tiger voters are unhappy. They both really

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.180
like the candidates they have supported, but
they have to compromise. Monkey voters, agree

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.240
with Gorilla on a few issues but they really
don't like Leopard. Tiger voters agree with

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.550
leopard on some issues, but really don't like
Gorilla.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.750
They strategically abandon their preferred
candidate out of fear of the one they disagree

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.400
with the most becoming king.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.200
The final results are Leopard 49% and Gorilla
51% with him being crowned king.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.580
Monkey and Tiger are the last candidates to
drop out and now the Animal Kingdom is left

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.780
with a two party system.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.250
Because of the centrist and sway-able Owl
voters, in future elections Leopard might

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.019
take the crown, then Gorilla wins it back,
only to lose it two Leopard again, but the

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.840
two parties never change.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.230
The citizens of animal kingdom ended up with
this system, not because they are lazy voters

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.580
or because its what they really wanted, but
because of the mathematics of how the system

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.700
is set up.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.870
Inevitably, given enough time, all first past
the post systems trend towards two main parties.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.330
But the choices of the voters still hasn't
changed since that first election. Only two-fifths

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.630
of them want either Leopard or Gorilla as
their first choice and 3/5ths of them want

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.370
someone else as their first choice.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.269
It's this majority of the voters that become
disinterested in the democratic process because

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.840
they feel they have no meaningful way to express
their real preferences.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.180
But it only gets worse from here. If the citizens
of Animal Kingdom are divided into groups

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.340
before they vote, they are susceptible to
gerrymandering.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.570
Gerrymandering is a bit tricky, but imagine
a block of ten homes each with one voter inside.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.840
Three are Leopard voters, three are Gorilla
voters and four are Owl voters.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.540
If the voters are divided up into groups before
they vote, whoever decides where the lines

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.440
are drawn has enormous influence on who will
win the election.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.740
For example, if you group the three Leopard
voters with two Owl voters and do the same

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.060
with the three gorilla voters. You can illuminate
owl from the election, even though owl voters

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.460
have the largest minority and should win under
a straight first-past-the post vote.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.430
If the leopard and gorilla parties are in
charge when the voting boundaries are drawn,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.650
they have enormous incentive to carve out
safe seats for themselves.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.860
But more on Gerrymandering in another video.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.590
Bah! You say, Vote 3rd party and change the
system!

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.340
This brings us to the final, and possibly
worst, problem of First Past the Post: the

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.650
Spoiler Effect

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.389
Imagine now its been years and years of Gorilla
and Leopard rule.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.110
Tiger decides it's time to enter the race.
He thinks that the voters are tired of the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.490
status-quo and he has a shot at winning.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.650
He sets up his campaign office, gets a surprising
amount of gold in donations and gets on the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.680
Animal News Network to debate with the main
candidates.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.050
Election night comes around, but alas, Tiger
gets only 15% of the vote -- mostly from Leopard

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.699
voters, who are closest to him on the political
spectrum. Gorilla easily beats Leopard and

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.380
gets to be king.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.360
The first past the post system at its worst:
the better a 3rd party candidate does, the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.139
more it hurts its own voters by guaranteeing
a loss for the party they most agree with

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.380
and a win for the party they disagree with.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.910
And don't forget, Gorilla is no fool: he knows
how the system works. Where do you think some

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.510
of those gold donations came from?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.400
Meanwhile, The Queen Lioness is displeased.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.860
She's been observing the elections and sees
that the system is bad for her subjects. And

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.850
she's been thinking, what makes a good voting
system? Well...

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.090
You should be able to vote for the candidate
you like the most, without worrying.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.260
More choice in representatives is better.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.970
The system shouldn't be susceptible to gerrymandering.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.380
And it should be open to new political parties.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.569
Luckily for the queen, there are several different
voting systems to choose from -- including

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.550
the alternative vote. But that will have to
be discussed in detail at another time.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.660
Thank you very much for watching.
