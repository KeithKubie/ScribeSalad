SARAH TAVEL: Hey, you
guys, how's it going?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.320
All right, so today,
I'm going to take a stab

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.360
at answering a
question that I know

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.620
as a VC I think about a lot.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.310
And many of you who
are either already

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.780
part of these billion
dollar companies,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.270
are going to start one day, or
on the path to building one--

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.620
like, how do you do it?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.324
And then, specifically,
like, look,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.490
how do you build a billion
dollar business is really

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.270
freaking hard.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.842
There's no recipe for it.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:30.300
But what I'm going
to answer, and I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
think pretty definitively, is,
how do you maximize a product

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.740
that you do have to become
one of these enduring

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.840
billion dollar companies?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.010
This is something that we
think about a ton at Greylock.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.680
It's our job to find these
companies very, very early on,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.900
figure out the ones
that have potential

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.997
by looking at the product, and
see that they actually have

00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:57.330
what it takes to become one
of these multibillion dollar

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.090
companies.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750
So just to speak a little
bit to the track record,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.640
I don't know how many of
you guys know Greylock.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.100
But there are five
companies that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.710
were founded after 2000 are
now worth more than $10 billion

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.960
in the public market.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.740
And Greylock has invested
in four out of five of them.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.170
And we're talking like super
early stage, series A, series

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.760
B. So this is something that
we really take seriously.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.240
And just to give a few
examples-- so Facebook,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.260
early on, we were investors
when it was just still

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.850
a college-only community.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.520
LinkedIn, we invested in
even earlier than Facebook

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.170
when it was just a pretty small
community of a little over 1

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.966
million members.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.800
And just so you guys
know, this thing

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.700
isn't in-- it's
not on my slides.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.730
Airbnb, we invested in the
series A, so super early on,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.170
like before it became the
company that it is today.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.380
And it's also my story.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.300
So when I was at Bessemer,
I was investing early stage,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.690
series A, series B companies
and met the Pinterest team

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.020
when it was this small,
5 person company, 13,000

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.830
registered users, and just got
so excited about the company

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.660
that I ended up joining it.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.640
And was there for
about 3 and 1/2 years

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.470
before joining
the Greylock team.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.430
And so got to see the company
go from 30,000 registered users

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.005
and like this kernel of
a product to the hundred

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.990
and-- it's actually 150
million monthly active users

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
that it is today.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.410
And what I've come to realize
is that what it comes down to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.830
is understanding how engagement
works in your product.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.830
So we think about engagement
as like users are just

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.510
kind of engaging
with our product

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.770
and they're just using it.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.680
But what I've come to
realize is that you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.620
can think of users as
basically putting fuel

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.520
or energy into your product.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.440
And then the key to becoming
one of these enduring,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.470
billion dollar companies
is to take that fuel

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.300
and turn it into
something that actually

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.690
powers your company forward.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.570
And what I've come
to realize is--

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.739
or the way I think about this
now is basically a hierarchy.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.030
And so what I'm going to do,
through this presentation,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.150
is I'm going to talk you
through this hierarchy and some

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.250
of the things that you
guys can be thinking about

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.010
if you want to take the
product that you have now

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.324
and really push it
to the next level.

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:30.240
And so the first level,
which I'll talk about,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.030
is this idea of
growing engaged users.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.422
So how do you-- we talk
about growth all the time,

00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:38.880
but what's the type of growth
that we should be focused on,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.050
and how do we make sure that
we're encouraging that growth?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.180
Then I'll talk about
just retaining users.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.030
And I'll finish
it off by talking

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.730
about how to make your
product self-perpetuating,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.550
how to find and create
virtuous loops in your product

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.390
that is really what will
propel your company forward.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.430
And I think if you can really
focus on these three levels,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.310
you're going to maximize
your chances of building

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.460
one of these companies.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.520
So let's talk about
the first level.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.870
So I'm sure you guys all
hear about growth hacking.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.145
And this has become
like the topic du

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:21.479
jour in Silicon Valley, at
least, which is like, oh,

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.770
I need to hire a growth hacker.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.394
How are we going to
increase downloads?

00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:28.230
What are we going to do to
increase monthly active users?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.290
And what you end up seeing--
and I see this especially

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.780
from the VC seat-- is that
there are a lot of companies

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.400
that figure it out.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.990
They grow their downloads.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.210
They grow their
monthly active users.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.270
And then it kind of collapses.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.940
Not all growth is created equal.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.880
And what matters is
not growing downloads.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.940
It's not growing like
the top line metrics.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.000
What matters is growing
people that are completing

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.870
what I call the core action.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.680
And so you can think
about the core action

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.040
as like the foundational
action in your product.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.030
There should be one.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.180
You should figure out what that
action is, what you ultimately

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.520
want your users
to do that creates

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.220
a foundation of your
product, and then you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.580
optimize the heck out of it
to really get users to do it.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.030
So for Pinterest, we realize
that pinning was ultimately

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.900
the core action, that if we did
discovery right on Pinterest,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.900
if we gave you the right
pins, that you would

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.820
save those pins to your boards.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.770
And that creates this incredible
flywheel within the company.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.380
Twitter obviously was tweeting.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.100
YouTube, the very innovation
that they had early on

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.310
was figuring out how to make
it super simple to get content

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.810
into YouTube, which created
this incredible self-fulfilling

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.770
prophecy for them.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.370
And when you think through
what your core action is,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.520
it's really important to
really play through the product

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.140
roadmap that it creates.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.430
So I think about Pinterest.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.330
And if we chosen click-throughs
as our core action

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.790
or if we had chosen actually
original pinnings, so

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.130
going from outside of
Pinterest and pinning things

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.950
into Pinterest instead
of repinning things

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.690
from within
Pinterest, the company

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.190
would look completely
different now.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.250
So you really have to be very
thoughtful and intentional

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.000
about choosing your core action.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.500
And if you are growing your
company without growing people

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.980
completing the core action,
I can't emphasize this enough

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.480
because I know we made this
mistake early on at Pinterest.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.380
It's like empty calories.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.360
You feel good for a
while because you see

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.225
this top line metric going up.

00:06:37.225 --> 00:06:38.600
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.350
left really with nothing.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.320
And so what you
should be tracking

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.522
is not the lowest
common denominator.

00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:46.730
It's tracking the people
that are actually completing

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.300
this core action for you.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.910
And it just optimizes you.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.866
It focuses you on
the right things.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:53.240
And then ultimately,
the question

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.840
you have to ask yourself is,
the core action that I have,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.806
is the motivation
for my users going

00:06:58.806 --> 00:06:59.930
to be high enough to do it?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.760
Or is it easy enough to do?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.000
And there's some
function of this--

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.360
I don't know if any of
you guys know [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
but he talks about this.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.361
This is a BJ Fogg model,
actually, a behavior model,

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.610
but I think that there's
something really to it, which

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.240
is that you have to motivate
your users to get them

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.570
over the trigger if you
want your product to grow

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.070
to a large enough user base.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.190
So then let's talk
about the next level.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.490
So let's assume you've got--
like, you guys all here

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.910
must have this already, which
is that you've got a growing

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.090
base of engaged users.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.750
Now, what ultimately
matters more

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.120
than anything is getting
those users to stick.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.700
Because look, I see
this all the time.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.460
There's two imaginary
companies, company A and company

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.730
B. Company A, as you can
see, is growing twice as

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.060
fast as company B. So
the founders of company A

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.080
feel fantastic.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.130
But they've got 80%
monthly retention.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.440
It's not that bad, losing 20%
of their users every month.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.240
Whereas this other company,
company B, is only losing 5%.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.260
And so what happens in
the first six months

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.690
is that company A, like if
I invested in a company A,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.370
I'd be like, yeah, killing it.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.990
Made the right call here.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.480
But I'm sure you guys
all know how to do math.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.650
What ends up happening is
that after about 12 months

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.220
in this random example that
I give, the lines cross.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.650
Because ultimately,
what happens is

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.199
that you're only growing
the number of people

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.490
that you're losing every month.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.672
And so you don't want to have
this kind of like the empty--

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:35.630
what's that expression?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.429
The empty bucket or the bucket
with a lot of holes in it?

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.179
You guys know what
I'm talking about?

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.162
Leaky bucket.

00:08:41.162 --> 00:08:42.995
So you don't want to
have the leaky buckets.

00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:46.820
So how do you make
sure that you're

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.906
part of the company B retention
number, not the company A?

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:53.180
And the way that
I think about that

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.540
is with what I call accruing
benefits and mounting loss.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.310
So accruing benefits,
the idea there

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.900
is that you want your users
to add data into your product,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.300
either explicitly or implicitly.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.490
And then you want
to recycle that data

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.240
back to the user in a way that
creates more value for them.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.810
So like when I'm on Facebook
and I engage with content

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.330
on my news feed,
Facebook's taking

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.850
all that implicit
and explicit data

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.160
and using it to
increasingly personalize

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.250
the news feed for me and making
it a more engaging product.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.890
And whether it's like what
I click on or even who

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.440
I am as a friend,
Facebook uses all

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.270
that to create these
accruing benefits.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.710
And the flipside
is that you should

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.860
have a user say, the more I
use the product, the more I

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.050
have to lose by
leaving the product,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.130
that you create this
experience where I, as a user,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.150
start to depend on your product.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.760
I'm leaving artifacts of
myself in the products

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.370
so it almost becomes an
extension of my identity.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.850
Or it's certainly just something
where I rely on it in some way.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.670
And so to give my
favorite example,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.520
I mean, how many of you are
Evernote users or Pocket--

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.380
I'll call out Pocket here also.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.214
How many of you
are Evernote users?

00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:13.380
I don't know about you guys.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.690
I'm freaking obsessed
with this product.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.880
Every time there's bad
news about Evernote,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.007
I have this, like,
[GASP] what's going

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:21.090
to happen to this company?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.360
Because I have
everything in Evernote.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.410
It has such accruing benefits
and mounting loss for me

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.170
that I just find myself
putting more and more content

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.220
into Evernote.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.206
Because now when I
do a search, I just

00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:35.580
know that it's
everything for me.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.410
It's just going to
get better and better.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.560
And my LTV is infinite.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.630
And I actually pay
the subscription just

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.240
to make sure that it stays
around a little bit longer

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.420
because that's like
my greatest fear.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.310
You know, Pinterest too.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.000
So when I was at Pinterest,
I was leading product

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.990
for our discovery team.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.020
And the thing that
I obsessed over

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.460
was, how do I take the action
that my users are doing

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.040
and return that back
to them in a way

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.550
that creates both the accruing
benefits and mounting loss?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.300
And what you find is that
ultimately, now on Pinterest--

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.340
I hope all of you
are Pinterest users.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.530
If you're not, please
sign up after today.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.710
It'll make me feel like
it's a job well done.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.660
But what you see on
Pinterest is that you've

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.550
got both this
mounting loss, which

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.980
is that you have your boards.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.420
And it's all your bookmarks.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.530
It's your recipes.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.150
It's your favorite articles.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.700
It's inspiration for
a trip you want to do

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.230
or what you want to wear.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.891
And then your home feed becomes
more and more personalized

00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:37.390
for you.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.950
Because what we do is when
you pin things to a board,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.410
we use that to personalize
recommendations for you

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.430
in your home feed.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.460
So like I just
bought a new home.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.570
Now my home feed is all
about the home decor

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.126
that I'm thinking about
for my empty place

00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:56.250
with just a bunch of boxes.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.190
And so that's the
idea with Pinterest.

00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:02.160
There's a flip side to this.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.150
There are plenty of companies
that don't get through level 2.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.550
So one of the companies that--
I don't know if any of you

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.860
guys ever use any of
these anonymity apps,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.230
like Whisper or Secret.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.310
I remember when Secret came
out, it was so much fun.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.680
Everybody was adding
secrets on it.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.660
We were all making
fun of each other.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.360
You were finding out the
Silicon Valley gossip.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.100
But then what
happens is that you

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.580
delete the app because you kind
of feel bad about using it.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.080
And then someone says,
like two months later, hey,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.810
did you see that
secret in Secret?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.920
And you're like, shit, OK.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.990
So you download Secret again.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.280
You install it.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.860
And you see the secret that
the person's talking about,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.630
and your product
experience is not

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.860
any different at that moment in
time than it was two months ago

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.380
or if you had been using
the product for two months

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.060
because there's no
concept of identity.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.670
And there's no concept
of accruing benefits

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.430
or mounting loss for me.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.610
On the other hand, Twitter
actually has anonymity.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.650
That's what's creating
so many of the problems

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.240
that they have
right now, actually,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.860
around trolling
and other things.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.490
But the reason that they
have accruing benefits

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.960
and mounting loss is because
they have persistent identity.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.110
You can create a fake
account which accomplishes

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.270
some of the part of anonymity.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.690
But because I accrue my
followers and the people

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.230
I follow, I have my likes,
I have everything else,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.260
they actually can have
retained users with anonymity

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.560
at the same time.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.070
And so let's talk level 3
because this is the hardest

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:36.580
level.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.500
I think if any of you
guys are growth people,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.630
you're probably thinking
about some of the loops here.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.010
And so the idea is you've
got this growing user

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.090
base, whether it's growing
through word of mouth,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.880
it's growing
through PR, whatever

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.470
is causing you to grow.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.950
And you've built a product
that retains those users.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.639
You've got accruing benefits.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:13:59.680
You've got mounting loss.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.530
People feel like the more I use
a product, the better it gets,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.000
the more I have to
lose by leaving it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.950
And now the question
is just whether you

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.080
can create virtuous
loops in the product,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.000
because this is what
really, I think,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.340
takes the company from being
a solid player to being

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.930
one of those iconic companies.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.610
The strongest virtuous loop
that I'm sure many of you

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.470
guys hear about all the
time is a network effect.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.030
And so at Pinterest, we
discovered our network effect

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.600
through our process of
creating the discovery team.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.400
It's just this very
simple idea, which

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.270
is that when a user
pins a pin, they either

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.380
bring a new website, a new piece
of content, into Pinterest,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.170
or they're actually creating
a new edge in our graph

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.600
by putting that
pin on their board.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.500
And what we do then is we
take that data of this user

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.320
put this pin on this board.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.260
Here all the other pins that
share a board with that pin.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.510
Therefore, those are
all edges in our graph.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.720
And we use that information to
make the discovery experience

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.482
better, which gets more
people to pin and engage

00:15:08.482 --> 00:15:09.190
with the product.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.960
And you've got this
wonderful virtuous loop.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.800
And there are other
types of virtuous loops

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.200
so that you're
always going to be

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.650
searching for in your company.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.420
So growth is a great one.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.750
So actually, one of the things
that our growth team was always

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.290
thinking about was people
are completing these actions

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.030
already on Pinterest.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.580
And how do we take
advantage of the ripples

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.840
that they can create?

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.280
So as an example-- I use this
example of sending a pin here.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.810
But I think even
a better example

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.360
is that each pin
on Pinterest has

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.630
been repinned thousands
of times, if not,

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.530
on average, millions of times.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.350
And that means that if I
find a pin that you've-- that

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.220
there's a recipe,
like a pancake recipe,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.410
that I discover in search,
I could show the person who

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.860
pinned it be like a super
engaged user who's already

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.810
getting notifications
all the time.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.110
Or I could show it like
a user who hasn't come

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.820
to Pinterest for two weeks.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.179
And if I pin that
pancake recipe,

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:13.720
they get a notification,
whether it's

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.210
a push notification or
an email, telling them,

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.100
hey, Sarah pinned your pin.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.050
Come see where she pinned it.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.496
Come see the other pancake
recipes that she likes.

00:16:23.496 --> 00:16:27.240
So then that's an example
of reengaging the user.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.646
So look, these are
really hard to create.

00:16:32.486 --> 00:16:34.330
There are so many
companies that try

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.540
to create virtuous loops
and just struggle to.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.180
Unfortunately, Evernote,
my favorite company,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.620
is one of those companies.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.110
So I don't know
if any of you guys

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:49.330
have ever tried to do one
of their shared notebooks.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.800
It just doesn't work.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.890
All the time when I accidentally
press the Chat button,

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.095
when really, I want to create
a note, it drives me crazy.

00:16:57.095 --> 00:17:00.490
But it's Evernote trying
to create virtuous loops

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.310
in their product.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.099
But ultimately, it's really
a single player mode product.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.849
Tinder is another example
that I love to make fun of.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.250
So Tinder, you know,
Tinder actually

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.829
has some of those
reengagment loops.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.026
It has some of the growth loops,
which is that if we match,

00:17:19.026 --> 00:17:21.400
Tinder sends a notification
to you letting you know, hey,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.286
Sarah swiped left on you.

00:17:24.286 --> 00:17:25.869
The problem that
Tinder has-- and this

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.810
is what all dating
sites have-- is

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.840
that if you match with
someone-- and the reason

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.090
I make fun of Tinder is
because we don't actually know

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.740
this is what happens on Tinder.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.184
But ideally, you
match with someone.

00:17:38.184 --> 00:17:39.850
You have a successful
date with someone.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.340
And that's an off-ramp
from the experience.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.850
That's not actually making
the experience more engaging

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.990
or creating a stronger loop.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.190
And so Tinder has to
constantly figure out,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.840
how do we get people
at the top of the loop

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.450
to keep them dating?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.380
And so as I said, ultimately,
the strongest fuel

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.230
you can have for your
company is your users

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.890
doing things in the product,
engaging with it in such a way

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.590
that they're making the product
stronger, both for themselves

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.410
and for other people
in the product,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.990
and they're also figuring out
how to reengage your users

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.680
and grow the product for you.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.250
And so last but not least,
how do you measure this?

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.270
How do you know if you're
on the right track?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.580
So we've talked about
these three things,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.630
each of the levels
in the hierarchy.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.660
And so I, as an investor,
but I imagine you

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.280
as a product manager, or a GM,
or the CEO of your company,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.340
ultimately wants to see
these three things also,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.020
which is am I growing?

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.850
Are users getting more or
less engaged over time?

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:55.270
So the users I bought to the
site one year ago versus now,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.990
what percentage of them are
engaging with the product?

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.740
Are we getting better over time?

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.420
Are we getting worse?

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.890
Are the cohorts growing?

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.420
Are we retaining them?

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.510
And ultimately, how am I
doing on my marketing spin?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.800
Are we getting people
through the funnel?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.740
And so the thing that I
think is the number one

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.830
thing to measure, and
everything else, in my view,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.560
is a waste of time,
is looking at cohorts.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.030
And so you look at cohorts.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.280
Does everybody know
what a cohort is?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.870
OK, good.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.860
I'm getting some nods.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.530
The cohort is just all the
users who joined January 2015.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.070
And you track those-- you've
kind of tagged those people,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.530
and you watch them,
month to month,

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.210
just as their own
cohort of users.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.360
And you see how many of them,
every week or every month,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.974
are completing your core action,
and what percentage of them

00:19:46.974 --> 00:19:48.640
are actually completing
the core action.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.210
So you're getting a sense
of both how many people are

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.210
the absolute value,
how are they retaining,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.970
and whether over time, your
product's getting better

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.970
at converting the new people
that sign up into people

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.062
that are actually
engaging with the product.

00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:05.770
And so what you see
is those three things

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.570
that I already talked about.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.360
It's like the distillation
of every other metric

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.050
that you could possibly track.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.770
And everybody has a different
way that they like to show it.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.650
If you're an early
stage startup or just

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.950
getting started with a new
app, I love line graphs.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.160
I just find it's the easiest
way to look at it at a glance

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.560
and really understand what's
happening with the company.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.810
But the bigger you
are, the further

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.740
you are in your user
growth and maturity,

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.751
the more you end up
going to the left.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.940
And so I think
ultimately, if you're

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.160
able to track your
cohorts, you're

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.640
able to communicate the
value of what you're doing,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.100
both to an investor, if
you end up coming down

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.980
this path eventually
or already have,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.506
or anybody else in your company.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.162
So just to close it out, we
talked about the three things

00:21:01.162 --> 00:21:01.870
in the hierarchy.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.800
We talked about what it is,
growing an engaged user, what

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.810
you actually look for,
what is an engaged user,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.010
focusing on the core action.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.760
We talked about the importance
of retaining those users,

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.720
making sure that you
don't have a leaky bucket,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.150
and then figuring out
ways to make the product

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.650
self-perpetuating.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.280
And I think that if you are
able to build your product

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.750
to check the box and really
excel on these three levels,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.300
I think you've done everything
you can from a product

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.150
perspective to maximize
your chances of becoming

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.690
one of these iconic companies.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.800
And so just to close,
again, the biggest thing

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.820
I want you guys to take
away is that engagement

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.370
is like this energy
that your users are

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.020
putting into the product.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.290
And its kind of like the wind
blowing or like the water.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.220
If you don't put the windmill or
the dam, you're just losing it.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.800
This energy is there
in the product,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.640
and you're not taking
advantage of it.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.580
But if you take
advantage of it right,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:08.310
it becomes just this
fuel for your company.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.524
And that's it for me.

00:22:09.524 --> 00:22:10.690
So thanks so much, you guys.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.440
[APPLAUSE]
