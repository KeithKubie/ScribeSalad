there notice that in an intensive
difference is that the word difference

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:34.950
difference is that the word difference
 

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.450

is being used in a different way than

cutting edge of this process what he
would want is that when artists begin to

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:27.080
would want is that when artists begin to
 

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.890
would want is that when artists begin to
talk about their art that they would

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:29.900
talk about their art that they would
 

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.820
talk about their art that they would

asked the question what the construction

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:41.660
asked the question what the construction
 

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.330
asked the question what the construction

we are reproductively isolated from

because then we can kill all the zebras

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719
because then we can kill all the zebras

but then zebra hood will come back

but then zebra hood will come back
 

01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:33.599
but then zebra hood will come back
because there's no zebra hood they won't

01:09:33.599 --> 01:09:33.609
because there's no zebra hood they won't
 

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:35.910
because there's no zebra hood they won't
come back now the fact that the barrier

come back now the fact that the barrier
is historical means that we with

Kevlar is a material they used to make a

01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:06.340
Kevlar is a material they used to make a
 

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.480
Kevlar is a material they used to make a
bulletproof vests and so the scientists

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:09.490
bulletproof vests and so the scientists
 

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:12.330
bulletproof vests and so the scientists
are trying to produce spider silk right

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:12.340
are trying to produce spider silk right
 

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.040
are trying to produce spider silk right
but spiders because they're predators

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.050
but spiders because they're predators
 

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:17.040
but spiders because they're predators
unlike silkworms don't allow themselves

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:17.050
unlike silkworms don't allow themselves
 

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:19.320
unlike silkworms don't allow themselves
to be domesticated you know put 200

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:19.330
to be domesticated you know put 200
 

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.390

spiders come on produce some silk and

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400
spiders come on produce some silk and
 

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.750
spiders come on produce some silk and
they won't do it so what did they do

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760
they won't do it so what did they do
 

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.420
they won't do it so what did they do
well they figure out the protein that

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:27.430
well they figure out the protein that
 

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:30.000
well they figure out the protein that
makes this change that we call spider

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.010
makes this change that we call spider
 

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:32.100
makes this change that we call spider
silk then they figure out the genetic

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.110
silk then they figure out the genetic
 

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:33.480
silk then they figure out the genetic
code of it

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:33.490
code of it
 

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.790
code of it
they found the gene in the spider they

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800
they found the gene in the spider they
 

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.710
they found the gene in the spider they
took that gene and implant it into a

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:37.720
took that gene and implant it into a
 

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.200
took that gene and implant it into a
goat right now when I first heard about

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:40.210
goat right now when I first heard about
 

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.300

this I thought that the result was going

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:42.310
this I thought that the result was going
 

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:46.380
this I thought that the result was going
to be spider goat you know a goat

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:46.390
to be spider goat you know a goat
 

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:50.180

express that protein but of course they

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:02.650
express that protein but of course they
 

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.620

don't have any use force for spider silk

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:04.630
don't have any use force for spider silk
 

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.440

so they just they kind of excrete it in

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:07.450
so they just they kind of excrete it in
 

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.320
so they just they kind of excrete it in
their milk and then what what is a

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:10.330

they extrude it through tiny little
