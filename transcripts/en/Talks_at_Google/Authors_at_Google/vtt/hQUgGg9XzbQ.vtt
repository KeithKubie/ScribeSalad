[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.560
SPEAKER: So welcome, everyone,
to this Talks at Google event.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.560
We are here with
Beau Lotto, who's

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.010
going to be talking about
his new book, "Deviate."

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.210
So Beau, he's a world-renowned
neuroscientist, entrepreneur,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.360
and also a two-time
TED Talk speaker.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.620
And in this book "Deviate," he's
drawing from over two decades

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.690
of research to reveal
startling truths

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.700
about how we perceive
the world and how

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.015
our brain perceives the world.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.265
So without further ado, I'm
going to leave it to Beau.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:38.765
BEAU LOTTO: [LAUGHS]
Hey, everybody.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:39.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.380
That's nice.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.840
So thanks for coming.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.460
It's such a lovely day outside.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.190
It's nice to be-- would have
been nice to be out there.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.240
We should do it out there.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.170
So we're going to talk
about perception, right?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.480
And actually, everyone
here in some sense

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.420
is dealing with perception.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.480
And the reason is because
perception underpins everything

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.389
you think, you
know, you believe,

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.680
the clothes you wear, the
people you fall in love with.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.739
Everything begins
with perception.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.280
So to understand
perception is really

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.290
to understand not just
how the brain works,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.081
which is what I'm
interested in, of course,

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.680
but what it is to be human.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.194
And if you really want to get
people to see differently,

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.110
we have to understand
the principles by how we

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.700
see in the first place, right?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.740
So a key question to perception
then, which we've all

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.240
been thinking about--
in fact, we've

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.990
been thinking about
for thousands of years

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.150
is, do we see reality?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.550
So how many here
at Google think you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.441
see the world as it really is?

00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:36.940
No?

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.832
There's always one.

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:39.790
If you're not seeing the
world as it really is,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.540
what are you seeing?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.956
How did you get
here if you're not

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.510
seeing the world accurately?

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.259
Sorry.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.550
AUDIENCE: You're gonna tell us.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.390
BEAU LOTTO: I'm
going to tell you.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.889
So--

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:48.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.480
--I think--

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.685
[LAUGH]

00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:51.520
--but I'm curious.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.680
I mean, I think you all think
you see the world accurately.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.180
Why?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.150
Because I think you all
believe that illusions exist.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.050
So do you believe in illusions?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.860
Yes?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.490
So an illusion by definition
is to see the world differently

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.050
from the way it really is.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.970
So if you believe
in illusions, you

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.490
think that you actually evolve
to see the world accurately.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.040
Most of the time, it's just
that sometimes you get it wrong.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860
So what we can do
is do a quick test

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.151
to see how good you are at
seeing the world accurately.

00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:20.120
So how many bears do you see?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.180
Three-- only three?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.170
Did you see-- oh,
you only saw two?

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.120
OK, keep looking around.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.643
Look differently.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.770
Turn your head.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.040
Imagine.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.565
Can you see four?

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:37.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] five.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.160
BEAU LOTTO: Five, six.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.140
Do I hear six?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.454
It's like an auction.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:43.679
AUDIENCE: Is there a panda?

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.845
BEAU LOTTO: You see a--
yeah, there could be pandas.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.130
It's a bear, right?

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.420
There are 11 bears hiding there.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.587
Right?

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.170
The point is, the
more differently you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.919
look at something, the
more things reveal.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.430
But that's actually
quite a complex scene,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.830
so we could try something
much simpler, which

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.364
is much more natural.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.280
So how many of you can
see the predator that's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.720
about to jump out at you?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.600
And if you haven't seen it
yet, you're dead, right?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.932
Especially here.

00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:10.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.510
So who thinks they can
save the rest of the room?

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.631
Where do you think it is?

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:17.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.180
BEAU LOTTO: Right-- up there?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.750
At the top?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:22.090
BEAU LOTTO: OK, you're dead.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.600
OK.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.697
OK, let's just add 10%
of the information,

00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.280
because 90% of the information
your brain uses to see actually

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.870
comes from grayscale.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.090
So we'll add 10%
to the information.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.750
And can you find it now?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.250
All right.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.500
For those who maybe shouldn't
be Google, there it is.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.580
OK.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.430
So now we go back, you can see,
it was always staring at you.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.976
It was always there.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.600
And this makes a
really important point

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.170
when it comes to vision,
which is only 10%

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.400
of the information--

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.570
you can come on in--

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.190
which is only 10%
of the information

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.600
your brain uses to see
actually comes from your eyes.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.500
The other 90% comes from
other parts of your brain.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.330
So your eyes are
almost pointless when

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.250
it comes to vision, right?

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.270
It's like the keyboard
is to a computer.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.894
It's how you get the
stuff in, but it's

00:04:09.894 --> 00:04:12.460
very little to that
you actually see.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.980
But again, this is still
a fairly complex scene.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.740
So let's try something
even simpler,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.180
which is just lightness.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.540
Surely people at Google
can see the world

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.330
accurately in terms of
light intensity, right?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.920
Even jellyfish
can see lightness,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.960
and they don't even
have a brain, right?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.720
So surely, you can see
the world accurately.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.044
And if that's true, then
things that are the same

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.460
should always look the same,
and things that are different

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.994
should always look different.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:39.910
And these two circles
are physically the same.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.830
And do they look the same?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.360
Yeah?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.859
Right?

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:45.700
So thank goodness, at
least at this level,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.830
you can see the
world accurately.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.580
But what happens if I
don't change those dots,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.760
I just change what
surrounds them?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.950
What happens to your perception?

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.109
Do they still look the same?

00:04:59.109 --> 00:04:59.650
AUDIENCE: No.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.190
BEAU LOTTO: No.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.106
The one on the left will
probably look lighter

00:05:02.106 --> 00:05:04.680
than the one on the right, yes?

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.030
And this makes it--

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.640
so nothing's actually changing
on those circles, just

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.590
your perception of them.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.930
And this is the simplest
illusion that your brain has,

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.971
which is called simultaneous
brightness contrast,

00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:17.200
and we really don't
know how it works.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.470
But what it demonstrates is
the most basic level of vision,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.740
of perception, which remember,
underpins everything it

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.130
is to be you, context
is everything.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.910
Your brain did not actually
evolve to do absolutes.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.050
It evolved to do relationships.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.380
It's not interested unless it's
contextual in contrast, OK?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.190
So much so that as you're
looking at me right now,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.810
your eyes are actually moving.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.210
They're called saccades
and microsaccades.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.690
And you can stop your eyes
from moving by closing one eye,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.000
sticking your finger into the
tear duct, and pushing back--

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.500
right?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.180
You can do it at home with your
kids or your friends, right?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.990
And you're basically
pushing your eyeball back

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.620
into its socket, and
your eye stops moving.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.360
What happens?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.000
Your eyes open, and your
eyeballs stop moving.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.090
What do you think happened?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.065
You go blind.

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:11.190
Of course, you'll go blind
if you shove your finger

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.180
into the back, right?

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.790
But by just simply stopping
your eye from moving,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.190
your brain has nothing
interesting to see,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.280
because it's only interested
in change in space and time.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.890
So if you stop change,
your brain goes blind, OK?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.200
So we've known that
context is everything

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.320
for a very long time,
but a far deeper question

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.320
is not that context is
everything, but why it is.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.624
And to understand why
context is everything

00:06:39.624 --> 00:06:41.040
is really to
understand what it is

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.290
to be human, but also to
understand how it is we can

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.140
help people to see differently.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.410
So instead of telling you,
I'm going to show you.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.280
And this is actually at the
heart of machine vision,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.740
of automatic cars, et cetera.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.100
This is the fundamental
problem that visual systems

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.850
evolved to solve.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.490
So hold up your
finger, and see if you

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.340
can make your finger the
same size as me by lining up

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.960
your finger with me, right?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.390
The right finger, right?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.030
Can you make us the same size?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.910
Yes?

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.410
OK.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.022
We're not the same size, right?

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:17.730
This is because--

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.280
--right?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.680
But as far as your eye is
concerned, we are the same.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.950
It's because data that falls
onto your eyes, into your ears,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.960
onto your skin conflates
multiple aspects of the world.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.590
In this case, size
and distance, right?

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.860
But the only access
we have to the world

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.920
is the data that
your senses detect.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.990
But the data that
your senses detect

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.680
is completely
meaningless, right?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.290
Which makes data itself-- so
who's working on big data?

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.750
We're at Google, right?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.690
Data is pointless, right?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.760
It is literally pointless
in and of itself

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.280
because it doesn't tell
your brain what to do.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.170
It doesn't come
with instructions.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.810
It conflates multiple
aspects of the world.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.360
And this is true at the
most fundamental level

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.170
of perception.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.730
It could be a loud
thing far away

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.150
or a quiet object up close, or a
bright object under dark light,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.971
or a dark object under
bright light, right?

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:13.470
These different
aspects of the world

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.730
can give rise to
identical pieces of data,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.430
but we have no
access to that world.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.670
So how does your brain deal
with the fundamental challenge

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.010
that it is to survive,
which is uncertainty?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.990
This is the problem that
every single brain--

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.740
in fact, every
single neural net--

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.760
is adapted to deal with, which
is uncertainty, ambiguity.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.440
So what's the other
piece of information

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.490
your brain has to see, except
for the data and the moment?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.960
What else does it
have access to?

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.930
AUDIENCE: Memory.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.260
BEAU LOTTO: Memory.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.102
Experience.

00:08:51.102 --> 00:08:52.810
So the functional
structure of your brain

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.520
is literally a
physical manifestation

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.380
of its past interactions
with the world.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.100
And not a passive interaction,
but a physical interaction.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.860
Your brain makes meaning
by physically interacting

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.950
with the sources of
the meaningless data,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.800
and it makes meaning from it.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.230
That's how your brain
then shapes itself.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.940
It's not a passive
receiving of information,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.270
which is why your brain
actually evolved to continually

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.000
redefine normality, right?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.220
And you see everything
relative to that

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.355
continually changing normal.

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.730
So I want to show you how
quickly your brain can redefine

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.810
normality by first noticing
that those two desert scenes are

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.310
basically the same, yes?

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.976
One is just a flipping
of the other one.

00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:33.430
In terms of color, the same.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.970
I want you to stare at the dot
between the red and the green.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.846
Don't look anywhere else.

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:40.720
OK, we're going to do
a bit of a magic trick,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.776
but it's going to happen
inside your head, OK?

00:09:44.776 --> 00:09:46.150
So as you're
staring at that dot,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.400
your brain is
redefining normality.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.070
It's learning that the left
side of its visual field

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.500
is under green light and
the right side is under red.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.600
That's becoming its
new reality, right?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.819
You're also getting very sleepy.

00:09:58.819 --> 00:09:59.860
Keep looking at that dot.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.730
Don't look anywhere else.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.313
When I tell you to,
I want you to look

00:10:02.313 --> 00:10:04.914
at the dot between the
desert scenes, but not yet.

00:10:04.914 --> 00:10:10.570
OK, five, four, three, two, one.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.950
Do they still look the same?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.766
AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:13.390
BEAU LOTTO: No?

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.490
The one on the left should look
reddish, the one on the right

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.750
should look greenish.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.920
Yes?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.540
And now as you look
around, your brain

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.300
will continue to
redefine normality again.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.290
Yes?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.810
So that's how quick your
brain redefines normality

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.450
at the most basic
level of lightness.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.360
So when you open your
eyes, what do you see?

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.920
You can't see the
world as it really

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.130
is because your brain is
forever separate from that.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.610
You can't see the
data, or it would

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.150
be pointless to see the data,
because it could mean anything.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.030
So instead, what you
see is a meaning that

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.220
was useful to see in the past.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.620
You see what we call the
empirical significance

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.340
of information.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.400
You see the behavioral value
of the data, not the data.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.090
That is literally what
you're seeing, right?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.120
So the reason why
your brain adapts

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.970
is because what was once
useful may no longer be useful.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.120
So your brain is continually
redefining normality

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.947
and seeing things relative
to that changing normal.

00:11:07.947 --> 00:11:10.280
So to give you a sense of
what I mean by seeing meaning,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.904
we'll do it in the
context of language,

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.910
so we'll pretend like
we're in a classroom, OK?

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.910
So in the next few slides, I
want you to read what you see.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.920
We'll do it all together, OK?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.300
Ready, one, two, three.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.652
AUDIENCE: Can you read this?

00:11:21.652 --> 00:11:22.360
BEAU LOTTO: Good.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.387
One, two, three.

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:24.845
AUDIENCE: You are
not reading this.

00:11:24.845 --> 00:11:25.345
[LAUGH]

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:26.734
BEAU LOTTO: One, two, three.

00:11:26.734 --> 00:11:27.608
AUDIENCE: [GIBBERISH]

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:29.165 --> 00:11:30.085
BEAU LOTTO: Right?

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:31.797
OK, one, two, three.

00:11:31.797 --> 00:11:33.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.820
BEAU LOTTO: What are
you reading, right?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.903
Remember the instructions.

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:37.479
I said, read what you see.

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:38.520
There are no words there.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.070
You all failed, right?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.160
That literally says,
w at ar ou rea in ?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.174
Right?

00:11:43.174 --> 00:11:44.840
There's no law of
physics that tells you

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.546
how to put an H between that
W and A. Why do you do so?

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:50.420
Because your brain has
encoded the statistics

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.310
of co-ocurring letters in the
English and other languages.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.900
So when you're presented with
a completely arbitrary context

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.640
of W space AT, you
put an H there,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.580
because it was useful
to do so in the past.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.367
But there's no inherent
value in this letter string.

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:05.450
It's completely arbitrary.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.210
It doesn't exist without us.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.660
And also notice, none of you
read, what are you dreaming?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.480
Because I had you reading.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.000
That was your recent history.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.570
So you interpreted this in
terms of your recent history.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.050
So you read, what are
you reading, right?

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.090
And this is true at the most
basic level of perception.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.820
So if you think
back to lightness,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.980
which again, is our
simplest perception,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.980
you'll see a dark brown tile at
the top and a light orange tile

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.480
at the side, yes?

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.636
That is your
perception of reality.

00:12:34.636 --> 00:12:38.570
You will bet your life that
they are different, yes?

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.520
When in fact, they're
exactly the same.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.990
Nothing is changing
on the screen

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.860
at all except the
meaning of the data.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.404
You're seeing not
the information,

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:50.820
but the meaning
of the information

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.880
based on your history.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.860
And not just your history.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.050
The history of your
culture and the history

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.600
of your evolutionary ancestors.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.110
Most of your life happened
without you there.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.547
We come into the world with all
kinds of perceptual meanings.

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:08.380
What's true for color
is also true for form.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.520
So these two tables
are the same, agreed?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.020
No?

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.580
What's wrong?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.870
No.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.420
The red table is simply the
green table on its side.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.730
They have the exact
same dimensions.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.160
The only thing that varies
are the angles at the corner.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.557
Again, you're seeing the meaning
of the data, not the data.

00:13:29.557 --> 00:13:31.140
It would be pointless
to see the data.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.752
The data is they have the
exact same dimensions.

00:13:33.752 --> 00:13:35.320
But behaviorally,
that wouldn't have

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.950
been useful in the
past, given the context.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.380
And what's true
for color and form

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.080
is also true for more
complex perceptions,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.660
like the combination
of light and sound.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.130
So when I play
this video, this is

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.130
something we worked on
for BBC many years ago,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.212
and it's called
the McGurk effect.

00:13:53.212 --> 00:13:55.420
And so when I play the sound,
you'll notice he says--

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.810
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.470
- Fah.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.060
BEAU LOTTO: Fah, as in F. Yes?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.094
- Fah, fah.

00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:00.677
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:00.677 --> 00:14:01.810
Of course, right?

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.000
And on the right, you'll
notice he says bah,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.204
as an a B, bah, right?

00:14:05.204 --> 00:14:05.870
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.267
- Bah, bah, bah, bah.

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:09.850
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.640
BEAU LOTTO: Yes?

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.290
Simple.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.706
So when I play
them both together,

00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:15.249
you have fah on the left
and bah on the right.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:15.915
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:19.055
- Fah, bah, fah.

00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:21.231
Bah, fah, bah.

00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:21.980
BEAU LOTTO: Great.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.813
Now close your eyes.

00:14:22.813 --> 00:14:24.204
- Fah, bah, fah.

00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:25.870
BEAU LOTTO: How many
sounds do you hear?

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.590
- Fah, bah, fah.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.650
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.660
BEAU LOTTO: There's one sound.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.090
There's only ever one sound.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.430
If you see his lips make the
shape of an F, you hear a fah.

Which means that
life is actually

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.060
really quite simple, right?

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.620
Very fundamental, very basic.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.900
At any point in time,
your brain is only ever

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.940
making one choice, one
decision at any moment in time,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.190
which is, do I go
towards something

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.890
or do I go away from
something, right?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.260
And whether you go
towards or away,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.570
the perceptions that you
have, the behaviors you make

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.970
are simply a reflex
grounded in your history.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.390
You have no free will
in what you're doing,

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.756
perceiving right now.

00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:36.130
It's just like when the doctor
hits your patellar tendon,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.260
and your leg goes out, right?

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.780
It is a reflex,
and that reflex is

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.240
grounded based on what
was useful to do perceived

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.316
in the past.

00:15:45.316 --> 00:15:47.630
OK?

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.030
So whether you go
towards or away

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.317
is determined by your
history, your culture history,

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:53.400
your evolutionary history.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.800
You have very little
control in the moment

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.924
of what you're going to do.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.650
So what you perceive, the
history that you perceive

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.370
is not what the thing
turned out to be.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.230
It's not the data.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.624
It's simply what you
perceived before.

00:16:09.624 --> 00:16:11.040
So what you perceive
now, what you

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.500
do now is what you did
before, the history

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.480

going to make a choice,

based on your history

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.260
And we could represent
this mathematically

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.560
in terms of a space of
possibility, a search space.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.810
And you can't just teleport
yourself around the space.

those assumptions.

It's not that sometimes

You always have an assumption.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.020
So it's as if your

this data, this completely
meaningless, arbitrary data,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.680
which is just energy
from the world,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.530
and it constructs
these perceptions,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.737
and it projects them
out into the world.

00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:46.320

The answer is no.

It creates energy, but
it doesn't make a sound,

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.910
because the sound is a
construct of your brain.

It's actually literally inside
your head, projected outward.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.170
We color the world.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.970
We are the source of
those perceptions.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.260
We color the world.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.350
Color is not a function
of the world itself.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.835
And we project these meanings
even into more complex ideas.

00:19:21.835 --> 00:19:22.710
So here's an example.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.610

And of course, there's nothing
meaningful about these two

triangles in this circle
until we put them in motion.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.280
And immediately, we start
projecting a meaning

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.400
onto these completely
arbitrary objects.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.320
We start hating one,
fearful for another.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.400

exist on the screen.

Pain is a perfect example.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.640
There's nothing
painful in the world.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.490
Painful pain is a
useful perception

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.440
about the world that exists
inside your head, right?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.440
And so what's true for color,
what's true for objects,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.500
is actually true
for other people.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.630
You have no access to the
spectral qualities of surfaces,

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.820
but nor do you have access
to inside someone's head.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.150
You have no access to
another person's thoughts.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.070

of meaningless data, right?

You are the source of
your own meaningless data.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.350
You then project a
meaning onto them.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.530
Every personality you
perceive is actually inside

You have no way of
determining whether or not

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.786
your perceptions are
actually accurate.

00:21:01.786 --> 00:21:03.243
When you connect
with someone, it's

00:21:03.243 --> 00:21:05.154
because your perceived
meaning of them

00:21:05.154 --> 00:21:06.820
happens to coincide
with their perceived

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.360

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.230
Right?

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.930

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.940
what name you're
going to give two

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.312
completely arbitrary shapes.

00:22:45.312 --> 00:22:46.520
These are meaningless shapes.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.270
They're not circles,
diamonds, or squares.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.870
They have no name, agreed?

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.620
Yes?

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.160
OK.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.040
I'm going to give you two
completely arbitrary sounds.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.460
One is kiki and the
other is booboo, right?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.417
They also don't mean anything.

00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:01.250
Now you're independent,
freethinking people.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.360
Tell me, which of these shapes,
which has no name, is kiki,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.350
and which of these
shapes is booboo?

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.850
Right?

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.110
AUDIENCE: Kiki on the left.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.818
BEAU LOTTO: How many
on the right-- yeah,

00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:12.490
say booboo's on the right
and kiki's on the left, yes?

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.590
How many of you want
to say the opposite?

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.140
So I read your minds, right?

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.160
Why is this happening?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.464
Why do you associate
them this way?

00:23:22.464 --> 00:23:23.130
It's the shapes.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.300
What is it about the shapes?

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.447
AUDIENCE: Shape of the
letters [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:28.530
BEAU LOTTO: It could be
the shapes of the letters.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.140
It actually has to do
with the sharpness, right?

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.720
It has to do with actually
your perception of pain.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.220
Your brain has an
overrepresentation

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.320
of roundness and
sharpness because it was

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.280
behaviorally useful to do so.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.120
And kiki and booboo are
sharp and rounded sounds.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.780
So if I give you the word
love and hate, how many of you

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.510
say the one on the right is
love and the one on the left

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.260
is hate?

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.920
Yes?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.130
Depending on the state of
your relationship, right?

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.910
Right?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.270
Because if I give you the word
hate and I prick your finger,

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.760
I activate the same
part of your brain,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.200
because hate is
actually painful.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.710
It's the behavioral
significance of the word

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.050
that your brain is
encoding, right?

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.230
And it's behavioral [INAUDIBLE]
of those sharp corners, which

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.901
is pain.

00:24:16.901 --> 00:24:17.400
OK?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.850
This is the basis of metaphor.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.280
You're mapping meanings.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.620
You're not mapping data.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.880
So if this is true, if
everything that I see

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.376
is grounded in my history,
and what that history gives

00:24:29.376 --> 00:24:31.250
me are assumptions, and
those assumptions are

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.280
essential for my survival--
every time I take a step,

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.854
my brain has all
kinds of assumptions

00:24:35.854 --> 00:24:37.520
that the floor is not
going to give way,

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.936
my legs aren't
going to give away.

00:24:38.936 --> 00:24:41.600
These are essential
for our survival.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.760
But the problem is,
the world changes.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.470
So what was once
useful may no longer

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:50.270
be useful, so we have to
change our assumptions.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.780
And that's the basis for
how we see differently.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.930
Change your assumptions, and
you'll change your perception.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.500
Right?

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.160
If your space of possibility is
determined by your assumptions,

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.320
if what lies right next
to me is determined

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.979
by what I assume to
be true, by changing

00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:08.520
what I assume to be
true, I'll change

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.130
what lies right next to me, OK?

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.590
I'm going to show you how
powerful this is, simply

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.305
in the context of
perceived motion.

00:25:16.305 --> 00:25:18.680
So as I put this into motion,
you'll probably assume it's

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.870
spinning from left
to right, yes?

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.460
That's because your brain
has the assumption that it

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.167
looks down onto surfaces.

00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:28.000
We come into the world
with this assumption,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.860
with this bias,
in the same way we

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.485
come into the world
with the assumption

00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:33.310
that light comes from above, OK?

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.070
We incorporate the laws of
physics into our perception.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.150
BEAU LOTTO: We'll
come to that, OK?

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.030
So for most of you, the
most likely perception,

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.100
given the assumption, it's
because your brain has

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.183
a different assumption,
which you're not aware of,

00:25:50.183 --> 00:25:51.880
but I'll make it
explicit in a second.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.380
Sorry?

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:53.297 --> 00:25:54.921
BEAU LOTTO: But the
explicit assumption

00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:57.520
is that you're actually looking
up at the surface, not down.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:58.555 --> 00:25:59.950
BEAU LOTTO: It could be.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.490
It could be.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.182
So most of you will assume
that your brain is actually

00:26:06.182 --> 00:26:07.390
looking down to that surface.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.015
If you're looking
down at that surface,

00:26:09.015 --> 00:26:11.090
then the most likely
perception is left to right.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.090
The possibility that it's
spinning right to left

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.810
is actually impossible
given that assumption.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.976
But if I put into
motion, and you

00:26:20.976 --> 00:26:22.350
try to play with
your assumption,

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.780
challenge your assumption,
imagine looking up

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.490
at it instead of
down, it will then

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.720
go in the opposite
direction, right?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.210
So sometimes if you
blur your eyes, blink,

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.637
you can get it to flip.

00:26:34.637 --> 00:26:36.720
So can you get it to go
in the opposite direction,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.940
or do you have it just going
in that same direction?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:44.364 --> 00:26:45.030
BEAU LOTTO: Yes.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.287
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:47.287 --> 00:26:48.120
BEAU LOTTO: Exactly.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.371
Can you get it to flip though?

00:26:49.371 --> 00:26:50.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:50.286 --> 00:26:51.000
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.714
But the reason why it's flipping
is-- can you get it to flip?

00:26:53.714 --> 00:26:54.880
Who else can get it to flip?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.762
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:55.762 --> 00:26:56.470
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah?

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.906
Blur your eyes and blink
and look around it.

00:27:00.906 --> 00:27:02.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.141
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:27:03.141 --> 00:27:03.640
OK.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.530
AUDIENCE: There we go.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:04.960
BEAU LOTTO: You get it?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.060
BEAU LOTTO: OK.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.060
What's happening is
basically, when you assume--

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.976
when your brain has the
assumption that you're

00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:13.540
looking down onto the surface,
the most likely interpretation

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.550
is left to right, right?

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.830
Given that assumption.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.380
As soon as you change that
assumption that you're

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.780
looking up at it, the most
likely perception is it's

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.330
spinning the opposite
direction, from right to left.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.680
What was previously
possible becomes impossible.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.330
You can no longer see it
spinning from left to right

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.109
because you've changed
your perception.

00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:35.650
And every time you switch your
perception, what your brain is

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.780
doing is changing its
assumption of whether it's

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.260
looking up or down, because
it has a different meaning

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.270
depending on that assumption.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.000
While the stimulus might
be bistable mathematically,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.190
it's not bistable in your head.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.550
It's determined by what
assumptions you're making.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.830
So what was once impossible
becomes possible.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.660
Once possible becomes
the impossible.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.030
All you're doing is
changing your assumptions.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.040
And we're just
talking about motion.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.120
This is what creativity is.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.100
Your brain never does big jumps.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.100
It never brings two things
that are far apart together.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.430
It only ever makes
a small step, right?

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.510
But it changes what's next to
it by changing its search space,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.419
by changing the assumptions
that define that search space.

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:22.960
So a quick question, which is,
which direction is it actually

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.060
rotating?

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.520
How many think left to right?

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.870
Right to left?

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.830
I don't care.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.850
There's no motion on
the screen at all.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.200
There's literally no motion.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.690
Agreed?

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.260
No?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.450
I mean, it's an
animation, right?

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.460
You're looking at a
series of still images

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.380
that are slightly
different from each other.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.999
Your brain is taking
that small change

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:50.790
and seeing the meaning
of the change, which

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.720
we call fine motion.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.860
If I took all those images and
put them in random sequence,

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.580
you would simply see a flicker.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.120
So you're seeing the meaning
of the change, not the change.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.640
OK.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.240
So this idea that "creativity
is this chaotic, messy,

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.582
serendipitous process"
is predicated on the idea

00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:12.040
that the brain puts two things
that are far apart together,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.090
that it actually
jumps, teleports

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.120
within its search space.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.910
That's not how
adaptive systems work.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.550
They only ever do small steps.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.140
So if that's true,
then in fact, there's

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.090
nothing creative
about creativity.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.397
It's only creative
from the outside.

00:29:30.397 --> 00:29:32.230
When you see someone
putting two things that

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.960
are far apart together,
it's because for you, they

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.280
are far apart together.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.710
You have a different
search space.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.140
For them, they're
making not a simple,

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.750
but they're making
a logical next step,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.540
consciously or unconsciously,
to the next most likely

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.120
possible based on
their search space,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.484
which is based on
their assumptions.

00:29:51.484 --> 00:29:53.150
Because they have
different assumptions,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.529
a different history, they have
a different search space, Right?

00:29:56.529 --> 00:29:57.320
And you think, wow.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.340
How did they do that?

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.840
How did they bring those two
things that far apart together?

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.150
Again, for you, they are.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.160
For them, they're not.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.950
So creativity is this
process of taking small steps

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.320
to the next most
likely, changing

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.330
your space of possibility by
questioning your assumptions.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.310
OK?

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.290
And that's the basis
for how we change

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:22.200
our assumptions, which is all
revolutions begin with a joke.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.420
They begin with a question.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.460
Nothing interesting
begins with knowing.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.840
It begins with not knowing.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.280
It doesn't begin with an answer.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.526
It begins with a question, and
it begins with a good question.

00:30:35.526 --> 00:30:37.400
You could be a great
experimentalist, come up

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.170
with a great
experimental design.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.230
But if you're asking a
bad question, who cares?

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.735
The cash is in a good
question, not necessarily

00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:47.907
in the right answer, right?

00:30:47.907 --> 00:30:49.740
So if you're actually
wanting to get someone

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.930
to shift from A to
B, the first step

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.370
is not actually B. The
first step is just to stop.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.610
The first step is to stop
the association that you're

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.500
making with that stimulus.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.490
The first step is to go to
not A. If what I'm doing

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.200
is I get a stimulus
and I automatically

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.290
generate a meaning,
the first step is not

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.640
to create a new meaning.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.470
The first step is to not make
that meaning, to go to not A.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.150
And then once you're in
that space of uncertainty,

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.860
now you can go in
multiple directions.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.400
So you can control the process
of going to not A, right?

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.400
But you can't control
where you go next.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.260
And we'll come to the
importance of ecology

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.550
for where you go next after, OK?

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.340
But if this is true, if asking
questions, and in particular,

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.950
good questions is the
basis of creativity,

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.510
why is it so difficult
to ask a good question?

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.770
Why is that so hard for us?

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.710
I'm going to suggest two
main reasons for this.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.320
There are others, but
these are two main reasons.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.474
And the first one
is that we often

00:31:58.474 --> 00:31:59.890
walk through life
thinking we have

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.860
an objective view of the world,
that we're rational, right?

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.860
That we have no
assumptions and biases.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.400
Or we'll admit that sometimes we
do, it's just that not always.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.260
But the point here
is every time you

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.760
make a perception
or a behavior, you

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.109
have biases and assumptions.

00:32:14.109 --> 00:32:15.400
You can never escape from them.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.350
You can change them,
but you can never

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:22.050
escape from having
assumptions and biases, right?

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:26.420
So here's a game you can play
when you have people around

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.970
for dinner, and you can do
it as a thought experiment

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.840
right now to demonstrate the
irrationality of who we are.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.290
Imagine you have
a glass of water,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.460
and imagine spitting inside
your glass of water, right?

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.780
So do this at home when you
have friends around, right?

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:43.280
Imagine--

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.450
--imagine spitting into
your glass of water, right?

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.490
So now imagine drinking it.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.457
Do you get a sense of disgust?

00:32:53.457 --> 00:32:55.040
But it's completely
irrational, right?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.790
What was once in your
mouth, you're simply

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.640
putting right back in, right?

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.400
It's just part of you, right?

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.719
But we can't help but generate
this perception of disgust,

00:33:04.719 --> 00:33:06.260
even though it's
completely rational.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.850
AUDIENCE: Kids wouldn't
mind to do that.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.150
BEAU LOTTO: Sorry?

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.470
AUDIENCE: Kids wouldn't
mind to do that.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.940
BEAU LOTTO: No, kids
would be fine with it.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.481
Even if it was
someone else's saliva,

00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:14.420
they'd be fine with it, right?

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.110
Right?

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.900
So everything you do has a bias.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.465
Everything you do has
an assumption, OK?

00:33:21.465 --> 00:33:23.840
But the other problem is that
these assumptions are often

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.400
hidden to us.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.010
We often have no idea
why we do what we do,

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.290
in the same way you didn't
know why you necessarily

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.420
named those two shapes
kiki and booboo.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.422
Our assumptions are
often hidden to us,

00:33:36.422 --> 00:33:37.630
and here's an example of one.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.979
- So there's nothing
Barack Obama could do

00:33:39.979 --> 00:33:41.620
to prove that he was born here.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.110
- If there was
maybe witnesses that

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.180
were in attendance at his birth.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:46.930
- Like his mother?

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.221
Would you listen to his mother?

00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:48.770
- No, no, no.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.010
She has motivation to lie.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.690
- So you don't trust Donald
Trump's birth certificate

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:53.400
either?

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.500
- Uh, yeah, because
he's been here forever.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.500
- Well, how do you know?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.958
But how do you--
what's your proof?

00:33:57.958 --> 00:33:59.720
- Um, well, his parents and--

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.940
- But no, they're biased.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.030
I'm talking about,
like, people who could--

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.560
- Why would they be biased?

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.440
- Well, like, I'm just using
your logic against you.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.870
BEAU LOTTO: Right?

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.840
And we laugh, but we're
no different, right?

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.280
Everything we do
are assumptions,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.639
and we often don't
know that we're

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.401
being guided, our
decisions, our choices

00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:22.150
are being guided by
these assumptions that

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.699
are almost blind to us, right?

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.050
We're blind to them, right?

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.699
Hence the power of
diversity of groups.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.659
So diversity of groups have
at least two significances.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.540
First of all, the best person
to reveal your own assumptions

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.670
to you is rarely you.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.940
It's usually someone else in
the right kind of environment.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.880
So if you give me
two groups, one

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.606
average to lower IQ from
a more diverse background,

00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:49.730
versus another group which
has a higher average IQ,

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.670
but from the same background,
I want the first group, right?

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.505
Because in that group
in the right setting,

00:34:55.505 --> 00:34:57.630
they're more likely to
reveal their own assumptions

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.770
to each other.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.710
What's more, the search
space of that group

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.845
is much more complex.

00:35:03.845 --> 00:35:05.470
It's a higher
dimensional search space,

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.280
because they have more
diverse assumptions.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.230
And we know from
complex systems theory

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.650
that the best solutions
are more likely to exist

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.950
in a more complex search space
than in a simpler search space.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.180
A simpler search space is more
adaptable, more evolvable,

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.230
but it's actually less likely
to hold the best solution.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.210
So I want the first group.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.100
I discover what my
assumptions are,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.260
and I can occupy within
a more complex search

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.230
space in the right environment,
which I'll come to in a moment.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.580
And the kind of search space
and the kind of combination

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.060
diversity that we tend to work
with is expert with naive.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.050
And the reason is because
experts are super efficient,

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.110
but they're terrible
asking a good question.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.690
But what's ironic is they
can recognize a good question

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.720
when asked.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.190
Whereas people who are naive,
they can ask great questions,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.830
but they don't know
they're great questions.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.036
So we find it's a
great combination.

00:36:02.036 --> 00:36:03.660
And also the power
of actually stepping

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.690
into a space which is
different from what you know.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.960
So you can actually shift
yourself from expert and naive,

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.995
and back and forth.

00:36:10.995 --> 00:36:15.440
So you can occupy both ways
of being at the same time.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.840
So both in groups,
but also internally.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.720
It is the combination
of expert and naive.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.240
And also, think
about technology.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.340
It's obviously here.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.370
So what defines the
best technology?

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.290
One argument is
that it's not what

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.730
enables us to do what we
can already do faster,

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.190
easier, with less friction.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.480
Those are good technologies.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.470
They're useful.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.040
They're not necessary
transformative.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.140
What are the ones that
are transformative?

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.780
I'd suggest they make
the invisible visible.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.210
They enable us to see what
we couldn't see before.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.940
A microscope, a telescope, MRI.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.430
Even a book.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.680
Being able to travel to
a new culture, right?

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.440
Because not only does that
reveal our own assumptions

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.220
to ourselves.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:03.030
It enables us to expand the
complexity of our assumptions.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.580
To shift from being the
center of the universe

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.490
to then revolving around,
orbiting around the sun,

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.140
completely changed
our assumptions

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.880
of what it was to be human.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.220
Those are transformative
technologies

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.280
that enable us to see what
we couldn't see previously.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.090
Which is why creativity
actually begins with humility.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.900
It begins with not knowing.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.182
So actually, one of
my aims in this talk

00:37:27.182 --> 00:37:28.890
is that you know less
at the end than you

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.170
think you know now, right?

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.050
Because nothing interesting
begins with knowing.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.700
It begins with not knowing.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.590
So the second one, and
the most difficult,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.890
is it might be that you now
accept that everything you do

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.640
has a bias and an
assumption, and that you're

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.470
going to now try to
reveal what they are

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.590
to yourself or through others.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.410
But now you have the next step,
which is to question them.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:59.270
But we hate not knowing, because
to question an assumption,

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.700
especially the assumptions
that define who you are,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.740
puts you into uncertainty.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.320
And we hate uncertainty.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.290
To not be sure that was a
predator, it's too late.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.390
Your brain evolved to
take what is uncertain

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.370
and to make it certain.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.020
So when you go down
below in a boat

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.670
and you're either moving
relative to the boat,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.700
your eyes are saying,
oh, we're standing still.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.324
But your inner ears
are saying, no, no.

00:38:20.324 --> 00:38:20.960
We're moving.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.876
And your brain cannot
deal with that conflict,

00:38:22.876 --> 00:38:25.070
which is one of the reasons
why you get seasick.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.330
So you go above deck and
you watch the horizon,

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.080
so your eyes and inner ears
are moving in register.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:36.860
We hate uncertainty,
because dying is easy.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.350
To step into uncertainty
is literally-- to not know

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.940
throughout evolution
was to increase

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.890
the probability of dying.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.490
Your brain evolved to predict.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.490
The better it's able to
predict, the more likely

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.972
it is able to survive.

00:38:48.972 --> 00:38:50.870
OK?

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.300
And what's more,
the best questions

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.710
create the most uncertainty.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.830
So for instance, imagine we
were remodel your biases,

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.347
your assumptions as
a network, right?

00:39:01.347 --> 00:39:03.430
Which we could do with the
gene regulatory network

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.540
or your biases, right?

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.710
And in the upper left, those
are your biases that are not

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.402
connected to each other, right?

00:39:10.402 --> 00:39:11.860
It'd be like a gene
that's encoding

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.210
the color of your eyes, OK?

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.180
Now if we're to
question that bias

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.600
and metaphorically move
it, nothing else changes.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.060
Just that bias.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.090
Now imagine instead
you question a bias,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.010
you move a bias
that's fully connected

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.890
to all your other assumptions,
something that maybe

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.945
defines what it is to be you.

00:39:31.945 --> 00:39:33.320
That would be an
example of, say,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.180
a homeobox gene that determines
segmentation of the body.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.010
If you shift that by--
it's the same amount

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.530
of energy, same
amount of movement,

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.270
the whole system shifts.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.160
This is what we call
in complex systems

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.550
a point of self-criticality.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.560
And we experience this
in nature all the time.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.910
Here's an example.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.350
This snow bank is under a
tremendous amount of tension,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.760
because it's fully connected.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.010
You add a small
amount of weight,

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:05.000
and the whole thing gives way.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.697
So great questions can cause
massive shifts in uncertainty.

00:40:13.697 --> 00:40:16.030
And now you're all wondering
whether or not he survived.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.655
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:16.655 --> 00:40:17.363
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:40:17.363 --> 00:40:19.120
I'm not going to tell
you just yet, right?

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.734
Because you are experiencing
uncertainty, right?

00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:25.150
That's what it is
being uncertain.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.830
You want to know, right?

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.430
We hate not knowing and
sitting with that moment

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.990
of not knowing.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.290
And yet, the irony is
that's the only place

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.500
you can go if you're ever
going to be creative,

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.950
is to step into uncertainty.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:43.730
And again, to be in uncertainty
creates a tremendous amount

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.230
of stress.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.080
That's one of our
biggest sources

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.460
of unwellness in our world
is the speed and uncertainty,

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.240
right?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.940
It actually decreases
connectivity within the brain,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.055
decreases adaptability,
increases brain cell death.

00:40:57.055 --> 00:40:59.430
It actually makes you a more
extreme version of yourself.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.080
If you're a liberal,
you become more liberal.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.371
If you're a conservative,
you become more conservative.

00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:05.970
You go to a place
that is familiar.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.010
Almost every
behavior you do, you

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.409
do in order to
increase certainty.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:13.200
You could argue it's
one of the reasons why

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.330
Uber was originally successful.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.700
Not because they enabled
you to order a taxi easier.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.740
It's because they told you when
the taxi was going to arrive.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.180
If I put you in San Francisco
on the street corner

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.435
and you're trying to catch a
taxi, and after five minutes,

00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:31.560
all these are going by,
you're completely stressed,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.300
your cortisol
levels are going up.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.685
And finally, you get a taxi.

00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:36.810
Now if instead I sit you
on the same street corner,

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.268
and after five
minutes I say, don't

00:41:38.268 --> 00:41:40.455
worry, it'll be there
in five minutes, right?

00:41:40.455 --> 00:41:42.330
You're using your phone,
your cortisol levels

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.690
go down, et cetera.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.870
Right?

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:47.310
It's because of uncertainty.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.490
Which is why in London now, they
put the times on all the bus

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.120
stops.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.590
Even though it's going
to be an hour and a half

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.030
before the bus gets
there, but knowing it's

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.370
going to be an hour and a
half decreases your stress.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.450
And at Terminal 5 in Heathrow,
wonderful, classic example.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.870
You get off the Heathrow
Express, you go into a lift.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.670
There's only one place
for this lift to go,

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.830
which is one floor
up to departures.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:12.040
So you step in, the doors shut,
and now you're trapped, right?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.920
Because there's no button to
tell you to go to floor one.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.320
So the first experience of
this millions and millions

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.920
of dollars terminal
was stress, right?

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.950
Because of uncertainty.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:22.850
So what did they do?

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.350
They put a little button on the
lift, that when you touched it,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.705
the light went on, and it was
connected to nothing else.

00:42:28.705 --> 00:42:29.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.517
Right?

00:42:30.517 --> 00:42:31.600
So you walked in the lift.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.820
You had this sense that, ah.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.444
Thank goodness.

00:42:33.444 --> 00:42:35.677
Now it goes-- it was always
going to go up, right?

00:42:35.677 --> 00:42:37.760
It was always going to do
exactly what it's doing.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.426
But you had this sense
of certainty now,

00:42:39.426 --> 00:42:41.080
of familiarity, right?

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.330
We hate uncertainty.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.600
And again, that's the
only place we can go

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.230
if we're going to be creative.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.790
So how does the brain
deal with uncertainty?

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.730
Because what's more, that
uncertainty and stress

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.950
reduces your space
of possibility.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.200
In fact, here's an example
of a space of possibility

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.390
reducing to a single dimension.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:02.990
This happened in Australia.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.570
He's going in to rob a bank.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.760
This actually happened.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.110
He hands the teller
a note, right?

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:09.860
And now suddenly, the
bank gets shut down.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.970
He's trapped.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.260
He's stuck, right?

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.760
He's locked in.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.730
But in fact, he's locked within
a completely narrow space

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.440
of possibility, one
dimension, because he's

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.930
forgotten that doors pull
as well as push, right?

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:30.400
So he was trapped by his
search space, not by the door.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.850
He was caught five
minutes later.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:33.350
Right?

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.630
AUDIENCE: Wait, so it
wasn't actually locked.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:35.838
BEAU LOTTO: It wasn't locked.

00:43:35.838 --> 00:43:37.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.280
The door was always open, but he
was pushing against it, right?

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.600
Because his search space went
down to a single dimension.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.390
And that's what happens when you
get stressed from uncertainty.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.932
So how can the brain--
but if the only place

00:43:51.932 --> 00:43:54.140
we can go to be creative is
to step into uncertainty,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.690
the very place that our brain
evolved to avoid, how is it

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.310
that we can actually go there?

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.400
What is evolution's
solution to uncertainty?

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.300
Because it's essential,
in order to adapt,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.890
that we're able to go there.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:07.420
So evolution gave us a solution.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.690
So what's the one thing that
you do where you actually

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.010
love uncertainty?

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.330
It's not that you tolerate it.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:14.920
You actually seek it.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.180
What's the one
thing that you do?

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.640
AUDIENCE: Play games.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.020
BEAU LOTTO: Play.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.560
Play is evolution's
solution to uncertainty.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.900
Is why play evolved, right?

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.990
What's more, play is
a way of being, OK?

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.886
It's a way-- for
those who study play,

00:44:33.886 --> 00:44:35.760
it's not just running
around in a playground.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.320
It is literally a serious way
of being that our brain evolved

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.940
to have, OK?

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.110
And if we add intention
to play, we get science.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.650
Science is nothing other
than play with intention.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.920
Empiricism is
inherent to the brain.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.730
And how do you define science,
and how do you define play?

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:56.940
So it's not like play.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.090
It literally is play.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.490
When we created an education
program based on this,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.489
it resulted in the youngest
published scientists

00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:05.230
in the world, aged
eight to 10 years old,

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.080
and the youngest
ever TED speaker.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.420
Because if you add rules
to play, you have a game.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.630
That's an experiment.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.987
But it's rethinking what science
is, which is not a methodology.

00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:17.820
That is the craft of
science, but that's not

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.350
what defines science.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.990
Science is this way of being,
which celebrates uncertainty.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:24.780
It encourages diversity.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.430
It's actually how
we create diversity.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.670
The function of science is, in
fact, to increase uncertainty.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.879
Because quality of science
isn't the question you ask.

00:45:33.879 --> 00:45:34.920
It's open to possibility.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.440
It's inherently cooperative and
it's intrinsically motivating.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.440
What does it mean to be
intrinsically motivated?

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.606
Almost everything you do,
you do for a reward that's

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:44.430
different from what you do.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:48.330
What is the reward for skiing?

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:49.660
It's skiing.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.610
The reward for play
is play itself.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.440
It's intrinsically motivating.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.850
And that's true
for anything that

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.100
is in the process of discovery.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.770
The reward of science,
the reward of discovery

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.170
is the discovery itself.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.530
And these are actually
what defines play.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.795
And if we add intention
to play, you have science.

00:46:09.795 --> 00:46:11.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.260
BEAU LOTTO: That's true.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.600
So I'm not talking about
the output of science.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.580
But I wouldn't say
science is about truth.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.680
Science is about utility.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.420
Evolution is not about truth.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.910
Evolution is about what's
useful, about predictable,

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:32.410
right?

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.734
Even with our mathematics,
we have theorems.

00:46:34.734 --> 00:46:36.400
All that theorems are
is making explicit

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.483
what your assumptions are.

00:46:37.483 --> 00:46:39.040
Given these set of
assumptions, this

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.720
is what we believe to be true.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.100
True is that this is far more
predictable than that was.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.710
So my theory of neuroscience,
for instance, so I'm

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.070
looking at neurotropic factors
in brain cell growth, right?

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.870
I'm looking empirically
to see, what

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.750
is the most likely explanation
for the data that I've got?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.970
I'm looking for
understanding that

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.400
decreases dimensionality
of the space of possibility

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.970
of the search, right?

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.540
So if I can reduce it to
one variable versus two,

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.620
I have a better explanation.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.550
That's utility.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:11.660
That's useful.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.130
I'm making a prediction.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.910
Is it true?

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.860
Well, then we get into the
semantics of what true is.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.190
And you could argue,
that is truth.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.800
To be able to predict in
every single situation

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.340
is potentially true, right?

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.100
But in terms of, for instance,
what your brain is doing,

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.960
if your brain is
when the cricket

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.640
or when the male fly is trying
to mate with the female fly,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.010
and it's trying to
predict her trajectory,

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:39.156
we can mathematically
model that.

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.030
Is that mathematical
model actually happening

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.810
inside that brain?

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:43.580
No.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:48.080
It's generated behavior
that is useful, right?

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.460
Empirically.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.940
Over the course of evolution,
learning, and development.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.610
So science is about absolutely--

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.819
I'm not saying this is
post-modern relativism at all.

00:47:57.819 --> 00:47:59.360
Post-modern relativism
doesn't exist.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.100
If it did, evolution
wouldn't exist.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.145
Some things are
better than others.

00:48:03.145 --> 00:48:05.270
We just don't know what
they are a priori, which is

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.750
why we have empiricism, right?

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.840
What we get from that
is truth in the sense

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.760
that it's highly
predictable or more

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.880
predictable than
the previous theory.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.140
OK?

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.020
And the way we do that-- but
that's the process of science.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.250
That's the scientific method.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.930
But in order to
do that, you have

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.380
to be able to ask
a good question.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.090
And in order to
ask that question,

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.260
you have to celebrate the
possibility of being wrong,

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.910
of not knowing, right?

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:36.040
So my suggestion is
that what underpins

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.280
good science is a way of being
that we actually call play.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.830
And it underpins
not just science.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.660
Anything that is creative.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.560
Whereas play has no intention.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.350
It's just simply
for the sake of it.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.630
Something like science or art
actually has an intention.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.160
It's trying to do something.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.090
See what I mean?

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.135
AUDIENCE: Earlier, you had a
video of people arguing about,

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.830
where was Barack Obama born?

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.797
And the way you've
defined science,

00:49:01.797 --> 00:49:03.880
I would interpret that to
mean it doesn't actually

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.130
matter where he was born,
that where he was born

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.720
doesn't have an answer.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.220
The only thing that matters
is what your bias is

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.730
or whether it fits your
subset of evidence.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.880
The question of where
he was really born

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.700
doesn't really exist
anywhere in this definition,

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.130
and that's the reason why
I don't buy the definition.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:24.370
That question has an answer, and
that answer is external to me,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.440
and it's external to my biases.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.080
And it may be true that
I have this or that bias,

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.400
but my biases have
only a limited power.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.200
My biases do not change
where Barack Obama was born.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.480
That fact is completely
independent of my biases.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.650
And so I find this definition
of science to be incomplete,

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.772
because science absolutely
does care about reality.

00:49:47.772 --> 00:49:48.480
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.060
I completely-- it doesn't
necessarily care about reality.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.640
It cares about predictability.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.340
The two can be very
coincident, yeah?

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.815
So I completely--
the process-- the aim

00:49:59.815 --> 00:50:01.690
here is not to define
the process of science,

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.930
the scientific method, which of
course, I apply in my own lab.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.581
What I'm trying to
suggest is that in order

00:50:07.581 --> 00:50:09.580
to apply that method, you
need to have something

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.140
that comes first, right?

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.904
You have to have a
desire to ask a question.

00:50:14.904 --> 00:50:16.820
You have to have the
willingness to doubt what

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.930
you think to be true already.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:20.570
You have to be willing to doubt
your own biases to think, well,

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.440
maybe Barack Obama was
actually born here.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.020
You have to have that if you're
going to do good science,

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.840
ie, if you're going to apply
a good scientific method.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.520
But you could have designed
the greatest experiment,

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.170
but if you have a crap
question, who cares, right?

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:39.200
Because then you find
a useless answer.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.550
I want you to come up
with a great answer,

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.370
but to do that, you have
to ask a great question.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:46.170
I want you to be a
great experimentalist,

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:47.920
but you could be the
best experimentalist,

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.950
but you'll still be
a crap scientist.

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.480
Because you'll come
up with useless

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.240
answers if you're
not willing to ask

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.430
a question, especially a
question that challenges

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:58.840
your own assumptions.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.344
And that's what
science is, is to be

00:51:00.344 --> 00:51:02.260
able to challenge your
own assumptions of what

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.060
you think is true.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.700
But to do that, your brain
evolved to take you away

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.380
from that place.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.065
And one of the only places
literally in evolution

00:51:11.065 --> 00:51:13.660
that it enables you to
challenge your own biases

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.960
is in the context of play.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.400
That's the way of being
that enables you to do that.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.340
And then you apply
the scientific method

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.170
of empiricism, right?

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.540
One control, one
variable, et cetera.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.480
But having one control is like
defining an artist's painting

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:31.650
based on the brushstrokes
or the pigment chemistry.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:34.590
The mechanism of painting is
not what defines whether or not

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.840
it was a good piece of art.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.185
It's the view.

00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:40.060
This is incomplete in
the sense that you then

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.870
apply a scientific method
on top of it, absolutely.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.370
And the intention of science
is different from the intention

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.660
of art.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.964
But the initiation, the desire
to go forward is the same,

00:51:49.964 --> 00:51:50.630
is the argument.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:51.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.280
And what's more, the most
successful systems in nature

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:59.824
are also the ones that
play into adulthood, right?

00:51:59.824 --> 00:52:01.240
So the point is,
you have to adopt

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.720
this way of being
if you're going

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.980
to ever explore the world.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.590
Otherwise, you'll be
stuck in your own biases

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:10.090
and your own
assumptions, and you'll

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:14.080
continue to live with the
idea that Barack Obama was

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.678
born in Africa, and not
from the States, right?

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:24.180
So the third point
is that in order

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.670
to be able to ask these
questions, to be in a lab,

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:29.730
for instance, where
questions are a good thing,

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.170
you need an ecology.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.630
It's not good enough just to
be on your own, necessarily.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.690
You need an environment where
asking questions, being playful

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:38.760
is actually a
positive thing, right?

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.244
Hence the power of
the host, the leader.

00:52:41.244 --> 00:52:43.410
And if you ask people, what
defines good leadership,

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.207
you get all kinds
of answers, right?

00:52:45.207 --> 00:52:47.040
But there are only three
that are associated

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.690
with the success
of any one company,

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.770
which has lead by example, admit
mistakes, and see qualities

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:54.060
in others.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.740
These are the three that define
the success of any one company.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.365
And the reason is
because they actually

00:52:58.365 --> 00:53:00.207
create an environment of play.

00:53:00.207 --> 00:53:02.540
The first one, lead by example,
is space that is secure.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.664
You can't ask questions
and play outside of space

00:53:05.664 --> 00:53:06.330
that is trusted.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.240
This is very well known.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.710
The second is admit mistakes.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:13.043
That is space that celebrates
uncertainty, that mistakes

00:53:13.043 --> 00:53:15.060
are OK, questions are OK.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.175
Not answers.

00:53:16.175 --> 00:53:17.500
All right?

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.010
Not to say that answers
are not important,

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:22.052
but you have to have
a good question first.

00:53:22.052 --> 00:53:23.760
And the third is see
qualities in others.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.010
That's the space that
celebrates diversity.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.510
Again, three of
the parameters are

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.340
essential for a quality of play.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.170
So we'll finish with two
examples of leadership.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:35.670
Here's one.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:03.420
BEAU LOTTO: Right?

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.208
Notice he looks up
for reassurance.

00:54:09.888 --> 00:54:10.824
[CRASH]

00:54:10.824 --> 00:54:11.480
[END PLAYBACK]

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.792
Right?

00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:15.250
So the question, of course, is
what kind of leader are you?

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:15.750
Right?

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.710
So we can just finish
with, who cares, right?

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:19.460
At the point when I
show you an illusion--

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.607
there is an illusion here.

00:54:20.607 --> 00:54:22.190
The seeing yourself
is actually dark--

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:25.190
is the same intensity
as the see there.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.949
Right now you're
seeing an illusion.

00:54:26.949 --> 00:54:29.240
But as soon as you know that
you're seeing an illusion,

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.490
your brain is holding two
mutually exclusive realities

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:33.500
at the same time, you're
seeing one reality,

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.080
but you also know
another reality.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.390
That's an incredibly powerful
thing for our brains,

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.640
to be able to hold two
mutually exclusive ideas

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.020
at the same time.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.320
That is the basis
for imagination.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.940
OK?

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:50.600
So this relates
ultimately to conflict.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.549
If conflict is the only place
where we can actually learn--

00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:56.090
and by definition
of conflict, I mean

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.548
to enter a situation that is
different from what you assume

00:54:58.548 --> 00:54:59.990
to be true, you're in conflict.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.360
Evolution, in that sense,
you could argue conceptually

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.770
as a conflicting process.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.680
That's the only place where
we can actually change.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.830
The problem is we enter conflict
in usually the same way.

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:11.720
If you and I are
in disagreement,

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.120
it's as if we're on different
ends of the same line.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.710
My aim is to prove
that you're wrong

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:17.418
and to shift you
towards me, and your aim

00:55:17.418 --> 00:55:19.390
is to do exactly the opposite.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:22.730
In that format of conflict,
we're set up to win,

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.560
but not necessarily learn.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.404
The question is, how does
biology deal with conflict?

00:55:29.404 --> 00:55:30.070
Here's a riddle.

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:33.152
How can you move those
two dots closer together

00:55:33.152 --> 00:55:35.568
without actually shifting the
location of the dots at all?

00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:42.690
AUDIENCE: Enlarge the circles.

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.300
BEAU LOTTO: Enlarge
the circles, right?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.180
You increase the space.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.280
You increase the dimensionality
of the space, right?

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.830
In the case of genetics, it's
called extradimensional bypass,

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.329
right?

00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:55.780
You complexify.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.507
You complexify the system.

00:55:57.507 --> 00:55:59.840
So while we might be at
opposite ends of the same lines,

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:02.740
we can actually be at
same side of a square.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.037
It now gives you more
directions in which to move.

00:56:06.037 --> 00:56:07.870
As you increase the
dimensionality of space,

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.970
you actually relatively become
closer and closer together,

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:11.470
right?

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.720
Now you create the possibility
of learning rather than

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.754
just winning.

00:56:14.754 --> 00:56:16.420
And this is how
actually nature resolves

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:21.809
conflict, by increasing the
dimensionality of space.

00:56:21.809 --> 00:56:23.100
So we'll finish with that idea.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.974
So imagine, in order to
do that, you actually

00:56:24.974 --> 00:56:28.630
have to enter conflict with a
question instead of an answer.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.220
And that's the
space-- that's the way

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.690
of being that's required in
order to do good science.

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:36.702
You enter with a question
rather than with an answer.

00:56:36.702 --> 00:56:37.690
OK?

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.840
So I hope that's useful.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.170
OK?

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.540
So any questions?

00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:48.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.450
This feels weird
talking on this.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.520
I've read an article
from a mathematician that

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.984
ends up questioning reality.

00:56:53.984 --> 00:56:56.150
And he says-- the biggest
thing that stuck out to me

00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.570
was, neuroscientists are
asking the wrong question.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.320
They shouldn't be
asking what's happening.

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.570
They should be asking, does
the gray matter even exist?

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:08.630
If we're always constantly
perceiving things incorrectly,

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:12.680
or shared perception is kind
of off, does the brain exist?

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.990
Does this chair even
exist in this reality,

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.040
or are we sharing that?

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.260
And I don't-- I'd like to hear
from a neuroscientist to tell

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:18.950
me a little bit about it.

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:19.658
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:57:19.658 --> 00:57:21.380
So the world exists.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.780
The physical world
exists, right?

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.140
What we perceive of that
world is not the same thing

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.980
as the world itself.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.960
I'll give you a
very simple example

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.600
to demonstrate that
this has to be true.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.750
Take light.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.110
Light is a linear
spectrum from--

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.610
well, actually, it's
electromagnetic radiation,

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.010
which is a huge spectrum.

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:43.310
We are sensitive to a very small
window, which by definition, we

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:44.310
call light.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.950
Light is part of the region
that we're sensitive to.

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.810
It's a linear spectrum, right?

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.540
We perceive that as a circle.

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.310
We perceive the
short wavelengths

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.880
to be blue and the long
wavelengths to be red.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.590
Which means that
perceptually, they

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:02.390
appear more similar
to each other

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:04.340
than they do to green,
which is in the middle.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.629
Even though they're
physically closer to green,

00:58:06.629 --> 00:58:08.670
they are perceptually more
similar to each other.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:12.530
It's a bit like one kilo
feeling a lot like 1,000 kilos,

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.050
but very different
from 500 kilos.

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.570
So even there in our
perception of color,

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:22.100
we don't do an isomorphic
representation of light itself.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.990
Our perception of
light is also color.

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.740
It has four categories, red,
green, blue, and yellow.

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:31.700
Spectra are uniformly,
continuously changing.

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.430
There's nothing
categorical about light.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.410
And yet, it was
perceptually useful to see

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.652
light in terms of
four categories,

00:58:38.652 --> 00:58:40.610
possibly because of the
four-color map problem,

00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:43.700
cartography, where you need
four colors, a minimum of four

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.790
colors to color any map in
order to make sure two surfaces

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.800
don't actually have
the same color, two

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.336
adjoining surfaces [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:50.336 --> 00:58:51.710
So it could be
useful that that's

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.690
why we see four
categories of color.

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:59.102
But it has nothing to do with
the category nature of spectra.

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.710
So spectra exists.

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.890
It's just that we don't
represent them as spectra.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.990
We represent them in a
way that was useful, not

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:07.906
in the way that was accurate.

00:59:07.906 --> 00:59:08.406
Yeah?

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.510
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering whether it

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.470
has to do with genetics
about how people stress out

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:21.800
about uncertainty.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.900
So I don't get nauseous on
the boats, and some people do.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.850
The question is, does
it imply that I'm

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:30.400
more tolerant to
uncertainty, and hence,

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.320
better at doing open
questions and doing science

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.910
than these other people?

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:36.670
BEAU LOTTO: Yeah.

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:38.000
So it's a very good question.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.240
I think it is true that
some people actually

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.280
have more tolerance for
uncertainty than others.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.220
And it's also a really important
question why they might be so.

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.680
Now it could be genetic.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.040
But also, if you think
about parenting--

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.240
so I have three kids.

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.400
My role, in some
sense, is to create

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.402
the certainty that enables
them to step into uncertainty.

00:59:58.402 --> 01:00:00.610
Because you can't step into
uncertainty unless you're

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.220
stepping from someplace.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.040
You can't play outside
of space that's trusted.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.610
So people who often can
tolerate uncertainty,

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:10.540
it's because they have
something very certain

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.539
that counterbalances it.

01:00:13.879 --> 01:00:15.920
And so a lot of education,
a lot of [INAUDIBLE],,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.796
is about trying to create
that certainty, right?

01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:20.420
It could be through
love, for instance,

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.920
that enables a
child, in this case,

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.020
to feel very
wanted, that enables

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.220
them to now step into and
be courageous and explore.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.840
But often, kids
that don't have that

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.180
find it very difficult
to be in uncertainty,

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.030
because so much of
their life is uncertain.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.100
They're actually looking for
certainly, not uncertainty.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.470
So I don't know if it's genetic.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.750
There seems to possibly
be a genetic component.

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:46.470
But there definitely is a
difference in people, right?

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:48.840
But the idea here is that we
can actually help people--

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.627
other people step
into uncertainty

01:00:50.627 --> 01:00:53.085
by helping to create an ecology
that enables them to do so.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.110
SPEAKER: Let's get a round
of applause for Beau.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.945
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:59.945 --> 01:01:02.390
BEAU LOTTO: Thanks
for coming in.
