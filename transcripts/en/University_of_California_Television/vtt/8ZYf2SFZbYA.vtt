[ Music ]

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.036
&gt;&gt; How's everyone this morning?

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:53.156
[ Cheering ]

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:56.976
Oh guys. How are
you this morning?

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:58.156
[ Cheering ]

00:00:58.156 --> 00:01:00.376
There you go.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:01.916
That's what I'd like to hear.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.576
So, I'm really, really
happy to be here.

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:10.906
This-- It feels like coming
home and I was going to wait

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:14.626
to shed my tears about
how much I love Tim

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.616
until the middle of my talk.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.456
But I'm going to start now,

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:21.146
because we all have
Tim in our mind.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:27.856
But I got into this whole
thing because of Tim.

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.816
I was a college student
who was really interested

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.606
in climate change, because
that was the issue that I felt

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:33.956
like was the issue of our times.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.766
And in a way I still do,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.726
but I hadn't ask the question
what actually lights me up

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:40.376
and what gets my heart going.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:42.926
And in conversations,
Tim really saw

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:44.996
that food was what lit me up.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:47.556
And so he said, "Hey,
there's this food conference,

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:49.156
called Food and Community.

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:49.986
You should come.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:51.216
Just check it out.

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:52.786
It'll be fine.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:54.106
I know your climate change.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:55.206
It's just four days."

00:01:56.376 --> 00:02:01.196
And now 10 years later,
it's been my whole career.

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:04.556
And one of the reasons why
I wanted to say that is

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:10.686
because it takes a deeply
spiritual level of humility

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:15.036
to be that person that sticks
with a community and an issue

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:22.926
for decades, and supports the
shiny objects that America likes

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:25.896
to grab on to like me, people
of color who are articulate,

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:28.226
who are charismatic,
who like the stage.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:31.666
But the people who support
us, who get us started,

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:35.266
who were the ones pushing us
every time we need pushing,

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:36.646
are people like Tim.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:39.736
So for me, he is
one of my teachers.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:44.176
And I just wanted to have make
sure that we were all clear,

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.526
I know whose shoulders I stand
on and I'm very, very grateful

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:49.376
to Tim and I'm grateful to
Katy Menard [assumed spelling]

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.066
because both of them were
the ones that helped push me

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:53.376
into where I am right now.

00:02:54.616 --> 00:03:02.336
So, moving on from there, I
wanted to help set some context

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:04.396
because this conference
is beautiful.

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:07.406
It's an inaugural conference,
we're coming together

00:03:07.406 --> 00:03:10.966
for the first time and I
wasn't meant to come up here

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:12.466
and do the death and doom story.

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:15.116
I meant to come up here
and be a storyteller.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.756
I'm meant to come up here
and make sure that we're all

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.106
in the same page when it
comes to the complexity

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:22.086
and the significance
of food justice.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:26.666
So when thinking about that,

00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:28.786
what is food insecurity
looks like worldwide?

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:32.246
How many people in the
world are food insecure?

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.936
805 million people are
food insecure in the world.

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:40.006
And that's about one
in nine people, right?

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:42.656
And then you bring that
back to the United States,

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:46.636
one in six people in the United
States are food insecure.

00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:49.026
And the most food
insecure household

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:51.246
in the United States,
are black women.

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:54.496
Black single mothers
specifically,

00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:56.106
which tells you a
little something

00:03:56.106 --> 00:03:59.366
about the factors contributing
to food insecurity other

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.596
than just lack of
access to food.

00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:05.076
And finally, one of the
most important things

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:06.506
about being food insecure is

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:08.696
that diet-related disease
tends to take you out.

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:17.666
So 13.2% of African-Americans
have diabetes.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:20.166
And African-Americans are
nearly two times is likely

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:23.906
to have diabetes than
average white American.

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:27.446
And I'm going to get in to
storytelling in a little bit

00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:28.996
when it comes to
my personal story

00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:34.846
but these statistics translate
into people's cousins,

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.016
their parents, their aunts,
their uncles, it's a real thing.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:42.696
Diet-related disease in my
family has been a real thing.

00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:47.586
So, what does this look
when it comes to families?

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.906
The beginning of my personal
story starts with my father.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.526
My father grew up on
welfare in Los Angeles

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:59.096
in the late 1950s
or early 1960s.

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:02.826
And one the things that I
always notice about my dad

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:03.646
when I was growing up,

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:06.326
is the fact that he always
had food going, right?

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.066
Wake up on Saturday
morning, he's cooking.

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:11.316
Come home after school,
there's food.

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:14.686
Food, food, food, food, food,
food was a thing for him.

00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:17.926
And it was only when I
got older that I realized

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:20.076
that the other people
that I knew

00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:23.596
that treated food the way my
dad did were a lot of my friends

00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:24.696
who were from Central America.

00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:28.226
My Guatemalan friends,
my Mexican friends,

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:32.116
my El Salvadorian friends,
some of my Vietnamese friends,

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:35.686
some of my Afghani friends,
and I was trying to figure

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:38.576
out what was this thread,
what was this thing

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:39.776
that I felt was in common?

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.136
And I started talking
to them about it.

00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:45.786
And one thing that came up
was that all of these friends

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:47.586
that I mentioned, their
parents were immigrants,

00:05:48.976 --> 00:05:53.486
and all of their parents fled
situations in their countries,

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.996
and all of their parents
had to do with being hungry.

00:05:57.456 --> 00:06:00.986
So feeding people for them was
not just you need to have food.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:08.346
Feeding people for them was this
is a basic, basic valuable thing

00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:09.946
and I am nourishing you,

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:14.046
nourishing your body,
nourishing your soul.

00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:17.146
Ethnic people have a very
deep relationship with food,

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:19.146
which is something
I'm going to get into.

00:06:20.056 --> 00:06:24.276
But I want you to think about
what the implications are

00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:26.386
when you can't be nourished,

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:29.696
when you have trouble
nourishing yourself,

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:32.126
when you have trouble
nourishing your children,

00:06:32.556 --> 00:06:35.416
when you have trouble nourishing
your spouse and your parents,

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:37.016
if you're an adult breadwinner.

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:40.806
I used the word nourish because
food insecurity doesn't quite

00:06:40.846 --> 00:06:41.346
do it.

00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:44.826
The word nourishment
actually gets

00:06:44.826 --> 00:06:48.826
to the multi-dimensional
way that food feeds us.

00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:51.656
And it feeds much more
than just our bodies.

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:58.036
So to demonstrate this, I wanted
to share a bit of my food story.

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:01.496
What was the first
food that I ate?

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:06.116
It was the in utero
nutrients that I was sucking

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.766
through the umbilical
cord from my mom.

00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:14.026
And to be clear about how
hardcore my mother is,

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:19.736
before she got pregnant she put
my father on a diet in addition

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:24.966
to herself because she wanted
the moment of conception to be

00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:29.276
as healthy and as pure and
as rich as humanly possible.

00:07:30.426 --> 00:07:34.576
She said "Oh no, our baby need
to start right" to be clear,

00:07:34.736 --> 00:07:36.506
this is what she eating
because we're going

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:38.286
to start getting
pregnant in about a week.

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:43.396
And then as she was pregnant
she ate really healthy food.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.746
She functionally ate a
microbiotic diet, right.

00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:46.816
That's what I grew up eating.

00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.886
There was a grain, there was a
vegetable, there was a protein,

00:07:50.146 --> 00:07:53.506
in different parts of the
plate and not really mixing.

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.346
And then occasionally, we
would have enchiladas, right?

00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:59.886
But my mom was really simple
in the way that she cooked.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:01.846
And she was very, very healthy.

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:06.376
So, when I was breastfeeding,
I was getting only the best.

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:09.296
When I started eating solid
food, she was the type

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:11.226
that would blend her own
baby food in the blender.

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:13.646
Only the best, right?

00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:16.726
And when we grow up, there
was this message about sugar.

00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:20.696
You are never to eat it,
it is terrible for you.

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:25.186
But if you're really good,
you can have a treat.

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:27.546
And to us, a treat
was the raisin bran

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:29.746
with the sugar crystals on the
raisins, you know what I mean?

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:33.136
That was a treat to us instead
of the regular raisin bran

00:08:33.136 --> 00:08:34.446
that kind of tasted
like cardboard.

00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:39.896
But we got the message pretty
early, that there are good foods

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.166
and there are bad foods.

00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.706
Now, when I got a little
older, I tried to figure

00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:46.366
out where did that come from?

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.156
You know, I set my mom down and
I said what was this obsession

00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:52.696
that you had with sugar
and with eating healthy

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.466
and with making sure
that we eat healthy?

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:57.526
Some thing must have
influenced you, yeah?

00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:01.006
And she said, "Yeah.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:02.106
Yeah, it did."

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:06.866
The thing that influenced her
was watching her family members

00:09:06.866 --> 00:09:07.356
fall apart.

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:11.846
It was watching her aunt
and uncles become amputees,

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.756
have diabetes, have
diet-related disease,

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:18.656
have congestive heart
failure, all of these things.

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:23.906
And I didn't really-- I
didn't put it together

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:27.836
because I thought
what do you mean?

00:09:27.836 --> 00:09:30.626
I was asking this when I
was I think a young teenager

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.466
so I didn't really
understand the concept

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:33.496
of diet-related disease.

00:09:33.876 --> 00:09:36.246
I knew what diabetes was and I
knew that it had something to do

00:09:36.246 --> 00:09:38.706
with sugar, but I didn't quiet
understand the correlation

00:09:38.706 --> 00:09:39.556
when it came to food.

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:42.706
And she said, "Well, you know
Pappy," who was my grandfather.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.586
"You know how his legs are
wrapped and he can't walk?"

00:09:46.556 --> 00:09:47.186
And I said, "Yeah."

00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:49.446
And she said that's
because of diabetes.

00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:55.006
And I said, "Oh, he-- really?"

00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:55.966
And she said, "Yeah.

00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:56.936
And you know Aunt Mildred?"

00:09:57.126 --> 00:09:58.876
my great aunt, her aunt.

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:01.326
"You know how she had a
leg amputated last year?"

00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:03.196
And I said, "Yeah."

00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:05.276
And she said, "Well,
that's because of diabetes."

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:08.256
And she started going
down the list.

00:10:08.936 --> 00:10:09.726
"You know uncle Bate?

00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:12.376
You know how Aunty
Deb has diabetes?

00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:14.626
You know all of these, right,
one right after the other.

00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:18.066
And I'm even getting
emotional talking about it

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:22.056
like it was my entire
family, my entire family.

00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.136
Our immediate family was
some of the only people

00:10:25.136 --> 00:10:27.146
that hadn't been
touched by this.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:30.336
And so for her, food was a
way of saving her children.

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:35.266
It was a way of making sure
that when we had grandchildren,

00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:36.966
when our children
were teenagers,

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:39.296
they wouldn't lose us.

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.436
So for her, it was justice.

00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:43.586
It was very serious.

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:47.656
And then I started thinking
about my grandmother,

00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:50.896
and the way that mother
must have grown up.

00:10:51.846 --> 00:10:53.516
When I would go over
my grandmother's house

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:54.446
when I was little,

00:10:55.276 --> 00:11:00.596
Nana overcooked most
vegetables, right?

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.236
We ate canned beets.

00:11:03.336 --> 00:11:05.126
We ate Kraft mac and cheese.

00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:09.596
One of our snacks, were
those cheese slices, plastic.

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:13.566
And I thought about how
my mom must have grown

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:19.236
up eating those 1960s housewife
recipes that were jello was used

00:11:19.236 --> 00:11:22.496
in everything including
meat, kind of disgustingly,

00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:26.376
and the way that she must
have put those dots together.

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:29.956
And then I started thinking
about the stories I was going

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:32.666
to tell my children, about
the way that I grew up

00:11:32.666 --> 00:11:33.636
and the food that I ate.

00:11:33.636 --> 00:11:38.366
And it gave me a whole other
level of respect for my family,

00:11:39.526 --> 00:11:47.466
because-- to add complexity
to my food story and the way

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:51.776
that I grew up, yes, she fed
us macrobiotic food and yes,

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:53.306
we ate really, really healthy.

00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:59.276
And I didn't know what kale was
until I was 23 years old, right?

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:02.186
I joined an intentional
community

00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:04.126
because I'm one of those.

00:12:04.126 --> 00:12:05.756
I'm hippy hardcore.

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:10.206
We had our own chickens.

00:12:10.436 --> 00:12:11.886
We had our garden in the back.

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:13.126
We had our food cooperative.

00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:15.246
It's in Los Angeles, the
Los Angeles Eco-Village.

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:16.996
It's 50% people of color.

00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:21.116
It's basically like the most
badass intentional community

00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:22.096
in the country.

00:12:22.526 --> 00:12:25.266
But we would-- started
getting CSA boxes.

00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:28.016
And I had to learn what
these other vegetables were,

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:31.056
and had to knock on people's
doors every other day.

00:12:31.416 --> 00:12:32.586
What is this?

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:34.736
How do you cook it?

00:12:34.736 --> 00:12:36.616
And I realized how
much I didn't know.

00:12:36.616 --> 00:12:41.056
As healthy as I thought I was, I
realized how much I didn't know.

00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:42.946
I didn't know beyond
a chain store.

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:48.406
I didn't know beyond a Ralph's
or Von's or anything like that.

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:50.416
And then I was the black chick

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:52.986
in the intentional community
talking about how, you know,

00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:58.196
I eat real good but I don't
know how many varieties

00:12:58.196 --> 00:12:58.936
of apples there are.

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:00.906
I know delicious red.

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:03.936
I know that when we had
something to celebrate,

00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:06.566
we went to Sizzler; and
when we really had something

00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:08.556
to celebrate because stuff
that was really good,

00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:09.636
we got to go to Red Lobster.

00:13:09.636 --> 00:13:11.716
That was what I knew.

00:13:12.836 --> 00:13:15.566
And so I had to reconcile the
fact that there were many, many,

00:13:15.566 --> 00:13:19.196
many people like me, who
were on the edge of healthy,

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:21.756
who ate healthy within
the mainstream context,

00:13:22.266 --> 00:13:24.256
but there was a whole
other layer of healthy

00:13:24.556 --> 00:13:26.966
that I knew nothing about,
that I came to as an adult.

00:13:27.126 --> 00:13:28.996
And it was a very
humbling experience for me,

00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:32.196
because when I thought
about why, I had to go back

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:34.636
to the context in
which I grew up.

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:36.766
What I said in the beginning

00:13:36.856 --> 00:13:40.866
about how nonfood factors
usually influence food

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:44.136
and security, I was an
African-American woman

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:46.096
who was a child in
the lat 1980s,

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:54.876
early 1990s in Los Angeles,
California context, right?

00:13:55.536 --> 00:13:58.876
Our first home was on
Wilton Place in 48th.

00:13:58.876 --> 00:14:00.516
And if you know anything
about LA,

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:04.416
you know that that is smacked
out in the middle of the hood.

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:06.086
And I remember playing
that game,

00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:08.886
the get down on the ground
game, when you get pops,

00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:12.556
and I didn't know that it
wasn't a game when I was little.

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:15.306
I just knew that my parents
tried to make something

00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:18.896
like a drive-by shooting,
not be terrifying for me.

00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:21.686
I remember the LA riots.

00:14:21.856 --> 00:14:24.946
I remember crashes and things
burning, and not outside

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:27.446
of our door but I
remember my friend coming

00:14:27.446 --> 00:14:29.996
over with lots of stuff, right?

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:31.316
Where'd you get all that stuff?

00:14:31.316 --> 00:14:33.426
We got it from stores and
if there was something going

00:14:33.426 --> 00:14:34.566
on that I didn't know about,

00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:37.496
something outside,
something on the TV.

00:14:37.496 --> 00:14:40.216
There was a reason why my mom
was crying, I didn't know why.

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:46.296
If any of you-- the
context in the early '90s

00:14:46.296 --> 00:14:47.406
that most people
have for that is

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:50.286
that is Menace II
Society, Boyz on the Hood.

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:53.946
Statistically, the gang
wars in Los Angeles during

00:14:53.946 --> 00:14:57.006
that period are one of the most
vicious civil wars America has

00:14:57.006 --> 00:15:02.176
had, 15,000 young men and
women were killed within a four

00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:06.206
to five year period
in that time, 15,000.

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.286
And I have brothers.

00:15:09.426 --> 00:15:11.356
I have older foster brothers.

00:15:11.356 --> 00:15:13.886
I have younger blood brothers.

00:15:14.786 --> 00:15:18.866
So for my parents raising
black children in Los Angeles

00:15:18.906 --> 00:15:22.826
in the late '80s, early
'90s was no fucking joke.

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:29.646
For us to be healthy, for us to
be safe, they had to do a lot.

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:32.396
They had to shield
us from a lot.

00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:36.326
They had to figure out what
they were going to do for work.

00:15:36.396 --> 00:15:39.316
What we were going to do for
play that was going to make sure

00:15:39.316 --> 00:15:41.956
that we didn't grow up thinking

00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:44.126
that the only thing our people
could is kill each other.

00:15:44.186 --> 00:15:50.346
And food was one of the
ways that they kept us safe.

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:51.936
So it's so much more
important to me

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.666
than just my mom
wanted to eat healthy.

00:15:54.306 --> 00:16:00.686
And when we think about
that on a larger scale,

00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:04.656
there was a study done
called "Unnatural Causes:

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:06.766
Is Inequality Making Us Sick?"

00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:10.536
And this was a study that
was turned into a movie.

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.676
You can look at out there
clips of it on YouTube

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.776
about the social
determinance of health.

00:16:15.466 --> 00:16:17.256
Food is just one of them.

00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:22.296
But one of the things, there
were startling statistics

00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:23.576
that they did these
vignettes on.

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:24.886
And one of the one that stood

00:16:24.886 --> 00:16:27.756
out to me always was the
infant mortality section.

00:16:29.036 --> 00:16:32.066
Because statistically,
a white woman in America

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:34.856
with a high school diploma has
a lower infant mortality rate

00:16:34.856 --> 00:16:38.816
than an African-American
woman with a PhD today.

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:41.526
That was startling to me.

00:16:42.216 --> 00:16:46.216
And the reason why is
very uncomfortable,

00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:50.946
because when you look at it
historically, African-Americans

00:16:50.946 --> 00:16:55.966
in America, middle class and
upper class African-Americans,

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:57.796
very, very, very
small percentage

00:16:57.796 --> 00:17:00.106
of African-American
had grandparents

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:02.556
that were brain surgeons,
and things like that.

00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:07.236
Usually, you become middle class
through hard work yourself,

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:09.376
and that you get a good job

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.906
and you become middle
class when you're an adult.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:16.246
But during your formative
years from 0 to 5 and 5 to 10,

00:17:16.816 --> 00:17:18.466
you're still breathing
the same air

00:17:18.466 --> 00:17:20.506
that working class people are.

00:17:21.606 --> 00:17:25.826
Your system is still getting
triggered, constantly triggered

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.606
by the unknown, by
survival mode, by violence.

00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:33.366
And this is when your
reproductive system is forming.

00:17:33.646 --> 00:17:35.946
And it never goes away.

00:17:37.526 --> 00:17:38.756
It's cumulative.

00:17:39.756 --> 00:17:42.806
The effects of poverty
are cumulative.

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:45.346
And that was one of the
most important things

00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:46.596
that this study emphasized.

00:17:47.196 --> 00:17:52.616
You can't get out because
if you were there at all,

00:17:53.086 --> 00:17:54.026
it stays in your body.

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:59.206
I will have a lower infant
mortality rate because of some

00:17:59.206 --> 00:18:02.476
of the things I went through as
a young child and someone else

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:05.126
who didn't grow up like me,
no matter where I end up.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.706
And that's really humbling.

00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:13.126
So when we talk about justice,
we are actually talking

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:15.816
about everyone, from
beginning to end.

00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:20.706
And there's always food deserts
to go along with these things.

00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:22.676
That's just infant
mortality when it comes

00:18:22.676 --> 00:18:24.506
to the stress hormone
running through our bodies,

00:18:24.936 --> 00:18:26.216
when it comes to air and water.

00:18:27.556 --> 00:18:31.276
But any community dealing
with the social determinance

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.856
of health, where
there is poverty,

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.456
there are also liquor stores.

00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:42.276
And this is a really good
time to share some hope

00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:50.276
because there's a lot of tension
around this kind of thing.

00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:52.756
And one of things that was
really hopeful to me is

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:56.306
that people with color
and those most impacted

00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:58.046
by an issue, are brilliant.

00:18:59.166 --> 00:19:02.726
In terms of mother being the--

00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:06.946
need being the source of
all invention, we will come

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:09.096
up with things and we
will figure it out.

00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:12.446
I was the executive director
of People's Grocery in Oakland,

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:16.106
California for many years,
and one of the main programs

00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:18.146
that we had was the
Growing Justice Institute.

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:19.726
Now, one of the impetuous

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.966
for the Growing Justice
Institute was we wanted young

00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:28.026
people to be able get
jobs, to get good training,

00:19:28.026 --> 00:19:29.896
to go out there and really
do their thing, right?

00:19:30.216 --> 00:19:33.116
But then when we had discussions
at the office, we thought,

00:19:33.156 --> 00:19:37.906
"Well, do we want to just train
them to get low-paying jobs

00:19:37.986 --> 00:19:40.056
because 7 of the 10
lowest paying jobs

00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:41.176
in the country are food jobs?"

00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:43.616
So that's probably
not going to work.

00:19:44.436 --> 00:19:47.556
We don't want to train them
into $2.15 minimum wage

00:19:47.556 --> 00:19:48.416
as a server somewhere.

00:19:49.286 --> 00:19:52.406
So, we thought this needs to
be an entrepreneurship program.

00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:55.766
And let's start with adults
because once we have adults

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:58.366
who were going to the program,
well, we can transition this

00:19:58.446 --> 00:20:00.606
to really being a functional
healthy youth program.

00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:04.346
And when we got this
group of people,

00:20:04.546 --> 00:20:08.076
it was nine African-American
adults from West Oakland.

00:20:08.216 --> 00:20:13.056
And we said, "What solutions do
you have for the problem of food

00:20:13.056 --> 00:20:14.436
in security in West Oakland?"

00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:19.046
The stuff they come up with
was freaking brilliant,

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:23.816
absolutely brilliant, right?

00:20:24.276 --> 00:20:26.526
We had a partnership
with Highland Hospital

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:28.746
which was the public
hospital in Oakland.

00:20:28.746 --> 00:20:32.286
And we were doing a childhood
obesity case study, right?

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:35.036
So there was the
pediatric obesity clinic,

00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:39.446
and all these two and
three-year-olds who had diabetes

00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:42.216
and diet-related
disease and were obese,

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.906
because now two-year-olds
can be obese.

00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:48.196
And so, they partnered
with us to give each

00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:50.796
of these families a community
supported agriculture box

00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:54.446
and cooking lessons and recipes,
and have a support group,

00:20:54.716 --> 00:20:56.726
around incorporating
healthy food into their diet.

00:20:56.726 --> 00:21:00.466
And actually, a quick
vignette about this program

00:21:00.466 --> 00:21:02.576
because this is also
the ingenuity of people.

00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:06.546
This is a primarily Latino group
and so we had a translator.

00:21:06.546 --> 00:21:09.266
And one of the beautiful
things that happened with it,

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:12.646
we tried to do the regular
cooking class recipes,

00:21:12.936 --> 00:21:14.706
what do you eat at
home conversation.

00:21:15.096 --> 00:21:17.426
And then just said, let's just
get these people in a circle

00:21:17.426 --> 00:21:18.626
and have them talk
to each other.

00:21:18.996 --> 00:21:21.146
And the stuff that
happened was incredible.

00:21:22.026 --> 00:21:23.996
There were conversations
about, hey,

00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:25.566
you can put these
things in tamales.

00:21:25.566 --> 00:21:28.056
I tried it last night,
it worked, right?

00:21:28.436 --> 00:21:30.596
And this is how I got
my kids to eat it.

00:21:30.986 --> 00:21:33.766
Hey, I'd chop this up and put
the spice on it and put it

00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:36.346
in a tostada, they didn't
know the difference.

00:21:36.376 --> 00:21:38.956
And they were just--
it was just hilarious

00:21:38.956 --> 00:21:41.146
about all these parents
who are fooling their kids

00:21:41.406 --> 00:21:44.236
in eating these different foods
and it was actually working.

00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:46.146
It was actually working.

00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:51.646
And so, one note that I just
want to throw in there is

00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:54.056
that creativity will find a way.

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:59.256
It will find a way but you have
to give it space to breathe

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:01.616
and leave it alone, so one

00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:03.366
of the Growing Justice
Institute people wanted

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.466
to be a nutrition educator.

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:08.456
And so, we sent her to
this hospital project

00:22:09.006 --> 00:22:11.116
as our representative to
do the nutrition classes.

00:22:11.116 --> 00:22:12.606
And it was one of
her first contracts.

00:22:12.606 --> 00:22:14.506
And now, she runs a very
successful nutrition

00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:15.316
consulting business.

00:22:16.236 --> 00:22:18.656
There was another woman who
did a partnership with a church

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.716
where she put a garden at
the church so that the food

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:23.736
that was being served on
Sundays could be sourced

00:22:23.736 --> 00:22:24.266
from the garden.

00:22:24.266 --> 00:22:28.096
And there are programs like this
that exist all over the country.

00:22:28.256 --> 00:22:30.116
But usually, when I
see programs like that,

00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:33.496
they're run by a nonprofit
and funded by a foundation.

00:22:33.926 --> 00:22:36.226
They're not run by the people
in the community who came

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:38.216
up with the idea who
maybe got a microgrant

00:22:38.216 --> 00:22:40.266
and are doing an
independent of anybody else.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.646
There was a woman who lived in
a housing project who noticed

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:48.036
that there were source--
there were resources for them

00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:50.906
to get healthy food but
people couldn't get there.

00:22:51.186 --> 00:22:53.146
So she organized a
transportation service

00:22:53.146 --> 00:22:56.286
to specifically go to a farmer's
market, go to the wick office,

00:22:56.286 --> 00:22:57.846
and go to different places

00:22:57.846 --> 00:23:00.516
where there were food
resources, a van service.

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:04.426
And every single project
was just as applicable,

00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:07.806
every single project, brilliant.

00:23:07.806 --> 00:23:09.276
We actually didn't
have to do that much.

00:23:09.906 --> 00:23:12.966
And so one thing I want to
emphasize when we're talking

00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:16.916
about creating justice is that
there are real-time examples

00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:19.906
of what it means to
give people the space

00:23:19.976 --> 00:23:22.866
to develop their own ideas
and give them the support

00:23:22.866 --> 00:23:25.586
that it takes to make sure
that they can do it themselves.

00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:28.656
But then, this leads
us to attention.

00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:32.216
Because when we're talking
about the bigger picture

00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:35.516
of food security, there
are a lot of complexities.

00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:40.876
One of the complexities
is the way that we talk

00:23:40.876 --> 00:23:46.046
about healthy food and
what is healthy in America.

00:23:46.976 --> 00:23:49.406
MyPlate, right?

00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:52.976
MyPlate. I still really can't
deal with MyPlate because I grew

00:23:52.976 --> 00:23:55.096
up with a food pyramid
and that's always going

00:23:55.096 --> 00:23:57.996
to be the image that is emblazed
in my head because Nana had

00:23:57.996 --> 00:23:59.706
that on the cabinet
next to the refrigerator

00:24:00.276 --> 00:24:02.186
but MyPlate is the same idea.

00:24:03.486 --> 00:24:06.156
And we used to have
food journals

00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:07.756
at People's Grocery as well.

00:24:07.756 --> 00:24:10.056
And we had many different
types of people

00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:11.276
from many different cultures

00:24:11.806 --> 00:24:13.876
who are recording their
daily intake of food.

00:24:14.256 --> 00:24:16.506
And when we were trying to
encourage them to eat healthy

00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:18.386
and they wanted recommendations,
we would say, well,

00:24:18.386 --> 00:24:20.956
you can eat this, this,
this, this and that.

00:24:20.956 --> 00:24:22.666
And these foods are healthy.

00:24:23.856 --> 00:24:27.906
But something that is very
uncomfortable to talk about is

00:24:27.906 --> 00:24:29.886
that actually people

00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:32.246
with different ethnicities
do have some

00:24:32.316 --> 00:24:33.276
biological differences.

00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:39.096
We have different food
sensitivities depending

00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:41.286
on where we come from, right?

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:44.126
Something that I can
eat might make you sick.

00:24:44.126 --> 00:24:47.136
And with there might be
some similarities in terms

00:24:47.136 --> 00:24:49.226
of your ethnic group and
your cultural background

00:24:49.606 --> 00:24:51.526
with the types of food
sensitivities you have.

00:24:52.246 --> 00:24:55.476
And we discovered this
pretty organically, right?

00:24:56.006 --> 00:24:58.216
There are certain people,
especially people that come

00:24:58.216 --> 00:25:00.386
from cultures that have been
in the same place for thousands

00:25:00.386 --> 00:25:01.866
of years and have an intermix.

00:25:01.936 --> 00:25:04.106
I'm a hodgepodge because
I'm a child of slavery.

00:25:04.146 --> 00:25:07.316
So I can-- you know, I have a
little bit of food sensitivity

00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:08.366
to almost everything,

00:25:08.366 --> 00:25:10.496
but my body can also
process almost everything.

00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.356
Because I got the masses' blood,

00:25:12.356 --> 00:25:13.986
I got the Cherokee
folks that own me.

00:25:13.986 --> 00:25:16.176
I got their blood, yeah,
all of that, that's all me.

00:25:16.736 --> 00:25:18.476
So I feel pretty
lucky in the game.

00:25:18.476 --> 00:25:19.866
But there were a lot
of people who came

00:25:19.866 --> 00:25:21.126
through People's
Grocery's doors.

00:25:21.546 --> 00:25:22.446
Who kept saying, you know,

00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:25.356
I'm trying to eat what my
doctor is telling me to eat,

00:25:25.726 --> 00:25:26.996
and it's making me sick.

00:25:28.186 --> 00:25:30.626
And so, we had to take them
to the process as saying, OK,

00:25:30.626 --> 00:25:31.816
what did your grandmother eat?

00:25:31.816 --> 00:25:33.976
Do you remember?

00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:35.456
Do you remember the recipes?

00:25:35.456 --> 00:25:36.936
Do you remember the
spices that they used?

00:25:37.306 --> 00:25:38.326
Most specifically,

00:25:38.326 --> 00:25:41.516
do you remember the food
combinations that they did?

00:25:41.626 --> 00:25:44.176
Because I will not tell you how
many times I have gone to one

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:45.676
of these damn foodie restaurants

00:25:46.016 --> 00:25:47.636
that are mixing all
these different types

00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:50.756
of foods together and mashing
this up and using this spice.

00:25:50.756 --> 00:25:53.486
And then I have gas
and I'm sick afterward.

00:25:53.766 --> 00:25:56.106
And it's like, yeah, these food
combinations have not existed

00:25:56.106 --> 00:25:56.966
for thousands of years,

00:25:57.196 --> 00:25:59.576
but there are food combinations
that really do work.

00:25:59.576 --> 00:26:01.196
So don't just start
mixing things together,

00:26:01.196 --> 00:26:02.236
thinking that it's
going to work.

00:26:02.606 --> 00:26:04.206
And 9 times out of 10,

00:26:04.636 --> 00:26:07.286
when these people started eating
what their grandmother's ate,

00:26:08.156 --> 00:26:08.736
they got better.

00:26:09.286 --> 00:26:11.696
It didn't always work
and it wasn't that linear

00:26:12.206 --> 00:26:14.626
but there was a theme
there that we saw.

00:26:14.626 --> 00:26:18.546
And so, the implications for
trying to do food planning

00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:22.466
and food systems
development in America is

00:26:22.466 --> 00:26:26.576
that MyPlate is not going to
work for everyone, it's not.

00:26:27.866 --> 00:26:31.136
And when we talk about places
that don't have grocery stores,

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:33.356
the only kind of grocery
stores that are funded

00:26:33.356 --> 00:26:36.326
by the $200 million fresh food
initiative and things like that,

00:26:37.326 --> 00:26:38.746
are mainstream grocery stores.

00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:42.126
They're not ethnic
markets, typically.

00:26:42.676 --> 00:26:46.326
But we have got to start
grouping ethnic markets

00:26:46.326 --> 00:26:48.656
into the bigger picture when
we talk about groceries.

00:26:49.986 --> 00:26:54.536
Korean markets, African markets,
the Mexican markets that are

00:26:54.536 --> 00:26:55.776
in Southern California.

00:26:55.776 --> 00:26:58.646
The Guatemalan markets,
they're in Southern California.

00:26:58.946 --> 00:27:00.236
All these different
types of markets

00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:02.886
that will sell foods
the different types

00:27:02.886 --> 00:27:05.696
of people can eat is a
very, very important factor.

00:27:05.766 --> 00:27:08.426
And we need to figure out,
how to have that conversation,

00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:12.926
which leads to a much deeper
issue and a much deeper tension

00:27:13.386 --> 00:27:16.606
when we're talking about
food security which is--

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:21.686
you know what, I can
see that the energy

00:27:21.686 --> 00:27:22.776
in the room has dampened.

00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:24.166
It's hard to sit and
listen to someone

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:25.426
for a long period
of time, I know.

00:27:25.736 --> 00:27:28.306
Everybody stand up.

00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:30.976
We're going to do an energizer

00:27:30.976 --> 00:27:34.176
because our bodies
need [inaudible].

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.676
Everybody lift your hands up.

00:27:36.986 --> 00:27:37.406
Wiggle your fingers.

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:41.046
Stretch it out a
little bit in this way.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.166
Keep wiggling.

00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:43.026
Keep wiggling.

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:45.756
Bend over this way,
keep wiggling.

00:27:45.756 --> 00:27:49.416
Roll your shoulders
back a little bit.

00:27:49.416 --> 00:27:50.186
Wiggle your shoulder.

00:27:50.186 --> 00:27:51.016
Now bend over.

00:27:51.596 --> 00:28:10.216
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:11.756
Shake it out.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.106
Shake it out.

00:28:13.106 --> 00:28:16.566
All right, sit back down.

00:28:16.566 --> 00:28:17.056
Good job.

00:28:23.736 --> 00:28:28.246
So, now that we're back.

00:28:28.726 --> 00:28:33.046
Another tension and we're going

00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:35.766
to get a little bit
political right now.

00:28:36.266 --> 00:28:39.096
So come with me, it's OK.

00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:44.386
But this whole thing about
patenting seeds, right?

00:28:44.386 --> 00:28:52.906
When you're dealing with ethnic
cultures who have had thousands

00:28:52.906 --> 00:28:56.826
of years of food
traditions, doing something

00:28:56.826 --> 00:29:02.346
like commodifying the DNA
and the genetic profile

00:29:02.346 --> 00:29:05.236
of their seeds is
culture-destroying.

00:29:06.816 --> 00:29:09.666
And unfortunately, a lot
of economic development

00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:12.606
and culture destruction
go hand and hand.

00:29:13.236 --> 00:29:14.136
That's just the way

00:29:14.136 --> 00:29:16.776
that globalization
imperialism has worked

00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:18.546
over the last few hundred years.

00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:23.236
But the implication for our
food system has gotten really,

00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:25.706
really intense especially
recently.

00:29:27.336 --> 00:29:32.926
Because one of the most--
going back to climate change,

00:29:33.176 --> 00:29:35.876
one of the first ways
that people in America

00:29:35.876 --> 00:29:38.166
and worldwide are going
to experience the effects

00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:42.286
of climate change is through
food, because minor fluctuations

00:29:42.286 --> 00:29:44.866
in temperature will
dramatically effect crops.

00:29:45.706 --> 00:29:48.846
And that will lead to spikes
in the price of grains

00:29:48.846 --> 00:29:52.606
which is a huge subsistence crop
for the majority of the world.

00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:57.186
And that leads to food rights,
as we've seen on and off

00:29:57.186 --> 00:29:58.306
over the last 10 years.

00:29:58.996 --> 00:30:01.646
But when you go a
step underneath that,

00:30:02.406 --> 00:30:04.316
what you're looking
at is the way

00:30:04.316 --> 00:30:06.886
that when people have their food
traditions taken away from them,

00:30:06.886 --> 00:30:08.526
it's a huge blow
to their culture.

00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:11.766
And when you commodify food,

00:30:11.766 --> 00:30:16.296
you're destroying
a piece of people.

00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:20.026
So, how do you interact
with that?

00:30:21.016 --> 00:30:23.066
Not all commodification
of food is bad.

00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:24.296
There's always been trade.

00:30:24.296 --> 00:30:25.186
There's always been barter.

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:27.086
There's always been the
buying and selling of things.

00:30:27.536 --> 00:30:31.376
What I'm talking about is scale
of which this is happening,

00:30:31.376 --> 00:30:36.246
and the balance, and trying to
make sure that we do it in a way

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:40.276
that preserves cultures
while still ensuring

00:30:40.276 --> 00:30:42.156
that there is enough
economic development

00:30:42.156 --> 00:30:44.316
so that everyone has
their basic needs met.

00:30:45.296 --> 00:30:48.246
The unfortunate thing about
this larger conversation is just

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:50.086
that most of the time;
there isn't a conversation

00:30:50.086 --> 00:30:53.366
about balance, because
culture is not preserved

00:30:53.676 --> 00:30:56.256
at the same rate as the
basic need is preserved.

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:00.666
Or culture isn't
preserved at the rate

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.176
that economic development

00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:04.736
to meet everyone's basic
needs is increasing.

00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:07.116
I'll say that.

00:31:07.396 --> 00:31:10.136
But there is even
opportunity in that.

00:31:10.686 --> 00:31:13.316
Because the raw ingredients
for the food movement

00:31:14.316 --> 00:31:18.846
to become a force, to
become a real force;

00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:24.336
the way that other movements
are and happen, I don't know

00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:28.006
that I've seen any better
raw ingredients especially

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:30.056
when you look at
social movement theory.

00:31:30.256 --> 00:31:31.886
What I just said
about climate change

00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:36.076
in food is actually pretty
significant, because the amount

00:31:36.076 --> 00:31:38.456
of money right now that
is being rerouted to deal

00:31:38.456 --> 00:31:42.246
with the climate crisis
is enormous, enormous.

00:31:42.996 --> 00:31:47.426
The president's resiliency task
force last year was 25 mayors

00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:49.936
from all across the country
that were coming together

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:52.906
to support the president with
recommendations about how

00:31:52.906 --> 00:31:56.056
to make cities across the
country more climate resilient

00:31:56.056 --> 00:31:58.566
when there's cases
of extreme weather.

00:31:58.566 --> 00:32:01.206
And these recommendations
are going to translate

00:32:01.206 --> 00:32:04.266
into every single department in
the United States government,

00:32:04.266 --> 00:32:06.106
rerouting a certain
part of their budget

00:32:06.366 --> 00:32:07.686
to climate resiliency.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:11.796
And if food is one of the first
ways that people are going

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.466
to interact with climate change,

00:32:14.846 --> 00:32:17.126
that means that our
movement just got access

00:32:17.186 --> 00:32:18.816
to millions of dollars.

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:26.836
But we're not really talking
about it that way yet.

00:32:26.836 --> 00:32:30.586
Now, when it comes to a
national movement that's founded

00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:33.626
in justice, the food
movement also has

00:32:33.626 --> 00:32:34.756
to leg up another movement.

00:32:36.236 --> 00:32:38.046
When you look at the
environmental movement,

00:32:38.576 --> 00:32:44.196
it was really-- there's
a funny conversation

00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:46.756
that I've been having with
the big green groups in DC

00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:49.396
because the environmental
movement has stopped being

00:32:49.496 --> 00:32:52.836
scary, and so it's
losing a bit of steam.

00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:57.566
But, I mean, they were
kidnapping people in the 1970s.

00:32:57.566 --> 00:32:58.926
When I read about
what was happening

00:32:58.926 --> 00:33:04.736
to get the Clean Air Act
and Clean Water Act passed,

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.786
they were-- they were some--
they were [inaudible].

00:33:06.786 --> 00:33:08.386
You know, they weren't
the immediate we're going

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.836
to go become a party
establishment kind of folks,

00:33:10.836 --> 00:33:12.746
or at least they were
the establishment folks.

00:33:12.746 --> 00:33:14.806
They had their lawyers but
they also had the people

00:33:14.806 --> 00:33:19.826
that were willing to, you
know, burn things, splash paint

00:33:19.826 --> 00:33:23.306
on things and be really
scary; and those parts

00:33:23.306 --> 00:33:26.086
of the environmental movement
have all gradually been sucked

00:33:26.086 --> 00:33:27.196
into the bigger machine,

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:29.646
and then we wonder why we can't
pass the climate bill, right.

00:33:29.976 --> 00:33:32.286
Part of social movement
theory is that you have

00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:35.856
to have the people that are
super scary to make the people

00:33:35.856 --> 00:33:38.956
who were trying to
actually be balanced look

00:33:38.956 --> 00:33:41.146
at a lot more attractive
to the powers they'd be.

00:33:41.856 --> 00:33:43.716
The scary people have to exist.

00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:47.426
And in food, we actually
have a bunch of people

00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:48.326
who were in the middle.

00:33:49.346 --> 00:33:51.076
We have a lot of people
who were in the middle,

00:33:51.226 --> 00:33:52.906
who could pretty
easily come over and be

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:55.946
in the establishment,
and who was, you know,

00:33:56.366 --> 00:34:00.426
one or two more years could be
over here just chaining herself

00:34:00.426 --> 00:34:04.856
to things everyday, right?

00:34:05.486 --> 00:34:08.946
And the opportunity
in that is enormous.

00:34:09.896 --> 00:34:13.616
Because when we sophisticate as
a movement, and we really start

00:34:13.616 --> 00:34:16.796
to talk strategy in a different
way, we're going to be able

00:34:16.796 --> 00:34:20.936
to have the full spectrum of
pressure and the full spectrum

00:34:20.936 --> 00:34:22.376
of what it takes to build power.

00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:26.836
And we are naturally moving
forward in that momentum.

00:34:27.456 --> 00:34:28.746
And more importantly,

00:34:29.006 --> 00:34:33.006
the mainstream food movement
doesn't exist the same way

00:34:33.006 --> 00:34:35.086
that the mainstream
environmental movement does.

00:34:35.516 --> 00:34:39.016
There aren't huge cadres of
people of color trying to break

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:41.256
into the mainstream
food movement,

00:34:42.106 --> 00:34:44.496
because food justice is
actually pretty mainstream

00:34:44.706 --> 00:34:47.776
which is pretty surprising but
not surprising when you think

00:34:47.776 --> 00:34:50.016
about the fact that the First
Lady is an African American

00:34:50.016 --> 00:34:51.726
woman, and the Let's
Move campaign is one

00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:54.446
of the most mainstream
things you have.

00:34:54.446 --> 00:34:55.976
The understanding that children

00:34:55.976 --> 00:34:59.046
of color are the most food
insecure people in this country

00:34:59.046 --> 00:35:01.686
because they come from single
black mamas is a thing.

00:35:01.686 --> 00:35:02.796
It's a thing in DC.

00:35:02.936 --> 00:35:04.626
It's a thing in Hollywood.

00:35:04.806 --> 00:35:06.096
It's a thing on the streets.

00:35:06.456 --> 00:35:09.126
There have been very
few movements

00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:12.786
that have had the potential
to be founded in justice.

00:35:13.546 --> 00:35:17.686
I just want that to
sit for a second.

00:35:18.476 --> 00:35:21.056
When we really start
to feel ourselves,

00:35:21.056 --> 00:35:24.816
and when we really see
ourselves as what we can be,

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:28.266
there hasn't really
been a movement like us,

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.506
and it's important for that
to just be internalized.

00:35:33.916 --> 00:35:35.216
So what can you do?

00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:42.256
So a lot of information and
I've been talking quite a bit.

00:35:42.446 --> 00:35:43.786
How does this get personalized?

00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:50.196
One thing that's really
important to remember is

00:35:50.326 --> 00:35:55.276
to locate yourself in
the fight for justice.

00:35:56.736 --> 00:35:57.566
Who are you?

00:35:58.186 --> 00:36:00.996
Who are your people
and what is your fight?

00:36:02.646 --> 00:36:06.056
And allow yourself to be
surprised by the answer.

00:36:07.386 --> 00:36:10.716
One secret that I have
kind of carried for a lot

00:36:10.716 --> 00:36:15.566
of my life is the fact that
when I think about food,

00:36:16.416 --> 00:36:18.996
what gets me emotional
in terms of the people

00:36:18.996 --> 00:36:20.866
that don't have anyone
to speak for them,

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:25.516
are white Midwesterners who
have nothing but strip malls

00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:33.156
and are morbidly obese, who
are on the political scale,

00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:36.126
much close to Sarah
Palin than Obama.

00:36:36.696 --> 00:36:40.086
It surprises the hell out of me.

00:36:40.216 --> 00:36:41.446
I'll tell you that much.

00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:43.986
I didn't grow up with
these people, right?

00:36:44.276 --> 00:36:45.356
Working class white people

00:36:45.356 --> 00:36:47.066
in Los Angeles actually
don't exist.

00:36:47.066 --> 00:36:48.316
They get pushed out
to the suburbs.

00:36:48.946 --> 00:36:50.686
But now, my husband
is a white man

00:36:50.686 --> 00:36:52.486
and I have an uncle in Texas.

00:36:53.566 --> 00:36:59.246
And there has been this, there
has been this realization

00:36:59.246 --> 00:37:01.996
and this understanding
in me that the part of me

00:37:02.576 --> 00:37:05.206
that felt compassion and
that felt drawn to fight

00:37:05.206 --> 00:37:07.656
for that community was the
part of me that recognizes

00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:12.466
that people that are supposed
to fight for everyone, liberals,

00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:20.156
progressives, democrats,
make fun of them.

00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:24.066
We can be really
mean, progressives.

00:37:24.836 --> 00:37:27.606
We can alienate.

00:37:27.686 --> 00:37:28.526
We can ridicule.

00:37:28.526 --> 00:37:29.236
We can mock.

00:37:31.276 --> 00:37:34.826
And yeah, a lot of those
people are fighting for things

00:37:34.826 --> 00:37:35.786
that we don't believe in,

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:40.426
but most working
class white Americans

00:37:40.426 --> 00:37:45.646
in this country are just
being manipulated by news,

00:37:46.336 --> 00:37:49.466
by the actual 1% that
doesn't want things to change.

00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:51.926
There are actually
plenty of people in the 1%

00:37:51.926 --> 00:37:53.096
who do want things to change.

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:56.856
But there's a whole machine
that pits us against each other,

00:37:56.946 --> 00:37:58.926
that has for a very long time.

00:37:59.796 --> 00:38:01.436
And some part of me
saw through that.

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:06.756
So when I say locate yourself in
the fight for justice, I mean,

00:38:06.756 --> 00:38:09.886
who are your people for real?

00:38:14.116 --> 00:38:16.456
I also want to note
that we need to be clear

00:38:16.936 --> 00:38:18.246
when it comes to ideology.

00:38:18.766 --> 00:38:20.766
That's also something
that we can do.

00:38:21.686 --> 00:38:23.136
One of the most horrifying
things

00:38:23.136 --> 00:38:24.846
that I encountered this
year was coal piling.

00:38:25.246 --> 00:38:27.386
Do people know what
coal piling is?

00:38:28.236 --> 00:38:30.606
Getting a lot-- OK,
so coal piling is

00:38:30.606 --> 00:38:34.316
when you have a big ass
truck, gas dazzling truck,

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:38.066
and you put a smoke stack
type thing on the back of it

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:41.676
to deliberately blow black smoke
when you're driving in front

00:38:41.676 --> 00:38:48.746
of a Prius just to say FU in
your environmentalism, right?

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:50.746
So this is a thing.

00:38:50.746 --> 00:38:52.046
This exists.

00:38:52.846 --> 00:38:56.236
And it was heartbreaking
when I first saw it.

00:38:57.036 --> 00:38:59.736
But then when I'm talking
about getting underneath that,

00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:02.646
what could possibly
drive someone

00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:05.616
to do something like
that, right?

00:39:05.616 --> 00:39:08.606
What could possibly--
I don't know.

00:39:08.606 --> 00:39:11.486
I'm going to choose to
believe that there's no one

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:13.446
who doesn't want to
breathe clean air.

00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:17.046
No one wants to stand behind;
even the person driving

00:39:17.046 --> 00:39:20.186
that truck doesn't want to stand
behind their truck breathing

00:39:20.186 --> 00:39:22.876
in the black smoke as
it's flying in their face.

00:39:23.356 --> 00:39:25.246
They don't want that.

00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:28.646
What they're raging against is
this mockery and this ridicule

00:39:29.196 --> 00:39:30.356
that I just described.

00:39:31.796 --> 00:39:34.206
It's those of us on
the coast looking

00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:37.596
at good old American values and
saying you're not good enough.

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.036
You are old school.

00:39:40.186 --> 00:39:41.556
You just need to change.

00:39:41.726 --> 00:39:43.116
You just need to
be more like us.

00:39:43.996 --> 00:39:47.246
But when I really get down to it
and I talk to my uncle in Texas,

00:39:47.246 --> 00:39:51.556
I actually kind of got the
way that he saw us, right?

00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.096
I can't chop wood.

00:39:53.156 --> 00:39:55.776
Like if I was stuck somewhere,
out in the middle of the woods,

00:39:55.886 --> 00:39:57.386
I would be freaked out.

00:39:57.546 --> 00:39:58.756
I'd be trying to call people

00:39:58.756 --> 00:40:00.676
from my cellphone
with no reception.

00:40:00.966 --> 00:40:02.516
I wouldn't know what
tree this is.

00:40:02.726 --> 00:40:04.416
I wouldn't know what
moss that is.

00:40:04.556 --> 00:40:06.046
I wouldn't know how
to find water.

00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:08.016
I'm basically an
animal in a habitat

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:09.906
that has no skills whatsoever.

00:40:09.906 --> 00:40:15.156
And for people that grew up with
good old traditional American

00:40:15.156 --> 00:40:18.236
values, that looks
pretty stupid,

00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:21.086
and I can actually
understand that.

00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:24.356
And so finding the
common ground and finding

00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:27.806
where our ideologies are
different, was really important

00:40:27.846 --> 00:40:29.246
to me because then
it helped me find

00:40:29.246 --> 00:40:30.776
out where our ideologies
were the same,

00:40:30.776 --> 00:40:34.076
where there were some things
we actually agreed on,

00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:36.056
because there were no
amount of statistics.

00:40:36.376 --> 00:40:39.776
And this is something that's
really, really, really important

00:40:40.016 --> 00:40:41.766
for movement-based
people to understand.

00:40:42.236 --> 00:40:44.446
Depending on who you're
talking to, there area no amount

00:40:44.506 --> 00:40:45.946
of statistics that are going

00:40:45.946 --> 00:40:49.226
to convince someone
of anything, right?

00:40:49.456 --> 00:40:52.236
Cold hard facts don't do
nothing when you're dealing

00:40:52.236 --> 00:40:53.606
with an ideological difference.

00:40:54.776 --> 00:40:56.116
So start there.

00:40:56.116 --> 00:40:59.136
Figure out if there's just basic
values that you disagree on.

00:40:59.206 --> 00:41:02.216
And then figure out what
that person is protecting

00:41:02.566 --> 00:41:03.576
by keeping those values.

00:41:04.186 --> 00:41:05.236
What is it that they love?

00:41:05.636 --> 00:41:08.326
What is it that's important
to them about their identity,

00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:10.986
that their ideology
helps them to protect?

00:41:11.156 --> 00:41:14.186
And then help them to
protect their identity.

00:41:15.746 --> 00:41:19.516
Help them to understand
that this cold hard facts

00:41:19.516 --> 00:41:22.166
that I'm giving you is
not me saying that the way

00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:25.086
that your parents raised
you, this thing that has been

00:41:25.086 --> 00:41:26.756
in your families
for generations,

00:41:27.056 --> 00:41:30.276
this thing that inspires
the same love in you,

00:41:30.466 --> 00:41:32.816
the justice inspires
in me is not wrong.

00:41:33.846 --> 00:41:35.076
You are not wrong.

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:39.716
As a human being, it's so
important for us to reach out

00:41:39.716 --> 00:41:40.866
and share this with each other.

00:41:41.496 --> 00:41:45.676
Nothing about who you are is
wrong, but there are things

00:41:45.676 --> 00:41:48.126
that you might believe in
that could be killing me.

00:41:48.476 --> 00:41:53.236
So where do we meet
in the middle on this?

00:41:54.786 --> 00:42:01.256
Learn the other side is
the next thing you can do.

00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:04.056
When I am in Santa
Barbara speaking

00:42:04.056 --> 00:42:06.406
at a higher education
food conference

00:42:06.466 --> 00:42:11.156
that has the word justice
in it, I dress like this.

00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:12.346
I wear my hair like this.

00:42:13.406 --> 00:42:16.746
I may drop and F-bomb
in my talk.

00:42:18.086 --> 00:42:20.286
When I'm in DC, I
don't dress like this.

00:42:20.446 --> 00:42:24.306
I don't wear my hair like this,
and I don't drop the F-bombs

00:42:24.336 --> 00:42:25.046
when I'm in the White House.

00:42:26.346 --> 00:42:32.086
And what that does is that helps
me to understand the other side.

00:42:32.756 --> 00:42:38.006
So Monsanto for real, like
for real, what are you doing?

00:42:38.006 --> 00:42:38.836
What are you doing?

00:42:39.896 --> 00:42:42.006
Why? Why are you doing this?

00:42:42.356 --> 00:42:46.136
What is it that you think
you're helping with this?

00:42:46.136 --> 00:42:48.026
And, you know, there are
actually some really answers

00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:48.896
to these questions.

00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:53.836
There is no fantasy in
which we can get rid

00:42:53.836 --> 00:42:56.306
of all modern conveniences
and go backwards 50 years.

00:42:56.426 --> 00:42:57.666
It isn't going to work.

00:42:58.026 --> 00:43:00.026
There are hell of
people on this planet.

00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:03.196
There will be at some point 12
billion people on this planet.

00:43:03.486 --> 00:43:04.546
How are we going
to feed everybody?

00:43:04.546 --> 00:43:05.606
How are we going
to house everybody?

00:43:06.106 --> 00:43:07.826
The climate has changed.

00:43:07.826 --> 00:43:08.746
It is changing.

00:43:08.746 --> 00:43:09.876
There is no going
back from that.

00:43:09.876 --> 00:43:12.726
How are going to keep everybody
safe in the middle of storms?

00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:15.696
We are animals in a habitat

00:43:15.696 --> 00:43:19.126
and that we have terraformed
our habitat to the point

00:43:19.126 --> 00:43:20.216
where we might not survive it.

00:43:21.206 --> 00:43:23.026
There are very real
considerations

00:43:23.506 --> 00:43:26.986
and there's very real ways
that we need to use technology.

00:43:29.186 --> 00:43:31.366
So when I say learn
the other side,

00:43:31.616 --> 00:43:34.866
I mean that we actually have to
be incredibly sophisticated now.

00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:37.956
The time for rage
against the machine

00:43:37.956 --> 00:43:40.046
like that civil disobedience
stuff that I'm talking about,

00:43:40.386 --> 00:43:43.636
it can't just be with this
amorphous we know things will

00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:45.266
be better.

00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:51.466
So to our people, make
them better in a way

00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:53.466
that I will agree with.

00:43:54.056 --> 00:43:58.216
Now is the time how much
money are we talking about?

00:43:58.516 --> 00:44:00.736
How many people on the
planet are we talking about?

00:44:01.046 --> 00:44:02.936
How many calories do
these people need?

00:44:03.116 --> 00:44:04.276
How do we get these calories

00:44:04.276 --> 00:44:06.316
in a way we maybe don't
have to patent seeds?

00:44:06.746 --> 00:44:09.596
How much yield are we going to
get from these particular crops?

00:44:09.596 --> 00:44:11.096
How does that fit
into the politics

00:44:11.096 --> 00:44:13.486
of this country considering
the fact that they have a loan

00:44:13.486 --> 00:44:15.296
from the IMF considering
the fact

00:44:15.296 --> 00:44:18.246
that this particular
dictator has guerilla warriors

00:44:18.246 --> 00:44:19.706
in all these different cities?

00:44:19.706 --> 00:44:23.176
I mean the level of
complexity of global trade

00:44:23.276 --> 00:44:26.916
and global food is
it's mind-boggling.

00:44:28.446 --> 00:44:31.316
And so these companies, the
level that they're playing

00:44:31.446 --> 00:44:33.026
at when it comes to
the number of factors

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:34.906
that they are considering,
is really intense.

00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:38.986
And we have got to be able to
participate in that conversation

00:44:38.986 --> 00:44:42.356
in a way that's very
sophisticated and very real

00:44:42.356 --> 00:44:44.546
and very concrete,
because when we talk

00:44:44.546 --> 00:44:45.816
about solutions we really have

00:44:45.886 --> 00:44:46.786
to know what we're
talking about.

00:44:48.126 --> 00:44:50.356
So know the other
side also known

00:44:50.356 --> 00:44:53.216
as know what you're talking
about and get specific.

00:44:53.216 --> 00:45:00.666
And what I'm going to end
with is that I'm talking less

00:45:00.736 --> 00:45:04.396
about social change and I'm more
talking about transformation

00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:07.526
and what transformation takes.

00:45:08.946 --> 00:45:11.836
Transformation takes [inaudible]

00:45:13.536 --> 00:45:15.146
because locating
yourself helps you

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:18.466
to identify your own
identity, your own ideologies

00:45:18.696 --> 00:45:22.096
that you're not willing to
budge on, which then allows you

00:45:22.096 --> 00:45:24.476
to reach out the
hand of relationship

00:45:24.476 --> 00:45:26.346
to someone else who's
very different than you,

00:45:26.916 --> 00:45:31.616
and understand what drives them
and what drives their identity

00:45:31.616 --> 00:45:33.936
in their ideology,
which then allows you

00:45:33.936 --> 00:45:38.376
to talk concrete numbers,
concrete solutions

00:45:38.406 --> 00:45:41.636
with timelines and
real money attached

00:45:42.246 --> 00:45:44.476
because that's what it
takes to shift policy

00:45:44.476 --> 00:45:46.636
and that's what it takes
to shift global systems.

00:45:47.656 --> 00:45:49.576
That's what transformation
looks like.

00:45:50.186 --> 00:45:53.526
And you got to go
hard, will you,

00:45:54.916 --> 00:45:58.396
exactly who you are and do you.

00:45:59.536 --> 00:46:03.686
Because I fully acknowledge and
I completely validate the side

00:46:03.686 --> 00:46:05.676
of me that has an
eco-spiritualist [inaudible]

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:08.256
that does Native
American ceremony and goes

00:46:08.256 --> 00:46:10.366
to sweat lodges and wakes
up at 2:00 in the morning

00:46:10.366 --> 00:46:13.236
to go do ocean ceremonies on
the full moon, that's totally

00:46:13.236 --> 00:46:15.606
who I am, to be clear.

00:46:16.556 --> 00:46:17.266
That's how I rule.

00:46:19.036 --> 00:46:22.366
Fully validating and immersing
myself in that part of myself,

00:46:22.366 --> 00:46:25.966
allows me to go to DC to a
meeting in the White House

00:46:26.796 --> 00:46:29.956
on food insecurity and
talk in an educated way

00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:32.776
to the Monsanto representative
about the number of people

00:46:32.776 --> 00:46:33.996
that are going to
be on the planet

00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:35.956
and how we can functionally
figure

00:46:35.956 --> 00:46:37.246
out what the solution
to that is.

00:46:37.926 --> 00:46:42.086
I'm extreme because
that's how I rule.

00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:44.846
My question to you
is how do you rule?

00:46:46.536 --> 00:46:47.566
There is no wrong answer.

00:46:48.226 --> 00:46:51.336
We're all links in the chain
to get everything done.

00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:54.126
And when you do you are
linking the chain really well

00:46:54.126 --> 00:46:55.746
and inspires and
encourages other people

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:56.756
to do their link really well.

00:46:56.756 --> 00:46:59.866
So that is my challenge to you.

00:47:00.206 --> 00:47:01.366
And it's whether
you're a student,

00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:02.686
it's whether you're
an administrator,

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:07.676
it's whether you're community
member, a parent, anything,

00:47:08.396 --> 00:47:11.666
take that with you, do you.

00:47:12.816 --> 00:47:13.206
Thank you.

00:47:14.596 --> 00:47:19.066
[ Applause ]

00:47:19.566 --> 00:47:21.006
I'm going to do some
question and answer.

00:47:25.396 --> 00:47:30.166
So, yeah. So Tim has a
microphone and he's going

00:47:30.396 --> 00:47:37.336
to around in case
anybody has any questions,

00:47:37.786 --> 00:47:44.756
thoughts, comments.

00:47:44.856 --> 00:47:47.876
There is one back there.

00:47:48.196 --> 00:47:48.766
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:47:48.936 --> 00:47:49.246
All right.

00:47:49.246 --> 00:47:53.256
&gt;&gt; I love your description of
understanding where, you know,

00:47:53.256 --> 00:47:55.626
your father-in-law
is coming from,

00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:58.126
you know, white Texas culture.

00:47:58.796 --> 00:48:00.236
Could you apply that Monsanto?

00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:07.776
Where are they coming from?

00:48:13.276 --> 00:48:17.156
&gt;&gt; Monsanto, without judging
their intentions, right?

00:48:17.646 --> 00:48:20.816
Monsanto's intention
is to make sure

00:48:20.816 --> 00:48:22.566
that economic development
doesn't slow

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:25.356
down while they are
feeding people

00:48:25.396 --> 00:48:27.996
and it's economic
development for everyone

00:48:28.326 --> 00:48:32.146
for their bottom line of
their CEOs for the countries

00:48:32.146 --> 00:48:34.566
that they're working with
and for the countries--

00:48:35.676 --> 00:48:38.376
for the institutions that are
loaning this country's money

00:48:38.866 --> 00:48:41.366
to become more autonomous
and secure.

00:48:42.236 --> 00:48:45.576
They also have an interest in
protecting the political lines.

00:48:46.436 --> 00:48:47.646
They keep the world going.

00:48:48.306 --> 00:48:50.056
What's going on in the
Middle East right now?

00:48:50.766 --> 00:48:52.456
They're interested
in protecting oil.

00:48:52.976 --> 00:48:55.096
They're interested in
protecting our ability

00:48:55.096 --> 00:48:57.236
that can continue
running on fossil fuels.

00:48:57.316 --> 00:49:03.906
Functionally, Monsanto doesn't
want the world to collapse.

00:49:05.566 --> 00:49:09.136
And at this point, the way the
globalization works is anyone

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:12.586
thing falls down,
there's a huge risk

00:49:12.836 --> 00:49:14.476
or at least that's what
they want us to believe.

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:19.836
And so, when I'm in
conversation with Monsanto

00:49:19.836 --> 00:49:23.446
and I'm really trying to figure
out what our common ideology is

00:49:23.746 --> 00:49:27.556
and where we diverge, we
probably agree on 10% of things

00:49:27.556 --> 00:49:28.786
that are very big picture.

00:49:29.526 --> 00:49:32.186
And our ideological
differences are in this 90%,

00:49:33.336 --> 00:49:36.616
because fundamentally
we don't agree

00:49:36.616 --> 00:49:38.166
on the way the people
should be paid.

00:49:38.866 --> 00:49:41.826
We don't agree on how bottom
lines should just continue

00:49:41.826 --> 00:49:43.206
to go up and up and up.

00:49:43.606 --> 00:49:46.726
We don't agree on preserving
culture in the same way.

00:49:48.206 --> 00:49:56.236
So, I think you didn't
quite ask this question

00:49:56.236 --> 00:49:58.116
but I'm going to
go there anyway.

00:49:58.586 --> 00:50:02.606
When it comes to helping
Monsanto shift, what I talked

00:50:02.606 --> 00:50:04.546
about in terms of building
power on the spectrum

00:50:04.546 --> 00:50:08.056
from civil disobedience to the
folks that can actually argue,

00:50:08.796 --> 00:50:11.036
we need our $1,400-an-hour
lawyers

00:50:11.426 --> 00:50:13.556
that can speak our language
who believe in our values.

00:50:15.206 --> 00:50:18.296
That's really what we need, so
that they can be talking to them

00:50:18.296 --> 00:50:20.636
over here while we are chaining
ourselves to their office.

00:50:22.356 --> 00:50:24.946
And we just haven't had both
at the same time quite yet.

00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:27.016
We've had our chaining
ourselves to their office

00:50:27.126 --> 00:50:31.076
and we've had the $1,400-an-hour
lawyers who kind of believed

00:50:31.076 --> 00:50:33.316
in our values when they were in
law school but then they need

00:50:33.316 --> 00:50:35.806
to feed their kids too, and so
they do what they got to do,

00:50:35.846 --> 00:50:38.406
but we need to figure out how
to bring these halves together

00:50:38.406 --> 00:50:40.616
and have them talk each other
so that we're building power

00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:41.696
in a more sophisticated way.

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:47.866
Did that answer your question?

00:50:48.696 --> 00:50:50.336
OK. Other questions?

00:50:52.296 --> 00:50:52.396
Yeah?

[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:50:55.846 --> 00:50:57.706
If you can wait a second,
Tim's coming with a mic

00:50:57.706 --> 00:50:58.956
and they're recording,
so I just want

00:50:58.956 --> 00:51:04.426
to make sure we get it down.

00:51:05.006 --> 00:51:08.316
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say
that really hit home for me,

00:51:08.416 --> 00:51:11.356
talking about the morbidly
obese Midwesterners.

00:51:11.356 --> 00:51:13.036
There's a lot of people
in my middle school

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:14.676
who are over 300 pounds.

00:51:14.676 --> 00:51:19.056
And it's also an area that's
really split between back

00:51:19.056 --> 00:51:20.976
to the [inaudible] and
sustainable agriculture

00:51:20.976 --> 00:51:22.506
and then very, very
conventional.

00:51:22.926 --> 00:51:28.266
And when you talked about people
about economic development

00:51:28.266 --> 00:51:31.016
and the way that it
also goes hand in hand

00:51:31.016 --> 00:51:34.126
with the destruction of
culture, I'm wondering

00:51:34.126 --> 00:51:38.176
if you think that-- because
a lot of those Midwesterners

00:51:38.176 --> 00:51:41.626
who were very stuck in
conventional agriculture,

00:51:41.946 --> 00:51:46.716
see this potential shift towards
a sustainable food system

00:51:46.716 --> 00:51:48.526
as an attack on their culture.

00:51:48.936 --> 00:51:55.376
And I'm wondering how we meet
halfway on that and, you know,

00:51:55.476 --> 00:52:00.486
preserve cultures
holistically and not-- yeah.

00:52:00.486 --> 00:52:06.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There are two
questions in your question.

00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:12.666
One is in general when progress
makes a particular group

00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:16.176
of people feel like who they
are is being taken from them,

00:52:16.436 --> 00:52:17.276
how do you deal with that?

00:52:18.096 --> 00:52:20.966
And then the other question is
specifically with this example

00:52:20.966 --> 00:52:24.736
with sustainable agriculture
and conventional agriculture,

00:52:25.276 --> 00:52:27.176
how do you reconcile
that difference?

00:52:28.676 --> 00:52:32.676
So, over here in this camp
you have a group of people

00:52:33.006 --> 00:52:36.126
and what needs to happen
to make us all healthy

00:52:36.126 --> 00:52:38.746
and sustainable makes them
feel like their livelihood

00:52:38.746 --> 00:52:40.286
and their identity
is being taken away.

00:52:41.416 --> 00:52:44.136
Most of the time, when I've
encountered that dynamic,

00:52:44.746 --> 00:52:47.026
that group of people
has historically felt

00:52:47.026 --> 00:52:51.886
like their values and who
they are hasn't been valued

00:52:52.686 --> 00:52:53.656
by the larger society.

00:52:54.726 --> 00:52:58.216
Nine times out of 10, they
feel marginalized and have

00:52:58.276 --> 00:52:59.116
for a very long time,

00:52:59.116 --> 00:53:00.786
and it felt like people
haven't listened to them,

00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:03.796
and it felt like their
interest haven't been protected.

00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:07.386
So getting to really
concrete conversations

00:53:07.386 --> 00:53:10.386
about what interest of yours
haven't been protected,

00:53:11.036 --> 00:53:14.596
and the conventional
agriculture people,

00:53:14.796 --> 00:53:16.196
their interest haven't
been protected.

00:53:17.246 --> 00:53:22.936
I mean, the other side of the
American farmland story is

00:53:22.936 --> 00:53:25.106
that you have a bunch of
Africans who got brought

00:53:25.106 --> 00:53:28.106
to this country to work the
land, because Native Americans,

00:53:28.106 --> 00:53:31.896
when they tried to enslave
them were just like FU.

00:53:31.986 --> 00:53:33.446
We know this landscape
way better than you.

00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:36.896
We don't run, or we'll die

00:53:37.446 --> 00:53:38.706
because that's kind
of who we are.

00:53:38.826 --> 00:53:40.506
We will not be enslaved
in our own land.

00:53:40.906 --> 00:53:42.676
So African-Americans
were brought over.

00:53:43.796 --> 00:53:45.886
And white southern farmers--

00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:49.606
the history of a working class
white farmers in this country,

00:53:50.006 --> 00:53:51.416
is also a very sad one.

00:53:53.026 --> 00:53:55.576
Because when George
Washington became president

00:53:55.576 --> 00:53:57.716
of the United States, he was
one of the wealthiest people

00:53:57.716 --> 00:53:59.876
in this country, to be clear.

00:53:59.876 --> 00:54:03.176
There is no such thing
as this every man

00:54:03.256 --> 00:54:05.956
who was running the country,
Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

00:54:05.956 --> 00:54:08.256
all of those people,
hell of money.

00:54:09.256 --> 00:54:10.436
They were the 1%.

00:54:10.436 --> 00:54:12.676
And they structured the
beginnings of this country

00:54:12.676 --> 00:54:14.226
to even alienate
their own people,

00:54:14.226 --> 00:54:19.106
because things haven't
actually changed that much.

00:54:19.706 --> 00:54:24.476
So Midwesterners, who have felt
like everything has been taken

00:54:24.476 --> 00:54:27.556
from them over and over
and over and over again,

00:54:28.236 --> 00:54:32.036
southerners who have felt
like everything has been taken

00:54:32.036 --> 00:54:35.706
from them over and over and over
again back to the civil war,

00:54:35.956 --> 00:54:37.516
in a way, they're right.

00:54:38.406 --> 00:54:40.326
We have a very common struggle

00:54:40.326 --> 00:54:42.966
but people tend not
to see it that way.

00:54:43.306 --> 00:54:45.646
Usually those people don't
expect me to come and say,

00:54:46.066 --> 00:54:51.986
"Actually, I feel you",
because they're pitting us

00:54:51.986 --> 00:54:52.726
against each other.

00:54:53.566 --> 00:54:57.996
So, conventional agriculture--
at least in the conversation

00:54:57.996 --> 00:55:02.586
that I've had-- has been less
about conventional agriculture

00:55:02.726 --> 00:55:04.936
and more about this
is the way of living,

00:55:04.936 --> 00:55:07.596
that once again I've
managed to attach myself to,

00:55:07.876 --> 00:55:10.736
and once again not only are
you trying to take it way,

00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:12.166
you're saying that
I'm hurting people.

00:55:13.066 --> 00:55:15.986
Just like you said when I
had to give up my slaves,

00:55:16.076 --> 00:55:17.656
you said that I was
hurting people

00:55:18.046 --> 00:55:20.046
so I did change my
whole lifestyle.

00:55:20.046 --> 00:55:23.676
And believe me, I'd taken a
lot of soul searching and a lot

00:55:23.676 --> 00:55:25.626
of emotional intelligence
training for me to get

00:55:25.626 --> 00:55:28.556
to the point where I can say
something like that identify

00:55:28.556 --> 00:55:29.346
with someone thinking

00:55:29.346 --> 00:55:32.136
that taking away their slaves
was actually destroying their

00:55:32.136 --> 00:55:32.896
whole lifestyle.

00:55:33.796 --> 00:55:40.216
But we have to get into really
concrete ways of allowing

00:55:40.216 --> 00:55:43.786
that group of people to
experience some safety

00:55:44.246 --> 00:55:46.426
so that they can choose
their own path forward,

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:50.336
and unfortunately there's no
simple or easy way to do that.

00:55:51.186 --> 00:55:52.496
It takes a really long time.

00:55:53.426 --> 00:55:55.256
The last thing I'll
say about this is

00:55:55.256 --> 00:55:58.716
that the environmental
protection agency is trying

00:55:58.716 --> 00:56:01.106
to do that right now with
the clean power plan.

00:56:01.886 --> 00:56:04.056
They're going to
allow every state.

00:56:04.656 --> 00:56:08.336
They set a series of criteria

00:56:08.936 --> 00:56:12.216
for what emissions targets
every state has to meet

00:56:12.216 --> 00:56:14.876
and these emissions target
for carbon are the same.

00:56:15.346 --> 00:56:17.046
But the way every state to gets

00:56:17.046 --> 00:56:20.186
to meet these emissions targets
is different because it depends

00:56:20.186 --> 00:56:21.406
on that state's subsidies.

00:56:21.756 --> 00:56:24.576
It depends on that
state's innovation pipeline

00:56:24.576 --> 00:56:26.836
for new technologies, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:56:27.416 --> 00:56:29.306
And there are many states
that still fighting it

00:56:29.306 --> 00:56:31.436
but it's much harder to fight
when there's nothing they have

00:56:31.466 --> 00:56:34.326
to do except figure out their
own way to get to a certain set

00:56:34.326 --> 00:56:36.246
of criteria that is
very hard to argue with.

00:56:37.596 --> 00:56:39.246
And so there are people
that are coming and kind

00:56:39.246 --> 00:56:41.466
of flocking these different
states and holding them

00:56:41.466 --> 00:56:45.626
and saying, "Yo, we know
all your resources have been

00:56:45.626 --> 00:56:48.486
extracted and you haven't
gotten very much for it.

00:56:49.336 --> 00:56:51.106
That's probably why
you're really angry."

00:56:51.206 --> 00:56:53.456
Let's just sit down
and talk about this.

00:56:53.556 --> 00:56:58.556
So it could take 25 to 50 years
by giving people enough safety

00:56:58.556 --> 00:56:59.496
so that they have the power

00:56:59.496 --> 00:57:01.866
to choose their own
path is the way to go.

00:57:02.456 --> 00:57:05.186
It's just hard to figure
out how to do that.

00:57:05.386 --> 00:57:06.316
Did I answer your question?

00:57:06.536 --> 00:57:10.746
OK. So thank you
all very, very much.

00:57:10.746 --> 00:57:12.326
I'm going to be around
for a little bit.

00:57:12.326 --> 00:57:14.176
And so, I look forward
to meeting some of you.

Thank you.
