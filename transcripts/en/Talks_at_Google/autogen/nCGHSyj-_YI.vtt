[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.555
- We have a confession
and 20 eyewitnesses.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.295
- And knife wounds
all over the place.

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:18.410
- Her drug test is clear, no
history of mental illness.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.720
- We've got everything
except for why.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.450
Did you hear her say anything?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.870
- It's like she's someone else.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.210
- He didn't try to stop her.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.350
- The mind plays tricks.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.540
You see things
that aren't there.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.850
- Tell us anything,
whatever you can.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.670
- I think there's
something wrong with me.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.500
JESSICA BIEL: Hello.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.660
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, so
please welcome to the stage

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.430
Jessica Biel.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.579
JESSICA BIEL: Hello.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.620
ALAN SEALES: Have a seat.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.328
JESSICA BIEL: Hi.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.090
ALAN SEALES: And we just
watched episode one,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.660
everyone who's here.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.920
I want to quickly touch on
the actual murder scene,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459
because I saw the whole
audience squirm and--

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:59.250
JESSICA BIEL: Good.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.270
ALAN SEALES: --bite their nails
and do all sorts of things.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.099
Is that the normal reaction
that you get from us?

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:06.890
JESSICA BIEL: Yeah.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.600
I actually haven't watched the
show with many big audiences

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.427
before.

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:13.260
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.960
JESSICA BIEL: Well
it's rare, I think,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.490
to have a television show that
you get to screen like this.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.330
It's new.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.430
Just went to the Tribeca
Film Fest last year,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.610
but that's a new thing.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340
Usually you're
bringing films there.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.760
You're not usually
bringing shows there.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.490
So I haven't seen this
more than a few times

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.550
with a larger crowd.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.350
But yes, it's always a
bit of a cringe moment

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.050
because it comes out of nowhere,
which is the idea, right,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.930
is the idea that
this person is just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.460
kind of blacking and having
this sort of attack almost.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.860
And yeah, everybody cringes.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.270
And it's over really
fast, which is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.850
kind of another part
of the whole idea

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.640
that when violence
occurs in life,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.220
it doesn't always have this
long, dramatic experience.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.330
It's like boom and it's
done, and no one even

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.510
knows what's happened.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.090
ALAN SEALES: So
what was the impetus

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.662
to screen it at festivals?

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:12.370
Because you said it's
a new thing, right?

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.315
JESSICA BIEL: Well
for the festival

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:14.600
it's a new thing I mean.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.990
To I think only last--

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.410
sorry, the year we were,
which is last year,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.330
so the year before
that, I feel like that's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.870
the first time that the Tribeca
Film Festival started screening

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.260
shows.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.620
So for the film
festivals I believe

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.720
it's kind of a new thing.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.579
So when you're doing
a TV show and then you

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.370
get to go to a film
festival, first of all,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.939
it's kind of surprising
and exciting.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.480
And then you go and you see the
show that you've been making,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.220
but you've never expected
to see it on a huge screen.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.001
You expect it to
just be on TV, small.

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.500
ALAN SEALES: These
are just big TVs.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.050
JESSICA BIEL: I know,
But it's different.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.820
It just seems different somehow.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.290
ALAN SEALES: Does that mean
that you filmed the pilot

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.610
a long time ago and then
you just picked up two

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.060
through eight recently?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.870
JESSICA BIEL: Yeah,
not too long ago.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.732
We filmed it in the fall.

00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:06.680
I think it was the fall.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.860
ALAN SEALES: I guess what
I'm asking is normally you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.492
film a pilot, it gets greenlit.

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:11.950
You have to screen
it and what not,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.850
see if there's interest in it.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.974
It may or may not ever air.

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:16.690
Did you go into it knowing
you would make the full eight

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.190
episodes?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.023
JESSICA BIEL: No, we
did what you just said.

00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:22.320
So we developed the material.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.490
We got a writer on
board, Derek Simonds,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.010
who then wrote
the pilot and what

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.170
the bible for what the
show would look like.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.090
Not necessarily how many
episodes it would be,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.530
because we didn't quite know.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.440
It can change when
you eventually

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.910
sell it to the right place.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.010
And they have a lot of opinions
about, is it eight, is it ten,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.910
is it only like a two hour
thing two nights in a row?

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.250
So we wrote the pilot, and
then we pitched it around.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.780
And USA was interested.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.150
And so basically that's
when they bought--

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.629
sorry, so then they gave us
the money to film the pilot.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.920
ALAN SEALES: Money's important.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.140
JESSICA BIEL: That's
what we needed, right?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.770
Money's important sometimes.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.290
And then we showed
them the pilot.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.260
And then they picked up
the rest of the season.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.839
So it's possible we would
have just shot the pilot

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.982
and no one ever saw it again.

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:26.440
ALAN SEALES: Because
I was reading,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.030
two through eight-- this is an
eight part miniseries for those

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.060
of you who don't figure out what
I'm talking about are ready.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.310
You know what the end will be.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.610
You know you're not going
to a season two, right?

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.140
JESSICA BIEL: No,
not necessarily.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.550
ALAN SEALES: Ooh.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.190
JESSICA BIEL: I mean,
television is so cool.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.885
The idea was sort of it
could be anthology series.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.960
What we want to do with season
one is we will close the case.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.790
So you're not going to
be season two going, ugh,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.010
I still have to wait
to get the answer.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.510
We're going to
close out this case

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.710
and you're going to
understand what happened.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.376
We're going to give
you all the answers.

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:11.360
Season two, if Bill
is interested--

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.130
Bill Pullman I'm talking
about obviously--

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.780
he can take on a new case.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.750
And I don't want to give away
what the ending's going to be,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.560
but there is a possibility
that maybe my character

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.930
could be involved in some way.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.832
But I don't think that's really
giving away much, necessarily.

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:32.290
ALAN SEALES: But we know that
you're involved in this case.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.665
JESSICA BIEL: Yes,
I'm definitely

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.290
involved in this case.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.689
Or you could recast
the whole thing.

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:39.980
ALAN SEALES: "True Detectives."

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.980
JESSICA BIEL: Right, or
"American Horror Story,"

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.512
or put characters
in other positions.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.720
You could do a lot of things.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.970
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, and you
would be interested in that

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.690
from the executive
producer standpoint--

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.420
JESSICA BIEL: Well yeah.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.330
ALAN SEALES: --not from
the acting standpoint.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.580
JESSICA BIEL: Well
from both, bu yeah,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.538
definitely from the
producer standpoint I would

00:05:56.538 --> 00:06:00.190
love my actors to come back.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.790
ALAN SEALES: So is this the
first time you've executive

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.480
produced anything or is
this old hat for you?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.830
JESSICA BIEL: Well I produced a
film with my producing partner

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.380
Michelle Purple and my
small little tiny company

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.490
called Iron Ocean just this past
year called "The Book of Love."

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.510
We produced a small short film.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.150
So this is my first
television producing.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.800
ALAN SEALES: And how is it
different for you starring

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.482
in it and producing it?

00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:30.940
JESSICA BIEL: Well it's just
kind of double duty, you know?

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.800
I have to wear a couple of hats.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.580
But definitely when
I'm working on set,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.280
on the days I'm
working on set, we

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.420
have a really good
team around us.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.240
Like I mentioned before, my
producing partner Michelle

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.569
and Charlie Gogolak, another
one of our producers,

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:48.860
there's a lot of support there.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.450
So they're kind of managing the
day to day producorial stuff.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.279
And I can kind of focus
on the creative stuff.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.320
ALAN SEALES: Producorial.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.020
JESSICA BIEL: Producorial.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.950
ALAN SEALES: I like that.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.200
JESSICA BIEL: It's a hard job.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.160
I'm not great at it.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.700
I'm very good and I like
the creative producing.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.850
I want to talk to writers.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.130
I want to talk to actors.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.470
I want to character develop,
story arc, character arc.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.440
I want to do that
kind of producing.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.911
And my partner has to do
all the horrible stuff.

00:07:17.911 --> 00:07:19.660
ALAN SEALES: Well it
seems like the best--

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.640
JESSICA BIEL: It
works out for me.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.973
ALAN SEALES: --you've got the
best of both worlds, yeah.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.277
I'm going to quote
you for a second.

00:07:27.277 --> 00:07:29.360
You said, "I've never
gotten a new romantic comedy

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.320
like most of the girls.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.520
Maybe because I'm fit people
assume I'm not funny."

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.860
JESSICA BIEL: I said that?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.430
ALAN SEALES: That's what--

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.000
JESSICA BIEL: I don't
think I said that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.710
ALAN SEALES: That's
what the internet said.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.040
I googled it.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.230
JESSICA BIEL: Well the
internet is always right.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.313
ALAN SEALES: I googled it.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.640
JESSICA BIEL: OK
let's go with it.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.580
I'm fit, therefore
I'm not funny?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.570
That's what it says?

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.756
No, don't repeat it.

00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:51.256
Please God--

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:51.756
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:53.319
--I beg you.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.360
Anyway, let's keep going.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.859
I know where you're
going with this.

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:58.690
ALAN SEALES: So this is a very
dramatic role, very serious.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.490
"Chainsaw Massacre,"
"7th Heaven," you

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.260
were in the third "Blade" with
Wesley Snipes, all of these

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.525
are not funny roles.

00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:08.650
JESSICA BIEL: You're right.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.800
ALAN SEALES: They're not even
air quotes, but funny roles.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.860
They're actually not funny.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.454
Do the roles seek you out or
do you seek out the roles?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.370
JESSICA BIEL: No, this
is a very good question

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.578
because when you put it on
paper like that, I'm like,

00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:21.780
what is wrong with me?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.465
Why am I want to scare everybody
and be serious all the time?

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:26.840
Because I'm really not that
serious of a person actually.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.506
So I don't know.

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:33.059
I think it must be a little
bit of both, somehow.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.210
You know what it is?

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.750
I like to be scared, and I
like to watch dramatic thing,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.250
I think.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.260
Maybe that's what it is.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.070
So if there's a cool
piece of material--

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.160
I'm just looking at it
is if it's something

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.050
that I would watch,
and then maybe I would

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.300
want to be in it or something.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.030
Maybe that's it.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.750
ALAN SEALES: So you don't
watch anything funny?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.708
JESSICA BIEL: Well see,
that's not true either.

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:57.620
I mean, I watch
more dramatic stuff.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.327
But of course I love to laugh.

00:09:00.327 --> 00:09:02.410
I'm being really insecure
about this about myself.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.330
I need to change
something about my life.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.110
ALAN SEALES: All right, then I
will co-write a comedy and you

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.610
will--

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.530
JESSICA BIEL: Please.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.254
Thank you.

00:09:11.254 --> 00:09:12.920
ALAN SEALES: You'll
be first on my list.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.860
JESSICA BIEL: I hope so.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.610
ALAN SEALES: So there's
a tie-in obviously

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.139
with the book that is sitting
here with your picture on it.

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:21.180
Yeah, have you seen this?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.690
JESSICA BIEL: I have seen that.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.981
I think that looks pretty cool.

00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:25.320
I never thought I'd be on
the cover of a book before.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.964
Well I mean, it's a
little random, no?

00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:29.630
ALAN SEALES: Well,
if you exec produce--

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.930
JESSICA BIEL: It's really cool.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.060
ALAN SEALES: --something
based on a book, yeah.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.050
JESSICA BIEL: I know, but do you
see people on books very often?

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.950
I don't.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.037
Are you on a book?

00:09:38.037 --> 00:09:38.870
ALAN SEALES: Me, no.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.510
JESSICA BIEL: OK, I
thought you would be like,

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.670
well I'm on a book, so.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.790
ALAN SEALES: Well yeah, I'm
on like six books, books

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.362
about how to interview badly.

00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:47.320
JESSICA BIEL: I think
this is going quite well.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.860
ALAN SEALES: Oh thank you.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.170
JESSICA BIEL: I don't know.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.930
Maybe I'm off.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.930
ALAN SEALES: We're got a
few holes, so we're OK.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.760
The series takes place in
Upstate New York, right?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.100
JESSICA BIEL: Yes.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.980
ALAN SEALES: Did you film
there, or where did you film

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.105
all the different outsides?

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:02.850
JESSICA BIEL: No.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.490
We filmed our pilot in
Charleston, South Carolina,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.020
which was so cool.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.600
What a great place
to spend sometime.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.780
But we did that because we could
sort of fake Upstate New York

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.400
at that time.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.980
I mean listen, the
foliage is very different,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.090
but we managed to
fake it a little bit.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.830
We were dealing with a
time in the year issue.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.670
And obviously you can see I was
in the water a decent amount.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.300
And we were really worried about
being Upstate New York in--

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.550
I think it was October.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.230
It's October we
were filming, so we

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.400
thought that's a little tricky,
little dicey, you never know.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.795
Could be iced over and frozen.

00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:41.170
It's possible.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.580
So we filmed the pilot there.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.310
And then everything else--
we're still filming.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.860
I have to go back
to work tomorrow.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.104
I have the day off today
to hang out with you guys.

00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:50.770
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
this is your day off.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.360
This is my day off.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.642
But I am not crying and sad and
miserable, which is basically

00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:57.850
what I am a lot on this show.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.097
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.097 --> 00:11:00.680
We're not done with
the interview yet.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:00.980
JESSICA BIEL: So good for me.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.210
ALAN SEALES: Don't worry.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.585
JESSICA BIEL: I
know that's true.

00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:04.350
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.060
So the rest of the episodes,
the rest of the seven

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.940
will be shot here.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.450
And we're working here
and a lot of places

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.950
Upstate, kind of Nyack area
and other surrounding areas.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.160
ALAN SEALES: So the
city that the story's

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.085
set in, totally fictional.

00:11:20.085 --> 00:11:21.960
JESSICA BIEL: No, it's
not totally fictional.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.400
I think it could
be like New Paltz.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.374
Is that a fictional place?

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.040
I thought that was
an actual real place.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.980
AUDIENCE: It's a real place.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.938
ALAN SEALES: It's real?

00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:31.438
OK.

00:11:31.438 --> 00:11:33.271
JESSICA BIEL: You look
at me like I'm crazy.

00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:35.130
ALAN SEALES: I just,
I never heard of it.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.213
So I look at it like I've
never heard of the name.

00:11:37.213 --> 00:11:38.860
JESSICA BIEL: It's
supposed to be

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.319
a place like New Paltz,
little Upstate, smallish--

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:46.860
I've never actually spent much
time in that particular place,

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.977
so I don't know how small.

00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:49.560
I don't want to talk
out of turn here,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.160
but kind of like every
place kind of a place,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.290
you know I mean right?

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.204
Like could find this sort
of town across the country.

00:11:58.204 --> 00:12:00.370
ALAN SEALES: It's interesting
because every place is

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.670
kind of a place, but I feel like
there are specific characters,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.270
types of people that we see
in here that exist in all

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.740
of these every places, like
the crazy religious family

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.380
and then your small town
shop owners and what not.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.670
Was it a conscious
decision to kind of set

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.580
the story in a place like
this, to enhance the characters

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.740
or enhance the story or does
one kind of beget the other?

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.630
JESSICA BIEL: That's
a good question.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.770
I mean, since this is a
German writer originally,

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.760
I know it was set in
Germany somewhere.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.610
So I think we were trying to
find a place that would serve

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:52.685
as the right town in the
States for, I don't know,

00:12:52.685 --> 00:12:56.210
kind of like a place that could
have a character of its own

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.860
in a sense.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.210
I feel like Upstate kind
of has that feeling of,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.320
I don't know, there could be
a lot of bubbling, simmering

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.310
things going on
underneath, which

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:10.200
is sort of what we're talking
about in the show a little bit.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.260
Kind of like from the outside
things are looking one way

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.180
and then when you
look a little deeper,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.800
you're seeing something else.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.965
I'm not trying to
like bag on Upstate,

00:13:20.965 --> 00:13:22.840
like there's some weird
stuff going on there,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.007
but that's true everywhere--

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:25.381
ALAN SEALES: Oh
we know there is.

00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:27.540
JESSICA BIEL: --this idea
of presenting ourselves

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.390
in a certain way.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.807
And maybe that's not
necessarily 100% true.

00:13:32.807 --> 00:13:34.390
ALAN SEALES: I totally
agree with you.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.000
I grew up in a small
town in North Carolina.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.825
So same mountain chain, same
culture, just different areas.

00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:41.950
JESSICA BIEL: There you go.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.180
ALAN SEALES: But yeah, I
totally agree with that.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.440
So as executive
producer, did you

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.220
help with any of the
casting of the show?

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.970
Did you have any--

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.610
JESSICA BIEL: Yes, all of it.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.360
We have been-- it's actually
been an amazing experience.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.880
And because I am usually
on the other side of it--

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.730
I'm the one putting
myself on tape

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.870
or going in for the
audition and having

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.110
to send these tapes that
you make at home that you're

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.110
so embarrassed about,
like oh, this is horrible.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.504
The lighting's bad.

00:14:09.504 --> 00:14:11.170
You're by yourself
reading with somebody

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.900
who can't read
lines because it's

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.100
like your mom and the
whole thing's bad.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.750
I have such a love and
respect for the people

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.716
that have auditioned
for the show because

00:14:24.716 --> 00:14:25.840
of being on the other side.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.860
It's just so intense.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.276
I know what they're
going through.

00:14:28.276 --> 00:14:29.510
I know how hard it is.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.310
And that process
has been super cool.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:37.320
I just have a different
take on a reading,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.170
on the creative
performance part of it

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.070
than, say, some of my other
producers or even our creator

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.110
or our director at the time.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.040
So it's been amazing
and I love being

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.660
part of that, that part of it.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.640
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I
guess now that you've

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.230
seen what it's on
the other side,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.840
has that changed how you're
approaching new roles?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.310
Are you even entertaining
new roles yet?

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.179
Are you still working
on finishing this one?

00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:06.970
JESSICA BIEL: I've read
a couple of things,

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.260
but now that we're sort
of in the last stretch

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.460
of the filming, it's
like a cluster some days.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.940
It's just everything's kind
of piling on top of itself.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.110
So I haven't really looked
at anything seriously,

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.610
or there hasn't
really been anything

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:25.380
that I'm really, really excited
about, so I've been focused.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.410
ALAN SEALES: No comedies?

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.450
JESSICA BIEL: No.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.290
Not on purpose though.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.960
I think it's changed
my perspective.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.060
It just made me mad.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.352
I'm like, I don't want
to do another audition

00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:40.310
because they're going to
do what I'm doing when

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.601
I'm watching the audition tape.

00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:45.350
It's like, oh, this
person is so good, but--

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.630
because when you feel like
no buts, just hire me.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.700
I'm great.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.510
Trust me.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.634
I can be great for you.

00:15:52.634 --> 00:15:53.300
ALAN SEALES: OK.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.160
And with that note, we
have mics in the aisles.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.960
If any of you have questions
for Jessica, line up

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.660
and we can get to those.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.600
You are a mom now.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.270
Congratulations.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.145
JESSICA BIEL: Thanks.

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:07.914
ALAN SEALES: Yes,
Silas is 2 and 1/2.

00:16:07.914 --> 00:16:10.330
JESSICA BIEL: Almost 2 and
1/2, yeah, two and some change.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.820
ALAN SEALES: That's a
great age, isn't it?

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.360
JESSICA BIEL: It
is and it isn't.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.240
It can be really great and
then it can be really terrible.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.031
ALAN SEALES: I've got
a 2 and 1/2 year old.

00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:20.490
I feel you.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.720
Has being a mother in
real life influenced

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.960
how you've approached
the character of Cora

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.860
here in the center?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.700
JESSICA BIEL: I think
just inherently yes, it

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:37.120
has to, because now I have an
actual understanding of what

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.980
that relationship is.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.320
If I didn't have a
kid, yeah, of course

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.950
you can evoke as many
feelings as you can possibly

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.190
build up in your
body to understand

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.400
what that feels like.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.110
But it will never compare
to the actual feeling of it

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.870
and the actual doing of it,
being a parent every day.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:06.410
And it's like the
best research ever,

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.270
just having to
exist with your kid

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.920
everyday to understand what
it would be like, you know,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.819
like if a person does this
kind of a thing that she does.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.569
The trickle effect for
her life, specifically

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.470
like what happens to her
and her family and her kid

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.660
and her relationship-- does
she ever see him again?

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.689
These are big
questions when somebody

00:17:28.689 --> 00:17:29.730
does something like this.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.660
So I have a lot of emotions
that come up for me

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.660
when we shoot stuff
and when we deal

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.760
with the mom-child
relationship, because if I

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.660
couldn't see my kid again,
I would not make it.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.080
I would just die on
the floor right here.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.280
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.210
Yeah, I hear you.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.774
Question over here?

00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:52.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jessica.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.889
JESSICA BIEL: Hi.

00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:54.930
AUDIENCE: It looks great.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.360
Congratulations.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.790
JESSICA BIEL: Thank you.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.690
AUDIENCE: It looks
really awesome.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.320
Really excited to watch it.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.900
So you're here,
house of YouTube.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.270
And obviously there's
a lot of places

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.170
where people can get kind
of amazing premium content

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.930
like this.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.750
How do you, either as an
actress or executive producer--

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.500
you've been in the
business a long time--

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.350
how do you see marketing
different nowadays

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.370
than it's been in the
past, because people

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.900
have so many options?

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.430
Love your thoughts either as an
actress or executive producer.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.950
JESSICA BIEL: I mean you're
right, it's changed so much.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.070
I think when I was
younger and we really

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.280
didn't have this kind of access
or these kind of platforms,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.960
everything was dependent on
the studio or the network,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.270
and you did everything,
and you didn't do anything.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.740
As one of the creative
people, you just kind of did

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.810
what they told you to do and
you would go do an interview

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.340
or you would do a magazine
cover and that was kind of it.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.280
It was very simple.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.650
And now I feel so
much more involved.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.490
I'm talking to USA all the time.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.400
We're collaborating on,
what am I going to post?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.590
What are you guys posting?

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:09.500
How can we push the marketing
campaign with my personal help,

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.040
with my personal platforms,
with their platforms?

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.280
It's very much more of
like a community thing.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.300
And it's really nice
because you feel

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.880
like you have a hand in
helping to get out there.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.310
And I guess that means you also
have a hand in if it fails,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.400
that nobody cared and
all the stuff you did,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.320
it didn't matter.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.600
But at least you're part of it.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.390
I feel much more a part of
it from the creative side.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.610
And I guess from the
producorial standpoint,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.286
as much help as you can
get to get the word out

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:44.160
for people to be talking
about your material,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.200
talking about your
show is only helpful.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.490
So it's been
nothing but positive

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.305
I think when it comes to
marketing, in my experience.

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:54.430
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.638
JESSICA BIEL: Yeah, pleasure.

00:19:55.638 --> 00:19:56.987
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:57.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.528
JESSICA BIEL: Hi.

00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:01.330
AUDIENCE: This is something
I've always wondered about.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.200
When you're reading
something at home

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.390
and you're just to yourself,
I really like this,

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.960
I'm going to make
this into a movie,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.971
what exactly is the process that
you get in a source material

00:20:09.971 --> 00:20:11.720
when it does come from
a book or something

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.457
like that to be turned into
a television show or a movie?

00:20:15.457 --> 00:20:17.540
How did that work with
this book and how does that

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.206
work in general?

00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:20.370
JESSICA BIEL: Sure.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.270
Bless you.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.390
For this book I just
started reading.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.730
And a couple chapters
in, I just was

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.600
really interested and really
intrigued and then continued on

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.880
and kept calling my partner
Michelle and saying,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.317
have you made it to
chapter whatever yet?

00:20:39.317 --> 00:20:40.150
You gotta get there.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.130
It's really good.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.670
Whoa, this went in a
direction I didn't think

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.650
that it was going to go in.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.830
And this is a
different experience

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.810
because the material was
already owned by UCP.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.810
So it wasn't a
situation where I had

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.040
to reach out and try to
get the rights, which we've

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.670
done multiple times before.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.432
Honestly I will look at a
cover of something and go,

00:21:04.432 --> 00:21:05.390
this looks interesting.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.060
Somebody call about the
rights, like that fast,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.660
because the rights
are just gone,

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.210
especially if it has any sort of
notoriety in the literary world

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.370
or anything at all.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.495
If it's on anybody's list,
if it's on Oprah's list,

00:21:18.495 --> 00:21:20.470
forget it, it's gone.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.980
Literally I want to
be talking to authors

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.840
who haven't published yet, when
their books are on the way,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.830
in their third, fourth,
fifth, whatever drafts.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.264
That's when you want to
be snatching up material.

00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:34.680
So this was a
little bit different

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.260
because UCP was
bringing it to me.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.630
I had the opportunity to jump on
board right away, which I did.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.680
And yeah, it's just
about your interests.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.180
Do you like?

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.060
It is it fun?

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.850
Is there a good character here?

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.710
Is it interesting?

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.020
Is it compelling?

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.647
It's kind of as simple as that,
at least in my experience.

00:21:52.647 --> 00:21:53.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.480
ALAN SEALES: UCP is
Universal Cable Productions,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.300
is that what it is?

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.290
JESSICA BIEL: Yes, UCP, yep.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:57.950
ALAN SEALES: Over here?

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.616
JESSICA BIEL: Sorry,
I should have said.

00:21:59.616 --> 00:22:02.670
AUDIENCE: All right, as
a proud owner of "Blade--

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.770
Trinity," I feel like
that actually qualifies

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.100
as a comedy at some points.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.240
JESSICA BIEL: Thank you.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.740
Thank you very much.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.200
AUDIENCE: But as Jason was sort
of alluding to before about

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.780
this new era of marketing and
distribution and access points,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.690
and TV ratings might
not be the best

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.056
way to qualify what is a
good show and a bad show

00:22:21.056 --> 00:22:22.430
or a successful
show and not one,

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:26.390
I'm curious how as your
first foray into TV--

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.890
second.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.250
I guess "7th Heaven" counts.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.250
JESSICA BIEL: Thank you.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.070
Also sometimes a comedy.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.040
ALAN SEALES: Don't look at me.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.040
AUDIENCE: How are you looking to
gauge success for "The Sinner"

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.399
in this new world of content?

00:22:41.399 --> 00:22:43.190
JESSICA BIEL: This is
a very good question.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:47.150
I'm nervous about
this because I'm

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:51.500
kind of a viewer
that likes to binge.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.700
So I want my stuff
when I want it,

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.750
as opposed to having
to wait week by week.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.800
So I don't know how
to gauge it, honestly.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.430
I don't know what to
expect for Wednesday night.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:09.290
And if we have kind of not so
good numbers, like you said,

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.840
it doesn't necessarily mean
that the show would not have

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.360
a good viewership or following.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.630
It may not necessarily mean that
we won't have a second season.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.720
But I still have a bit
of an old school feeling

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.240
about it, like ugh, well if
we don't get good numbers then

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.910
I guess we'll
probably get canceled

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.090
or we won't get a second season.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.340
I think we're going
to have to wait

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.720
when it can be
streamed to really

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.210
see what the legs of the show--

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:42.830
what it's going to be,
because I don't know.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.210
I want it when I want
it, like most people do.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.280
So it'll be really interesting
to see what happens.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.740
I think I have to
remember to not just take

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.502
the numbers on Wednesday
as truth and that's it,

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:58.585
because you're right, it's
so different right now.

00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:00.680
ALAN SEALES: Do
you watch yourself?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.990
You going to be one of
the extra Nielsen numbers?

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.115
JESSICA BIEL: I don't know.

00:24:04.115 --> 00:24:07.750
I mean I'll turn my
television on for sure.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.960
I don't know.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.770
I haven't figured that out yet.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.530
I see my films.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.210
But I've watched
this so many times.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.680
I've seen these cuts a lot.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.030
I don't think I'm going to have
a viewing party or anything.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.660
I don't know.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.890
I haven't really
thought about it.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:23.931
ALAN SEALES: Interesting.

00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:26.210
Yeah, I don't know if
that would be weird

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.309
or not to watch yourself on
TV-- maybe the first time.

00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:31.100
I figure you've binged
all of "7th Heaven,"

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.120
but you're probably
over that now.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.970
JESSICA BIEL: All
of it, oh yeah.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.794
I just constantly go back to the
beginning and revisit it all.

00:24:35.794 --> 00:24:36.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.527
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, one
more question here.

00:24:38.527 --> 00:24:40.110
AUDIENCE: Hi Jessica,
I was wondering,

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.820
who's you're favorite
actor you've worked with?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.700
JESSICA BIEL: Favorite actor?

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.490
Oh, that's a good question.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.170
ALAN SEALES: Your husband?

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.940
JESSICA BIEL: Have we worked
together in that capacity?

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.440
Have we?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.100
ALAN SEALES: I don't know.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.110
JESSICA BIEL: I don't think so.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.700
He's really good though.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.750
I've had the pleasure of working
with a lot of great people.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.235
You know, Bill, Bill
Pullman and Chris

00:25:06.235 --> 00:25:07.860
and everyone we're
working with on this

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.130
has been amazing, so much fun.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.290
I also really loved working
on "The Illusionist"

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.550
with Ed Norton
and Paul Giamatti.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.630
Those two guys, I mean,
they just blew me away.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.850
They're so nice and so talented.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.260
I mean, everyone
I've worked with

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.759
has been amazing
in their own right,

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:27.890
but I would say maybe
those two I really enjoyed.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.210
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thank you.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.176
JESSICA BIEL: Yeah.

00:25:30.176 --> 00:25:30.926
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:31.542
Yeah.

00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:32.790
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.040
So you know when you base
something off a book,

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.080
be it a movie or a TV
show, inevitably there

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.850
are going to be some changes.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.840
Usually the plot gets different
or some things are being cut

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.450
or some things are being added.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.120
And I guess two questions.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.310
Firstly, how loosely did
you base it off the book?

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.150
Like is it very
accurate or did you

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.220
get a lot of creative
license with it?

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.250
And secondly, how do you
make those decisions?

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.120
How do you decide what is in
and what is not and what to add?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.620
JESSICA BIEL: Right,
good questions.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:16.100
So we stick pretty closely to
kind of the main real threads

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.790
of this book.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:22.740
This book kind of lives in
two worlds, a present time

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.220
and a past.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.970
And so there's these threads
that we're kind of following.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.940
And we take some
creative liberties,

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.680
I think, mainly
with the characters.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.930
I don't even know if you
call them creative liberties.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.610
We just develop them
in a different way,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.630
maybe a little bit more
thoroughly in some ways,

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.683
a little bit broader
in other ways,

00:26:42.683 --> 00:26:46.230
took some really acute
ideas of these characters

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.130
and expanded it a little bit.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:53.400
But we stick pretty closely
to the main big plot points.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.650
For example, the Ambrose
character, Bill Pullman's

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:01.130
character, he's much
different in our show

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.430
than he is in the book.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.930
Cora--

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.715
ALAN SEALES: Did you
write him that way

00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:08.160
or did Bill choose
to take him that way?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.390
JESSICA BIEL: We
wrote it that way.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.240
I think me and my
producers and our creator,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.100
Derek Simonds, who's
an incredible writer

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.710
and developer, he really saw
that that Ambrose character

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:28.990
needed more behind it,
needed to really flush out

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.960
this person for television.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.350
So he took that liberty
and changed that character.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.730
The second question was--

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.500
can you remind me?

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.874
AUDIENCE: Yeah, how do you go
about making the decisions?

00:27:45.874 --> 00:27:47.730
JESSICA BIEL: Oh,
making the decisions.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.040
You know, that's a tough
one because you obviously

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.740
want to keep the skeleton
and the real flavor,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.930
the language of the book,
because you're optioning

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.610
this material for a reason.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.750
But the formats are
so different, right?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.520
You can sit and read this book
for days and days and days

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.330
and just slowly get chunks
and be very happy with it,

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.510
whereas what we're trying to
do is keep your attention,

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.990
keep an audience's
interest for--

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.790
I think it's what, 42
minutes with commercials--

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.810
short attend attention spans.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.740
We have to kind of
drop little nuggets

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.640
along the way to keep you
interested and keep you going.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.910
So we really have to
cut things and add

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.340
things to keep that in mind,
to keep the suspense moving.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.340
Whereas you could read
a book and it's just

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.655
like interesting and
romantic and atmospheric,

00:28:45.655 --> 00:28:48.280
but nothing really happens for
a while and you're cool with it.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.460
That doesn't work
obviously in television.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.760
But the main person who's
making these decisions

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.050
is Derek, our writer-creator.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.980
And we are trusting him to
know that this is the best

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:08.710
way to handle all of these
interweaving storylines, arcs,

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.500
themes, past, present, time.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.850
It's very complicated what
we've been having to do.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.510
And how he's been doing has
been quite an amazing feat.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.840
So hopefully you will agree.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.590
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.030
We are actually short on time.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.320
I know you have to get going.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.674
So is there a quick
question over here?

00:29:26.674 --> 00:29:27.590
Got time for one more?

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.280
AUDIENCE: Hopefully.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.270
ALAN SEALES: OK, yeah.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.380
AUDIENCE: So we already started
touching on this briefly.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.130
Are you ever sitting
at your house looking

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.680
at source material and you and
Justin just look at each other

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.730
and you're like, hey, we
should do this together.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.771
Or have you talked about
it throughout your lives

00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:42.520
like we should do
this or, hey, I'd

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.090
love for you to kill me in this?

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.090
JESSICA BIEL: He would
probably love that.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.571
Yes, all the time, all
the time we are looking--

00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:55.070
I'm reading something going,
you know, you should read this.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.400
There's a really interesting
character in here for you.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.670
Or yes, we should try to
do something together.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.880
What would it be?

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.650
I always say to him that it
would be fun to do something

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:12.570
where like not playing lovers or
not playing married people, do

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:16.444
something completely, I don't
know, something not that.

00:30:16.444 --> 00:30:17.860
I don't know what
that would mean.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.170
ALAN SEALES: Comedian assassins.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.450
JESSICA BIEL:
Yeah, there you go.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.230
ALAN SEALES: That would be fun.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.430
JESSICA BIEL: That would
be fun, So yeah, we're

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.140
always looking for that
right thing, because why not?

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.490
Why not work with your best
friend, partner person,

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.660
if you can?

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.240
But I really think you have to
be careful because we've all

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.907
seen this go terribly wrong.

00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.240
You know what I'm talking about.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.610
There's a few of them
that I'm talking about.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.330
So it's a delicate
balance of finding

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.880
the right thing, of being at
the right time of your lives.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.920
And I don't know, we
haven't found it yet.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.080
But I hope so.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.696
I hope we can.

00:30:54.696 --> 00:30:55.820
I'd love to work with them.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.530
Actually you know what, we talk
a lot about him directing me

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.050
in something, which I
think would be really

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.545
cool because he's directed a
few things, like little things,

00:31:05.545 --> 00:31:06.920
commercials and
different things.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.911
And he basically does a lot
with his own videos and stuff

00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:11.410
like that.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.030
But I really think he'd
be an amazing filmmaker.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.700
So I'd love for him to
direct me in something.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.534
So now it's out there,
and he better do it,

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:24.700
because I'm the boss of him.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.410
ALAN SEALES: All right, so cool.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.839
We have this little Android for
you as thank you for coming in.

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:33.130
It's a Talks at Google Android.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.050
JESSICA BIEL: Thank you.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.360
ALAN SEALES: Everyone go see--

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.080
watch "The Sinner" this
Wednesday, August 2 on USA.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.190
And help me thank Jessica
Biel for coming in.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.790
JESSICA BIEL: Thank you guys.
