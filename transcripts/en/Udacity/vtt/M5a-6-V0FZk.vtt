00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.327
And the answer of course,
is that Rafael drives faster.

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:06.487
64 miles per hour is faster than 62.

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:11.550
And the reason this was so easy to
compare is because 64 miles per hour,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.630
really means 64 miles divided by 1 hour.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.181
And 62 miles an hour mean
62 miles divided by 1 hour.

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:22.007
They have the same denominator and
it's easy to compare.

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.250
And see that this quantity
is great than this.
