00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.012
- Hi, I'm Sal Khan, founder
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:03.012 --> 00:00:06.005
and as you might know, we are
a not-for-profit organization

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.914
with the mission of providing
a free world-class education

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:10.825
for anyone, anywhere.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:12.484
And the way that we're able to do that

00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:15.642
is through the support of folks like you.

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.721
Khan Academy is much more than me.

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:20.950
We're over 100 people developing the math,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.489
the science, the humanities
content that you've used

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.983
and that people that you care
about have used, the SAT prep,

00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:31.013
the team that's building
out the adaptive software

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.810
and allowing our content and our software

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.571
to be localized around the world.

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:36.778
None of that will be possible

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:39.504
without your generous donations.

00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:42.025
So if you, or anyone
that you've cared about

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:44.985
has benefited from this, I encourage you,

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.469
or I ask that you go to khanacademy.org

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.265
and you think about making
a donation of any size.

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.120
Any size will help.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.121
And what's especially exciting

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.875
is that between now and December 31st,

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.761
every dollar you donate will
be matched dollar for dollar

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.170
up to $2.3 million.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.519
And so there's a great way

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.599
to get a huge return on your donation.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.737
So with that, thank you
for using Khan Academy.

00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:10.349
Thank you for supporting Khan Academy,

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.766
and I hope you have a wonderful holidays.
