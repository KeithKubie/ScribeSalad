Kunol, we missed you in
the last interview with Krohl.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; I know, I should have been there.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.650
I'll do the next one for sure.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.
But you know what?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.290
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; We finished lesson one.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.840
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're done.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.060
&gt;&gt; You're telling me we're one-third
of the way through the course?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's great.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.730
&gt;&gt; And you know what we should do now?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.230
No.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.970
&gt;&gt; We should recap.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.480
&gt;&gt; We should.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.950
&gt;&gt; So the first part of the lesson
we learn about how a screen

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.960
is made of different views.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.830
&gt;&gt; Yep, image view and text view.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; And
we learned how to style those views.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.690
&gt;&gt; So if you want to change
the color of a text for instance.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.580
And in the final bit,
what we did was took different views and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.380
put them together.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.190
So we call them view groups.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.762
We use linear layout, relative layout,
we use margin and padding.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.027
Yup, so we're done now.

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:38.759
&gt;&gt; And that's Lesson 1.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:39.815
All right.
[SOUND]

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:40.755
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:45.951
&gt;&gt; I got a chilled raspberry
fruit loop tea for

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:50.577
Kunol, and green tea for Catherine.

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:53.940
You know, they haven't even really
talked about Android Studio.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.700
Let's fix that.
