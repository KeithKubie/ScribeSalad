00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:03.703
Well to generate the next point,
I have to find a rise of -3,

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.774
that means going down by three, but

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:10.003
also a run of four, which means going
over four, and that takes me here.

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.596
So, this is the next point that I should
plot, and once I have my two points,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.280
plot my line.
