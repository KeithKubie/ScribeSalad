00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.742
What do horror movies and comedies have in common?

00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:21.293
The two genres might seem totally different,

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.002
but the reason they're both so popular

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.365
is perhaps because what they have in common:

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.319
their use of dramatic irony.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.733
First, let's clarify.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.438
There are three types of irony out there.

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:33.767
Situational irony is when you expect one thing,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.110
but get the opposite.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.804
Verbal irony is when someone says something,

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.229
but truly means the opposite.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:40.858
Dramatic irony, though,

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:42.824
is what we will be looking at right now.

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:44.319
Dramatic irony is when the audience

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.414
seems to know more about an event,

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:47.529
a situation,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:48.864
or a conversation

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:50.277
than the characters in the movie,

00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:51.240
on the show,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.708
or in the book do.

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.620
The audience is in on a secret

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.455
that the characters have missed.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:57.936
This is a great story-telling device

00:00:57.936 --> 00:01:00.960
that creates tremendous emotion within that text.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.528
Think about it for a moment.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.686
How does it feel when, in a horror film,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.990
you know that the scary villain is hiding

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.340
behind that door in the darkened room.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.803
The music becomes eerie,

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.610
the lighting creates complete shadows,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.681
this has to be bad for the hero!

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.819
Of course, though, that hero must enter the room

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.489
to find the villain.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.156
You feel tremendous tension and the suspense

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:26.028
of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary,

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.913
but you just don't know when.

00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:31.533
That tension is dramatic irony:

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.562
you know something more than the characters in the film.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:36.664
Now, take the typical comedy.

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:40.686
There will probably be some type of "misunderstanding".

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:42.518
Again, we know more of what is going on

00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:44.003
than the characters do.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.672
Picture two characters making a plan

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.961
for a birthday surprise for their roommate

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:49.410
while that roommate overhears

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.945
the entire conversation from the hallway.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.301
From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur,

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:56.934
and the tension builds.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:01:59.179
This isn't the same tension as the horror film

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.849
since it is probably pretty funny

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.276
as the character tries to figure out the whos and the whats,

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:05.909
but it serves as a great example

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.497
of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony.

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.915
This tension or suspense in both genres

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.385
drives the story and keeps the plot progressing.

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.141
The audience wants, no, needs,

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:19.704
to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:22.633
either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.263
or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity

00:02:26.263 --> 00:02:28.493
and clearing up the confusion.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:31.243
So, when you feel like you are in on a secret,

00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:33.133
that is dramatic irony,

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.563
a hallmark of all the great writers,

00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:38.269
from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.
