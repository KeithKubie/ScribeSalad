things start at the local level and work

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
things start at the local level and work
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.230
things start at the local level and work
their way up to the state level in the

federal government because the federal

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
federal government because the federal
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.550
federal government because the federal
government moves more slowly than local

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
government moves more slowly than local
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650

their real needs and so I think one of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
their real needs and so I think one of
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.880
their real needs and so I think one of
the things that government needs to do

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
the things that government needs to do
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950
the things that government needs to do
is listen well but here's what I think

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
is listen well but here's what I think
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380
is listen well but here's what I think
we can do at the federal level more

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
we can do at the federal level more
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.200
we can do at the federal level more
effectively we can speak to the science

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
effectively we can speak to the science
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869
effectively we can speak to the science
because it's complicated and we do a lot

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
because it's complicated and we do a lot
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790
because it's complicated and we do a lot
of research and we do a lot of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
of research and we do a lot of
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.280
of research and we do a lot of
translation of the science into what it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
translation of the science into what it
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.170
translation of the science into what it
means for people so that the decisions

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
means for people so that the decisions
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330
means for people so that the decisions
can be made on the basis of real science

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
can be made on the basis of real science
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.000
can be made on the basis of real science
and on the basis of a real technical

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
and on the basis of a real technical
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430
and on the basis of a real technical
understanding and we can evaluate those

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
understanding and we can evaluate those
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220
understanding and we can evaluate those
impacts and put choices out now what you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
impacts and put choices out now what you
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.810
impacts and put choices out now what you
really want to do at the national level

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
really want to do at the national level
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.069
really want to do at the national level
is send long-term signals and those

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
is send long-term signals and those
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.250
is send long-term signals and those
signals go to people in markets because

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
signals go to people in markets because
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.149
signals go to people in markets because
the best thing EPA and other regulatory

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159
the best thing EPA and other regulatory
 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.130
the best thing EPA and other regulatory
agencies need to do is set standards

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
agencies need to do is set standards
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649
agencies need to do is set standards
based on what we think the science tells

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
based on what we think the science tells
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210
based on what we think the science tells
us the law tells us and what's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
us the law tells us and what's
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920
us the law tells us and what's
achievable but those need to be

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
achievable but those need to be
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480
achievable but those need to be
long-term signals because we don't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
long-term signals because we don't
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300
long-term signals because we don't
deliver the solutions we really don't

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
deliver the solutions we really don't
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.810
deliver the solutions we really don't
the market delivers the solution that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
the market delivers the solution that's
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390
the market delivers the solution that's
why on things like climate change we're

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
why on things like climate change we're
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730
why on things like climate change we're
looking at regulating the power sector

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
looking at regulating the power sector
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.399
looking at regulating the power sector
to reduce carbon pollution I am setting

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
to reduce carbon pollution I am setting
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069
to reduce carbon pollution I am setting
standards out to 2030 because the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
standards out to 2030 because the
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.530
standards out to 2030 because the
solutions are here what you need to do

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
solutions are here what you need to do
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630
solutions are here what you need to do
is give them the time to take hold in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
is give them the time to take hold in
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.179
is give them the time to take hold in
the marketplace and then what happens is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
the marketplace and then what happens is
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850
the marketplace and then what happens is
the solutions of today start taking off

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
the solutions of today start taking off
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.550
the solutions of today start taking off
but what's most important is the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
but what's most important is the
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770
but what's most important is the
solutions of tomorrow start getting

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
solutions of tomorrow start getting
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200
solutions of tomorrow start getting
driven into the market they take time

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
driven into the market they take time
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.139
driven into the market they take time
it's like being in a race in the federal

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
it's like being in a race in the federal
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.999
it's like being in a race in the federal
government you know says what direction

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
government you know says what direction
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.760
government you know says what direction
to run and then this and they shoot the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
to run and then this and they shoot the
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219
to run and then this and they shoot the

the people who are driving new

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
the people who are driving new

for in EPA's career for 44 years at EPA
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.990
for in EPA's career for 44 years at EPA
is we've listened to the science and the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
is we've listened to the science and the
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.120
is we've listened to the science and the
law and we have we have let solutions

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
law and we have we have let solutions
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.820

take off in the marketplace which is
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.520
take off in the marketplace which is
where the the cheapest most effective

environmental standards forward so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820
environmental standards forward so
 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.510

think everybody think about where
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.430
think everybody think about where

turn it into economic viability and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
turn it into economic viability and
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.020
turn it into economic viability and
economic opportunities and nothing lends

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
economic opportunities and nothing lends
