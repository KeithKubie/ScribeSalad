00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.900
- A quick caveat before
we get started here,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.190
I do not want Smarter
Every Day to be observed as

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.540
a channel that glorifies weaponry.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.230
I am just fascinated by fluid dynamics,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.780
ballistics, optics,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.140
mechanics, aerodynamics.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.800
All this stuff is just fascinating to me.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.030
And I am hard-pressed to
find one singular thing

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.100
that I can study that wraps
all these physical phenomenon

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.250
into the perfect Venn
diagram that tickles my brain

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.310
quite like firearms.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.030
So, that's why you'll see me
studying firearms so often

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.660
and I hope you realize that
I'm doing it as intelligently

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.820
and respectfully as I can.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.270
That being said, I've
made some observations

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.300
in the last episode and
I've learned some stuff.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.180
And I've also decided to
push it a little further

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.810
by studying suppressors.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.290
So, let's look at this and
try to get smarter everyday.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.630
First, let's revisit what we
learned in the last episode.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.330
Using a phantom camera with a
clever photography technique

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.250
called Schlieren, which is
German for streak by the way,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.540
we observe that the
supersonic bullet creates

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.610
an angular shot cone and
the angle of that cone can

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.460
be used to determine the mach number.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.980
We also learned from
Dr. Konigstrasse at UAH

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.000
that a bullet travelling
in the transonic regime

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.830
can create supersonic flow around it

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.340
because the air has to speed up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.000
and rush around the outside
of the surface of the bullet.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.420
This is a connection I
didn't make at the time

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.410
but we've all see these awesome pictures

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.800
of a fighter jet with this
cone of vapor behind it,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.150
this is totally why that happens.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.820
The jet is flying along
in the transonic regime

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120
just like that bullet and
just like the normal shockwave

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.310
that occurs on the side
of the subsonic bullet

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.950
that's happening on the jet.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.720
And it does two things, number one,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.910
it makes this cone of
vapor form on the jet

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.480
and number two, it makes
me all tingly inside.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.170
Okay, so I think we have
a good understanding

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.970
at this point of shockwaves
created by a bullet itself.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.010
You may have heard someone talk
about the crack of a bullet

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.652
as it passes, that's
created by this shockwave.

00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:54.752
But if you think about
the bang of a gunshot,

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.480
it's all those rapidly expanding gases

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.920
out the front of a muzzle right?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160
So it's time to hone in
on that area right there

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.090
and study that with super schlom,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.920
super slowmo suppressor
Schlieren, there you go.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.753
It's hard to say.

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:09.080
In a past episode of Smarter Every day

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.690
I asked a company to fabricate
a see-through suppressor

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420
so we could see the flame front propagate

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720
through the baffles and try to
understand what was going on.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810
That was effective in showing
what happens on the inside

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.480
of their particular suppressor design

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.780
but what I wanna see
is exactly what happens

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.480
on the outside of the suppressor,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.160
after all, that's where all the noise is.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.910
Here's my friend Coop firing his rifle

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.580
chambered in 300 blackout, both
suppressed and unsuppressed.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.830
I want to show you a full
minute of slow motion video

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.150
because I believe it does
the best job of explaining

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.660
the physics of what's going on.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.730
On the left we have a suppressed weapon

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.750
and on the right we have the
same weapon unsuppressed.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.520
When they're first fired
you can see straight away

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.760
that the weapon on the right
seems to have a larger,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.160
dirtier blast but after four milliseconds

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.277
there doesn't seem to
be any more shockwaves,

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:53.920
we're just venting the
exhaust gases at that point.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.070
The weapon on the left,
however, is still chugging away.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.670
It's like this initial
blast is bouncing around

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.250
on the inside of the suppressor

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.590
and just a little bit of the gases

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.849
are being leaked out
with every reverberation.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.160
(gunshot echo)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.540
Watch what happens next though.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.740
On the right, the echo from
the unsuppressed weapon

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.230
is huge and very distinct.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.190
You can see how powerful and singular

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.710
that initial blast was

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.150
by how sharp the echo is when it returns.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.330
Imagine that echo entering your ears,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.480
meanwhile you can still see
that the suppressed weapon

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.380
is dissipating that
acoustic energy slowly.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.380
This is like the clearest
example I can show

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.350
of that energy being
dissipated differently.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.730
On the right, the unsuppressed version,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.650
the whole thing's over in
a millisecond and a half

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.130
but on the left, the same acoustic energy

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.280
is dissipated over 15 milliseconds.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.260
That is a direct comparison showing you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.820
that it almost acts like
a capacitor in a circuit,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.980
it's like, slowly filtering
the energy as it exits.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.270
Anyway, that energy dissipation
does not come for free.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.480
Suppressors heat up very, very quickly.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.820
All that thermal energy is captured

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.240
because it doesn't dissipate
away from the weapons.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.530
So the problem with suppressors is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.290
if you fire enough rounds through 'em,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.360
they heat up very, very fast
and they can cause malfunctions

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.920
and even damage to the weapon.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.890
Now let's look at subsonic ammunition

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.130
being fired from a suppressor.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.130
This is absolutely fascinating.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.370
Okay first observation.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.030
The first thing that leaves the
suppressor is unburnt powder

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.630
and look at that, there's
little baby shockwave,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.700
they're supersonic.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.140
Now whether this is gunk coming loose

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.360
from previous shots, or
whatever, I don't know

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.550
but it's clearly supersonic.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.032
Second, did you see
that little vortex ring

00:04:31.032 --> 00:04:32.360
poot out the end?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.630
Okay, here we go, bullet time.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.610
We know this is a subsonic round

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.570
so we're expecting normal shockwaves

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.840
on the sides of the
bullet but look at that.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.570
They're not there until the bullet

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.770
is several inches away from the muzzle.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.960
It is crazy to think about how complicated

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.300
this flow environment
is but it's really fun

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.070
to make these observations
and try to figure it out.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.420
This episode of Smarter
Every Day is sponsored

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.253
by Hello Fresh.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.730
if we go out of town.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.270
It really works for us.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.269
Is that, what are you doin' right now?

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:12.458
Does it say use your hands?

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.493
- No it didn't, it just says to mix.

00:05:14.493 --> 00:05:15.993
- Have you ever eaten a jalapeno?

00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:17.580
- No.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.861
- Today's the day buddy.

00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:23.270
- Mummy's gonna have her burger
without jalapenos (laughs)

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.440
- You can't deviate from the recipe.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.678
- Yeah, yes I can

00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:28.430

00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:42.040
- Absolutely!

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.890
- You don't have to like...

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.744
- I don't have to shop.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:44.720

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.920
Big thanks to Hello Fresh for
sponsoring Smarter Every Day

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.370
and for making this happen.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.010
I really like it when this happens

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.730
and yeah, give it a shot.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.310
I think you'll dig it with
your family, it works for us.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.900
What are these little squirrely things

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.980
that come out of the suppressor?

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.250
- Okay, so what you're seeing here

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.930
on this blackout cartridge
is your seeing unburnt

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.960
propellant leaving the
muzzle before the bullet goes

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.270
and so for 300 blackout
optimally you get complete

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.420
burnout around 9 1/2 to ten
inches of barrel length.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.920
So this is a 10.2 inch barrel length

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.690
so we're right on the threshold of burning

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.030
all the propellant out before
the bullet leaves the muzzle.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.969
- But look, there was a
supersonic piece of powder

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.059
- Yeah there is.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.947
- You see that?

00:06:32.947 --> 00:06:33.780
- Whoa!

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.690
- This is insane, we're just
like, learning important stuff.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.560
Alright, well that was delightful,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.709
what did we learn John? (laughs)

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.710
- Propellant outruns bullets sometimes.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.600
You may have grains of propellant

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.060
that exit the muzzle faster
than the bullet, supersonically.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.360
- That's crazy, and there's
a shockwave on those grains

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.490
of propellant
- Exactly!

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.280
- That's uh, never
would have thought that.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.170
- Neither would I.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.330
