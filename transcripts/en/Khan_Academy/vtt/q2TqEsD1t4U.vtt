00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.310
We're on the last section of the
last test. So this is the

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.730
home stretch.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.670
Problem 1.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.040
A restaurant menu lists 8
dinners and 3 desserts.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.220
How many different
dinner-dessert combinations

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.400
are possible from this menu?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.940
So you have 8 dinners.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.070
And for each of them you can
have 3 different desserts.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.350
Right?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.500
So that's 8 times
3 combinations.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.920
And that's 24.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.350
And you could list them
all out, right?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.420
For dinner 1 you could have
1, 2, 3, desserts.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.200
For dinner 2 you can have
1, 2, 3, desserts.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.740
So you would have 3 for each of
the 8, 3 possible desserts.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.830
So that's how you get to 24.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.030
Problem 2.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:47.410
The sum of 3x and 5 is equal to
the product of x times 1/3.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.630
So I just read it and while
I read it I wrote it out.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.960
The sum of 3x and 5 is equal to
the product of x and 1/3.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.090
Which of the following
equations gives the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.830
relationship stated in
the problem above?

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.690
Well, exactly as I wrote
it, that's choice E.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560
x times 1/3, that's the
same thing as 1/3 x.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.010
So that's 1/3 x.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.840
So that's choice E.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.090
Problem 3.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.590
Let me see if I can
do it right here.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.410
A clerk accidentally threw a
valuable document into one of

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.365
90 trash cans.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:23.150
All right, 1 of 90 trash cans.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.070
Let's say there are
90 trash cans.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.330
It is equally likely that the
document is in any one of

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.950
these 90 trash cans.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.820
If exactly 15 of these 90 trash
cans are blue, what is

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.890
the probability that the
document will be in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890
a blue trash can?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.030
Well, 15 of these 90 are blue.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.800
So the probability it's going
to be in one of those 15 is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.520
going to be is essentially
15/90.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.050
How do I know that?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.690
Well there's 100% probability
it's in 1 of the 90, right?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.090
And so if I want to know, what
is the probability it's in one

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.430
of the blue, I take the
fraction of the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.640
blue over the whole.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.650
And that's the probability that
it's in one of the blue

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.160
trash cans.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.360
And if I divide the top and the
bottom-- let's see 15 goes

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.695
into 90-- 15 goes into
30 2 times, so it

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.600
goes into 90 6 times.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.610
So this is 1/6.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.663
Just divide the numerator and
the denominator by 15.

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:17.750
And that's choice C.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.300
Next problem.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.380
Problem 4.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.040
How many different integer pairs
satisfy the equation, x

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.480
over y is equal to 1/2?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.680
So another way of writing this,
you could say that x is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.290
equal to 1/2 y.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.870
I just multiply both
sides by y.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.470
Or you can multiply
both sides by 2.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.470
And you say 2x is equal to y.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.350
So how many integer pairs
satisfy this?

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.200
Well, any integer I've
put in here, I double

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.980
it and I get a y.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.940
So what of the pairs?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.720
1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 10.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.840
They're infinite.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.720
I can keep going.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.150
So the answer is more than 4.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.690
I mean, I listed more
than 4 just in the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.900
span of about 5 seconds.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.320
So the answer is definitely E.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.020
There are infinite integer
pairs that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.230
satisfy that equation.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.790
Next problem.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.840
Problem 5.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.890
Let me see what they're asking
first. According to the graph

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.170
above, during which of the
following 2 month periods did

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.590
Ellen's bookstore sell the
least number of books?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.580
So a 2 month period.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.930
Interesting.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.720
So let's draw the graph.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.810
And so this is June,
July, August,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.033
September, October, November.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:46.650
And this is 10, 20, 30, 40 and
I'm going to try to draw as

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.750
best as they drew,
as best as I can.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.770
So in June, it looks like they
sold a little under, I don't

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.480
know, 10 books.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.915
June looks something
like that.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:59.000
In July they sold a ton.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.270
They sold 40 books,
it looks like.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.391
July looks something
like that.

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.685
In August they sold exactly
10 books, it looks like.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:09.420
I'll just eyeball it.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.096
August. September looks like
30, or a little over 30.

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:16.740
September is like there.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:24.790
October is like 25.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.624
And then November is 30.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:32.750
November looks about 30.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.070
So they say, during which of the
following 2 month periods

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.160
did Ellen's bookstore sell the
least number of books?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.670
So let's look at the choices.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.280
Choice A is June and July.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.530
Whoops.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.660
So how many books did she
sell in June and July?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.840
We can eyeball it.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.260
Let's say that this is
7 and this is 40.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.870
So this is going to be 47.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.890
July and August is
this period.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.780
So I can already tell you that
July and August is going to be

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.740
higher than June and July.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.920
Why?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.430
Because August is higher
than June.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.720
August looks like 10.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.720
This looks like 40.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.480
So this is going to be 50.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.320
And then if we look at August
and September and if we say

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.290
that this is 10 and that
looks like about-- I

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.580
don't know-- 30, 33.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.900
So what's 10 plus 33?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.160
43.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.850
So that's our winner so far.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.755
And then they're asking
September and October.

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:35.860
Let me switch colors.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.782
September and October
would be that.

00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:43.655
If that's 33, October
looks like about 25.

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:44.800
So there's a little bit
of approximation here.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.410
So what's 33 plus 25?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.160
That's 58 and that's actually
the most so far.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.520
And then finally October
and November.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.495
November looks like 30.

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.240
So what's 30 plus 25.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.450
It's 55.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.200
So the smallest is definitely
August and September.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.450
Next problem.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.940
Maybe I'll stick with
this white.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.550
Problem 6.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.896
OK, they drew us a line.

00:06:12.896 --> 00:06:20.730
And they say that this is point
A, this is point B and

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.420
this is point C.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.750
In the figure above,
AC equals 24.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.000
And they tell us that
AB is equal to BC.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.700
So this side, this length has
to equal that length and

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.390
combined they add up to 24.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.760
So we know that's going
to be 12 and that's

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.180
also going to be 12.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.140
Because they have to add up
to 24 and they're equal.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.320
Point D, not shown, is on the
line between A and B-- so

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.470
point D is someplace here-- such
that AD is equal to DB.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.165
So if we put D here, I'll do
it in a different color.

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:05.210
If this is D, they want us-- so
12 is this whole length and

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.930
they're saying AD
is equal to DB.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.780
So what are each of these
smaller lengths

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.540
going to be, equal?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.220
This is equal to this, so this
is going to have to be 6 and

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.370
this is going to have
to be 6, right?

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.970
Because the two sides are equal
and the two lengths are

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.780
equal and they add up to 12.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.750
Now what are they asking?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.980
What does DC equal?

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.090
So what is this distance?

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.420
Just to here.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.100
From there to there.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.480
OK.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.600
So we'd have to go
6 to get to B.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.410
And then we'd have to go
12 more to get to c.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.880
6 plus 12 and that gets us 18.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.000
So this distance is 18.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.880
Not too bad.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.320
This problem is that's
answer D.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.570
Problem 7.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.610
If n is a positive integer
then 6 times 10 to the

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:05.030
negative n, plus 1 times
10 to the negative

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.820
n must equal what?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.740
So let's simplify that.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.210
This is essentially-- I mean
they wrote it a little

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.250
complicated-- but we have six
10s to the negative n here.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.260
And then we have
1 more, right?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.870
I mean 6 times 10 to
the negative n.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.690
You could rewrite this as 10 to
the negative n plus 10 to

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.040
the negative n plus 10 to the
negative n plus 10 to the

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.595
negative n-- not that I'd
recommend you to do this on

00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:30.540
the exam-- 10 to the negative
n plus 10 to the negative n.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:30.970
How many have I drawn?

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.130
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:33.360
Right.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.090
That's 6 times 10 to
the negative n.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.980
And to that we add 1 more
10 to the negative n.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.010
So how many 10 to the negative
ns do we have?

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.440
We have 7 now.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.100
Right?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.470
So it's 7 times 10 to
the negative n.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.890
And that is not a choice.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.860
So what's another way of writing
10 to the negative n?

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.870
Well, that's the same thing
as 1 over 10 to the n.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.500
So that's 7 times 1
over 10 to the n.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.600
Which is, of course, equal
to 7 over 10 to the n.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.850
And that is choice B.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.840
Next problem.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.170
Actually, I'll do it in the next
video because I have less

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.040
than a minute left.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.450
I'll see--
