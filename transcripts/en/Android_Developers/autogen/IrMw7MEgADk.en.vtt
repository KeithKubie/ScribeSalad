replaced it with something much better

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040

Android studio one of the nice benefits
that you can open multiple inspections

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
that you can open multiple inspections
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.870
that you can open multiple inspections
at once it's a lot faster so if you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880
at once it's a lot faster so if you
 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.510
at once it's a lot faster so if you
haven't used that tool go use it it's a

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520
haven't used that tool go use it it's a

very easy way to analyze your Harkey and
 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.680
very easy way to analyze your Harkey and
you know debug various things like

you know debug various things like
padding and margin and you know even

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
padding and margin and you know even
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.800
padding and margin and you know even
performance sometimes if you have too

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810
performance sometimes if you have too

many views that overlap each other

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260
many views that overlap each other
 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.930
many views that overlap each other
here's another one that's the old way of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940
here's another one that's the old way of
 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.610
here's another one that's the old way of
profiling the code so that was called

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620
profiling the code so that was called
 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.620

for quite a while here we see it in

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330
for quite a while here we see it in
 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.719
for quite a while here we see it in
action inside of Eclipse it used to be

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729
action inside of Eclipse it used to be
 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.490

its own standalone tool so one of the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500
its own standalone tool so one of the
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.350
its own standalone tool so one of the
issues that we had with trace with the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360
issues that we had with trace with the
 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.969
issues that we had with trace with the
original version was an instrumented

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979
original version was an instrumented
 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.130
original version was an instrumented
profiler so there was a lot of overhead

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140
profiler so there was a lot of overhead
 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.200
profiler so there was a lot of overhead
it was running on every method that was

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210
it was running on every method that was
 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.969
it was running on every method that was
invoked it was running in interpreted

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979
invoked it was running in interpreted
 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.740
invoked it was running in interpreted
mode and so you couldn't really trust

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750
mode and so you couldn't really trust
 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.510
mode and so you couldn't really trust
the number so when he said you know this

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520
the number so when he said you know this
 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.250
the number so when he said you know this
method took three milliseconds that

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260
method took three milliseconds that
 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.860
method took three milliseconds that
wasn't true the method actually was a

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870
wasn't true the method actually was a
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.690
wasn't true the method actually was a
lot faster than that and the only thing

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700
lot faster than that and the only thing
 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.610
lot faster than that and the only thing
you could do is compare the relative

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
you could do is compare the relative
 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.010
you could do is compare the relative
time between different methods and even

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020
time between different methods and even
 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.600
time between different methods and even
that was difficult because if a method

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610
that was difficult because if a method
 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.400
that was difficult because if a method
was invoking native code native code was

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410
was invoking native code native code was
 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.129
was invoking native code native code was
not affected so any method in working

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139
not affected so any method in working
 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.779
not affected so any method in working
native code was skewed because you know

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789
native code was skewed because you know
 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.450
native code was skewed because you know
numbers projects also wrong over the

numbers projects also wrong over the
 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.430
numbers projects also wrong over the
years we added sampling for funding to

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440
years we added sampling for funding to
 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.650
years we added sampling for funding to
the stool but so it was very difficult

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660
the stool but so it was very difficult
 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.680
the stool but so it was very difficult
to use only a few of us even were using

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690
to use only a few of us even were using
 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.180
to use only a few of us even were using
it internally because it wasn't that

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
it internally because it wasn't that
 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.420
it internally because it wasn't that
great a few later thankfully we

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
great a few later thankfully we
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.310
great a few later thankfully we
introduced systrace so the big benefit

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320
introduced systrace so the big benefit
 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.930
introduced systrace so the big benefit
of systrace of a tracer is that it gives

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
of systrace of a tracer is that it gives
 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.760
of systrace of a tracer is that it gives
you a comprehensive view of the entire

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770
you a comprehensive view of the entire
 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.440
you a comprehensive view of the entire
system trace view tells you how much

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450
system trace view tells you how much
 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.900
system trace view tells you how much
time you're spending in on every line of

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910
time you're spending in on every line of
 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.370
time you're spending in on every line of
code inside your application basically

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380
code inside your application basically
 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.529
code inside your application basically
but sometimes performance issues come

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539
but sometimes performance issues come
 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.969
but sometimes performance issues come
from somewhere else in the system maybe

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979
from somewhere else in the system maybe
 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.770
from somewhere else in the system maybe
you're blocked on something that's in a

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780
you're blocked on something that's in a
 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.960
you're blocked on something that's in a
different process so this trace gives

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970
different process so this trace gives
 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.850
different process so this trace gives
you that view that you needed before

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860
you that view that you needed before
 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.029
you that view that you needed before
that were completely in the blind and

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039
that were completely in the blind and
 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.590
that were completely in the blind and
now we have

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600
now we have
 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.330
now we have
fellows that have been introduced in

for instance we saw that operators you

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:10.090
for instance we saw that operators you
 

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.210

you can do this structuring assignment

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120
you can do this structuring assignment
 

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.360
you can do this structuring assignment
so when you have a POJO you create

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.370
so when you have a POJO you create
 

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.390
so when you have a POJO you create
methods called component 1 2 3 etc then

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400
methods called component 1 2 3 etc then
 

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.500
methods called component 1 2 3 etc then
you can do more you can do multiple

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:37.510
you can do more you can do multiple
 

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.090
you can do more you can do multiple
assignments in one line of code so this

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:39.100
assignments in one line of code so this
 

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.590
assignments in one line of code so this

the Android extensions again there's a
talk by a Jack Wharton I think on

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:20.429
talk by a Jack Wharton I think on
 

00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:21.890
talk by a Jack Wharton I think on
Thursday morning about it

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900
Thursday morning about it
 

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.029
Thursday morning about it
it's going to talk about a lot of

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039
it's going to talk about a lot of
 

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.770
it's going to talk about a lot of
interesting things we also created a

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780
interesting things we also created a
 

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.810
interesting things we also created a
style guide so those of you who are

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820
style guide so those of you who are
 

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.120
style guide so those of you who are
still using our Java guide I mean we

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.130
still using our Java guide I mean we
 

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.440
still using our Java guide I mean we
didn't really have one but if you're

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:30.450
didn't really have one but if you're
 

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.180
didn't really have one but if you're
following our source code you're pretty

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.190
following our source code you're pretty
 

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.430
following our source code you're pretty
perfect in your fields with em you're

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440
perfect in your fields with em you're
 

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.960
perfect in your fields with em you're
gonna be happy to know that we're not

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:35.970
gonna be happy to know that we're not
 

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.360
gonna be happy to know that we're not
doing that anymore with cutting first

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:38.370
doing that anymore with cutting first
 

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.580
doing that anymore with cutting first
because we don't really like it and also

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:40.590
because we don't really like it and also
 

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.020
because we don't really like it and also
because you can't redo it because of the

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.030
because you can't redo it because of the
 

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.060
because you can't redo it because of the
properties syntax and cut in any way we

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.070
properties syntax and cut in any way we
 

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.310
properties syntax and cut in any way we
also have an interoperability guide so

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
also have an interoperability guide so
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.289
also have an interoperability guide so
if you're gonna be writing code that is

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299
if you're gonna be writing code that is
 

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:50.149
if you're gonna be writing code that is
meant to be consumed by both Java

00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159

first of all layouts and Android there

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120
first of all layouts and Android there
 

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.520
first of all layouts and Android there
are a bunch of them but these are kind

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:13.530
are a bunch of them but these are kind
 

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.080
are a bunch of them but these are kind
of the major ones that people dealt with

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.090
of the major ones that people dealt with
 

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.460
of the major ones that people dealt with
over time first of all there was

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.470
over time first of all there was
 

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.580
over time first of all there was
absolute layout and you know it's so

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:19.590
absolute layout and you know it's so
 

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.289
absolute layout and you know it's so
easy to use why wouldn't you then you

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299
easy to use why wouldn't you then you
 

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:22.700
easy to use why wouldn't you then you
just tell the view exactly where you

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:22.710
just tell the view exactly where you
 

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.799
just tell the view exactly where you
want it to be right linear layout you

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:24.809
want it to be right linear layout you
 

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:26.600
want it to be right linear layout you
can just nest those things as deeply as

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:26.610
can just nest those things as deeply as
 

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.370
can just nest those things as deeply as
you want to and get the exactly the UI

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380
you want to and get the exactly the UI
 

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.980
you want to and get the exactly the UI
you're looking for frame layout it's

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:30.990
you're looking for frame layout it's
 

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.470
you're looking for frame layout it's
fine you know you can you squint at it

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480
fine you know you can you squint at it
 

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.149
fine you know you can you squint at it
it's kind of like an absolute layout if

00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159
it's kind of like an absolute layout if
 

00:20:35.159 --> 00:20:36.230
it's kind of like an absolute layout if
that's the best thing we can say about

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240
that's the best thing we can say about
 

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.200
that's the best thing we can say about
it comply

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.210
it comply
 

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.149
it comply
grid layout turns out it's a little bit

00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159
grid layout turns out it's a little bit
 

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:43.159
grid layout turns out it's a little bit
complicated to use but you know we can

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:43.169
complicated to use but you know we can
 

00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:44.840
complicated to use but you know we can
figure that out and it has a lot of

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:44.850
figure that out and it has a lot of
 

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.880
figure that out and it has a lot of
flexibility there and relative layout

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:46.890
flexibility there and relative layout
 

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.770
flexibility there and relative layout
we've heard that it's expensive is this

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780
we've heard that it's expensive is this
 

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.460
we've heard that it's expensive is this
something we should be using or not so

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:51.470
something we should be using or not so
 

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.690
something we should be using or not so
the modern world here's how we think

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700
the modern world here's how we think
 

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.450
the modern world here's how we think
about absolute layout

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:57.460
 
 

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:03.110
 
we just want to make it clear

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120
 
 

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.279

the only reason that this is not

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760
the only reason that this is not
 

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.419
the only reason that this is not
deprecated is because there is one

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:11.429
deprecated is because there is one
 

00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:14.529
deprecated is because there is one
important class that subclass it is the

00:21:14.529 --> 00:21:14.539
important class that subclass it is the
 

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.090
important class that subclass it is the
participate okay well we deprecated and

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100
participate okay well we deprecated and
 

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.140
participate okay well we deprecated and
that's about as far as we can take

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:18.150
that's about as far as we can take
 

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.789
that's about as far as we can take
because webview is an absolute layout

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799
because webview is an absolute layout
 

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:20.840
because webview is an absolute layout
sorry

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:20.850
sorry
 

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.640
sorry
don't use that hopefully you're not

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
don't use that hopefully you're not
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.950
don't use that hopefully you're not
linear layout it's actually fine to

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960
linear layout it's actually fine to
 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.899
linear layout it's actually fine to
still use especially for simple cases if

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:26.909
still use especially for simple cases if
 

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:28.820
still use especially for simple cases if
you're deeply deeply nesting then you're

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:28.830
you're deeply deeply nesting then you're
 

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.049
you're deeply deeply nesting then you're
deeply deeply wronged and there's a

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059
deeply deeply wronged and there's a
 

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.340
deeply deeply wronged and there's a
better solution we get to it at the

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.350
better solution we get to it at the
 

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.590
better solution we get to it at the
bottom of the slide frame layout it's

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600
bottom of the slide frame layout it's
 

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.810
bottom of the slide frame layout it's
also okay for simple use cases you need

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820
also okay for simple use cases you need
 

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.580
also okay for simple use cases you need
to put that one thing in there with you

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:37.590
to put that one thing in there with you
 

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.960
to put that one thing in there with you
know appropriate padding and margins

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:38.970
know appropriate padding and margins
 

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.669
know appropriate padding and margins
that's kind of what the dirty secrets of

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679
that's kind of what the dirty secrets of
 

00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:42.049
that's kind of what the dirty secrets of
Furman out is that it's an absolute

00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059
Furman out is that it's an absolute
 

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:44.149
Furman out is that it's an absolute
layout in these guys use margins

00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159
layout in these guys use margins
 

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:46.070
layout in these guys use margins
correctly you're busy enough so close

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080
correctly you're busy enough so close
 

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.769
correctly you're busy enough so close
but don't do that don't do that don't do

00:21:48.769 --> 00:21:48.779
but don't do that don't do that don't do
 

00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:51.740
but don't do that don't do that don't do
that a grid layout so it turns out that

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:51.750
that a grid layout so it turns out that
 

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.810
that a grid layout so it turns out that
it's it's really intended to be used

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820
it's it's really intended to be used
 

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.299
it's it's really intended to be used
with tools except the problem was we

00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:56.309
with tools except the problem was we
 

00:21:56.309 --> 00:21:59.149
with tools except the problem was we
never actually wrote the tools so I

00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159
never actually wrote the tools so I
 

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:01.310
never actually wrote the tools so I
think we forgot probably not the best

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320
think we forgot probably not the best
 

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.529
think we forgot probably not the best
layout to use for your situation unless

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539
layout to use for your situation unless
 

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.669
layout to use for your situation unless
you're already wrapped your head around

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679
you're already wrapped your head around
 

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:08.000
you're already wrapped your head around
it okay there may be better solutions

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.010
it okay there may be better solutions
 

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:09.529
it okay there may be better solutions
out there relative layout we believe

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539
out there relative layout we believe
 

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.659
out there relative layout we believe
that constraint layout is in general a

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:11.669
that constraint layout is in general a
 

00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:13.039
that constraint layout is in general a
better solution now we think of it as a

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:13.049
better solution now we think of it as a
 

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:14.750
better solution now we think of it as a
subset of the capabilities a relative

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760
subset of the capabilities a relative
 

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.159
subset of the capabilities a relative
layout it has a lot of the same

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:16.169
layout it has a lot of the same
 

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:18.260
layout it has a lot of the same
capabilities of relative positioning of

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:18.270
capabilities of relative positioning of
 

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.870
capabilities of relative positioning of
children with respect to each other but

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880
children with respect to each other but
 

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.279
children with respect to each other but
it has way more like relative

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:22.289
it has way more like relative
 

00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:24.830
it has way more like relative
positioning to guidelines and some of

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840
positioning to guidelines and some of
 

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.789
positioning to guidelines and some of
the new capabilities they've been

00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799
the new capabilities they've been
 

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:27.019
the new capabilities they've been
working on to consider what I like to

00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:27.029
working on to consider what I like to

relative layout that's works and also

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620
relative layout that's works and also
 

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.620
relative layout that's works and also
the best thing about it is it's tightly

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:33.630
the best thing about it is it's tightly
 

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.120
the best thing about it is it's tightly
integrated with the tool it was written

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:35.130
integrated with the tool it was written
 

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.490
integrated with the tool it was written
in tandem like by the same people with

the tool which means the design tool

00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:39.779
the tool which means the design tool
 

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:41.389
the tool which means the design tool
works really well with that layout as

00:22:41.389 --> 00:22:41.399
works really well with that layout as
 

00:22:41.399 --> 00:22:43.490
works really well with that layout as
opposed to well they created the api's

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500
opposed to well they created the api's
 

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.350
opposed to well they created the api's
and the tools sort of never caught up

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360
and the tools sort of never caught up
 

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.720
and the tools sort of never caught up
that is not the case there we mentioned

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:47.730
that is not the case there we mentioned
 

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.210
that is not the case there we mentioned
2.0 it's not 2.0 yet I would say it's

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220
2.0 it's not 2.0 yet I would say it's
 

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.980

this week we'll go over some of that

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:58.470
this week we'll go over some of that
 

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.789
this week we'll go over some of that
stuff probably final thought on on

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799

absolute layout just to make it clear so

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:05.850
absolute layout just to make it clear so
 

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.539

we have a class in the UI toolkit called

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:08.549
we have a class in the UI toolkit called
 

00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:10.340
we have a class in the UI toolkit called
adapter view it's the base class for a

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.350
adapter view it's the base class for a
 

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.500

all I mean they served us fine for many

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:16.870
all I mean they served us fine for many
 

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.290
all I mean they served us fine for many
many years they had a few issues they

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:19.300
many years they had a few issues they
 

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.270
many years they had a few issues they
were difficult to maintain

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280
were difficult to maintain
 

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.330
were difficult to maintain
grid-view I think has not been used by

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:24.340
grid-view I think has not been used by
 

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.160
grid-view I think has not been used by
pretty much any app for quite a while

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.170
pretty much any app for quite a while

maybe for applications gallery is kind

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:28.930

of like a horizontal ListView and I'm

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:30.490
of like a horizontal ListView and I'm
 

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.800
of like a horizontal ListView and I'm
pretty sure it's been deprecated for a

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:31.810
pretty sure it's been deprecated for a
 

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.870
pretty sure it's been deprecated for a
long time and we haven't certainly been

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880
long time and we haven't certainly been
 

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.550
long time and we haven't certainly been
looking at it for a while so I wouldn't

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:35.560
looking at it for a while so I wouldn't
 

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.380
looking at it for a while so I wouldn't
use it if I were you anyway oh it

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.390
use it if I were you anyway oh it
 

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.090
use it if I were you anyway oh it
doesn't work so you have some of the

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:39.100
doesn't work so you have some of the
 

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100
doesn't work so you have some of the
issues so an adapter view has an adapter

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.110
issues so an adapter view has an adapter
 

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.480
issues so an adapter view has an adapter
and the adapter is the interface between

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:42.490
and the adapter is the interface between
 

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.240
and the adapter is the interface between
your data set and the view itself so one

your data set and the view itself so one
 

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.590
your data set and the view itself so one
of the things you can do in the adapter

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600
of the things you can do in the adapter
 

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.290
of the things you can do in the adapter
is nullified view of any changes in the

is nullified view of any changes in the
 

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.640
is nullified view of any changes in the
data set the points that you can only

notify of course grant changes all you

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.110
notify of course grant changes all you
 

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.790
notify of course grant changes all you
can say is hey something has changed so

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:55.800
can say is hey something has changed so
 

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.890

absurdly enough in this view we have a

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:58.900
absurdly enough in this view we have a
 

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.480
absurdly enough in this view we have a
lot of code that's trying to figure out

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:00.490
lot of code that's trying to figure out
 

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.760
lot of code that's trying to figure out
what has changed wouldn't be nice if you

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:02.770
what has changed wouldn't be nice if you
 

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.320
what has changed wouldn't be nice if you
could tell us because you probably know

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:04.330
could tell us because you probably know
 

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.450
could tell us because you probably know
well we built an API where you cannot

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:06.460
well we built an API where you cannot
 

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.300
well we built an API where you cannot
tell us so that's kind of done we also

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:09.310
tell us so that's kind of done we also
 

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.640
tell us so that's kind of done we also
used to tell you to follow this pattern

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:11.650
used to tell you to follow this pattern
 

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.500
used to tell you to follow this pattern
the view holder so the view holder and

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:13.510
the view holder so the view holder and
 

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.610
the view holder so the view holder and
you know it's one of those things where

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:14.620
you know it's one of those things where
 

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.930

I've seen a lot of people mad online

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:15.940
I've seen a lot of people mad online
 

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.070
I've seen a lot of people mad online
about the view holder because for

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080
about the view holder because for
 

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.960
about the view holder because for
updates you have to write it was

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:18.970
updates you have to write it was
 

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.520
updates you have to write it was
actually extremely important I went back

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:20.530
actually extremely important I went back
 

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.640
actually extremely important I went back
and I looked at one of our old talks and

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:22.650
and I looked at one of our old talks and
 

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.750
and I looked at one of our old talks and
using the view holder pattern would give

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760
using the view holder pattern would give
 

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.520
using the view holder pattern would give
you an extra 10 frames per second when

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:26.530
you an extra 10 frames per second when
 

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.840
you an extra 10 frames per second when
you were scrolling your list view on its

you were scrolling your list view on its
 

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.940
you were scrolling your list view on its
mobile g1 so it did matter a lot way

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:29.950
mobile g1 so it did matter a lot way
 

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.890
mobile g1 so it did matter a lot way
back then it's not as necessary anymore

it was rather difficult so instead now

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:13.060
it was rather difficult so instead now

we have the recycler view thank thankful

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:16.390
we have the recycler view thank thankful

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.130
your data set you can specify a layout
 

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.850
your data set you can specify a layout
for this for single recyclerview so this

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:38.860
for this for single recyclerview so this
 

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.500
for this for single recyclerview so this
is the same exact code with just

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:40.510
is the same exact code with just
 

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.640
is the same exact code with just
different layout managers for the

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:41.650
different layout managers for the
 

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.470
different layout managers for the
recycler I should point out too that all

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480
recycler I should point out too that all
 

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.240
recycler I should point out too that all
of those words verdict were vertical but

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.250
of those words verdict were vertical but
 

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.290
of those words verdict were vertical but
you can actually have a horizontal

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:46.300
you can actually have a horizontal
 

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.930
you can actually have a horizontal
layout for years people asked us how to

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:48.940
layout for years people asked us how to
 

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.440
layout for years people asked us how to
do a horizontal OSB you just set a

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.450
do a horizontal OSB you just set a
 

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.150
do a horizontal OSB you just set a
rotation on the ListView and then you

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:54.160
rotation on the ListView and then you
 

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.590
rotation on the ListView and then you
have to intercept all the touch events

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600
have to intercept all the touch events
 

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.120
have to intercept all the touch events
and rotate them and then you know

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.130
and rotate them and then you know
 

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.980
and rotate them and then you know
there's a few more ApS that you put in

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:58.990
there's a few more ApS that you put in
 

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.650
there's a few more ApS that you put in
you to override because anyway that was

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:01.660
you to override because anyway that was
 

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.010
you to override because anyway that was
easy

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:02.020
easy
 

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.990
easy
secret though the easiest way is simply

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000
secret though the easiest way is simply
 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.810
secret though the easiest way is simply
rotate your phone 90 degrees which has

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
rotate your phone 90 degrees which has
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.370
rotate your phone 90 degrees which has
gotten easier with some of the system UI

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:08.380
gotten easier with some of the system UI
 

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.580
gotten easier with some of the system UI
improvements anyway that's released so

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:10.590
improvements anyway that's released so
 

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.990
improvements anyway that's released so
and one of the nice things about recycle

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000
and one of the nice things about recycle
 

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.460
and one of the nice things about recycle
view I mean there's so many things much

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:14.470
view I mean there's so many things much
 

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.230
view I mean there's so many things much
much better ways you know we have paging

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240
much better ways you know we have paging
 

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.630
much better ways you know we have paging
and we have prefetching the API is nicer

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640
and we have prefetching the API is nicer
 

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.220
and we have prefetching the API is nicer
you can change level managers you can

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.230
you can change level managers you can
 

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.410
you can change level managers you can
write on the out manager but also

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.420
write on the out manager but also
 

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.330
write on the out manager but also
animations they come for free so the

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:24.340
animations they come for free so the
 

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.920
animations they come for free so the
equipment have the code we just saw is

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:25.930
equipment have the code we just saw is
 

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:28.500
equipment have the code we just saw is
this and in particular with recycle you

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.510
this and in particular with recycle you
 

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.170
this and in particular with recycle you
what you get is fine grained changes so

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:31.180
what you get is fine grained changes so
 

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.720
what you get is fine grained changes so
you can tell us if an item was removed

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:33.730
you can tell us if an item was removed
 

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.520
you can tell us if an item was removed
what item was removed when an item was

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:35.530
what item was removed when an item was
 

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.930
what item was removed when an item was
added what I think was that it you can

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:36.940
added what I think was that it you can
 

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.400
added what I think was that it you can
tell us about phalanges of the of items

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.410
tell us about phalanges of the of items
 

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.390
tell us about phalanges of the of items
that I've changed or you can tell us

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.400
that I've changed or you can tell us
 

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.130
that I've changed or you can tell us
that everything has changed this is much

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.140
that everything has changed this is much
 

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.140
that everything has changed this is much
better for you and for us all right

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.150
better for you and for us all right
 

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.050
better for you and for us all right
fragments in the old days we heard that

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:49.060
fragments in the old days we heard that
 

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.420
fragments in the old days we heard that
fragments were really complicated and

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:51.430
fragments were really complicated and
 

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.090
fragments were really complicated and
also we would fix this thing so we

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.100
also we would fix this thing so we
 

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.200
also we would fix this thing so we
didn't necessarily have everything

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.210
didn't necessarily have everything
 

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.670
didn't necessarily have everything
correct or have all the api's that

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:56.680
correct or have all the api's that
 

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.260
correct or have all the api's that
people needed so we would put in

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.270
people needed so we would put in
 

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.670
people needed so we would put in
improvements and we put that into the

00:26:59.670 --> 00:26:59.680
improvements and we put that into the
 

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.860
improvements and we put that into the
platform release and then applications

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:01.870
platform release and then applications
 

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.770
platform release and then applications
could only use that with devices on that

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:04.780
could only use that with devices on that
 

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.680
could only use that with devices on that
platform release and so the modern

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:07.690
platform release and so the modern
 

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.050
platform release and so the modern
device is don't use the platform version

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:10.060
device is don't use the platform version
 

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.000
device is don't use the platform version
we have since ported all of that code

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.010
we have since ported all of that code
 

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.680
we have since ported all of that code
and make all of the fixes in the sport

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:13.690
and make all of the fixes in the sport
 

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.200
and make all of the fixes in the sport
library and we have now deprecated

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.210
library and we have now deprecated
 

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.090
library and we have now deprecated
fragments in the core platform so don't

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:18.100
fragments in the core platform so don't
 

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.560
fragments in the core platform so don't
use them there use the support library

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:19.570
use them there use the support library
 

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.320
use them there use the support library
or now jetpack version of fragments we

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.330
or now jetpack version of fragments we
 

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.690
or now jetpack version of fragments we
are putting more goodness there so use

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:24.700
are putting more goodness there so use
 

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.200
are putting more goodness there so use
those and also we are making continuing

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.210
those and also we are making continuing
 

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.700
those and also we are making continuing
to make improvements there's a talk on

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:29.710
to make improvements there's a talk on
 

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.010
to make improvements there's a talk on
fragments this week tomorrow by Adam and

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:32.020
fragments this week tomorrow by Adam and
 

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.010
fragments this week tomorrow by Adam and
Ian tomorrow so please check that out to

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.020
Ian tomorrow so please check that out to
 

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.810
Ian tomorrow so please check that out to
hear more information about things that

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:36.820
hear more information about things that
 

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.030
hear more information about things that
we are doing as well as ways to use

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.040
we are doing as well as ways to use
 

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.320
we are doing as well as ways to use
fragments which should be a little bit

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.330
fragments which should be a little bit
 

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.170
fragments which should be a little bit
easier a major

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:41.180
easier a major
 

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.000
easier a major
one of those is the new navigation

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.010
one of those is the new navigation
 

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.250
one of those is the new navigation
controller so check that out it sort of

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:45.260
controller so check that out it sort of
 

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.990
controller so check that out it sort of
builds on fragments that doesn't depend

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000
builds on fragments that doesn't depend
 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.970
builds on fragments that doesn't depend
on them there is no dependency but it

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:48.980
on them there is no dependency but it
 

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.740
on them there is no dependency but it
does build on those capabilities for

creating and navigating between the
 

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.780
creating and navigating between the
screens of your application activities

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:55.790
screens of your application activities
 

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.570
screens of your application activities
very closely related to fragments in the

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:58.580
very closely related to fragments in the
 

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.510
very closely related to fragments in the
old days basically Android applications

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:00.520
old days basically Android applications
 

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.770
old days basically Android applications
consisted of multiple activities that

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:02.780
consisted of multiple activities that
 

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.980
consisted of multiple activities that
was the application flow for all Android

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:05.990
was the application flow for all Android
 

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.080
was the application flow for all Android
applications we expected developers to

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.090
applications we expected developers to
 

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.480
applications we expected developers to
do this and developers did this when you

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:10.490
do this and developers did this when you
 

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.610
do this and developers did this when you
want to go from one sort of screen of

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:12.620
want to go from one sort of screen of
 

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.010
want to go from one sort of screen of
your app to another one you launch an

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:15.020
your app to another one you launch an
 

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.990
your app to another one you launch an
intent you get a new window there you

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000
intent you get a new window there you
 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.730
intent you get a new window there you
have some window animation to get you

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:18.740
have some window animation to get you
 

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.300
have some window animation to get you
there and there you are the new approach

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:22.310
there and there you are the new approach
 

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.210
there and there you are the new approach
is use single activities when you can it

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:25.220
is use single activities when you can it
 

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.320
is use single activities when you can it
turns out that's a much richer

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:26.330
turns out that's a much richer
 

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.290
turns out that's a much richer
experience for the user those window

experience for the user those window
 

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.060
experience for the user those window
animations they're well they're

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.070
animations they're well they're
 

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.680
animations they're well they're
animating but they're not doing anything

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:32.690
animating but they're not doing anything
 

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.150
animating but they're not doing anything
interesting they're not doing anything

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.160
interesting they're not doing anything
 

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.250
interesting they're not doing anything

Dianne Hackborn posted this on G+ we
usually get this question from

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:47.330
usually get this question from
 

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.180
usually get this question from
application developers where they will

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:49.190
application developers where they will
 

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.340
application developers where they will
ask us what application architecture

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:51.350
ask us what application architecture
 

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.420
ask us what application architecture
they should use in their application

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:53.430
they should use in their application
 

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.240
they should use in their application
and our answer is always we don't care

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.250
and our answer is always we don't care
 

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.670
and our answer is always we don't care
we are not you we don't know how your

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:58.680
we are not you we don't know how your
 

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.200
we are not you we don't know how your
application works we don't know the best

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.210
application works we don't know the best
 

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.360
application works we don't know the best
architecture for your application so

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:02.370
architecture for your application so
 

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.250
architecture for your application so
please make your own decision and then

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260
please make your own decision and then
 

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.930
please make your own decision and then
there's usually a follow-up question of

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940
there's usually a follow-up question of

there's usually a follow-up question of
yeah yeah I get that but which

yeah yeah I get that but which
architecture should I use so Diane

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:11.790

and for all we do not care the

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:15.780
and for all we do not care the
 

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.740

around which you build your application

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:25.950
around which you build your application
 

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.680
around which you build your application
so please build the one that's

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:27.690
so please build the one that's

advice that makes sense and we believe
 

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.300
advice that makes sense and we believe
that we have that now specifically with

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.310
that we have that now specifically with
 

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.070
that we have that now specifically with
the architecture components we think

that we have an approach that makes a

that we have an approach that makes a
lot of sense

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:45.030
lot of sense
 

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.700
lot of sense
we have api's that are easy to use and

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:46.710
we have api's that are easy to use and
 

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.470
we have api's that are easy to use and
you can build around those we are not

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480
you can build around those we are not
 

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.810
you can build around those we are not
demanding that you use this please use

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820
demanding that you use this please use
 

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.400
demanding that you use this please use
the architecture that makes sense to you

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.410
the architecture that makes sense to you
 

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.410
the architecture that makes sense to you
but we do have a core architecture that

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:54.420
but we do have a core architecture that
 

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.150
but we do have a core architecture that
we believe should work if you're

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.160
we believe should work if you're
 

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.650
we believe should work if you're
starting a new application if you have

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:57.660
starting a new application if you have
 

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.090
starting a new application if you have
new developers on your team it makes

00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100
new developers on your team it makes
 

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.750
new developers on your team it makes
sense one of the reasons that we worked

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760
sense one of the reasons that we worked
 

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.210
sense one of the reasons that we worked
with Android architecture components was

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220
with Android architecture components was
 

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.620
with Android architecture components was
to solve hard problems one of the

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:06.630
to solve hard problems one of the
 

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.050
to solve hard problems one of the
hardest problems was Android lifecycle

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:09.060
hardest problems was Android lifecycle
 

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.450
hardest problems was Android lifecycle
and our answer was all you need to do is

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460
and our answer was all you need to do is
 

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.940
and our answer was all you need to do is
understand this diagram and memorize it

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:13.950
understand this diagram and memorize it
 

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:17.540
understand this diagram and memorize it
and someone externally did their own

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:17.550
and someone externally did their own
 

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.100
and someone externally did their own
version that diagram which looks like

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.110
version that diagram which looks like
 

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.230
version that diagram which looks like
this which is actually a lot easier to

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240
this which is actually a lot easier to
 

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.080
this which is actually a lot easier to
understand if you look at it like this

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.090
understand if you look at it like this
 

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.670
understand if you look at it like this
so that's basically everything you need

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:25.680
so that's basically everything you need
 

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.140
so that's basically everything you need
to know and keep in your head at all

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.150
to know and keep in your head at all
 

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.960
to know and keep in your head at all
times so the problem would be you would

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:29.970
times so the problem would be you would
 

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.580
times so the problem would be you would
basically create a bunch of methods in

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:31.590
basically create a bunch of methods in
 

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.930
basically create a bunch of methods in
your activity so that you could track

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940
your activity so that you could track
 

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.730
your activity so that you could track
and manage lifecycle you're handling

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740
and manage lifecycle you're handling
 

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.470
and manage lifecycle you're handling
creation and starting and stopping and

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480
creation and starting and stopping and
 

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.060
creation and starting and stopping and
resuming and pausing and you're probably

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.070
resuming and pausing and you're probably
 

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.220
resuming and pausing and you're probably
doing stuff in destroy as well you're

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.230
doing stuff in destroy as well you're
 

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.170
doing stuff in destroy as well you're
probably doing too much in oncreate

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:42.180
probably doing too much in oncreate
 

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.240
probably doing too much in oncreate
you're probably having race conditions

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:44.250
you're probably having race conditions
 

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.890
you're probably having race conditions
as well as the leaks and you're starting

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:45.900
as well as the leaks and you're starting
 

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.150
as well as the leaks and you're starting
your stop and you're probably doing that

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.160
your stop and you're probably doing that
 

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.770
your stop and you're probably doing that
in the pause and resume as well and

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:48.780
in the pause and resume as well and
 

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.720
in the pause and resume as well and
you're not exactly sure why you're

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:50.730
you're not exactly sure why you're
 

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.310
you're not exactly sure why you're
overriding on destroy but someone told

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320
overriding on destroy but someone told
 

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.810
overriding on destroy but someone told
you you probably should so we'll do that

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820
you you probably should so we'll do that
 

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.740
you you probably should so we'll do that
as well so in the meantime you actually

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:57.750
as well so in the meantime you actually
 

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.630
as well so in the meantime you actually
only know the lifecycle State if you

00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640
only know the lifecycle State if you
 

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.370
only know the lifecycle State if you
override those methods we didn't give

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380
override those methods we didn't give
 

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.930
override those methods we didn't give
you a way to query that we know what it

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940
you a way to query that we know what it
 

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.820
you a way to query that we know what it
is internally we're just not letting you

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:04.830
is internally we're just not letting you
 

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.510
is internally we're just not letting you
in on the sea

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520
in on the sea
 

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.730
in on the sea
all right so there is no API for you to

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740
all right so there is no API for you to
 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.230
all right so there is no API for you to
query so you need to override all those

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240
query so you need to override all those
 

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.670
query so you need to override all those
methods and then you end up chucking too

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:10.680
methods and then you end up chucking too
 

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.130
methods and then you end up chucking too
much code in there so too much logic

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140
much code in there so too much logic
 

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.870
much code in there so too much logic
basically happening everywhere the new

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880
basically happening everywhere the new
 

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.670
basically happening everywhere the new
approach is we have an object called a

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:16.680
approach is we have an object called a
 

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.650
approach is we have an object called a
lifecycle owner you can ask it for a

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:18.660
lifecycle owner you can ask it for a
 

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.450
lifecycle owner you can ask it for a
lifecycle object and then you can either

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:20.460
lifecycle object and then you can either
 

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.250
lifecycle object and then you can either
query the state if you want to know what

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260
query the state if you want to know what
 

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.740
query the state if you want to know what
state a lifecycle you're in or you can

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:24.750
state a lifecycle you're in or you can
 

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.420
state a lifecycle you're in or you can
set an observer on it and then you can

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:26.430
set an observer on it and then you can
 

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.130
set an observer on it and then you can
get callbacks into this methods this

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140
get callbacks into this methods this
 

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.570
get callbacks into this methods this
allows you to abstract it into a

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580
allows you to abstract it into a
 

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.920
allows you to abstract it into a
separate place so you're not basically

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:30.930
separate place so you're not basically
 

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.110
separate place so you're not basically
bogging down activity code with all this

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120
bogging down activity code with all this
 

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.850
bogging down activity code with all this
information but you're putting it where

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860
information but you're putting it where
 

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.530
information but you're putting it where
it makes sense in your application

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:36.540
it makes sense in your application
 

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.740
it makes sense in your application
fortunately we override we subclass

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:39.750
fortunately we override we subclass
 

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.810
fortunately we override we subclass
lifecycle own or implement that in both

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820
lifecycle own or implement that in both
 

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.120
lifecycle own or implement that in both
fragment and app compat activities so in

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.130
fragment and app compat activities so in
 

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.950
fragment and app compat activities so in
the support library please use these

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960
the support library please use these
 

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.260
the support library please use these
those are lifecycle owners so basically

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:48.270
those are lifecycle owners so basically
 

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.940
those are lifecycle owners so basically
you can query them to get the lifecycle

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:49.950
you can query them to get the lifecycle
 

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.310
you can query them to get the lifecycle
and then go from there so we went from a

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320
and then go from there so we went from a
 

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.990
and then go from there so we went from a
model where you would have activity with

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000
model where you would have activity with
 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.760
model where you would have activity with
basically all of this lifecycle

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:55.770
basically all of this lifecycle
 

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.800
basically all of this lifecycle
dependent logic in it to a model where

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:57.810
dependent logic in it to a model where
 

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.420
dependent logic in it to a model where
the activity can be much smaller take

00:32:59.420 --> 00:32:59.430
the activity can be much smaller take
 

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.490
the activity can be much smaller take
that logic out abstract it into this

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500
that logic out abstract it into this
 

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.200
that logic out abstract it into this
over the thing over there set a

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.210
over the thing over there set a
 

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:04.670
over the thing over there set a
lifecycle observer on it and get the

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:04.680
lifecycle observer on it and get the
 

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.290
lifecycle observer on it and get the
callbacks you want we have a similar

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:06.300
callbacks you want we have a similar
 

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.630
callbacks you want we have a similar
problem going on with views and data we

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640
problem going on with views and data we
 

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.950
problem going on with views and data we
have an activity and then we have all

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960
have an activity and then we have all
 

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.390
have an activity and then we have all
this information about the views in

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:11.400
this information about the views in
 

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.430
this information about the views in
there and then we have the data for the

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440
there and then we have the data for the
 

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.720
there and then we have the data for the
views and we need to know when the data

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:14.730
views and we need to know when the data
 

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.490
views and we need to know when the data
changes and we need to also track the

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500
changes and we need to also track the
 

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.260
changes and we need to also track the
lifecycle so we don't leak things or

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:18.270
lifecycle so we don't leak things or
 

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.360
lifecycle so we don't leak things or
call things at the wrong time so we just

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.370
call things at the wrong time so we just
 

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.310
call things at the wrong time so we just
end up having too much stuff there well

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320
end up having too much stuff there well
 

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.800
end up having too much stuff there well
now you have this concept of a live data

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:24.810
now you have this concept of a live data
 

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.450
now you have this concept of a live data
and a view model where you can put that

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460
and a view model where you can put that
 

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.820
and a view model where you can put that
stuff you can abstract it out of the

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:28.830
stuff you can abstract it out of the
 

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.920
stuff you can abstract it out of the
activity so you can put all that

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:30.930
activity so you can put all that
 

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.780
activity so you can put all that
information out there observe that stuff

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:32.790
information out there observe that stuff
 

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.490
information out there observe that stuff
so now in the activity you should really

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500
so now in the activity you should really
 

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.860
so now in the activity you should really
have only information about views and a

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:36.870
have only information about views and a
 

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.870
have only information about views and a
reference to the view model and then put

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880
reference to the view model and then put
 

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.400
reference to the view model and then put
all of that logic in the view model it's

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:40.410
all of that logic in the view model it's
 

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.140
all of that logic in the view model it's
using live data objects its handling

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:42.150
using live data objects its handling
 

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.330
using live data objects its handling
lifecycle on its own and you can observe

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340
lifecycle on its own and you can observe
 

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.810
lifecycle on its own and you can observe
it way better way less buggy for data

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820
it way better way less buggy for data
 

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:53.340
it way better way less buggy for data
our approach our our argument to you was

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:53.350
our approach our our argument to you was
 

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:57.660
our approach our our argument to you was
kind of well you you're on your own we

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:57.670
kind of well you you're on your own we
 

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.980
kind of well you you're on your own we
don't we don't manage your data do

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:58.990
don't we don't manage your data do
 

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.420
don't we don't manage your data do
whatever you want and there are lots of

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:00.430
whatever you want and there are lots of
 

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.860
whatever you want and there are lots of
database solutions out there we have

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:01.870
database solutions out there we have
 

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.660
database solutions out there we have
sequel light in the platform go ahead

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:03.670
sequel light in the platform go ahead
 

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.820
sequel light in the platform go ahead
and use it knock yourself out whatever

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:05.830
and use it knock yourself out whatever
 

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.470
and use it knock yourself out whatever
weird that we don't want to get into

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480
weird that we don't want to get into
 

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.600
weird that we don't want to get into
that business the new approach is we

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:09.610
that business the new approach is we
 

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.250
that business the new approach is we
actually do offer something for data it

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:11.260
actually do offer something for data it
 

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.260
actually do offer something for data it
built on top of sequel Lite but it

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.270
built on top of sequel Lite but it
 

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.440
built on top of sequel Lite but it
actually offers build time verification

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:16.450
actually offers build time verification
 

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.600
actually offers build time verification
so you're not just sending these queries

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:18.610
so you're not just sending these queries
 

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.460
so you're not just sending these queries
down and then getting errors at runtime

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:20.470
down and then getting errors at runtime
 

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:22.350
down and then getting errors at runtime
but you can see this problem at build

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:22.360
but you can see this problem at build
 

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.060
but you can see this problem at build
time and integration with the live data

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.070
time and integration with the live data
 

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.810
time and integration with the live data
stuff that we saw earlier or you can be

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:27.820
stuff that we saw earlier or you can be
 

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.940
stuff that we saw earlier or you can be
on your own if you if you want to we're

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:29.950
on your own if you if you want to we're
 

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:31.440
on your own if you if you want to we're
not trying to take over your database

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:31.450
not trying to take over your database
 

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.500
not trying to take over your database
solution we're simply offering a better

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.510
solution we're simply offering a better
 

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.880
solution we're simply offering a better
local persistence story than we had

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:35.890
local persistence story than we had
 

00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.860
local persistence story than we had
previously to make it easier for you the

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:37.870
previously to make it easier for you the
 

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.750
previously to make it easier for you the
overall diagram looks like this the only

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760
overall diagram looks like this the only
 

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.669
overall diagram looks like this the only
new element here is this idea of

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679
new element here is this idea of
 

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.740
new element here is this idea of
repository it's a pattern for basically

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:43.750
repository it's a pattern for basically
 

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.960
repository it's a pattern for basically
abstracting for where the data comes

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:45.970
abstracting for where the data comes
 

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.650
abstracting for where the data comes
from so if it comes from local or web

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:48.660
from so if it comes from local or web
 

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.610
from so if it comes from local or web
shouldn't matter to the rest of the

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:50.620
shouldn't matter to the rest of the
 

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.990
shouldn't matter to the rest of the
people that are querying it so it's kind

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000
people that are querying it so it's kind
 

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.780
people that are querying it so it's kind
of nice to have an abstraction their

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:53.790
of nice to have an abstraction their
 

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.440
of nice to have an abstraction their
data paging so we had this thing called

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:58.450
data paging so we had this thing called
 

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.660
data paging so we had this thing called
cursor adapter it had some good elements

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:00.670
cursor adapter it had some good elements
 

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.130
cursor adapter it had some good elements
about it it did have support for a

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.140
about it it did have support for a
 

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.060
about it it did have support for a
database cursor that's nice but it was

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.070
database cursor that's nice but it was
 

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.040
database cursor that's nice but it was
specific to ListView and had basically

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.050
specific to ListView and had basically
 

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.580
specific to ListView and had basically
other problems with in efficiencies

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:10.590
other problems with in efficiencies
 

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.900
other problems with in efficiencies
paging sizes stuff like that

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:12.910
