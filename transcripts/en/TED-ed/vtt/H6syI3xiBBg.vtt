00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.533
Once upon a time

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.509
in the magical and very round Land of Pi,

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.132
there lived six swashbuckling musketeers.

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:24.135
There names were Parentheses,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:25.016
Exponents,

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:25.983
Multiplication,

00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:26.562
Division,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:27.097
Addition,

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:28.212
and Subtraction.

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:32.220
But each was known best by his or her mark:

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.015
the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses,

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.181
the small and raised digits of Exponents,

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:40.623
the mighty X of Multiplication,

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:41.592
slash of Division,

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:42.801
plus of Addition,

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.886
and, well, you can guess the symbol

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:48.643
by which little Subtraction was best known.

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:52.279
The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place,

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:54.386
and that's why the numbers of the kingdom

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.845
needed the musketeers.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.649
The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.500
as anarcho-syndicalist commune,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049
each number with a vote,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.894
but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate,

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:09.907
engineered a war between some robot things

00:01:09.907 --> 00:01:11.588
and the knights of the kingdom,

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:14.695
and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor,

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:17.887
and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him,

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:19.740
and a princess or two,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.474
and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually.

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:27.025
It was kind of a big day.

00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:30.134
Anyway, the musketeers were called to action

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:33.761
to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon.

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.644
They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked.

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:38.839
First Multiplication,

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:40.139
then Parentheses,

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:42.081
but that didn't work.

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.805
The dragon continued eating people.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.932
So Addition tried, but was thrown aside.

00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:50.019
Exponents leaped at the beast

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.247
and was quickly squashed.

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:54.799
Nothing was working.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.964
The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:00.016
They would attack in sequence,

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.189
but who should go first?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.150
They bickered for a while,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.455
the dragon ate a few more princesses,

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:09.125
and then they finally agreed.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.959
They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.062
inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon.

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.478
Parentheses pointed out where to work first

00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:20.324
and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division,

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.040
Addition, and Subtraction

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.448
while they diced and sliced.

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:25.359
First here,

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.314
then, move over there,

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.269
then there.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.167
Look out! There's another set!

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.324
Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead.

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:36.746
Then, it was Multiplication, Division,

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:39.604
Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn,

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:41.887
always the same order.

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:45.185
P-E-M-D-A-S

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.865
When they finished that set, they went to another,

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:48.582
and another,

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:53.316
always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order.

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:56.449
Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.040
PEMDAS, there is another spot!

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.347
Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses.

00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:04.471
There's one!

00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:06.354
And that tricky exponent.

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:07.908
There we go!

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:11.674
Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:14.971
down to his last fearsome roar.

00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:18.088
But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon,

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:23.757
all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one,

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:28.631
and they all lived happily ever after.

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.108
Except for the Emperor Number,

00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:31.215
which they threw into the mouth

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:33.550
of an ancient nesting creature in the desert.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.801
The End.
