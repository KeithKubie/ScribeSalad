00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So according to Newton's third law, forces always exists in equal and opposite pairs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So that means as the earth pulls the skydiver down, the skydiver also pulls the earth up.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We know that a skydiver moves down as she falls, but my question is,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
"By how much does the earth move up during the 10-minute skydive?"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To answer this question, let's assume our skydiver has a mass of 65 kg

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the earth has a mass of 6x10²⁴ kg.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now here I have used scientific notation and if you're not familiar with what this means

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you should check out the link below this video to learn more about it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not too hard. Basically, it means that this is a 6 followed by 24 zeros.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Use your knowledge of Newton's third law of motion and these numbers to answer this question.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Enter your answer in scientific notation

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
by putting your base number here and the exponent up in this box.
