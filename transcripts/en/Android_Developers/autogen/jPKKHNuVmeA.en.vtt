the typical way of line user interacts
with your application is by navigating

accessibility actions and it's those

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560
accessibility actions and it's those
 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.280
accessibility actions and it's those
actions that actually perform perform

actions that actually perform perform
 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.260
actions that actually perform perform
user actions and this actually makes for

much about it
 

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.570
much about it
so as Raman mentioned if you use

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580
so as Raman mentioned if you use
 

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.180
so as Raman mentioned if you use
standard widgets things just work so

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.190
standard widgets things just work so
 

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.130

we're gonna turn on talkback first so

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140
we're gonna turn on talkback first so
 

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.519
we're gonna turn on talkback first so
we're going to elapse settings and down

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:37.529
we're going to elapse settings and down
 

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.310
we're going to elapse settings and down
here at the bottom we have accessibility

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320
here at the bottom we have accessibility
 

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.649
here at the bottom we have accessibility
and one of the services is talkback so

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659
and one of the services is talkback so
 

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.110
and one of the services is talkback so
we'll turn that on there's a switch up

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120
we'll turn that on there's a switch up

so this dialog pops up explaining that
 

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.230
so this dialog pops up explaining that
talkback sees basically everything that

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240
talkback sees basically everything that
 

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.050

talkback can interact with things the
 

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.760
talkback can interact with things the
way that a user would so as as talkback

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:07.770
way that a user would so as as talkback
 

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.949

this represents the accessibility focus

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660
this represents the accessibility focus
 

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.870
this represents the accessibility focus
so as Robin mentioned accessibility

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880
so as Robin mentioned accessibility
 

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.579
so as Robin mentioned accessibility
focus works just like system focus

00:09:19.579 --> 00:09:19.589
focus works just like system focus
 

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:21.440

there's also the concept of navigation

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240
there's also the concept of navigation
 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.630
there's also the concept of navigation
in a linear way so Allen can use a

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640
in a linear way so Allen can use a
 

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.579
in a linear way so Allen can use a
gesture from swiping left to right or

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:49.589
gesture from swiping left to right or
 

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.800
gesture from swiping left to right or
top to bottom to move focus through the

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:51.810
top to bottom to move focus through the
 

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.960
top to bottom to move focus through the
user interface so we'll move out to the

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:53.970
user interface so we'll move out to the
 

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.430
user interface so we'll move out to the
launch where it's a little bit more

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440
launch where it's a little bit more
 

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.530

use gestures to navigate linearly

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440
use gestures to navigate linearly
 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.920
use gestures to navigate linearly
through the UI gentlemen we've also

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:29.930
through the UI gentlemen we've also
 

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.930
through the UI gentlemen we've also
added gestures associated with that

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:31.940
added gestures associated with that
 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.420
added gestures associated with that
accessibility actions so for example how

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.430
accessibility actions so for example how
 

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.940
accessibility actions so for example how
one can do a two part swipe up and then

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:36.950
one can do a two part swipe up and then
 

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.560
one can do a two part swipe up and then
right and that will perform the system

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.570
right and that will perform the system
 

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.090
right and that will perform the system
action of pulling down the notification

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:40.100
action of pulling down the notification
 

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:51.790
action of pulling down the notification
shade so I'll just go right and then

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800
shade so I'll just go right and then
 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.710
shade so I'll just go right and then
swipe down and left and that will

dismiss the notification as if he
 

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.120
dismiss the notification as if he
pressed the back button so I'll do down

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.130
pressed the back button so I'll do down
 

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.070
pressed the back button so I'll do down
and left to do a back action so we have

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.080
and left to do a back action so we have
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.150
and left to do a back action so we have
a couple other system gestures as well

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160
a couple other system gestures as well
 

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.670
a couple other system gestures as well
so and what's also worth mentioning is

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680
so and what's also worth mentioning is
 

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.030
so and what's also worth mentioning is

one of these events can interrogate the

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:16.700
one of these events can interrogate the
 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.880
one of these events can interrogate the
view hierarchy so talkback for example

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:18.890
view hierarchy so talkback for example
 

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.440
view hierarchy so talkback for example
can deep dive into the views your

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.450
can deep dive into the views your
 

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.690
can deep dive into the views your
application presents and get get more

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:22.700
application presents and get get more
 

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.460
application presents and get get more
information about them well such as

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.470
information about them well such as
 

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.240
information about them well such as
whether a button is clickable a view is

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.250
whether a button is clickable a view is
 

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.690
whether a button is clickable a view is
checkable and so forth so this is used

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.700
checkable and so forth so this is used
 

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.290
checkable and so forth so this is used
throughout talkback

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300
throughout talkback
 

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.480
throughout talkback
so now we're actually going to cover the

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:35.490
so now we're actually going to cover the
 

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.130
so now we're actually going to cover the
top three problems that we see most

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.140
top three problems that we see most
 

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.079
top three problems that we see most
often in third-party developer

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:39.089
often in third-party developer
 

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:42.350
often in third-party developer
applications we have a sample app which

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360
applications we have a sample app which
 

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.540
applications we have a sample app which
we're going to use to sort of get into

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:44.550
we're going to use to sort of get into
 

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.519
we're going to use to sort of get into
these issues and illustrate them for you

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:48.529
 

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:56.090
and I'll double tap to launch that okay

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100
and I'll double tap to launch that okay
 

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.950
and I'll double tap to launch that okay
and so Casey's going to take us through

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:57.960
and so Casey's going to take us through
 

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.260
and so Casey's going to take us through
the inaccessible content descriptions

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.270
the inaccessible content descriptions
 

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.510
the inaccessible content descriptions
app so this is a very common mistake

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:02.520
app so this is a very common mistake
 

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.550
app so this is a very common mistake
that we see actually Casey we're getting

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560
that we see actually Casey we're getting
 

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.140
that we see actually Casey we're getting
a little Russell from your mic could you

run it up the outside of your shirt sure
all right so I'll just take us through

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140
all right so I'll just take us through
 

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.070
all right so I'll just take us through
the inaccessible version of the content

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.080

the same unlabeled images here so let's
 

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.210
the same unlabeled images here so let's
take a step back and look at some of the

a lot of developers are going to be

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:09.450
a lot of developers are going to be
 

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.210
a lot of developers are going to be
developing for let's say Gingerbread or

so each of these buttons is also set to

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:20.700
so each of these buttons is also set to
 

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.170
so each of these buttons is also set to
be Android focusable equals true which

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180
be Android focusable equals true which
 

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.910
be Android focusable equals true which
means if a user has a keyboard and they

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920
means if a user has a keyboard and they
 

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.190
means if a user has a keyboard and they
start pressing down or right they'll

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:28.200
start pressing down or right they'll
 

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.770

icon buttons and image buttons are going
 

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.050
icon buttons and image buttons are going
to have this set by default but if you

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060
to have this set by default but if you
 

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.310
to have this set by default but if you
use an image view you'll have to

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320
use an image view you'll have to
 

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.590
use an image view you'll have to
explicitly say this image view should be

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600
explicitly say this image view should be
 

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:49.460
explicitly say this image view should be
able to receive keyboard focus all right

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:49.470
able to receive keyboard focus all right
 

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.260

so let's move on to one of the next

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.270
so let's move on to one of the next
 

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.990
so let's move on to one of the next
things which is grouping and ordering of

the application action bar will speak
 

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.210
the application action bar will speak
because it's a standard Android action

fixed this we have api's on jellybean

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.040
fixed this we have api's on jellybean
 

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.799
fixed this we have api's on jellybean
that allow for developers to use custom

I've implemented this node provider this

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520
I've implemented this node provider this
 

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.580
I've implemented this node provider this
new jellybean API that allows us to

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:36.590
new jellybean API that allows us to
 

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.200
new jellybean API that allows us to
define regions and custom views for

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.210
define regions and custom views for
 

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:43.760
define regions and custom views for
things I can touch explore the content

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:43.770
 

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.980
I can also double tap to make things

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:45.990
I can also double tap to make things
 

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:53.810
I can also double tap to make things
happen and I can even do something like

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820
happen and I can even do something like
 

00:21:53.820 --> 00:22:00.950
happen and I can even do something like
long pressing so this is basically the

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960
long pressing so this is basically the
 

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.420
long pressing so this is basically the
mechanism and jellybean that allows

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:02.430
mechanism and jellybean that allows
 

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.700
mechanism and jellybean that allows
developers to make their entirely custom

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:04.710
developers to make their entirely custom
 

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.310
developers to make their entirely custom
drawing views accessible to the standard

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320
drawing views accessible to the standard
 

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.380
drawing views accessible to the standard
jellybean accessibility services so if

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:09.390
jellybean accessibility services so if
 

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.030
jellybean accessibility services so if
you're rendering something in OpenGL

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:11.040
you're rendering something in OpenGL
 

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.150
you're rendering something in OpenGL
which is great and pretty and fast you

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.160
which is great and pretty and fast you
 

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.100
which is great and pretty and fast you
can also make it totally accessible and

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.110
can also make it totally accessible and
 

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.750
can also make it totally accessible and
so this requires a little bit more work

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760
so this requires a little bit more work
 

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.090
so this requires a little bit more work
we've made this node provider helper

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100
we've made this node provider helper
 

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.730
we've made this node provider helper
class to make it a little bit easier but

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740
class to make it a little bit easier but
 

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.920
class to make it a little bit easier but
you can provide an entire view hierarchy

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:24.930
you can provide an entire view hierarchy
 

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.160
you can provide an entire view hierarchy
virtually that talkback and a user of

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.170
virtually that talkback and a user of
 

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.090
virtually that talkback and a user of
accessibility will be able to explore so

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100
accessibility will be able to explore so
 

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.470
accessibility will be able to explore so
actually I'd like to swipe through this

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480
actually I'd like to swipe through this
 

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.560
actually I'd like to swipe through this
too just to show when you implement the

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:36.570
too just to show when you implement the
 

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.810
too just to show when you implement the
node provider you sort of magically get

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820
node provider you sort of magically get
 

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.270
node provider you sort of magically get
a lot of extra features so I can swipe

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280
a lot of extra features so I can swipe
 

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.070
a lot of extra features so I can swipe
left and right through this and that

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080
left and right through this and that
 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.110
left and right through this and that
didn't take any extra effort just adding

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120
didn't take any extra effort just adding
 

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.210
didn't take any extra effort just adding
those those virtual nodes

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220
those those virtual nodes
 

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.460
those those virtual nodes
let's talk back manage swiping left and

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.470
let's talk back manage swiping left and
 

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.640
let's talk back manage swiping left and
right through the hierarchy so one thing

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:55.650
right through the hierarchy so one thing
 

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.450
right through the hierarchy so one thing
that we didn't mention earlier I'd like

00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460
that we didn't mention earlier I'd like
 

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:05.570
that we didn't mention earlier I'd like
to back out for a real quick so you'll

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580
to back out for a real quick so you'll
 

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.310
to back out for a real quick so you'll
notice that on this tablet everything is

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320
notice that on this tablet everything is
 

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.810
notice that on this tablet everything is
really small and for somebody with low

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820
really small and for somebody with low
 

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.910
really small and for somebody with low
vision they might find that things in

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:16.920
vision they might find that things in
 

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.410
vision they might find that things in
your app are a little difficult to see

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:18.420
your app are a little difficult to see
 

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:25.580
your app are a little difficult to see
so one way to get around that and I'll

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:25.590
so one way to get around that and I'll
 

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:31.190
so one way to get around that and I'll
pop in to accessibility settings is to

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200
pop in to accessibility settings is to
 

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.570
pop in to accessibility settings is to
turn on a feature called large text mode

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:34.580
turn on a feature called large text mode
 

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.250
turn on a feature called large text mode
so this is going to do exactly what you

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260
so this is going to do exactly what you
 

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:43.760
so this is going to do exactly what you
expect it to so for anybody on the

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:43.770
expect it to so for anybody on the
 

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.920
expect it to so for anybody on the
Hangout or for anybody watching in

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:46.930
Hangout or for anybody watching in
 

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.110
Hangout or for anybody watching in
and maybe low resolution you can

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120
and maybe low resolution you can
 

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.000
and maybe low resolution you can
hopefully read the text now it's a lot

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.010
hopefully read the text now it's a lot
 

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:56.940
hopefully read the text now it's a lot
bigger and one really easy mistake to

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:56.950
bigger and one really easy mistake to
 

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.980
bigger and one really easy mistake to
make is in your application when you're

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:58.990
make is in your application when you're
 

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.850
make is in your application when you're
setting your text sizes to use density

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:02.860
setting your text sizes to use density
 

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.650
setting your text sizes to use density
independent pixels dips instead of

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:04.660
independent pixels dips instead of
 

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.350
independent pixels dips instead of
scaled pixels so when you set text size

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360
scaled pixels so when you set text size
 

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.630
scaled pixels so when you set text size
if you use scaled pixels it respects the

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640
if you use scaled pixels it respects the
 

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.440
if you use scaled pixels it respects the
system's desired text size one thing

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:13.450
system's desired text size one thing
 

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.910
system's desired text size one thing
that this can be a problem for is if you

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:17.920
that this can be a problem for is if you
 

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.830
that this can be a problem for is if you
don't test your app with slightly larger

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840
don't test your app with slightly larger
 

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.810
don't test your app with slightly larger

internationalization of your apps it's
important to make sure that you're

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400
important to make sure that you're
 

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.140
important to make sure that you're
testing for this anyway so if you have a

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:33.150
testing for this anyway so if you have a
 

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.000
testing for this anyway so if you have a
string that shows up as a certain size

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.010
string that shows up as a certain size
 

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.120

in German it may end up being longer and
 

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.400
in German it may end up being longer and
with large fonts on it's going to be

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:41.410
with large fonts on it's going to be
 

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.040
with large fonts on it's going to be
longer as well as a little bit taller so

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.050
longer as well as a little bit taller so
 

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.150
longer as well as a little bit taller so
it's important to test your app with

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.160
it's important to test your app with
 

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.100
it's important to test your app with
that to make sure it works but generally

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.110
that to make sure it works but generally
 

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.930
that to make sure it works but generally
if you use scaled pixels instead of dips

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:48.940
if you use scaled pixels instead of dips
 

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.140
if you use scaled pixels instead of dips
this will just work so let's go into one

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.150
this will just work so let's go into one
 

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.790
this will just work so let's go into one
of the test apps real quick to see what

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:53.800
of the test apps real quick to see what
 

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.910
of the test apps real quick to see what
the difference so we'll pop into the

00:24:59.910 --> 00:24:59.920
the difference so we'll pop into the
 

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.410
the difference so we'll pop into the
inaccessible version of item grouping

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:03.420
inaccessible version of item grouping
 

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.640
inaccessible version of item grouping
and I'll see that the text size was

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:05.650
and I'll see that the text size was
 

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.170
and I'll see that the text size was
exactly the same what you're really

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.180
exactly the same what you're really
 

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.910
exactly the same what you're really
looking at here is the header it's the

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:08.920
looking at here is the header it's the
 

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.400
looking at here is the header it's the
same as it was previously because we've

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:11.410

actually constructed this view using
dips rather than scaled pixels if we go

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:16.750
dips rather than scaled pixels if we go

back out onto the fixed version you can
 

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.420
back out onto the fixed version you can
see that the header now is quite large

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:21.430

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:48.899
ask us often is there a way we can only
implement some accessibility features

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:48.909
implement some accessibility features
 

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.639
implement some accessibility features
and turn them on if accessibility itself

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:50.649
and turn them on if accessibility itself
 

00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:53.280
and turn them on if accessibility itself
is on and that's that's something that

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:53.290
is on and that's that's something that
 

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.230
is on and that's that's something that
you can do through the accessibility

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240
you can do through the accessibility
 

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.349
you can do through the accessibility
manager class there is a check to see if

00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359
manager class there is a check to see if
 

00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:59.400
manager class there is a check to see if
accessibility and accessibility services

00:34:59.400 --> 00:34:59.410
accessibility and accessibility services
 

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.190
accessibility and accessibility services
on and if Explorer metouch is enabled

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200
on and if Explorer metouch is enabled
 

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.230
on and if Explorer metouch is enabled
yeah so if you're using the

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240
yeah so if you're using the
 

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.620
yeah so if you're using the
accessibility helper class and you're

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:06.630
accessibility helper class and you're
 

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.849
accessibility helper class and you're
creating a virtual view hierarchy for

00:35:08.849 --> 00:35:08.859
creating a virtual view hierarchy for
 

00:35:08.859 --> 00:35:10.980
creating a virtual view hierarchy for
all of your nodes you can do this only

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:10.990
all of your nodes you can do this only
 

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.660
all of your nodes you can do this only
when accessibility is turned on and

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:12.670
when accessibility is turned on and
 

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.010
when accessibility is turned on and
that's really easy to check

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:14.020
that's really easy to check
 

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.810
that's really easy to check
that's accessibility manager dot is

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:15.820
that's accessibility manager dot is
 

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.849
that's accessibility manager dot is
enabled and is touch exploration enabled

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:17.859
enabled and is touch exploration enabled
 

00:35:17.859 --> 00:35:21.900
enabled and is touch exploration enabled
on newer devices newer api's in terms of

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:21.910
on newer devices newer api's in terms of
 

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.580
on newer devices newer api's in terms of
the performance hit that your

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:23.590
the performance hit that your
 

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.160
the performance hit that your
application takes as Raman to mention

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.170
application takes as Raman to mention
 

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.870
application takes as Raman to mention
there really is none and we care very

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880
there really is none and we care very
 

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.859
there really is none and we care very
deeply about performance I think tens of

00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:31.869
deeply about performance I think tens of
 

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:35.820
deeply about performance I think tens of
milliseconds is really pushing it as far

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:35.830
milliseconds is really pushing it as far
 

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.020
milliseconds is really pushing it as far
as the

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.030
as the
 

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.400
as the
performance hit that somebody has to

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:38.410
performance hit that somebody has to
 

00:35:38.410 --> 00:36:27.020
performance hit that somebody has to
deal with profiling and making sure I

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.030
 

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.520
also use my phone a lot I think I may

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:29.530
also use my phone a lot I think I may
 

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.410
also use my phone a lot I think I may
actually get worse battery time than

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:31.420
actually get worse battery time than
 

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.730
actually get worse battery time than
Raman because I have my screen

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:32.740
Raman because I have my screen
 

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.520
Raman because I have my screen
brightness set a lot higher so that I

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:35.530
brightness set a lot higher so that I
 

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.020
brightness set a lot higher so that I
think that's actually one of the most

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.030
think that's actually one of the most
 

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.510
think that's actually one of the most
interesting things is that while we are

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520
interesting things is that while we are
 

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.970
interesting things is that while we are
doing speech in the background we're

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:41.980
doing speech in the background we're
 

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.730
doing speech in the background we're
doing vibration in the background if the

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:44.740
doing vibration in the background if the
 

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.170
doing vibration in the background if the
user just turns their brightness down

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.180
user just turns their brightness down
 

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.150
user just turns their brightness down
they're probably going to save more

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160
they're probably going to save more
 

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.220
they're probably going to save more
battery than they're eating up from the

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.230
battery than they're eating up from the
 

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:59.760
battery than they're eating up from the
vibration the haptic feedback yeah so on

00:36:59.760 --> 00:36:59.770
vibration the haptic feedback yeah so on
 

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.860
vibration the haptic feedback yeah so on
an OLED device he's he's saving a lot of

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:01.870
an OLED device he's he's saving a lot of
 

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:10.500
an OLED device he's he's saving a lot of
battery on on screen brightness laptop

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:10.510
battery on on screen brightness laptop
 

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.650
battery on on screen brightness laptop
gives me about six six to eight hours so

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:13.660
gives me about six six to eight hours so
 

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:22.630
gives me about six six to eight hours so
good thing

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640
 

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:41.410
the other one was adjusting the voice

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:41.420
 

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.430
what's your advice for folks who want to

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440
what's your advice for folks who want to
 

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.200
what's your advice for folks who want to
try to support that be releases prior to

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.210
try to support that be releases prior to
 

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.930

Ice Cream Sandwich and four so um
actually the back view access was also

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760
actually the back view access was also
 

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.610

gmail team did and what they did was to

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.120
gmail team did and what they did was to
 

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.140
gmail team did and what they did was to
take the chromevox codebase so from box

accessibility is in evil and that option
 

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.430
accessibility is in evil and that option
is turned on it actually adds a little

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440
is turned on it actually adds a little
 

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.920
is turned on it actually adds a little

a way to change the voice parameters I
 

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:43.750
a way to change the voice parameters I
think he is referring to

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760
think he is referring to
 

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.180
think he is referring to

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:23.950
under it full-time and my job is to be
 

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.860
under it full-time and my job is to be
aware of these features run the

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:25.870
aware of these features run the
 

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.000
aware of these features run the
development crew in what we're doing

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:27.010
development crew in what we're doing
 

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.000
development crew in what we're doing
particularly interested in are like the

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.010
particularly interested in are like the
 

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.300
particularly interested in are like the
certification that goes around the

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:33.310
certification that goes around the
 

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.640
certification that goes around the
device so you implement the feature goes

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:35.650
device so you implement the feature goes
 

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.890
device so you implement the feature goes
to the carrier or the oh yeah they

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:37.900
to the carrier or the oh yeah they
 

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.070
to the carrier or the oh yeah they
implement the feature how do you when

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.080
implement the feature how do you when
 

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.580
implement the feature how do you when
you make them do to go to show that the

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:44.590
you make them do to go to show that the
 

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:54.360
you make them do to go to show that the
features working properly did you say

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:54.370
features working properly did you say
 

00:46:54.370 --> 00:47:03.030
features working properly did you say
CTS tests no that's fine

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040
CTS tests no that's fine
 

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.490
CTS tests no that's fine
I just haven't seen that that particular

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:05.500
I just haven't seen that that particular
 

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:17.520
I just haven't seen that that particular
test suite yet okay so you do have your

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:17.530
test suite yet okay so you do have your
 

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.840
test suite yet okay so you do have your
test suite out there I've got all the

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:18.850
test suite out there I've got all the
 

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.420
test suite out there I've got all the
code of course and and I'll just go

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.430
code of course and and I'll just go
 

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.950
code of course and and I'll just go
ahead and take a look look down in there

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960
ahead and take a look look down in there
 

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.290
ahead and take a look look down in there
and see what you do because one of the

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:25.300
and see what you do because one of the
 

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.170
and see what you do because one of the
things that I have to deal with too is

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180
things that I have to deal with too is
 

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.760
things that I have to deal with too is
when an arbitrary person writes an app

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:29.770
when an arbitrary person writes an app
 

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.890
when an arbitrary person writes an app
and they're using it I have to be able

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:31.900
and they're using it I have to be able
 

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.060
and they're using it I have to be able
to tell them whether or not they've done

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.070
to tell them whether or not they've done
 

00:47:33.070 --> 00:48:01.990
to tell them whether or not they've done
it right what you asked before

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000
 

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.640
okay perfect

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:04.650
okay perfect
 

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:06.410
okay perfect
those are very useful by the way I threw

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420
those are very useful by the way I threw
 

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.910
those are very useful by the way I threw
out the platform thank you so much for

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920
out the platform thank you so much for
 

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.140
out the platform thank you so much for
putting those out there that's uh it

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:12.150
putting those out there that's uh it
 

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.940
putting those out there that's uh it
allows it literally allows me to do my

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:13.950
allows it literally allows me to do my

oh absolutely the hard part I have is

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.290
oh absolutely the hard part I have is
 

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.230
oh absolutely the hard part I have is
getting through all the code I spend so

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240
getting through all the code I spend so
 

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.550
getting through all the code I spend so
much time just going through the code

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560
much time just going through the code
 

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.440
much time just going through the code
and making adjustments I wish I had more

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:24.450
and making adjustments I wish I had more
 

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.230
and making adjustments I wish I had more
time actually put back in in fact today

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240
time actually put back in in fact today
 

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.210

I just signed the contributor agreement

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220
I just signed the contributor agreement
 

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.230
I just signed the contributor agreement
for Google after all these years so

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240
for Google after all these years so
 

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.160
for Google after all these years so
hopefully you'll be seeing some things

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:34.170
hopefully you'll be seeing some things
 

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.460
hopefully you'll be seeing some things
but yeah it's it's a lot of code to go

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:37.470
but yeah it's it's a lot of code to go
 

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:51.859
but yeah it's it's a lot of code to go
through that's good I know I know well

00:48:51.859 --> 00:48:51.869
through that's good I know I know well
 

00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:53.500
through that's good I know I know well
part of the part of the challenge with

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:53.510
part of the part of the challenge with
 

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:57.730
part of the part of the challenge with
picking a contribution is to work on is

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:57.740
picking a contribution is to work on is
 

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.870
picking a contribution is to work on is
how do I not duplicate what's already

00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880
how do I not duplicate what's already
 

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.160
how do I not duplicate what's already
been done because I don't know what

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:01.170
been done because I don't know what
 

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.270

someone's doing at 2:00 in the morning

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280
someone's doing at 2:00 in the morning
 

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.890
someone's doing at 2:00 in the morning
you know no there isn't

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900
you know no there isn't
 

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:17.030
you know no there isn't
so that's part of doing a lot of virtual

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040
so that's part of doing a lot of virtual
 

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.839
so that's part of doing a lot of virtual
machine work right now and down and down

00:49:20.839 --> 00:49:20.849
machine work right now and down and down
 

00:49:20.849 --> 00:49:23.599
machine work right now and down and down
in the guts of dalvik right now and so

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:23.609
in the guts of dalvik right now and so
 

00:49:23.609 --> 00:49:26.809
in the guts of dalvik right now and so
what I'll be looking for is you'll have

00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819
what I'll be looking for is you'll have
 

00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:30.589
what I'll be looking for is you'll have
this virtual machine handle the talkback

00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599
this virtual machine handle the talkback
 

00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:32.359
this virtual machine handle the talkback
because you're dealing there's a native

00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:32.369
because you're dealing there's a native
 

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.670
because you're dealing there's a native
interface i/o this is actually a great

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680
interface i/o this is actually a great
 

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.890
interface i/o this is actually a great
time to mention that if you turn on

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:36.900
time to mention that if you turn on
 

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.829
time to mention that if you turn on
talkback on the emulator alright it just

00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839
talkback on the emulator alright it just
 

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:42.700
talkback on the emulator alright it just
works so the emulator has text speech

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:42.710
works so the emulator has text speech
 

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:47.780
works so the emulator has text speech
you may need to install talkback just

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:47.790
you may need to install talkback just
 

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.220
you may need to install talkback just
talkers talkback built into the emulator

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:49.230
talkers talkback built into the emulator
 

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.920
talkers talkback built into the emulator
now

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:49.930
now
 

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.000
now
you may need to install talkback

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.010
you may need to install talkback
 

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.220
you may need to install talkback

iceberg project site that we mentioned
 

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.630
iceberg project site that we mentioned
where the source code for talkback is

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640
where the source code for talkback is
 

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.920

that's a great way to test keyboard

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400
that's a great way to test keyboard
 

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.760
that's a great way to test keyboard
accessibility so you've got a desktop

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:09.770
accessibility so you've got a desktop
 

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.440
accessibility so you've got a desktop
with a keyboard you open up to the

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:11.450
with a keyboard you open up to the
 

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.420
with a keyboard you open up to the
emulator and you can use the arrow keys

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:13.430
emulator and you can use the arrow keys
 

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.310
emulator and you can use the arrow keys
to move through your application and

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:15.320
to move through your application and
 

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.570
to move through your application and
that works the same way that a hardware

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:16.580
that works the same way that a hardware
 

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.550
that works the same way that a hardware
keyboard key word would on that device

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:18.560
keyboard key word would on that device
 

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:30.250
keyboard key word would on that device
like the Droid and so when you move your

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:30.260
like the Droid and so when you move your

are doing touch explanation okay so what

00:50:42.099 --> 00:50:42.109
are doing touch explanation okay so what
 

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:44.770
are doing touch explanation okay so what
what part of the OS handles the event

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:44.780
what part of the OS handles the event
 

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.450
what part of the OS handles the event
the actual event is that that's done on

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:46.460
the actual event is that that's done on
 

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.130
the actual event is that that's done on
the main thread or are you passing it

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:48.140
the main thread or are you passing it
 

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:54.880
the main thread or are you passing it
off to some other service so I can I can

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:54.890
off to some other service so I can I can
 

00:50:54.890 --> 00:51:16.930
off to some other service so I can I can
go into a 30-minute explanation and you

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:16.940
go into a 30-minute explanation and you
 

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.760
go into a 30-minute explanation and you
can actually do touch expression using

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:18.770
can actually do touch expression using
 

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:24.840
can actually do touch expression using
the things it's actually pretty cool

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:24.850
 

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:27.099
I'll go down I'll go down look at the

I'll go down I'll go down look at the
 

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:28.450
I'll go down I'll go down look at the
code that'll probably answer my

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:28.460
code that'll probably answer my
 

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.770
code that'll probably answer my
