00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.769
So we see here in this table,

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.580
that for given "n's", when "n" is one,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.482
"f" of "n" is 12, when
"n" is 2, "f" of "n" is 5,

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.812
and when "n" is three, "f"
of "n" is negative two,

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:10.476
when "n" is four, "f"
of "n" is negative nine.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:12.681
And so one way to think about it is

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.445
this function "f" is defining a sequence

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:19.392
where the first term
of this sequence is 12.

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:22.712
The second term of this sequence is five.

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.939
The third term of this
sequence is negative two.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.097
The fourth term of the
sequence is negative nine.

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:30.514
And it goes on, and on, and on.

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:33.834
And you might notice that
it's a arithmetic sequence.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.411
We start with a 12, and
then the next term...

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.942
What have we done? We've subtracted seven.

00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:41.860
Now to go from the second
to the third term...

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.915
What do we do? We subtract seven.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.185
So each term is seven less
than the term before it.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.436
Now with that out of the
way, see if you can define

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:55.358
this function of "n." If you
can define it explicitly.

00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:57.958
So figure out a function definition.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.907
So I want to figure out
"f" of "n" is equal.

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:03.183
I want you to figure out
what this needs to be so that

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:05.249
if you input "n" here, it gives you

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:06.898
the appropriate "f" of "n."

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:10.195
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.679
It's going to be, we could think
of it as we're starting at,

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.815
The first term is going to be 12.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:21.115
But then, we are going to subtract seven.

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:23.941
And what are we going to subtract seven?

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.287
How many times are we
going to subtract seven?

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:28.608
So for the first term, we
subtract seven zero times.

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:29.745
And so we just get 12.

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.996
For the second term,
we subtract seven once.

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:37.925
For the third term, we subtract
seven twice. One, two times.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.657
For the fourth term, we
subtract seven three times.

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:44.373
So it looks like whatever term we're on,

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:47.345
we're subtracting seven "n" minus one,

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.433
we're subtracting seven
whatever term we're on,

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:52.520
that term minus one time.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.509
So it's "n" minus one times.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.028
And let's see if this actually works out.

00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:00.905
So "f" of one is going to
be 12 minus seven times

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.461
one minus one, that's a zero.

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.365
So that's all just going to be 12.

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:06.756
"f" of two is going to be 12 minus seven

00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:08.637
times two minus one.

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:12.236
So it's going to be 12
minus seven times one.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.442
We're just going to subtract seven once,

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:15.556
which is exactly the case.

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:17.785
We started at 12, we subtract seven once.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:20.641
"f" of three, you can keep testing this.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.660
12 minus, and we should have
to subtract seven twice.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.841
And we see three minus one, is two times.

00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.000
So we're going to
subtract seven two times.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.369
So this looks right on.

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.412
We've defined the function explicitly.

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:37.150
We've defined "f" explicitly
for this sequence.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.170
Let's do another example, here.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.535
So in this case, we have some function

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.579
definitions already here.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.204
So you have your sequence,

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.643
it's kind of viewed in this table.

00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:51.592
You could view it as the
first term is negative 100.

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.541
The next term is negative
50, next term is zero,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.143
next term is 50.

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:57.722
And it's very clear that this is

00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.022
also an arithmetic sequence.

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:04.022
We're starting at negative
100, and then, we're adding 50.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.747
And then we're adding 50,

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:10.437
and then we are adding 50.

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.118
So each term is 50 more
than the term before it.

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.184
And what I want you to
do is pause the video,

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:16.529
and think about which
of these definitions of

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.619
the function "f" are correct.

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.012
And it might be more than one.

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:23.542
Alright, so let's think about it.

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.212
So this definition right over here,

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:27.232
one way to think about it is by

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:30.186
saying I'm going to start at negative 100.

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:33.109
And I'm going to add
50, "n" minus one times.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.814
Does this make sense?

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:38.542
Well, for the first term,
if we start at negative 100,

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.260
we don't want to add 50 at all,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.884
we want to add 50 zero
times, and it works out.

00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:45.925
Because one minus one is going to be zero.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.154
So it checks out for "n" equals one.

00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:50.755
Let's see, for "n" equals two,
you start at negative 100,

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:55.144
I want to add 50 once.

00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:57.854
So this should be a one.

00:03:57.854 --> 00:03:59.880
Two minus one, yup, it's a one!

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.504
We're adding 50. Whatever this number is,

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.106
whatever "n" is, we're adding 50

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:07.310
one less that number of times.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.539
So for here, we're adding 50 twice.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.372
When "n" is four, we're
adding 50 three times.

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:14.253
And this one checks out.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.830
When "n" is four, we're adding 50,

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.989
four minus one, three times.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.844
Negative 100, plus 50 times three.

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:24.655
We're adding 50 three times, adding 50

00:04:24.655 --> 00:04:26.860
one, two, three times.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.413
Well that gives you
50. So I like this one.

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:32.038
Now let's see about this one over here.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:34.964
Negative 150 plus 50 "n."

00:04:35.994 --> 00:04:37.982
Alright, that's one way
of saying, so let's see

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:41.233
If "n" is equal to one,
it's going to be negative...

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.392
Actually, let me draw
a table for this one.

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:46.736
So if we have "n" and we have "f" of "n."

00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:49.336
This is going to be for this
character right over here.

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:54.336
So if "n" is one, it's going
to negative 150, plus 50.

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:59.493
Which is negative 100,
yup that checks out.

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:02.548
When "n" is two, we get negative 150,

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:07.354
plus 50 times two, which is going to be...

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:10.451
This is 100, and there's negative 150,

00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.138
this is going to be negative 50.

00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:15.179
When "n" is three, and
that checks out, of course.

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:18.792
When "n" is three, you get negative 150,

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:21.959
plus 50, times three,
which is equal to zero.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:22.911
This checks out.

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:24.513
This one over here is going to work.

00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:25.930
And you might say, "Well, hey,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.160
these formulas look different."

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.041
Well you can algebraically manipulate them

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:33.100
to see that they're the exact same thing.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.405
If you were to take this first one, it's

00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:38.189
negative 100, plus,
let's distribute this 50,

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.926
plus 50 "n", plus 50 "n", minus 50.

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:49.966
Well, negative 100, minus
50, that's negative 150.

00:05:50.844 --> 00:05:52.399
And then you have plus 50 "n."

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.535
So these are algebraically the exact same

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:56.717
definition for our function.

00:05:56.717 --> 00:05:58.018
Now what about this one here?

00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:01.060
Negative 100 plus 50
"n", does this one work?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.475
Let's see, when "n" is equal to one,

00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:08.304
this would be negative 100
plus 50, which is negative 50.

00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:09.744
Well no, this doesn't work.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.230
We need to get a negative 100 here.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.527
So this one is not, not correct.
