00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:01.956
&gt;&gt;Guys, I know.

00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:03.066
Just take a deep breath, you guys.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.296
Give us a few minutes, okay?

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Justin, can you stop, please?

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.856
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having trouble
managing your classroom?

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.746
Here are some of our
favorite tricks of the trade.

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:15.766
&gt;&gt;Good morning, my brother.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.546
How are you?

00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:16.896
&gt;&gt;Great.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:17.686
&gt;&gt;What is Ohm's Law?

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:18.906
&gt;&gt;Oh, uh...

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.536
V equals I times R.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:25.976
&gt;&gt;Sweet. Sweet.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:27.506
Morning, my brother.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:29.096
Little Bobby!

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Darrell McClendon
reinforces lessons while making a

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:34.806
personal connection with
each student every day.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:37.156
&gt;&gt;Darrell: One, the kids have
to give me a firm handshake.

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:39.306
If they don't give me a firm
handshake and look me in the eye,

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.746
they have to go back to the end of
the line and start all over again.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:43.326
[Laughing] See ya!

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:44.046
See ya!

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:45.416
&gt;&gt;Darrell: It's a respect
kind of thing.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:47.856
What I normally do here is I ask
them a question about engineering,

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.026
and they can't come into my room

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:50.636
until can they answer
the question right.

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:54.146
And things that I'm asking them now
they learned three, four weeks ago.

00:00:54.146 --> 00:00:56.886
Most kids don't retain it, you know,
more than however long they need it

00:00:56.886 --> 00:01:00.236
for the test, but they know they
can't get into the room without it.

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:02.196
&gt;&gt;Oh, oh, I feel for you.

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:02.896
I feel for you.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.156
&gt;&gt;Darrell: I do it as a little
fun, and I do it as a review

00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:06.746
for the concepts, because
I try to teach them

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.326
that the engineering concepts
that we learn and we do

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:10.976
in the class aren't
all that difficult.

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.236
&gt;&gt;Power good morning.

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.076
&gt;&gt;P equals...

00:01:13.076 --> 00:01:13.886
&gt;&gt;No, I'm over here.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.516
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:18.706
&gt;&gt;Darrell: I firmly believe
that you've got to find some way

00:01:18.706 --> 00:01:20.626
to connect with the kids.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:21.506
&gt;&gt;The color is black.

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:22.746
What is the number?

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:23.686
&gt;&gt;Zero

00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:23.946
&gt;&gt;What?

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:24.826
&gt;&gt;Zero.

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:25.306
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:26.426
Say it with some authority.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.376
My sister, how are you?

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:29.306
&gt;&gt;Good.

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Share one of your tricks
with fellow teachers on Edutopia.
