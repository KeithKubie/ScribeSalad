00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640
the mark as read pending intent is then
 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.240
the mark as read pending intent is then
fired the user is given the choice to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250
fired the user is given the choice to
 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.790
fired the user is given the choice to
respond and have taken a transcription

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800
respond and have taken a transcription
 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.740
respond and have taken a transcription
of that response is set in that remote

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
of that response is set in that remote
 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.320
of that response is set in that remote
input the reply pending intent is then

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330
input the reply pending intent is then
 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.380
input the reply pending intent is then
fired and that's the entire Android auto

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390
fired and that's the entire Android auto
 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.090
fired and that's the entire Android auto
flow so let's see how we can put that

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
flow so let's see how we can put that
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.199
flow so let's see how we can put that
into code first the app needs to declare

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209
into code first the app needs to declare
 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.870
into code first the app needs to declare
support for Android auto to do that it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
support for Android auto to do that it
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.240
support for Android auto to do that it
needs to create a new XML file that's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
needs to create a new XML file that's
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.270
needs to create a new XML file that's
linked in the Android manifest

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
linked in the Android manifest
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.290
linked in the Android manifest
this XML file says that it has

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300
this XML file says that it has
 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.490
this XML file says that it has
notifications that Android auto should

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
notifications that Android auto should
 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.370
notifications that Android auto should
take a look at note that for messaging

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380
take a look at note that for messaging
 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.360
take a look at note that for messaging
apps that support SMS MMS or RCS this

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370
apps that support SMS MMS or RCS this
 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.350
apps that support SMS MMS or RCS this
uses SMS bit also needs to be added so

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360
uses SMS bit also needs to be added so
 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.150
uses SMS bit also needs to be added so
now Android auto is taking a look at our

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
now Android auto is taking a look at our
 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.520
now Android auto is taking a look at our
messages we can build up the messaging

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530
messages we can build up the messaging
 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.440
messages we can build up the messaging
style so we can't really have a

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450
style so we can't really have a
 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.750
style so we can't really have a
conversation without people so the first

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760
conversation without people so the first
 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.700
conversation without people so the first
person we have to add is the user of the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710
person we have to add is the user of the
 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.000
person we have to add is the user of the
device to do that we create this new

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010
device to do that we create this new
 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.730
device to do that we create this new
person object person is used to set

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740
person object person is used to set
 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.190
person object person is used to set
things like the user's name their icon

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200
things like the user's name their icon
 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.409
things like the user's name their icon
and a unique key in the event that

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419
and a unique key in the event that
 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.290
and a unique key in the event that
multiple people have the same name so we

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300
multiple people have the same name so we
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.110
multiple people have the same name so we
create this device user and we create

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120
create this device user and we create
 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.540
create this device user and we create
the messaging style with it we can then

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550
the messaging style with it we can then
 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.630
the messaging style with it we can then
add our conversation information so I'm

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640
add our conversation information so I'm
 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640
add our conversation information so I'm
from Seattle and I love skiing so I'm

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650

the messaging app needs to set it as

the messaging app needs to set it as
 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.830
the messaging app needs to set it as
such

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840
