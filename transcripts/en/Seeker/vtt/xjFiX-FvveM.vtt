00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.550
Teachers always have their favorite students.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.229
But when does this favoritism turn into bias?

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.309
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.470
Teachers are an important part of our learning
and development.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.320
I still remember every single one of my elementary
school teachers - the ones I thought were

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.980
good as well as the ones I thought were not
as good.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.170
But what did they think of me?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.170
Or you?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.630
How did that affect our learning?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.339
Well, a recent study, published in the Journal
Economics of Education Review, looked at data

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.160
from thousands of students across the US*
and their teachers to see where race and gender

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.730
fall into the equation.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.000
In the study, different teachers were asked
to rate the same 10th grade student and predict

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.800
his or her highest level of educational attainment.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.390
The researchers found that predictions varied
based on the gender and race of both the student

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.390
and teacher.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.730
In general, the expectations of black teachers
for black students were 30 to 40 percent higher

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.310
than those held by non-black teachers.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.530
In other words, they believed black students
would do far better.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.269
To illustrate, 37 percent of black teachers,
when asked about a black student, let’s

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.380
call her Samantha, thought she would obtain
a four year college degree.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.439
In contrast, only 28% of white teachers thought
she would do so.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.630
Now if she were a Samuel instead, this effect
would be even greater.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.640
White male teachers, in particular, have very
low expectations of black boys.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.770
They don’t believe they’ll do as well.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.060
The problem is… that what teachers believe
has a serious impact on student outcomes.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.259
We know from this and other studies that expectations
matter.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.799
In this particular study, the researchers
found black students who had a non-black teacher

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.729
in a specific subject in 10th grade were less
likely to pursue that subject later in their

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
schooling.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.149
But it’s more than just subject area preferences.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.159
It influences how well students do in school
and to some degree the quality of their education.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.499
In the infamous Pygmalion In The Classroom
study from the 1960s, researchers Rosenthal

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.039
and Jacobson conducted an experiment with
elementary children in public school.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.369
At the beginning of the school year, the researchers
gave all students an IQ test as a baseline.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.619
They then told teachers, erroneously, that
a certain subset of the those students would

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.430
show an “intellectual growth spurt” over
the course of that year.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.680
This was a lie.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800
In fact, the students were chosen at random.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.850
But, that suggestion to teachers had a measurable
effect: by the end of the year, the students

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.670
who were labeled as growth spurt students
actually did perform better than the rest

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.910
of their classmates.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.230
On average, they gained 3.8 IQ points more.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.180
And, these differences were even greater for
younger children.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.680
Looking at first grade students only, the
difference was 15.4 IQ points.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.360
This suggests that there is a sort of self-fulling
prophecy happening.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.370
Teachers who believe their students will do
well are more likely to act in ways that will

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.120
lead to that happening.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.900
Since the 60s, other studies have dug in to
try to figure out what exactly teachers might

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.470
doing that leads to bias.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.500
And, it looks like it could be things like
- giving children they believe are smart more

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.610
time to answer questions when called on, giving
them more challenging questions, or recommending

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.420
them for gifted and talented programs.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.670
Teacher expectations are powerful.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.790
So much so, that today, we largely consider
it unethical to label students the way we

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.190
did in the Pygmalion study.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.900
It wouldn’t be right to knowingly put some
students at a disadvantage.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.590
Which is why labels like race and gender are
so tricky in a classroom.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.090
These labels don’t require a researcher:
Teachers can automatically and involuntarily

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.540
apply them to students.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.090
So, it is especially important to grapple
with and examine the expectations attached

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.090
to them.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.460
it really is and what it means, check out
this episode on The Science of Racism.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:57.600
Did you have an experience where you felt
your teacher was biased against you?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.350
Or maybe favored you in some way?
