Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History and today we're going to make it rain.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.950
We're going to talk about money, the stuff
that makes the world go 'round. I'm not very

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.820
good at making it rain.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
MFTP: Mr. Green! Mr. Green. I'm sorry, but
money doesn't make the world go round. It's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.700
actually conservation of angular momentum.
It's the same thing that allows, like, figure

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.040
skaters to turn in circles.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.840
John: Look, me from the past. I know you came
in fourth for physics, among all "C" students

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.230
in the entire state of Alabama in the 1994
state academic decathlon tournament, but that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.440
doesn't actually make you good at science.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.050
[Intro]

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.050
So, here is what economic textbooks say about
money. In general it has three functions:

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.269
medium of exchange, unit of account, and store
of value. And its first function is by far

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:49.940
the most important.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.530
Like, this is a quote from my actual, physical
high school econ text book: "In primitive

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.229
economies, food might be traded for clothing,
or help in building a house might be exchanged

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.940
for help in clearing a field. But exchange
today in all economies -- market as well as

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.480
command -- takes place through the medium
of money."

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.040
A couple things about that quote, first off,
primitive is a cringe-y word. Secondly, a

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.290
market economy is basically all economies
these days, and a command economy is what

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.540
we called the Soviet Union's economy back
in the eighties.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.670
Anyway, money is very important to history--like,
our old friend Adam Smith thought that, quote:

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.280
"property money and markets not only existed
before political institutions, but were the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.270
very foundation of human society." Ehh, he
was pretty into economies, so he was probably

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.570
a little biased toward money, but it is important.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.050
Smith also thought that before there was money,
there was barter, but barter could be cumbersome;

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.860
like if I make cheese and you make shoes,
and you're lactose intolerant, then barter

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.850
breaks down because I need shoes, but you
don't need cheese. Then I have to live like

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.020
a hobbit and get this very powerful ring,
it's like, really stressful, I end up having

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.880
to go to Mordor, it's just very complicated.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.920
So, Smith's ideas that rather than adapt to
shoelessness, humans created a commodity that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.120
they would agree upon ahead of time could
be used in exchange, and that commodity is

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.960
money. Yes, these are all ones.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.240
Stan, I forgot to mention this, but you are
buying lunch today.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.580
Now, we generally think of money as like coins,
or later, bills, but the material of money

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.830
is arbitrary. Smith wrote: "In all countries,
however, men seem at last to have been determined

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.190
by irresistible reasons to give the preference,
for this employment, to metals above all other

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.890
commodity." A sentence that shows you why
we didn't teach him in Crash Course Literature.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.800
But of course, it's really inconvenient to
like, weigh and measure metals every time

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.190
you wanna buy or sell something, so people
hit upon the idea of making coins with a standard

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.209
size and weight. Now, Smith is probably right
that coins are much more convenient than bartering,

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.770
right? Like, especially if the main store
of value in your community is something like

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.880
cattle. I mean, let's say you still need a
pair of shoes, well, they aren't worth an

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.370
entire cow; trading in partial cows... fairly
messy. It's also very bad for the cow's health,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.670
and the cow loses a lot of its value, because,
you know, it's no longer living.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.000
So that all makes sense, but it's problematic
when Smith universalizes that observation

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.560
by claiming that as a matter of convenience,
every prudent man in every period of society

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.240
must naturally have endeavored to create money.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.900
Smith -- man of the enlightenment that he
was -- is positing that the creation of money

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.349
is part of human nature. Like, in the second
chapter of Wealth of Nations, Smith explicitly

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.069
says that the division of labour is the, quote:
"consequence of a certain propensity in human

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.190
nature ... to truck, barter, and exchange
one thing for another."

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.069
But yet, no! Like, what made sense for eighteenth
century city and town dwellers like Adam Smith

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.940
doesn't necessarily apply to like, all human
beings over the course of many millennia.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.970
And if you don't believe me, you can just
ask anthropologists. They love to talk about

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.459
this stuff.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.209
So, here's the fascinating thing to me: when
you look at places where the social order

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.459
is not based on money, we find that people
actually don't barter at all. So David Graeber's

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.430
book "Debt: The First 5,000 Years" surveys
the literature of anthropology and discovers

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.530
that in societies without money, people don't
actually barter, but they do find ways to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.250
exchange. He quotes an anthropologist named
Caroline Humphrey, who concluded: "No example

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.200
of a barter economy, pure and simple, has
ever been described, let alone the emergence

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.769
from it of money; all available ethnography
suggests that there has never been such a

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:19.980
thing."

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.350
Now, that's not to say that barter doesn't
exist or that it never has, I mean, I just

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.650
traded Stan two copies of my book Paper Towns
for the candy left in this pinata. Big money,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.770
no whammies. Two things of Sweet Tarts?! Stan!
That's not fair.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.220
Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.580
So, according to Graeber, barter was reserved
for trade between strangers, even enemies.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.220
For most of human history, humans lived in
small communities, and in those small communities,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.449
most exchange took place using forms of credit.
Basically, when people know each other well,

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.710
they're willing to trade with the future expectation
that what one gives today will be repaid at

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.430
some future date with something of roughly
equivalent value. So in small, localized communities,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.610
everyone is in debt to everyone else, and
there's no real need of physical money, like

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.790
coins, as a way of keeping a count, because,
you know, you remember when someone owes you

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.979
forty barrels of beer, or whatever.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.479
We see this historically in the early civilizations
of the Fertile Crescent, where the basic monetary

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.740
unit was the shekel, and one shekel's weight
in silver was the equivalent of a bushel of

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.150
barley. Money in Ancient Sumer was actually
created by bureaucrats in order to keep track

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.910
of resources and move things back and forth
between departments. But that doesn't mean

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.260
that silver actually circulated freely. Graeber
writes: "While debts were calculated in silver,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.610
they didn't have to be paid in silver."

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.610
So while some people seem to think that money
is naturally backed by precious metals, usually

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.310
gold or silver, that doesn't seem to have
been the case. It was enough to establish

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.500
that something was worth a shekel or a fraction
thereof, and then trade for something of equivalent

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.639
value -- meat, or whatever else, without actually
having to have the shekels change hands.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.570
And this was especially helpful in economies
where taxes and payments to workers were both

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.500
in grain, rather than money.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.750
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, first, Graeber
blows our minds by telling us that Adam Smith

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.290
was all wrong about money evolving from barter
societies, but what about credit as the precursor

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.919
to money?

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.250
I mean, it's basically saying that credit
cards aren't an advancement so much as they're

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.290
a return to the glorious past, except instead
of trust, there are like, large, faceless

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.960
corporations with the power to sue you.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.490
So the essence of credit is debt, and at least
according to Graeber, that's the glue that

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.310
holds social orders together, at least, if
you consider debt at its heart, to be about

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.520
obligation. At least one of the things that
binds us together as a community is the recognition

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.460
that we owe our neighbors something and that
they owe something to us in return. It's like

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.610
keeping your lawn mowed so that you can keep
your neighbor's property value high. It doesn't

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.150
make sense to have a lawn -- they're expensive
and time consuming, and you can't eat grass.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.139
But you take care of your lawn for the same
reason your neighbors take care of theirs.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.000
Out of the sense of mutual obligation.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.350
But money changes our understanding of those
obligations, right? Because once we're able

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.410
to put a price on our obligations, we can
make them transferable, which wouldn't be

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.570
possible without money. Like, for instance,
it allows you to hire someone to mow your

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.470
lawn for you, but Graeber argues that money,
especially in the form of coinage, also may

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.050
chattel slavery, possibly.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.460
So in West African social orders before the
arrival of Europeans, money was used, but

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.889
only for weddings, funerals, and other activities
that like, cemented human relationships. And

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.630
the money largely had symbolic value. But
when Europeans arrived, they introduced monetized

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.690
trade into the system, and in the process,
transformed that system. Money was no longer

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.570
about transferring value to solidify relationships
between individuals and families; it was about

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.370
quantifying debt and also making it transferable.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.479
So, Graeber's theory links money as we know
it to slavery and war, like, coins began to

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:54.490
be used in India, China, and the soon to be
Persian province of Lydia, almost simultaneously,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.160
all around 600 BCE. And in Graeber's view,
this happened because this was a period of

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.210
time that saw a shift from earlier forms of
honor-based warfare, like, what is described

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.229
in the Iliad, to a new, more state-based warfare.

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:12.580
Armies started fighting over things like territory
and resources, rather than, like, kidnapped

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.900
wives. So in a-- oh, it's time for the open
letter!

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.199
But first, let's see what's inside my globe
today. Oh, look, it's a molten core of nickel

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:28.110
and iron! Can--can you turn into coins? Oh!
Stan! Look how rich I am! Virtually.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.130
Thought Bubble's clearly much better at making
it rain than I am. An open letter to honou-based

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.060
warfare.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.620
Dear Honor-Based Warfare, um, I guess now
is the time in the video that I have to tell

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.180
you that I don't entirely agree with Mr. Graeber.
Like, with the Iliad we were telling ourselves

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.660
a story about why we went to war, right? We
went to war not for resources, but for glory.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.120
Honor. Now, I don't want to sound cynical
and disbelieving, but we still tell ourselves

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.230
those stories. These days, the President rarely
goes on TV and says, "You know why we're going

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:04.520
to go to war? We need resources." No, we still
say it's about honor and ideas and standing

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.560
up for the defenseless, and et cetera, which
is all about as historically convincing as

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.370
the Iliad. In short, honor-based warfare,
I'm not entirely convinced that you, you know,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.140
exist. Best wishes, John Green.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.410
Anyway, so in all three of these governments
in India, China, and Lydia, they were pretty

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.149
small scale, especially compared to the empires
that would soon come, but they built their

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:31.080
power on professional armies that needed to
be paid, and coins were a great way to pay

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.820
them. It just works much better than like,
trying to split up the plunder among everybody.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.980
The plundering method of payment is just like
a garage sale. The people who get there early

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.740
get all the good plunder, and then the rest
of the people, they're just left dividing

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.680
up, you know, old clothes.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.170
Also, in Graeber's view, states began to encourage
the use of coins because of the uncertainty

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.980
of war -- like, violence creates uncertainty
for merchants, and decreases the likelihood

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.350
that they will accept payment in the form
of some kind of trust-based credit arrangement.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.570
And soldiers aren't known for accepting credit
as payment, either, because, you know, soldiers

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.290
are keenly aware that they might die soon.
So, according to Graeber, this combination

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.970
of war and state-building led to the rise
of coinage. And then in order to keep paying

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.430
soldiers, rulers, like, say, Alexander the
Great, needed to continue their conquests.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.830
So you need an army in order to have an empire,
and your army only likes to be paid in coins.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.360
Now, you can seize some sweet, sweet metal
plunder and then melt it down and make coins,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.110
but with an empire-sized army, that's not
gonna cut it. You need more silver. Where

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.850
are you gonna get new silver? Mining. Nope,
Stan, not miming, I said "mining", don't ever

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.570
put mimes in Crash Course again.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.560
So now you need a steady supply of miners;
fortunately, you've conquered a bunch of people,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.490
so you have lots of prisoners of war, and
now you have slavery.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.330
This military-coinage slavery complex was
described explicitly in the Arthashastra,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.890
a political guidebook written by Minister
Kautilya for the Mauryan dynasty, that made

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.899
it clear that coins and markets sprung up,
above all, to feed the machinery of war. He

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:03.140
wrote: "The treasury is based upon mining,
the army upon the treasury; he who has the

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.740
army and the treasury may conquer the earth."

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.250
And Graeber says that China followed a similar
pattern: he writes, "The same fractured political

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:16.019
landscape, the same rise of trained, professional
armies, and the creation of coined money largely

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:20.390
in order to pay them." So, if money is a creation
of the state and its military, then it follows

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.540
that when the state fails, as it did in Europe
after the fall of the Western Roman Empire,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.630
coinage largely disappears. And that's exactly
what happened, actually, but of course, that

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.279
doesn't mean that transactions failed to take
place or that trade completely disappears,

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:38.269
but it did decline a lot. And in situations
like that, people often revert to the virtual

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:42.940
credit systems that we talked about earlier:
the ones that rely more on personal connections

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.800
than on like, state enforcement.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.070
So Adam Smith's origin myth of money -- that
it derives from people's natural desire to

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:55.600
make barter more convenient through the creation
of a medium of exchange -- really doesn't

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.110
hold up to scrutiny. I mean, there are clearly
examples of an alternate history where production

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.570
and exchange work okay without actual coins
or bills changing hands. It's kind of like

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.660
today, actually -- money works as long as
there is some form of trust and a way to make

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.610
people meet their obligations. People used
to feel obligated because failure to meet

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.899
their obligations would hurt their standing
in their small, localized communities, and

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:22.790
now we meet our obligations because otherwise,
like, people take our houses or whatever.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.180
But while we have evidence that money, as
we conceive of it today, isn't necessary for

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.130
exchange, it IS necessary, or, at least, very
useful, for states, and I think states are

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.180
probably good.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.890
Oh, maybe not, I'm not positive. I just like
the internet so much; I don't think we would

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.310
have the internet without states.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.519
So I wanna be clear that I don't entirely
buy Graeber's version of history. I might

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:46.790
be wrong, of course, but I'm not convinced
that coins necessarily lead to slavery. And

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.339
I don't think that ancient slavery is really
comparable to the chattel slavery that we

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:54.250
saw in the Americas. But I do think that it's
important to look at alternative points of

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.910
view when it comes to history, even when you
don't agree with them. It's helpful to understand

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.660
that there's more than one well-argued point
of view in the world. And I do think Graeber

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.240
very effectively challenges the idea that
human beings are like natural, rational, economic

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.250
actors who wouldn't be possible without money.
And in the face of overwhelming anthropological

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.470
evidence, at least this much is true: money
is not the product of human nature; it's the

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.720
product of human actions, like the formation
of governments and markets.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.040
In short, and I know this will disappoint
some of the economics majors out there: ultimately,

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:32.670
I think my mom was right. We aren't made of
money. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.140
week.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.290
Crash Course is made with the help of all
of these nice people. I didn't want to do

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.230
the credits without my globe. And it exists
because of your support through Subbable.com.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.720
Subbable is a voluntary subscription service
that allows you to support Crash Course directly.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.350
We want to thank all of our Subbable subscribers;
thanks to everyone for watching. As we say

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.690
in my hometown, don't forget to be awesome.
