00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.155
What job that does not exist today do you think will be one of the world's "top 10" jobs in 10 years?

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.524
I think, and I'm speaking about my industry

00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.474
so the company I work for

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:14.262
is a company that is engaged in supporting our clients

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.765
in defining this work environment.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:20.351
And what we are seeing already today

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:22.685
but will increase definitely in the future

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.246
is the involvement of people

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:27.038
that have skills that are not directly related

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:28.529
to products themselves,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.800
but people who understand mainly other,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.277
let's say, sciences,

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:34.293
so people who can,

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:37.157
who are able to equate together concepts

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:39.536
that go from anthropology

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:40.563
to sociology

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:41.829
to psychology.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.340
If you think about the impact

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.613
that the work environment can give to the people

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.292
working in that environment,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.507
it's really important to have the ability

00:00:50.507 --> 00:00:53.449
to understand what people are expecting

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.046
from a work environment

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.524
and translate that into an effective formula

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.131
that, in the end, could bring effective results.

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:03.128
So, something we are seeing today

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:05.137
but will definitely develop tomorrow

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:07.131
is really the ability to understand

00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.626
different cultures.

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:10.795
So, we study different cultures.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.284
We had just, we just conducted a study

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:15.468
to see how people behave in places

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:16.401
like Beijing

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:17.811
or Monterey

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.733
or Los Angeles

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.339
and to understand also

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.220
how the culture code, as we call it,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.297
impacts those work environments.

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:29.422
So, I think the more the world is globalizing,

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.883
the more we see emerging economies becoming relevant,

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:34.736
the more, I think, these profiles

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:36.555
that are not necessarily only driven

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.365
by technical knowledge

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.258
will be profiles that will have a certain impact

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:43.297
and importance in our industry.
