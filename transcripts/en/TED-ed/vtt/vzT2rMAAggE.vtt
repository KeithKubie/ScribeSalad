00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:05.716
There are a lot of ideas that I'm passionate about.

00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:07.598
Um, and I spoke at the Institute

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:09.620
about one I'm particularly passionate about,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.591
and that's empowering people

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:16.416
and, in fact, to empower people to own their own data,

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.086
to have a feeling of ownership and empowerment

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.334
about their own data.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:24.623
I was thinking that data about people's own self

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.908
could be considered like a song

00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:28.435
that they have copyrights to

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:29.879
and that they should feel empowered

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.834
to be able to exchange the data about themselves

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.169
for goods and services

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:37.241
or for other data

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.950
in a way that has transparent value to them

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.112
because right now, I and I think a lot of people

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:46.402
feel frustrated about these, you know, privacy policies

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.741
and other ways that people record data about you

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.520
where you don't really see clearly the value.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.264
I gave the example that I had lost my passport,

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.994
and, in fact, I'm a day late getting here.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:01.076
And, at the time, I thought,

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:03.325
"Well, how silly! I have this little booklet.

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:06.237
Why can't I just walk up to the kiosk

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:08.411
and it can take an image of my face

00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:09.487
and look at all my data."

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.910
I would expose a vast amount of data to them

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.403
for a limited time

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:16.478
for the purpose of verifying my identity,

00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:18.879
not so they can keep that forever

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.079
and use it for marketing

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.687
or whatever model-building purposes

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:22.693
that they have,

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:24.826
that's not part of the deal.

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.622
I would like a clear and transparent deal.

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.956
I let you see this

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:29.782
for this purpose,

00:01:29.782 --> 00:01:30.702
for this time,

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:34.289
in exchange for this value,

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.964
and I'm okay with that, right,

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:38.633
if it's clear to me what the value is.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.945
I'm willing to give more,

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:42.503
and I would like to see

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.463
these clear and transparent contracts

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:47.968
existing in plain language

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:50.870
with the proper potential digital controls

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.156
to make you accountable that you don't use my data

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.381
in sneaky other ways, right,

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.119
so that I trust you.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.540
And when there's trust,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.866
you know, then there can be an exchange.

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.655
And when there's an exchange for value,

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.530
I think we're building an economy,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.687
a personal data economy.

00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:10.464
And I think that will make people creative.

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.114
I think that will make people entrepreneurial

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:16.298
about collecting more data about themselves,

00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:17.760
you know, talking,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.917
giving more insights about themselves,

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:22.342
like some people would go to Mechanical Turk

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.545
and participate.

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:25.638
Some people would go to surveys and participate

00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:28.029
because they get value back.

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.414
And that's what I'd really like to see.

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.464
I'd like to see companies offering real value

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:33.887
in exchange for people's data

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:38.340
and not these pretty much impossible-to-interpret contracts,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.448
and that's something I'm very passionate about.
