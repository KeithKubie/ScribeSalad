00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is no. We're going to talk about a cryptographic protocol that does this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But actually achieving what we want depends on lots of other things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It depends on people.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It depends on assumptions about the adversary, knowing what capabilities the participants have

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as well as any eavesdropper might have,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as well as building the system that actually runs the protocol.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These are all things we're not going to talk about.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What we are going to talk about is a protocol that, given the right answers

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to these questions, could provide this property.
