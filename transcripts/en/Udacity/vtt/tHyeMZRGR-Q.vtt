00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.445
We've worked with complementary angles. Let's see if we can figure out what

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:09.240
supplementary angles are. Here's angle R, which measures 60 degrees, and here's

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:13.425
angle Q, which measures 120 degrees. These angles are considered to be

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:18.050
supplementary angles. Let's see if you know what this word means. Here are two

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:22.285
questions. Here, angles S and T are supplementary, and angles U and V are

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:28.141
supplementary. What do you think are the missing angles, T and V? Find their

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:32.819
measures. And don't worry about entering the degree symbol. Good luck.
