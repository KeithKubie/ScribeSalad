00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.970
So in these first two steps of the

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.670
alcohol metabolism pathway, we've essentially learned that this,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.550
intermediate acetaldehyde, is what causes the alcohol flush

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.420
reaction. The ethanol itself mainly causes the intoxication.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.210
And it turns out the acetic acid is

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.320
just largely a harmless metabolite. So knowing that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.020
an accumulation of acetaldehyde can actually cause alcohol

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
flush, which scenario would result in the most

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
severe alcohol flush reaction? Take a look

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.320
at each answer individually. Notice how it's

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.690
different. They each change the ADH or

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.020
the ALDH2 enzymes. Look carefully each option, and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.360
notice that they change with regards to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.910
the activity level of the enzymes. Reduced

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.430
activity, or an enhanced activity. Go ahead

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.870
and pick which answer you think is best?
