00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.450
first one but am a thought was
brilliantly acted I thought was

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
brilliantly acted I thought was
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.679

brilliant tied together with the first

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
brilliant tied together with the first
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260

and I love showing it to people because
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070
and I love showing it to people because
people I think always like oh well it's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
people I think always like oh well it's
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.499
people I think always like oh well it's
a sequel it can't be good more of the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
a sequel it can't be good more of the
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050
a sequel it can't be good more of the
same and stuff but everyone I show it to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
same and stuff but everyone I show it to
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120
same and stuff but everyone I show it to
they're like that was fucking good and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

guess the camera picks it up picks up

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320
guess the camera picks it up picks up
 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.250
guess the camera picks it up picks up
the sound somehow um even though the

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260
the sound somehow um even though the
 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.690

and it's talking back but it doesn't
 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.530
and it's talking back but it doesn't
pick that up and again it's I guess

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540
pick that up and again it's I guess
 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.840
pick that up and again it's I guess
nitpicking but um so at the one thing

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850
nitpicking but um so at the one thing
 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.400
nitpicking but um so at the one thing
about the scares I'll say is I like the

can guess I didn't think it was very
 

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.350
can guess I didn't think it was very
good but I've always talked about the

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360
good but I've always talked about the
 

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.900

Paranormal Activity movies so here it is
they did just kind of get dumber and

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:29.070
they did just kind of get dumber and
 

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.460
they did just kind of get dumber and
dumber I take it right from to on they

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:31.470
dumber I take it right from to on they
 

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.620
dumber I take it right from to on they
got dumber and dumber but each one up

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:33.630
got dumber and dumber but each one up
 

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.010

until five had something you know

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.020
until five had something you know
 

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.370
until five had something you know
something of interest um and I think the

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380
something of interest um and I think the
 

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.260
something of interest um and I think the
only thing that really stands out about

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.270
only thing that really stands out about
 

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.660
only thing that really stands out about
this one is the girl the kid in it is

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:44.670
this one is the girl the kid in it is
 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.620
this one is the girl the kid in it is
very very good legitimately scary but

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:48.630
very very good legitimately scary but
 

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.240
very very good legitimately scary but

that's my thoughts on the final

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:57.630
that's my thoughts on the final
 

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.240
that's my thoughts on the final
paranormal activity if they do make

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.250
paranormal activity if they do make
 

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.550
paranormal activity if they do make
another one I have no interest in seeing

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560
another one I have no interest in seeing
 

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.160
another one I have no interest in seeing
it hopefully this is the last long

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.170
it hopefully this is the last long
 

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.329
it hopefully this is the last long
because it really seems like it's run

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339
because it really seems like it's run
 

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.340
because it really seems like it's run
out of steam so but I still love the

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.350
