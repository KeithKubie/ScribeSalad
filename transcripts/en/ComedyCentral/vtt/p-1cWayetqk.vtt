&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK!

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.138
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE RUNS THIS
TOWN, AND IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.040
GOOD FOR YA, YOU WILL SHUT UP!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.741
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.842
HE'S THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.777
PLES WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM, MAYOR BILL DeBLASIO!

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:21.355
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
♪♪

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.522
HOW ARE YA!

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.159
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.427
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.830
&gt;&gt; IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.431
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN
EXCITING TIME FOR YOU.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:36.336
YOU'RE ALSO TAKING A MORE
NATIONAL PLATFORM ON THE ISSUE

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.539
OF INCOME INEQUALITY.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.974
YOU FEEL THAT'S A REAL INJUSTICE
AND I WANT TO ASK YOU, BEFORE WE

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:46.213
GET INTO THAT, WHAT ALSO ABOUT
HEIGHT INEQUALITY?

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.414
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:54.588
WHAT ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE
THE 1% PERCENTERS TOWER IN THEIR

00:00:54.588 --> 00:01:03.030
IVORY LEGS OVER THE  HOY PELOY,
THE PROLATARION, WHO, MAYBE, 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.234
ARE CLOSER TO THE RATS, THE
GUTTER, THE SUBWAY?

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.502
HOW DO YOU REDISTRIBUTE THAT.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.170
&gt;&gt; I'M KIND OF DARWINIAN ON THIS
ONE.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.239
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH!

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.441
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.509
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WINNERS, LOSERS.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.777
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN HUNDREDS OF US
TIE YOU TO THE GROUND

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.479
GULLIVER-STYLE --

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.082
&gt;&gt; I'VE HAD THAT
RECURRING NIGHTMARE.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.451
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.621
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'VE HAD THE OPPOSITE.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.891
WITH INCOME INEQUALITY,
YOU PUT TOGETHER WHAT'S CALLED A

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:36.129
PROGRESSIVE AGENDA TO ADDRESS
INCOME INEQUALITY.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.999
BASIC TENT POSTS, WHAT CAN BE
DONE?

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.001
&gt;&gt;  RAISE WAGES AND BENEFITS.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.271
$15 MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE 
THE MINIMUM IN AMERICA.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:51.278
&gt;&gt; Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR
WAL-MART, McDONALD'S.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.413
ARE THERE SMALL BUSINESSES ON
THE MARKET WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.548
ABILITY TO DO THAT?

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:58.518
IS THAT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT OR IS
 THE IDEA, THAT'S OKAY?

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.023
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE SOME
LOCAL  VARIATIONS, EXCEPTIONS,

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.993
BUT MINIMUM-WAGE USED TO MEAN
WHAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY LIVE ON.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:09.963
NEW YORK CITY, MINIMUM WAGE
$8.75, CAN YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.498
CITY ON THAT?

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.201
&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
LIVE ANYWHERE ON $8.75.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:18.672
THESE WAL MARTS AND McDONALD'S
PAY VERY LITTLE AND THE STATE

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:22.142
AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PICK UP
THE TAB FOR SERVICES THAT NEED

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.377
TO BE RENDERED.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.213
&gt;&gt; FOOD STAMPS, WELFARE, ET
CETERA.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:32.352
$15 MINIMUM WAGE, BASIC
BENEFITS, PAID SICK DAYS AND

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.355
FAMILY LEAVE, THE KIND OF THINGS
WE SEE IN INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.592
ALL OVER THE WORLD, TAX THE
WEALTHY.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:41.228
HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA, TAX THE
WEALTHY.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:44.331
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE'S ONE WE'LL THROW
TO YOU.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.199
THIS IS CHODDS-APPROVED.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.705
1982, THE S.E.C. DEREGULATED THE
STOCK OPTION BUYBACK FOR

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.041
CORPORATE INVESTMENT.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.210
WHAT ABOUT YOU REIN THAT IN, SO
MUCH OF THE PROFITS -- WE HAVE

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.980
SOME STATISTICS HERE -- THIS IS
BY THE WAY A HARVARD BUSINESS

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.785
REVIEW, THIS IS NO LEFTEST
RAG -- ARE SUGGESTING IF YOU

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:09.022
TAKE BACK THE BUYBACK ON THE
OPEN MARKET IT INADVERTENTLY

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.392
INFLATES THE STOCK MARKET, SO
MUCH OF THE WAGE IS PULLED OUT,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.595
NOT BEING REINVESTED INTO THE
COMPANY, GOES TO THE BOARD,

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.899
WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.903
&gt;&gt; YES, IN PROGRESSIVE AGENDA,
AVAILAVLE AT

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:24.471
progressiveagenda.us, BY THE
WAY--

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:29.876
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU COULDN'T GET .COM?
&gt;&gt; WE TOOK WHATEVER WE COULD.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:35.982
WE MAKE SURE THE TAX ADVANTAGE
FOR "PERFORMANCE PAY," IS 

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:39.352
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING
TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.722
C.E.O.s MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF
MONEY AND THEN IT'S TAX 

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:46.593
SHELTERED CURRENTLY, AND WHAT IT
DOES, AS YOU INDICATE, IS MAKES 

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.763
MATTERS WORSE BECAUSE THE MONEY
DOESN'T GO BACK INTO THE 

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.599
COMPANY, DOESN'T GO TO WORKERS
OR INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY TO

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.069
BUILD BETTER JOBS, IT GOES TO
THE FEW. 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.371
THE BIGGER PROBLEM IN THE
COUNTRY IS CONCENTRATION OF

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:01.775
WEALTH AND POWER IN THE HANDS OF
THE VERY FEW IS ACTUALLY PULLING

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.212
DOWN THE COUNTRY WITH THE
GREATEST INCOME DISPARITY SINCE

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.813
BEFORE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.382
WITH WE HAVE FOR THE LAST 25
YEARS OR SO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.786
FAMILY LITERALLY ADJUSTED FOR
INFLATION HAS GONE BACKWARDS

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.054
ECONOMICALLY.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.157
WE HAD A "RECOVERY" SINCE THE
GREAT RECESSION BUT THE VAST

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.892
MAJORITY OF GAINS WENT TO THE
TOP 1%.

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:23.930
&gt;&gt; Jon: WITH THESE STATISTICS
SO STARK, WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.001
TO THEN --  IS IT PEOPLE DO NOT
TRUST THAT WHEN THAT MONEY GOES

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.871
BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT
WILL BE SPENT WISELY, THAT IT

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.773
WON'T BE SQUANDERED?

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.476
DO THEY ALMOST PREFER IT BEING
SQUANDERED TO THE WEALTHY

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.478
C.E.O.s THAN TO THE
GOVERNMENT?

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.481
HOW DO YOU REBUILD TRUST IF THAT
IS YOUR PLATFORM THAT THAT MONEY

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.383
IS UTILIZED CORRECTLY?

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.419
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHEN PEOPLE OF THIS
COUNTRY SEE THEIR GOVERNMENT

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.923
ENSURE A DECENT STANDARD OF
LIVING -- AGAIN, $15 MINIMUM

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:54.528
WAGE, PAID SICK LEAVE AND PRE-K,
WHICH WE'RE SO PROUD OF IN THIS

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:59.266
COUNTRY, IT SHOULD BE GIVEN YOU
HAVE FULL-DAY PRE-K FOR THE

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:03.336
KIDS -- WHEN THE FOFT IS
PROVIDING THOSE FUNDAMENTALS,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.539
THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN
TRUST.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.409
PEOPLE DIDN'T GET TO VOTE ON A
LOT OF THESE THINGS.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.246
THESE WERE CHANGES IN OUR
PRIVATE SECTOR ECONOMY THAT

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.514
HAPPENED WITHOUT DEBATE.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:19.553
IF I SAID, LET'S TAKE THE WARREN
BUFFET RULE, HE PAYS A LOWER TAX

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:23.423
RATE THAN THE SECRETARY OR
CLERKS WHO WORK IN HIS OFFICE.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:26.159
WARREN BUFFET SAYS THAT'S WRONG
AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SAYS

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.327
THAT'S WRONG.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.497
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN SAYS WE
SHOULD CLOSE THE HEDGE FUND

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.665
LOOPHOLE.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:35.202
WHY DOES A BILLIONAIRE HEDGE
FUND MANAGER PAY LESS IN TAXES

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:38.238
THAN THE WOMAN WHO CLEANS HIS
BEACH HOUSE OR THE MAN WHO FLIES

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:40.874
HIS PRIVATE JET?

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:45.178
THAT WOULD BE A CONSENSUS
POSITION THAT THOSE IN THAT

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.846
POSITION NOT BE ALLOWED -- BUT
WE DIDN'T GET TO VOTE ON THOSE,

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.048
JON.

00:05:48.048 --> 00:05:52.018
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE OTHER SIDE, PEOPLE
LOOK AT IT AND SAY THE FEDERAL

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.120
GOVERNMENT AND CITY GOVERNMENT
HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.723
MONEY, THEY'VE SPENT ALL THE
MONEY OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS,

00:05:56.723 --> 00:06:01.461
YET WE  STILL HAVE INTRACTABLE
POVERTY AND AREAS WE CAN'T FIX

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.396
WITH MONEY AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.399
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THEM MORE
INTERVENTION, WHAT DO WE DO WITH

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:11.571
THE AREAS THAT SEEM TO BE
IMPERVIOUS TO THOSE KIND OF

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.772
INTERVENTIONS?

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:15.609
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ASK IF THERE  HAVE
BEEN INSTANCES WHERE GOVERNMENT

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:20.981
WAS BUREAUCRATIC OR WERE
POLITICS INTRUDING IN THE

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:22.849
EQUATION -- OF COURSE. BUT I
THINK WE KNOW THE BASICS DO

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.084
WORK.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:26.519
BASIC EDUCATION AND
INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS,

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.256
HISTORECALLY, IN THIS COUNTRY,
FROM THE END OF WORLD WAR II

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.992
THROUGH THE '70s THERE WAS A
BOOMING MIDDLE CLASS BECAUSE WE

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.460
INVESTED.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.431
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'VE CREATED
NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGH

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:42.335
SEGREGATIONIST POLICIES,
ECONOMIC POLICIES, ET CETERA,

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:45.572
THAT HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT
FOR INTERVENTIONS TO PERMEATE

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.773
THOSE AREAS.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:51.845
WHAT ABOUT BREAKING THOSE UP SO
THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SO

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.413
TRAPPED?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.782
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS, I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT, AND ONE OF THE

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:56.983
WAYS IS YOU BUILD AFFORDABLE
HOUSING.

00:06:56.983 --> 00:07:00.020
IN THIS CITY WE HAVE 21,000
UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.221
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.890
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY NEW YORK
CITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CITY

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.693
FOR EVERY PEOPLE IS IF WE CREATE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:07:06.693 --> 00:07:11.431
IN THE PROCESS, YOU START TO
INTEGRATE COMMUNITIES.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.735
THAT IS ONE OF THE BEGINNINGS OF
A BIGGER CHANGE.

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.771
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WILL BE NICER TO
SEE 200,000 UNITS IN NEW YORK

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:21.808
BECAUSE THAT WILL BRING THE
TOTAL UP TO 200,000.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.109
DONE YOUR BACKGROUND RESEARCH!
