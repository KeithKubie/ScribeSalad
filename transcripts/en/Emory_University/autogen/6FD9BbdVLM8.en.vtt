00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.879
 
so the study is a rehabilitation study

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889
so the study is a rehabilitation study
 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.970
so the study is a rehabilitation study
that involves looking at people who have

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980
that involves looking at people who have
 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.320
that involves looking at people who have
had a stroke or a hemorrhage in the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330
had a stroke or a hemorrhage in the
 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.010
had a stroke or a hemorrhage in the
brain and it is the goal is to improve

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020
brain and it is the goal is to improve
 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.770
brain and it is the goal is to improve
upper limb movement in people who had a

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780
upper limb movement in people who had a
 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.920
upper limb movement in people who had a
stroke so this treatment that we're

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930
stroke so this treatment that we're
 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.210
stroke so this treatment that we're
using our this intervention that we're

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220
using our this intervention that we're
 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.800
using our this intervention that we're
testing as part of this research study

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810
testing as part of this research study
 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.010
testing as part of this research study
involves using a robotic device and the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020
involves using a robotic device and the
 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.840
involves using a robotic device and the
robotic device has a series of games

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850
robotic device has a series of games
 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.850
robotic device has a series of games
that robot sort of fits over top of a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860
that robot sort of fits over top of a
 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.410
that robot sort of fits over top of a
person's arm and there's a series of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420
person's arm and there's a series of
 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.630
person's arm and there's a series of
games that a person plays that

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
games that a person plays that
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.580
games that a person plays that
challenges them to move their arm if

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590
challenges them to move their arm if
 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.160
challenges them to move their arm if
they cannot move their arm at all then

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170
they cannot move their arm at all then
 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.840
they cannot move their arm at all then
the robot will help them a hundred

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850
the robot will help them a hundred
 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.889
the robot will help them a hundred
percent as they learn the robot will

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899
percent as they learn the robot will
 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.479
percent as they learn the robot will
decrease the amount of help as the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489
decrease the amount of help as the
 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.430
decrease the amount of help as the
person increases their effort so the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
person increases their effort so the
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.410
person increases their effort so the
goal is to really remove the robotic

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420
goal is to really remove the robotic
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.090
goal is to really remove the robotic
device in the end and then have the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100
device in the end and then have the
 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.549
device in the end and then have the
person just using your arm so that's

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559
person just using your arm so that's
 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.130
person just using your arm so that's
that's the idea this one has a little

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
that's the idea this one has a little
 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.620
that's the idea this one has a little
bit of a caveat in that we also apply a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630
bit of a caveat in that we also apply a
 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.969
bit of a caveat in that we also apply a
pharmacological agent that we believe is

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
pharmacological agent that we believe is
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.610
pharmacological agent that we believe is
useful for improving learning so what a

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620
useful for improving learning so what a
 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.430
useful for improving learning so what a
person has a stroke they are essentially

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440
person has a stroke they are essentially
 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.580
person has a stroke they are essentially
relearning old skills so where you we're

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590
relearning old skills so where you we're
 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.850
relearning old skills so where you we're
testing a research question that the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
testing a research question that the
 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.880
testing a research question that the
robotic therapy Plus this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
robotic therapy Plus this
 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.560
robotic therapy Plus this
pharmacological pharmacological agent is

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570
pharmacological pharmacological agent is
 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.380
pharmacological pharmacological agent is
better than the robot therapy plus a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390
better than the robot therapy plus a
 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.570
better than the robot therapy plus a
sham treatment or a placebo treatment

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580
sham treatment or a placebo treatment
 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.510
sham treatment or a placebo treatment
which is a just a sugar pill so I don't

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
which is a just a sugar pill so I don't
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.670
which is a just a sugar pill so I don't
know who gets the drug the subjects

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680
know who gets the drug the subjects
 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.020
know who gets the drug the subjects
don't know who gets the drug and none of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
don't know who gets the drug and none of
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.969
don't know who gets the drug and none of
the evaluators get the drug in the end

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979
the evaluators get the drug in the end
 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.100
the evaluators get the drug in the end
when the studies done then we break the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110
when the studies done then we break the
 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.440
when the studies done then we break the
blinding and then we figure out who did

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
blinding and then we figure out who did
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.200
blinding and then we figure out who did
better based upon what study arm they

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210
better based upon what study arm they
 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.789
better based upon what study arm they
were in we know that the robotic

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799
were in we know that the robotic
 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.570
were in we know that the robotic
training works but again like in many

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580
training works but again like in many
 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.100
training works but again like in many
many investigational studies you sort of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110
many investigational studies you sort of
 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.350
many investigational studies you sort of
add one therapy plus another therapy to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
add one therapy plus another therapy to
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.880
add one therapy plus another therapy to
think that you'll get even better so

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
think that you'll get even better so
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.560
think that you'll get even better so
that's really our research question can

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
that's really our research question can
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.929
that's really our research question can
we add robot plus the pharmacological

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
we add robot plus the pharmacological
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.359
we add robot plus the pharmacological
therapy to get an even better so and

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369
therapy to get an even better so and
 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.160
therapy to get an even better so and
this has happened the robot has improved

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
this has happened the robot has improved
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.840
this has happened the robot has improved
people who were

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850
people who were
 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.630
people who were
you know one would think is that may not

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
you know one would think is that may not
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.270
you know one would think is that may not
improve if you're in your 70s 80s and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
improve if you're in your 70s 80s and
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.460
improve if you're in your 70s 80s and
90s you may not think you can prove but

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
90s you may not think you can prove but
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.680
90s you may not think you can prove but
we have data that suggests that you can

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690
we have data that suggests that you can
 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.560
we have data that suggests that you can
the reason it is not just the robot the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570
the reason it is not just the robot the
 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.900
the reason it is not just the robot the
robot will help but it's the games and I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
robot will help but it's the games and I
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.570
robot will help but it's the games and I
mentioned that term neuroplasticity the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580
mentioned that term neuroplasticity the
 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.980
mentioned that term neuroplasticity the
changing in the brain now are there are

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990
changing in the brain now are there are
 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.550
changing in the brain now are there are
certain certain items that need to occur

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
certain certain items that need to occur
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920
certain certain items that need to occur
for the brain to change one of those is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
for the brain to change one of those is
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720
for the brain to change one of those is
being attentive so you have to attend to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
being attentive so you have to attend to
 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.690
being attentive so you have to attend to
something also you have to be motivated

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
something also you have to be motivated
 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.550
something also you have to be motivated
to do it if you're not motivated to do

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
to do it if you're not motivated to do
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.990
to do it if you're not motivated to do
something you rarely learn just think of

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
something you rarely learn just think of
 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.820
something you rarely learn just think of
a a tennis game if you're really not

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830
a a tennis game if you're really not
 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.560
a a tennis game if you're really not
interested in playing tennis and your

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
interested in playing tennis and your
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.300
interested in playing tennis and your
your father sends you out to play tennis

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
your father sends you out to play tennis
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.920
your father sends you out to play tennis
and you just aren't very interested

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
and you just aren't very interested
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.300
and you just aren't very interested
you're not going to learn the skill very

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310
you're not going to learn the skill very
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.500
you're not going to learn the skill very
well it's the same thing with these

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510
well it's the same thing with these
 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.480
well it's the same thing with these
games what the robot does is that it has

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
games what the robot does is that it has
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.390
games what the robot does is that it has
a computer program that's along with it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400
a computer program that's along with it
 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.370
a computer program that's along with it
think of it like a video game and the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
think of it like a video game and the
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.040
think of it like a video game and the
video game has a series of levels all

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050
video game has a series of levels all
 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.930
video game has a series of levels all
the way from zero which is the easiest

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940
the way from zero which is the easiest
 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.030
the way from zero which is the easiest
to 10 which is the most difficult the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
to 10 which is the most difficult the
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.380
to 10 which is the most difficult the
games like you said are motivational

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390
games like you said are motivational
 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.900
games like you said are motivational
that make you attend they're challenging

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910
that make you attend they're challenging
 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.150
that make you attend they're challenging
and they're progressively increase the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160
and they're progressively increase the
 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
and they're progressively increase the
difficulty level all of those things are

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
difficulty level all of those things are
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:39.350
difficulty level all of those things are
important for brain plasticity
