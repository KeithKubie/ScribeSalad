Hello,

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,310
I'm busy getting animated about language
and this is why you should join me.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,030
We've been digging into the decipherment
of ancient scripts in some languages

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:15,030
out there. People sing when they
speak. So how does that work?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,980
It's the U S is 50th state and one
of the most popular tropical vacation

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,340
destinations in the world.
But how do you say it's name?

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,990
Did you know that bees are out there
talking to each other right now?

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,480
Storytellers of old knew how to spin
tales with monsters and ghosts like in

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,620
Homer's odyssey,

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,770
spirit possession and lady Murasaki's
tale of Genji or even spooky settings as

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,220
dog days in Ferno, ancient Sanskrit.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,310
Turn that dial 1000 years into the future.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,220
What will future English be like.
