00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.799
You'd think by now scientists would have learned
everything there is to know about one oxygen

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.890
and two hydrogen atoms, H2O.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.300
But we learn new things about water all the
time.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.240
Really, we do.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.369
Hey there, hydro-friends, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.169
Water is important for… well, every living
thing on earth; it is part of every single

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.119
cell in our bodies, and all plants and animals
need water to survive.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.480
But despite its ubiquity, water is incredibly
unique.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
It goes from solid to gas in a smaller temperature
range than many other compounds.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.110
Plus, when you cool it down into ice, it expands
AND becomes less dense than its liquid form.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660
That doesn’t happen with most other substances!

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.660
You’d think by now, scientists would have
already learned everything there is to know

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.660
about this combination of one oxygen and two
hydrogen atoms — H2O.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.660
But we learn new things about water all the
time!

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.930
For example, a study in the December 2016
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.970
showed ice doesn’t melt the way you think
it does.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.920
Instead of melting all at once, in a sort
of continuous process, it goes layer by layer...

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.890
The top layer is only 45 nanometers at its
thickest, or 1/1000 the thickness of a human

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.890
hair, and it stays liquid-like below 0 degrees
celsius...which is the reason ice is slippery!

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.140
In fact, this new study showed that it’s
liquid-like even at negative 38 degrees!

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.140
That’s...slick!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.130
And while this study might be pretty “cool,”
another 2016 study from the International

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.110
Journal of Nanotechnology could be even more
awesome.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.570
It found that water might actually have TWO
distinct liquid states.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.690
You probably know that all matter exists in
one of five states — solid, liquid, gas,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.050
sometimes plasma, and very rarely Bose-Einstein
condensate, where the atoms start to act like

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.050
waves.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.520
But in this study, researchers found that
liquid water actually undergoes a change in

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.010
its properties — how it behaves — when
it is cooled from 60 degrees celsius to 40

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.010
degrees.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.740
They’re calling this the “crossover temperature”.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.290
In other words, even though water “looks”
identical just above and below this temperature

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.170
range, it has different properties, and thus,
is potentially two distinct types of liquid

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.170
water.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.229
When water is cooled, it loses its ability
to store electrical energy — also called

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.820
its dielectric constant.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.159
Researchers thought that this happened in
a linear fashion, but at the crossover temperature,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.009
it gets a kink in this linear line.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.780
This small change impacts other physical properties
of the liquid, like the speed of sound in

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.010
water and how it conducts heat.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.450
Above 60C, liquid water’s chemical properties
look more like what we’d associate with

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.360
water vapor or steam.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.280
Below that, the properties appear more ice-like.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.730
And although the change is small, it may have
a dramatic effect on molecular systems.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.591
The researchers looked at how proteins behave
in water at the crossover temperature, and

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:40.860
around the 60 degree mark, certain systems
of proteins go from being stable to unstable.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.250
The researchers think that the physical changes
in water at this temperature may be impacting

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.340
the proteins directly.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.580
With further research, this could help us
learn how certain diseases infect us.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.970
The two states of liquid water could also
change how we work with microscopic systems,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.819
like nanoparticles, which are sensitive to
this crossover temperature.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.670
So, water is still kind of mysterious, and
there’s probably a lot more to learn about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.670
it.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.700
I mean, only recently have scientists learned
how it is even able to conduct electricity,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.800
or the fact that forcing it through tiny tubes
changes it’s boiling and freezing points.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.470
Even though it’s all around us and inside
of us, that’s no reason to take water for

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.470
granted.

All of these things we’re learning about
water are super cool, but what about hard

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.250
and soft water?

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.410
What’s the difference between those?
