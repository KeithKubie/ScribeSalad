00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:09.585
You're in line at the grocery store when, uh oh,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:11.275
someone sneezes on you.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:13.736
The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:16.487
and lands on a cell on your airway lining.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:19.040
Every living thing on Earth is made of cells,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.073
from the smallest one-celled bacteria

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:23.852
to the giant blue whale to you.

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:27.190
Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.278
a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins,

00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:33.475
that surrounds and protects the inner components.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:34.493
It's semipermeable,

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.048
meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:38.402
but blocks others.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:41.495
The cell membrane is covered with tiny projections.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:42.752
They all have functions,

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.728
like helping cells adhere to their neighbors

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:47.785
or binding to nutrients the cell will need.

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.062
Animal and plant cells have cell membranes.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:52.052
Only plant cells have a cell wall,

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.048
which is made of rigid cellulose that gives the plant structure.

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:59.414
The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky.

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:00.584
Pretending to be a friend,

00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:03.548
it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane,

00:01:03.548 --> 00:01:06.954
and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside.

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:08.330
When the virus gets through,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.220
the cell recognizes its mistake.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.172
An enemy is inside!

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.010
Special enzymes arrive at the scene

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.224
and chop the virus to pieces.

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:18.043
They then send one of the pieces back

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:19.379
through the cell membrane,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.063
where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells

00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:23.717
about the invader.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.332
A nearby cell sees the warning

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:27.810
and immediately goes into action.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.419
It needs to make antibodies,

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:31.189
proteins that will attack and kill

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.068
the invading virus.

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:35.656
This process starts in the nucleus.

00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:37.667
The nucleus contains our DNA,

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.390
the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.290
our bodies need to function.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.128
A certain section of our DNA contains instructions

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:49.279
that tell our cells how to make antibodies.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.329
Enzymes in the nucleus find the right section of DNA,

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.138
then create a copy of these instructions,

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:56.427
called messenger RNA.

00:01:56.427 --> 00:02:00.423
The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders.

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:03.467
The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.907
There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:07.302
in a human cell,

00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:09.140
all studded along a ribbon-like structure

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.673
called the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.914
This ribosome reads the instructions from the nucleus.

00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:18.091
It takes amino acids and links them together one by one

00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:22.003
creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus.

00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.237
But before it can do that,

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.776
the antibody needs to leave the cell.

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:28.649
The antibody heads to the golgi apparatus.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.717
Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell.

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:35.118
Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane,

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:38.798
the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions,

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:41.355
telling it how to get to the edge of the cell.

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:42.184
When it gets there,

00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:45.975
the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses to the cell membrane.

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:47.954
The cell ejects the antibody,

00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:50.584
and it heads out to track down the virus.

00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:52.390
The leftover bubble will be broken down

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.980
by the cell's lysosomes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.916
and its pieces recycled over and over again.

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.079
Where did the cell get the energy to do all this?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.401
That's the roll of the mitochondria.

00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:04.719
To make energy, the mitochondria takes oxygen,

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.366
this is the only reason we breathe it,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.386
and adds electrons from the food we eat

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:11.457
to make water molecules.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.882
That process also creates a high energy molecule,

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:18.244
called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts.

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:20.964
Plant cells make energy a different way.

00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:22.103
They have chloroplasts

00:03:22.103 --> 00:03:24.205
that combine carbon dioxide and water

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.048
with light energy from the sun

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:27.769
to create oxygen and sugar,

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.345
a form of chemical energy.

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:32.294
All the parts of a cell have to work together

00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:34.532
to keep things running smoothly,

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:36.646
and all the cells of your body have to work together

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:38.949
to keep you running smoothly.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.520
That's a whole lot of cells.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.232
Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them.
