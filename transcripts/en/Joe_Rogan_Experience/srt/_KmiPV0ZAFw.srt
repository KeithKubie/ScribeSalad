1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,270
And when live, what's up, heavyweight
champion of the world. How does that feel?

2
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,240
Man said amazing. You
know, it's a big blessing.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,850
I'm just happy this is, it seem real.
It's still, yeah, of course it's real.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,180
Uh, for the first few weeks, the
first few days I was pinching myself.

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:21,780
See it fills, fills a dream
or nothing, but you know,

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm just really blessed to be here. I
want a big blessed honorable situation.

7
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:29,340
Right. You got soaps, like how many weeks
out did you find out about the fight?

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,170
Um, I think it was like a month,
a month and two weeks. Wow.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,820
Month and two weeks. I messaged JD
Hearns I told him, you know what,

10
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:40,050
give me the opportunity and what
do you know, you message back?

11
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:44,730
Me and my girl were just all happy.
Like whoa. That was crazy. Wow.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,450
And you were already in
camp, right? [inaudible]

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,730
so like it wasn't like they
close you out of shape? No,

14
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,930
it was after my fight against, uh,
Alexander to trinkle. Oh, that's right.

15
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,840
How much time did you
have off to recover? Um,

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,570
I just took like a week and
a half off fell. That's nine.

17
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,250
I went back to the gym and I, we'll
just ready and loose. So it was,

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,920
it couldn't have happened in a
perfect time. That's amazing. Um,

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,090
do you like it like that where you
just experienced a big fight so you're

20
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,530
already kind of used to the being
in the ring, being on television,

21
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,710
the whole moment of it all and then
boom, it happens again right afterwards.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,850
Yeah, of course. You know,
cause I was already loose,

23
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:25,330
I was already in fight mode.
So especially from, uh,

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,140
having the heavyweight
champion title, you know,

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm the opportunity to get that. It was
amazing. It was incredible fight, man.

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,400
It was incredible, man. Thank
you. It was really amazing.

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,780
What was amazing was when you got
dropped, you kept your composure,

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,470
you got up and then he tried to move
in for the kill and then you started

29
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,510
landing bombs on him and dropped him.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,620
And I remember jumping off the
bed while I was watching. Oh Shit.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,360
It was wild man fight. It was
my first time getting dropped.

32
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:59,300
And you know what? I'm, I don't feel
super hurt, you know, because I have,

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,061
when I got dropped,

34
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,660
he hit me with the a good right
hand and I took it like a champ.

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,950
But I got a man and I just throwing bombs.

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,930
You have fluid punches, man. I mean
it's, it's really interesting to watch.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,720
You're so efficient. Like
the way you throw punches,

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,360
you're not like grunting
and fucking digging.

39
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,790
Like there's a lot of guys that you see,

40
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,660
there's a tremendous amount of energy
that's expended every time they throw

41
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,650
punches. But you man, your punches
just coming bunches, they just pop.

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,330
You just fire them on nations.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,670
The combinations that we'd be working
at in the gym, many rollerblades.

44
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,340
That's why I had a trainer who throws a
lot of combinations as good at a working

45
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,900
speed. So I think we click
really good together. Well,

46
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:44,070
it's such a big asset for heavyweights
because most heavyweights,

47
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,900
they're throwing big bombs and they're
looking for that one punch. Yeah.

48
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,290
And you just pile them on man. And
you throw them at all these angles.

49
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,500
And especially when you get
in tight with dudes, you know,

50
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,920
like w when you're in tight
with dudes in these dogfights,

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,760
your punches are coming at these different
angles and so fluid is beautiful to

52
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,810
watch, man. Thank you man.
Especially with these big guys.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,570
I love fighting bigger guys. You know,

54
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:11,110
some one time I s I fought a guy that was
shorter than me and it was Kinda hard.

55
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,110
So imagine me pressuring bigger guys
and throwing these combinations at works

56
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,030
for me. Really good. It does.

57
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,050
And you're the first ever Mexican
heavyweight champion of the world.

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,210
Thanks to God. It's crazy man.

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,250
I mean you are in the same
league as a Cain Velasquez,

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,220
the first ever in UFC heavyweight
champion that was Mexican. Yeah,

61
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,820
I mean that's a, that's just
an incredible honor man.

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,460
Thanks man.

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,990
Have water shirt that the love you
must be getting from all the meaning.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,270
Oh my gosh, I can't even go to the
store without taking so many pictures.

65
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:48,730
People on a lines, they get off, uh,

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,590
like say if I'm in a
drive through somewhere,

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,240
they get off of their car and tries
to take pictures. But it's a blessing,

68
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:59,170
you know? I really appreciate it. All my
fans, all the supporters. It's amazing,

69
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,460
man. You know what was really cool was
the post-fight press conference when you

70
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,750
talking about it, you're like,
damn, you know, we made it.

71
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,970
And you were just saying,
we're seven. My mom. Yeah.

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Tell your mom that was
beautiful. Yeah, I can,

73
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,300
because a lot of people don't know
that we're, we're struggling a lot of,

74
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,860
even before this fight, you know,

75
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,861
and I'm going through a lot of the stuff
with a top rank with Bob Barron of me

76
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,900
not getting a lot of fights, a waiting,

77
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,960
waiting because I had one
more fight left with them,

78
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:33,100
so they didn't want to let me go,
so I had to pay my pay it off.

79
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,370
So now, yeah, everything
turned around so quick.

80
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,500
Sorry Bob. I fucked up. Yeah,
well there's a lot to do too.

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,050
We're not interested in
fighting you. You know? Um,

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,760
I had seen it was one of those things
where you were incredibly talented and

83
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,520
incredibly skilled, but you
didn't have the biggest name yet.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
So there wasn't like a
lot of money in it yet,

85
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,700
but there was a giant risk and
a lot of insiders were very,

86
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,080
very aware of this. You know,

87
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,410
guys who really followed boxing were
very aware of this and coming into that

88
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:02,980
fight,

89
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,210
like I talked to a lot of people that are
like big boxing fans and they're like,

90
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,840
that dude is alive dog.
That's a live dog. Like,

91
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,950
I mean for sure. Anthony
Joshua was a bad motherfucker.

92
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,430
He's a big giant muscular dude. It looks
like a dinosaur. But they were like,

93
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,470
Andy Ruiz is alive dog.
He could win that fucking,

94
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,830
it's because when they see me, they're
like, oh, look at this chubby kid, man.

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,130
He's going to get tired really fast.
He's just going to get knocked out.

96
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:31,270
But the real people that know about
boxing, they know the skills that I have,

97
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,550
the movement. Yeah, I could get a
little bit more fit and I'm more leaner,

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,080
you know, get the, the um,

99
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,950
like the extra fat turning into
muscle. I love to do that, you know,

100
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,840
but the thing is people love you because
you're kind of Chubby. Cause I, I'm me.

101
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,720
Well it's also you, you
like, you like, Hey,

102
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,300
you know people that like go to the
beach and don't want to take their shirt

103
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,990
off. You're like, fuck man, Andy
Ruiz is kinda built like me shit.

104
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,820
And he's the champion of the world. Yeah,
give, give these bad guys confident.

105
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,960
You know, it makes a big deal. Like
you remember when Butter Bean Pot,

106
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,380
potter bean was obviously
never a champ, but you know

107
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,030
[inaudible] because he was as big
fat guy. I would fuck people up.

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,760
You know what? I took a picture with a
butter being when I was at like thing.

109
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,970
I was like five years old,
six years old and the Quanah,

110
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:20,690
he fought over there and he
was a big guy, man, big guy.

111
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,190
He was a tank man.

112
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,690
That dude had some fucking pie where
he made everybody a starch. People,

113
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,510
you know, he really couldn't
go past four or five rounds,

114
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,920
but he would put a fucking beating
on you for four rounds. See,

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,670
when Johnny Knoxville from a,
that crazy asshole decided to hey,

116
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,000
they made him bleed or something
on that God. But he, they,

117
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,790
he let him punch him
for some crazy reason.

118
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,430
He decided to try to box with
butter beans, sprained them. It was,

119
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:53,360
this was not good. Don't
do that to people, man. Now
I'm going to sign a waiver.

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,620
So you're sitting pretty right now, man.
I mean, you're at the top of the heap.

121
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,650
You're the champ and you are the most
popular champ right now because you're the

122
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:06,410
guy who pulled off the giant upset
over the Olympic gold medalist,

123
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,810
the fucking the man, Anthony Joshua,

124
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:13,580
you knock him out and like th everyone
is sitting there chomping at the bit.

125
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,800
There's wilder who's, you know,

126
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,250
probably the greatest knockout artists
in the history, the heavyweight division.

127
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,510
And then there's Tyson
fury and Tyson fury.

128
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,970
And while they're trying to figure it out,

129
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,940
and then Tyson fury is now
in a different organization.

130
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,690
It's a hard to make the matches work
now. It's like what happens next for you?

131
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,040
You know? Um,

132
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,510
what's gonna be next is the rematch
against me and Anthony. Joshua,

133
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,010
we're still negotiating. Um, but
there's definitely going to be there.

134
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,050
We matched this year.
Exciting fight. Uh, but yeah,

135
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,820
but a wilder, you know, uh,

136
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,500
while they're wearing me and
him are on the same team.

137
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,430
I had a little interview with him over
there at the pack-out fight and really

138
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,740
cool dude. He's very
cool. He's really cool.

139
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,800
We would respect each other and um,

140
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,500
but that'll be a good fight, you know,
between me and him. I love that. Well,

141
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,900
I mean, people knew who he was before,

142
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,020
but God damn that Tyson fury fight put
him on the map. What anything raising.

143
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,780
I was really glad I was
there too. I was like, man,

144
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:12,980
I want to be in that position.

145
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,870
I want to be championed and kind of
motivating me, you know, there well,

146
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:20,560
you know, and then his, the fight
with Brazil afterwards where he,

147
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,160
he flat lined that one punch. He's an
interesting guy, man. He's so interesting.

148
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:25,431
You know,

149
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,820
his story that he didn't even start boxing
until he was like 20 something years

150
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,340
old and he really started
doing it because of a daughter,

151
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,010
because the daughter has medical
issues. Got into the Olympic team,

152
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:38,840
won a bronze medal a year and a half in
a boxing. That's crazy. Yeah, it's nuts.

153
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,210
But he's blessed, you know? Yeah.
Blessed. Like you man. I mean,

154
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,640
this is it. It's gotta be a crazy
feeling now like six months ago,

155
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,750
you're this struggling boxer, you know,
trying to make ends meet, you know,

156
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,870
working your way up, very respected.
We don't have that big name yet.

157
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,230
And then boom, you get the
opportunity of all opportunities.

158
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,100
I think that's what I need is just the
opportunity and be hungry, you know,

159
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,110
from having nothing to wanting
to want, uh, something, you know,

160
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,680
in life. It, it's a big motivation.
Especially with me. I have five kids,

161
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:17,700
so damn. Hello. I'm 29. Wow.

162
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,150
Five kids started early.
I know, but Mexican style,

163
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,970
Mexican style, definitely. Well, hey man,
your five kids are sitting pretty now,

164
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:30,010
man. Yeah, that's a
beautiful name. So you a,

165
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,920
there was a rematch that
is in negotiation. Now, how
much can you tell us? Um,

166
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,990
that is going to be in December
sometime. December. Uh, um,

167
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,170
uh, there's going to be, there's going
to come out pretty soon. You know, I,

168
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,520
I did tell you about telling anybody.
No, don't send it to the cameras are off.

169
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,500
Yeah. Um, but it's going to be this
year. It's going to be an exciting fight.

170
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,210
Me and Anthony, Joshua
rematch. Uh, but, um, the,

171
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,070
the words are gonna come out soon.
Where's it gonna be at? If anything,

172
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll message you and be like, Oh,
you already know actually. Well, um,

173
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,080
so now going into this rematch,

174
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,370
is there anything that you're going to
do differently? I mean, um, you know,

175
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,870
obviously now that he's well aware
you're a big threat, you know,

176
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,030
he's going to think about you. I mean,

177
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm sure he was aware you were threat
before, but when you stopped him,

178
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,210
you became the first guy to beat him. I
mean that, I mean, that changes history,

179
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,960
that thing. What we're
going to do. Uh, um, we're,

180
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,260
we're getting a big house over
there in Mexico, somewhere in the,

181
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,780
in the nowhere is, you know, so we're
going to have a close suited, uh, uh,

182
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,290
camp, you know, close camps.

183
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,900
So we're just going to be
really focused for this fight.

184
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,950
We're not underestimating him
or anything. Um, you know,

185
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,930
it was just got to work
hard and do it again.

186
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,990
She'll show people what
I'm capable of. Now.

187
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,380
How much changes now that you're
the champ, do you have, um,

188
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,860
do you change anything in your camp and
as far as your strength and conditioning

189
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,730
as far as nutrition or, um, as long
as we have all the team, you know,

190
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:07,590
the stuff that we need and the nutrition
is the chef, uh, um, the coaches,

191
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,220
you know, the, all the, all the stuff
that I need to, to win this fight,

192
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,160
especially training, you know, that
that's the main thing and trainings thing,

193
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:18,160
discipline and, and, um,
you know, praying to God.

194
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,080
Now I'm coming into the fight
with Joshua the first time.

195
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,620
Did you have a nutritionist? Did you
have a strength and conditioning coach?

196
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,280
And I did have one. Um, the plan was
not to lose too much weight, you know,

197
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,020
because the guy's really big, you know,

198
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:35,200
I want it to be heavy so I could
carry his weight and you know,

199
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,400
and it worked for my favor. But I think
the main thing that I'm going to do,

200
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,820
I might do a little bit of ways
just to tighten up a little bit. Uh,

201
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,620
but just they busy. That's the main
thing. Do you worry about like give,

202
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,030
it's not broke, don't fix it.

203
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:52,350
Like there have been guys before that
have made changes in the way they prepare

204
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,080
and those like maybe fuck with their
confidence or they didn't feel as good.

205
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,180
They didn't, they didn't
perform the same way. No,

206
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,510
I don't think we're going to be changing
too much of that stuff. You know,

207
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,300
as long as they're, it's training,
we have the good sparring, just,

208
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,190
just exactly what we
did for the last fight.

209
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,820
I think that's where we're going
to be doing this more intense. Now.

210
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:13,150
Do you have a guy that monitors
your heart rate? Do they,

211
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,990
did they take like logs of like what your
resting heart rate is when you get up

212
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,930
in the morning and your
heart rate variability and
all that kind of shit? Nah,

213
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,560
they don't, they don't do that. I'm Kinda
just old school, old school, you know,

214
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,740
work hard, wake up, run, train. Uh,

215
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,790
he good for like four or five days and
we have our little cheap meals, you know,

216
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,030
but you know, just, just have
a happy camp that, you know,

217
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:37,420
this is heavy weight camp. Like attire,
battery. Yeah. Heavyweight camps.

218
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:41,260
Nice weight cutting. Now what kind
of food they have you eating? Um,

219
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:46,240
right now I'm just, uh, just eating
like, you know, uh, sandwiches,

220
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,800
uh, sandwich steaks. Yeah. I just ate
a sandwich before I came on. So, well,

221
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:51,980
the beautiful thing about
beating heavyweights,

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,290
you don't have to worry about your weight,

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,290
but it's in terms of optimal performance,

224
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,810
like when your chef has you in camp, oh,

225
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,830
when will come and they feed
everything chicken. Me. Uh,

226
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,460
I try not to eat too much. Me, you
know, it takes too long to digest.

227
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:11,050
I get constipated, can
shit comfortable. But,

228
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,890
um, everything, no vegetables,
a lot of white rise. They tell,

229
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,390
they tell me not to eat too much white
rice, but I like white rice. Now.

230
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:22,540
Do they have you taking supplements
or anything like that? You know what,

231
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:27,010
for this fight I wasn't taking a lot
of slip them as just multivitamins. Um,

232
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,490
something to get me
through the training. Um,

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,270
yeah basically. And what kind of strength
of conditioning should they have?

234
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,570
You do and you running,
you running, sweating, um,

235
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,640
doing explosive stuff. Uh, a lot
of made work, a lot of millwork.

236
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,160
I think that's one of my favorite
things at the gym. Sparring,

237
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,080
beating people up and doing
millwork. Yeah, of course.

238
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,680
Right now you, you had an
extensive amateur career too, man,

239
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:58,420
which is a think a lot of like how
you're so well-schooled you know,

240
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,540
that that helped me a lot, you know. Um,

241
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,830
I first started training when I was six
years old and now I trained for a whole

242
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,760
year and when I was 70 years old,
I had my first amateur fight. Um,

243
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,330
I was always this big
Chubby kid where, uh,

244
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,360
there wasn't people at my age at
that weight. So I always had a fight.

245
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,320
Bigger guys and no older
guys. So my first fight I won,

246
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:24,520
but they gave it to the other guy at 12
years old, finding a seven year old. So,

247
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,260
but I got robbed, I got robbed. I
feel I dabbed your first fight and I,

248
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,800
and I had the video too. Oh,
just put that shit online. Yup.

249
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,390
Let the Internet decide. Wow. So
you first fight at seven years old.

250
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:38,980
That's incredible, man. That's,

251
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,250
there's no substitute for that guys
who get into combat sports young.

252
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,610
That's the guys who have what I was
talking about that you possessed before.

253
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:49,090
That sort of fluidity. The efficiency
to punches. It's like your,

254
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:53,780
you develop throwing punches. I, it's
all muscle memory type of, you know, um,

255
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,830
a lot of male work and she's
working hard, man, working hard.

256
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,830
And this is a sport that I
love and I've been doing.

257
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,970
This is the only thing that I know. So
thank God that it paid off, but I just,

258
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,790
it's, it's such an amazing
story. I love a story like that.

259
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,300
It's such a rocky story, such as
Cinderella story and I Cinderella,

260
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,050
it's amazing. Well, yeah,
everybody underestimated me there.

261
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,750
They're just waiting for me to, to
get knocked down. And then when they,

262
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,760
when they see me get knocked
down, they're like, oh.

263
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,930
And it's crazy that the announcers were
saying, oh, Anthony's a great finisher.

264
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,220
Look at how he's in, finish
him and what do you know?

265
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:29,240
I ended up getting them with
the, with the hook. Yeah.

266
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:33,680
It was crazy how many times you watched
the fight? Um, probably like 30 times,

267
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,160
30 times. And I still got
more, more to see, you know,

268
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:41,500
because when he come in with the
uppercut and the hook, um, I was Kinda,

269
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,970
I was kind of being on a
lazy mode, you know? Uh,

270
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,110
I think I need to put my geared
up more and move ahead more. Well,

271
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:51,800
he's a big powerful motherfucker,
but he's an outside fighter.

272
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,890
He likes to fight on the outside
and drop big power punches.

273
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,610
And that's where it became apparent
that like when you're in the dog fight,

274
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,090
when you guys are in tight, you have that
advantage. The fluidity in efficiency.

275
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,160
And I think it's, I think it was the
speed that I kind of messed them up,

276
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,780
you know, and I'm not, I'm not just
the one, two, three fighter, a puncher,

277
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:16,490
you know, and I try to throw more than,
than one or two punches. So no dude,

278
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:20,630
you know, throw hailstorms shit
coming away from all kinds of angles.

279
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,570
It's awesome man. So you're in this
amazing position now, um, when you're,

280
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:28,400
you're headed into this fight, how long
did it take to negotiate the rematch?

281
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm sure you had some sort of
a contract clause, right? Yeah,

282
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:34,940
we had a contract clause, uh, which has
been going back and forth, you know,

283
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,870
with my team and their team. Cause they
were trying to get you to go to England.

284
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,070
Yeah. But now I want to say it in
America, but in, there's some, we don't,

285
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,180
we can't say what's happening.

286
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,110
I love to have it back over there at
the Madison Square Garden, you know,

287
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,170
loves to run it back.

288
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:51,380
And [inaudible] how about the staples
center and the Staples Center?

289
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,630
That's what I said to and
when one of the interviews,

290
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:58,130
but for Vegas Move Vegas would
have been great too. Yeah, right.

291
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,060
But wherever it is is going to be an
amazing fight and amazing venues. So,

292
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,380
but tune in is there, the
announcement is going to be in soon.

293
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,100
Now is this gonna be on design
again on the zone? Beautiful. Um,

294
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,770
it's so nice. You could
just watch it on app. Yeah,

295
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,040
we're watching your phone and
watching a laptop. And um,

296
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,910
when you see the rest of the heavyweight
division meeting, what a crazy,

297
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:23,780
exciting time for boxing. Lauzon
comes in these waves, right?

298
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,250
And we're like this waves of awesome
shit happening right now as a hot wave.

299
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:32,690
Canelo's hot. You know, Manny just
won the title at 40 years old,

300
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,320
you know, triple g and canal, they're
talking about having another fight.

301
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,940
It's so amazing right now. It's
like boxing is on fire. That is,

302
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:45,650
you know, and I'm just blessed to be
in there and in the top 10, you know,

303
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,600
and having the unified heavyweight
champions. But, you know, uh,

304
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm willing to fight anybody
as soon as I, um, when the,

305
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:59,400
the rematch, I'm willing to fight Tyson
fury or wilder or anybody, you know,

306
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,300
that's all. Well, listen,

307
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:05,010
there's never been a time that I can
recall where there's four legitimate

308
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:09,180
heavyweight champions that everybody
thinks of. Like, look, Anthony,

309
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:11,910
Joshua could have been the
man, you know, Tyson fewer.

310
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,470
He could be the man while
there could be demand.

311
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,970
You could be the man who's the
fucking man. It's like, no one knows.

312
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,950
It's not like during the Tyson era,

313
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,970
it was like Tyson and everybody else
was just, just waiting to get murked.

314
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,690
You know, like there's been times
where there was a standout fighter,

315
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,190
but when you, when Joshua beat Klitschko,

316
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,590
it was apparent that Joshua was the guy.

317
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,190
But then as wilder started piling
up bodies, it's like, damn,

318
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:42,500
maybe Wilder's the guy and then
Tyson fury comes back, you know?

319
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,260
And like a lot of people had written
Tyson fury off after the Klitschko fight.

320
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,180
They were like, you know,
he kind of went crazy,

321
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,330
almost committed suicide and all these
mental health problems and now he seem

322
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,950
super happy and healthy.
And so it's this incredible,

323
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,330
incredible time for boxing where you
have like in terms of star power and in

324
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,310
terms of like the public interest,

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,640
I can't recall a time in my life with
has been for dudes who were at the top of

326
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:12,360
the heap like this. Yeah, a Tyson
phrase, a good guy. It's, you know,

327
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,200
I love his personality, his
energy. And you know what if I, if,

328
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,710
if I want to see that fight again
while during fury, you know?

329
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,350
And those are really good fight.
I think it was really close.

330
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,690
If Walter wouldn't have knocked
him down in the last round,

331
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:28,500
I think Tyson freer was winning
in my eyes. I think so too.

332
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,500
And I think you could make an argument
that he still won even though he got

333
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:35,010
knocked down twice in the
five. Yeah. It's still,

334
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,770
you make a good argument that
he still won the decision.

335
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,210
I know a lot of people think he did,

336
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:44,211
but I didn't have a problem with the
decision just because of action does not

337
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,630
end the way wilder knocked him down
and that final well like what the fuck?

338
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,610
How did he get up? That was,

339
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:55,170
what was crazy like when while there
like two was a stomach crosses throat and

340
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
with Oh fuck, it's over
and he's shaking his head.

341
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,590
He thought it was off and then Tyson
fury just rises from the dead like a

342
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:05,910
fucking Zombie. It's just as crazy man
in the heavyweight division, you know?

343
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,020
It only takes one punch to change the
whole game, the whole, the whole fight,

344
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:14,100
you know? And that's the beauty of
it. It is the beauty of it. Now.

345
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,510
What is it like,

346
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,290
like getting accustomed to all this
recognition now I know you've got this new

347
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,670
ice, you got an ar hanging
phone spending a little,

348
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,730
that heavyweight champion. Shailene
jeweler. Yeah man. Dude, your,

349
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,390
I mean your whole life is like shifted.
Like what does that feel like? Shit,

350
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,620
it feels good. You know, just get in the
stuff that I always wanted. You know,

351
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:39,450
seeing a lot of famous, uh, people
having nice stuff, you know,

352
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:39,870
and uh,

353
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,500
thanks to God and now I could just
get it from myself and from my family,

354
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,800
from my kids. My mom. I'm gonna call you
driving now. Um, I have a Rolls Royce.

355
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,110
You stepped right up. You
didn't even fuck around.

356
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,040
You didn't even try BMW first.
Nah, I already had that before.

357
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,220
What were you driving before you
won the title? Um, I had a Porsche.

358
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:05,540
I had a Porsche Panamera oh, those
are nice. But it's our roles wise. No,

359
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,580
Rolls Royce is a king car.

360
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,700
You know what the car that I love
right now and I bought from my,

361
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,090
from my fiance Julie. Uh,
it's the new g wagons.

362
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,850
It's 2019 so beautiful shine.
My wife is one of those.

363
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,430
Yeah, the other shit. She was lucky.
Those are dope man. That's a crazy car.

364
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,460
It's, they redesigned it. They made it
so that the old ones, they had like a,

365
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,470
that old truck suspension with the live
rear and front axles and it was kind of

366
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,970
bumpy and shit. I love
it, man. When you move it,

367
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,980
when the car moves that like the
seats hug you, that's a tank too.

368
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,430
Yeah. Those doors we a
thousand pounds. It's crazy.

369
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,930
We shut those things like a
bank vault, you know? Yeah.

370
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,630
But there's something about a Rolls Royce
man that's like a suitable car for a

371
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,940
champ. You know, you run around
the room. All my dream car man,

372
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:55,360
my dream car I even had pictures of
before. I wasn't even in any of that.

373
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,090
Nothing. I used to have
pictures on my, on my,

374
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,020
on my wall of other cars that I wanted
a Lamborghini, Rolls Royce, you know,

375
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,810
just dreaming big. Right. And that's
what I tell a lot of these kids,

376
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,720
managers that dream big
have, have 'em right.

377
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:12,220
Something that you want in life and just
keep, keep praying for it, you know,

378
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:15,680
keep wishing for it and it will
come true. You work hard. Yeah.

379
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,610
If you work hard. Some people
just want to wish, no. Yeah.

380
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,960
They got to work hard. There's
a lot of shit involved. Yeah.

381
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,590
Do you use any sort of
a sports psychologist or
anything like that? Um, no,

382
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:30,580
not really. No. Just
motivation. My kids, uh,

383
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,190
um, you know, just a person that wants
to do betters and to do better. Right.

384
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,740
And so when you are preparing
for a fight, do you,

385
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,770
um, do you ever have moments
where you, you know, you'll,

386
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,870
you'll find yourself feeling down
or you find yourself not, yeah,

387
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,510
there's mental place now. There's
a lot of times like that, you know,

388
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,450
because I'm missing home. I'm like,
man, I want to go with my kids.

389
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:59,590
I want to go with my girl. Oh,
I'm, I'm, I'm mad man. I haven't,

390
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,140
I haven't fucked or nothing, so I'm
fucking angry. And um, you know,

391
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,810
stuff like that. That's what a lot
of boxers go through, you know,

392
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:12,310
because this is a lonely sport, you know,
this was a one man sport and you know,

393
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,800
you got to do everything on
your own and not on your own.

394
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,470
But when you go to the gym, you have
routine, but you just after the gym as,

395
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,210
as what you do, you know, I
usually just rest, watch movies.

396
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,820
I'm trying to go to show, find a show,
just relax, just chill out. Do A,

397
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,710
get regular massage or anything. Yep.
I get massages, um, from ar therapy,

398
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,930
uh, from La. Uh, he hooks it up like
every, I probably when I'm in camp,

399
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:40,420
I'll get one like to two
times a week, three times.

400
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,440
So basically it's normal stuff, just
normal strength and conditioning food.

401
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,360
It's the grind of camp is something
that boxers always complained about.

402
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:53,810
That's like one thing is
this to the day in, day out,

403
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,940
just hard work constantly.

404
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,330
You know what sex for for a lot of the
fighters too is going in there and you

405
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,050
know, your coach wants you away,

406
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,530
you after training every fucking
time and you're like, man.

407
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,410
And it's crazy. But you know, I
was just working hard. It's, it's,

408
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,210
it's, everything's in a payoff.
What did they like to keep you at?

409
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,160
Like what weight did they
like to keep you out? Um,

410
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:20,000
I think like at two 55 to 50, that's
where you feel like you're your best.

411
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,350
I'm at my best at two 50
by two 50. But I gained to,

412
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,240
what did I wait like two 67
for Joshua really purpose.

413
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,570
Just because he saw me. Huh?
Yeah, I kind of worked out.

414
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,680
It definitely worked out. Now what
did you do differently? Um, nothing.

415
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,180
No, it was good. Just I'm
more portion, you know,

416
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:45,380
a little bit more portion and I was just
happy through all this camp. You know,

417
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,900
I was just focused, motivated. Uh,

418
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,640
I kept telling everybody
that I'm going to win,

419
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,190
that I'm going to pull out
the upset and you know,

420
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,960
just having those good vibes inside
you. Uh, and the fun camp, you know,

421
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,880
it was fun. I enjoyed the camp a lot.

422
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,830
The only thing that people worry about
when someone finds success and you know,

423
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:07,670
obviously Tyson is the best example
of it because he's documented in his

424
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:12,671
documentary and he talks about all the
time was how things got out of control.

425
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,150
Once he became famous, I was,

426
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,450
things just went off the rails and he
just lost his fucking mind. How do you,

427
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,190
how do you prevent that from
happening and you were weeds.

428
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,620
I think just having the right
people around you. You know,

429
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:29,300
having the right people around you that
want to do good and want you to do good,

430
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,990
you know, I'm bringing you good
opportunities, you know, stuff like that.

431
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:37,570
And you know, I'm a, I'm a family man.
I'm always with my kids, with my fiances.

432
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,580
So, um, that's one of the
big blessings that I have.

433
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,170
And if that would've happened, I think
my dad will grab me by the throat, like,

434
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,720
what the fuck are you
doing? He's always on me.

435
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:52,330
So you seem like a real down to Earth
Guy, which helps a lot, you know?

436
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,690
I mean that, that really does,

437
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,750
it's the dudes that have feeling like
sometimes the ego is what gets you to the

438
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:02,720
dance because you believe you are
the baddest motherfucker of all time.

439
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,220
But then once you are there
and the challenge is met,

440
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,120
then there's no other challenges
in front of you, like with Tyson.

441
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,720
And each fight is kind of like a done
deal before it happens and you just start

442
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:19,700
getting tigers and doing crazy shit,
you know, recently with tigers. Yeah.

443
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,460
Nah. Um, then the main thing just
remain humble, you know? Um, I,

444
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,820
um, I was praying for this
opportunity for so long,

445
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:32,960
so I'm still gonna continue to keep
praying and thanking God for all these big

446
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:35,060
blessings that he gave me and you know,

447
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:38,570
just continue to work hard and
enjoy my family to the fullest.

448
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,700
And you've got a good crew of
dudes with you too. You can tell.

449
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,740
I know this is you're saying this the
biggest entourage that the hat and I

450
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,530
never, I never rolled
everybody's ever brought in here.

451
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,400
I never wrote with a lot of entourage
and not just with a few of my best

452
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,660
friends, you know, friends,

453
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,320
close friends that were from high
school and some of my cousins and that's

454
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:57,600
awesome. Stuff like that.
Just family who know you.

455
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,370
He's actually known you
from the beginning. Now I'm
this new found celebrity,

456
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,900
like are they giving you like there's
other distractions that come your way,

457
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,890
like, like movie type offers and
television shit. You know what?

458
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,970
I did my first commercial, uh, for
sweat away exhales and, and uh,

459
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,260
it's a Masco brand. What is it? A
sweat o x sweat o x sweat away. It's a,

460
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,720
it's a drink, you know,
like, uh, like pedia light,

461
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,260
but it's a Mexican version and it
was fun, man. It was really fun.

462
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,340
I loved doing commercials. Have you
been to Mexico since you one? I have.

463
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,650
You remember I met the
president of Mexico.

464
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:39,120
I went to Los Pinos and that was
amazing man. Um, um, that is Lopez.

465
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,950
He's the president for, for med school.

466
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:45,951
Amazing guy is a wild being in Mexico
was the first ever Mexican heavyweight

467
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:50,280
champion and it was super wild.
So many, so many fans, you know,

468
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,150
little kids, uh, of, um,

469
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,160
all types of sort of people come
in my way and it's just crazy how,

470
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,420
how they react, you know, how they react
or screaming. Like it's crazy, man.

471
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:04,470
I was, must be the,

472
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,560
the wildest thing about this is the shift
in how people perceive you versus just

473
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,270
a few months ago and now like
you're the fucking man. It's,

474
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,680
it's weird, right? It's crazy.
Does that mean what does, what,

475
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,110
what goes on in your head while
all this has happened? Um,

476
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,810
that this is just the beginning. You know,

477
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,400
this is just the beginning and you know,

478
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,330
I don't wanna I don't
want to lose the title.

479
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,580
So the main thing I could just gotta
stay focused and get prepared for the

480
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:37,230
rematch. You know, cause there's more
work to be done. So, and um, you know,

481
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,640
I want to be the Mexican Rockies so I
want to continue to keep winning and

482
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,010
defending all my titles. That's beautiful.

483
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:49,011
Now Joshua is the first fight and
so this will take place in December.

484
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,540
And given if you win, what would you
like to, who would you like to face next?

485
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Cause it looks like it's going to be a
while before they could sort out Tyson

486
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,900
fury and Deontay wilder. Um,
because of contractual shit.

487
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,900
Uh, when I, when and, and Sealskin
I went for the rematch. Uh,

488
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,610
I love to fight Tyson fury man sizing
fury. I know wilder Wilder's there too.

489
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:15,660
He has the belt that, that I want,
you know, cause I want the WBC bell.

490
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,380
Why do you want that belt? Because
I'll be undisputed if I have that bell,

491
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:22,800
you know, I have all the belts. I'm
in the heavyweight division and I'll,

492
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,970
I'll be the new king. Do you have not?

493
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:28,710
You have WBA I have the WBA.

494
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:32,970
WBO I beo and IBF. Damn.

495
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,590
I know. Damn, that's crazy. I
should've brought him to man. Shut up.

496
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,020
Do what you just have
laid out on your bed? No,

497
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:42,670
they're actually in my at
Dad's house. They're actually,

498
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,960
I thought my dad's house must be bizarre.
Just looking at them. Right? They are,

499
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:51,430
man. It's, I was crying, man. Like I
said, I was still pinching myself for,

500
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,590
for weeks. I can only imagine.

501
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,100
I would imagine it's getting the
last years before really, really,

502
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,950
really sinks in. So, uh,

503
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,980
Tyson fewer seems to you to be like the
best matchup after that size. Inferior.

504
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,570
I think that he's, well, he's one of the
biggest names out there, you know? Um,

505
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,160
I, I liked Dylan, Dylan White, so,
you know, he was coming up, but um,

506
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:15,670
he got caught up with stop it. Uh, what
did he get? What did he get caught with?

507
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,220
I don't know. I think
it was PD or something,

508
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:20,860
some sort of performance enhancing.
I don't know why they do that.

509
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,250
I know why they want to win. Shit. I,
you don't need it man. Look at me. I'm,

510
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,450
it doesn't look like if I take anything.
And I was just on natural. Well,

511
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,770
you're consistent and even
though you carry body fat,

512
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,530
you're always in great shape. You know,
you never have a problem with fatigue.

513
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,330
I have a six pack under my bed.
It's in the valley somewhere. Yeah,

514
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,130
I mean that's deceptive. You know,

515
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,850
there's quite a few fighters like that
that you look at them on the outside and

516
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:53,080
you can get real confused, you know?
But you have always been consistent.

517
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:56,230
Like you had a consistent amateur
career, consistent professional career.

518
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,180
Some fighters just like they,

519
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,570
maybe they just feel like they
need something else, you know?

520
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:04,270
They just don't feel like they're
doing enough and they want it.

521
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,650
They want a shortcut. It's
usually, it's usually a bad sign,

522
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,150
you know? And in today's
climate it's, look, there's,

523
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,000
there's Vata testing and
there's the best, you know,

524
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,730
that was my first time getting tested.

525
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,950
And by Vida and they're fucking
strict man. They go there,

526
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,540
they'll go look for you wherever you're
at, at your house, at the gym, anywhere.

527
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,040
And um, they take blood
out, piss out. I liked it.

528
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,980
Yes. Um, I think it's the best way.

529
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,330
And you Sada is what works with the
UFC. Very similar, same sort of deal.

530
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:39,130
They wake you up six o'clock
in the morning, hey buddy,

531
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,950
time to find out what's up, you know,

532
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,750
and they've caught a
lot of people that way.

533
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,720
They caught a lot of people and it's
great. It cleans up the sport, you know,

534
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,260
I mean this, uh, this is a dangerous,

535
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,510
dangerous sport and when
people are taking things, they,

536
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,110
there's a potential that they could hit
you when they wouldn't be able to hit

537
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:59,830
you without it. And I mean, this is a
something that we all want to avoid.

538
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,341
We all know,

539
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:04,610
avoid anything that could potentially
mean it's already a dangerous enough,

540
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,740
some balls out. It's already trying to
kill each other and all that. Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:12,730
So Dillon white is, I mean, how long
they suspended him for? Um, I'm not sure.

542
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:17,490
I seen it on Instagram, but you
know, things happen. But you know,

543
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,310
hopefully it gets clean and, or we don't
know what really happened. You know,

544
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:25,960
maybe there was a team side of that
puts something in it or we don't know.

545
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,500
Yeah. It could be PR. When we
catch this a lot with the UFC,

546
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,490
we're guys buy a supplement at like
a vitamin store and it's tainted.

547
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,710
Or even like a diet one holiday.
They been that soon. Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,240
Anything that has like a diarrhetic
things along those lines. Yeah,

549
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,760
it's a as a shame. But you know,

550
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
if they're not using Vada
testing and they get caught,

551
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,800
then they're just dumb. Cause
then it doesn't, it means that,

552
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,200
that's what I was kind of scared. You
know, fighting over there at the UK.

553
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,130
We don't know what they're gonna be
letting our Anthony Joshua be taking or

554
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,540
whatnot or, I don't know,
take some shit. I don't know.

555
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,480
Tell you what she looks like. He
does. He does. He looks like it.

556
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:08,780
But it looks like what you would
think a movie fighter would look like.

557
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,010
You know, like he's, he's
just, he's built perfect,

558
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,710
like he's got a perfect body. Like
you wouldn't want to change anything,

559
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,890
you know, like if you're making a
sculpture, like damn nailed it. Yeah.

560
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,350
You know, but that, I don't know if
that's natural. What do you think?

561
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't know if he took something,
you know, it didn't work. If he,

562
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,230
if he doesn't wear, if he doesn't
use it for the next fight,

563
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:37,010
I don't know who knows how the body's
gonna react or if he doesn't have it. So,

564
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,310
or maybe, um,

565
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,740
reacted wrong when he wasn't using it
when I follow him or that's possible.

566
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,480
That's definitely happened before. That's
definitely happened before. You know,

567
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,810
you've seen fighters that look different
because of stricter testing and then

568
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,390
they don't perform the same
way. They have like real proud.

569
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,770
And then also it's confidence.

570
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,280
If you know you've been cheating and
then all of a sudden they take away your

571
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:01,010
secret weapon and then you just,
you're like, I'm fine, I'm fine,

572
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:05,720
but you in this little league out. Yep.
So you worried about that? If, if I,

573
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,740
if the fight takes place in
the UK, uh, you know, somewhat,

574
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,160
but it's not going to be over there.
So he's never tested positive before.

575
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,860
Right. He's never have, so
you just gave up the ghost,

576
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,030
you said it's not going to be over there.

577
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,600
So now the people have narrowed
it down. There's 197 countries,

578
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,500
now we know it's not going to be in
England. No, that's not okay. 196.

579
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah, it's uh, in combat sports. I
mean, it's always been a problem.

580
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,800
Performance enhancing drug.
Now everybody's been using
it. A lot of champions,

581
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:40,220
you know, from the heavyweight division
two, a lot of sure. A lot of people.

582
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,260
Yeah. But I dunno, I don't want to
try it. I don't want to get caught up.

583
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:45,911
Well, it's,

584
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:49,880
it's beautiful that you haven't had it
and you can take pride that everything

585
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:53,240
that you've accomplished is from hard
work and intelligence. Yeah, sure that.

586
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,890
So when you look at the landscape
of boxing, I mean, right now, uh,

587
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,930
what fights are exciting for you?
Um, I want to see that pack out and,

588
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,130
uh, what's his name? Thurman? No. Uh,

589
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,960
um, uh, the guy that fought, uh,

590
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,630
many, um, Mikey Garcia. Oh,

591
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:21,610
Earl span arrow span or else Penn's
chant like him. He's a bad motherfucker.

592
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,660
Wish the shutdown Garcia like that.
Garcia is a bad motherfucker. He was,

593
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:30,470
I was over there in Vegas with him.
It was funny. Well, when Garcia look,

594
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,470
I give it up to Garcia cause after that
fight, he's like, that guy is the truth.

595
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,660
Yeah. The guy's the
real deal. And you know,

596
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,450
that's beautiful when a guy doesn't
make excuses and says, hey man, I guys,

597
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,210
he's, everybody knew Earl. Spence
is a bad motherfucker though.

598
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,670
I mean there was no surprise once you
have him fight like the really elite

599
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:51,660
fighters, I think that's when highest
talents is in a show. Oh sure. Yeah.

600
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:56,190
I mean it's such a great time for boxing
or Earl spends junior versus Manny

601
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,530
pack. That would be incredible.
Yeah. They're working on it.

602
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,430
Is that what they're working on?

603
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,940
I thought they were working on a rematch
with Thurman. Uh, I don't think so. No.

604
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,330
No. Who wants to see
that? Man, I want to see,

605
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,440
you don't want to say I think
Pacquiao beat his ass. Fuck yeah.

606
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,860
It was crazy when he knocked him
down. The first round was huh? Wow.

607
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,840
I think he got too
confident at the many pack.

608
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,260
Y'All got too confident and he got hit
with punches that he shouldn't have.

609
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:23,070
You know? And I don't know, I think
Thurman was just surviving the whole time,

610
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,560
but either way he was
connecting really good shots.

611
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,870
He connected with good
shots and then he hits hard.

612
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,490
The crazy thing is Manny is the oldest
ever guy to win the welterweight title.

613
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,510
40 years old.

614
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,310
He's won titles in how many different
weight classes now it's more than eight.

615
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,450
Like 12. I don't know something,

616
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,920
but it's like eight more than eight
different weight classes, which is nuts.

617
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,180
Like who the fuck does that?

618
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,540
And then maintains his power
all the way through it.

619
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,200
He just takes care of himself,
you know. Amaz I am white rice,

620
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,520
whatever it's doing in the Philippines,
so it's amazing. But um, yeah,

621
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,870
that's a great fight. Um,

622
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,590
and then there's Mayweather who shows
up at that fight and talking shit.

623
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:06,330
And I think that'd be a good fight
against Manny pack young Mayweather. Oh,

624
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:10,230
watch it. Apparently according to
Khabib number, I bet on it could be.

625
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,780
You've never been better off as
the UFC lightweight champion,

626
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,850
bad Russian motherfucker. He's, um,
he's saying that that Floyd May,

627
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:20,580
where there's people have been trying
to get him to box him. Uh, that's crazy.

628
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,510
Wow. Floyd made that an easy money
off Conor McGregor. That's crazy.

629
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,370
He probably thinks I do
too. I mean, a crazy, well,

630
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,840
Floyd played that perfectly too.

631
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:35,160
You don't give Connor like six weeks
to prepare. You know, he, uh, you know,

632
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,790
he took the lion's share of the
money but gave Connor shitload.

633
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,260
He made a lot of money off that fight.
Yeah, man. Where there's smart man,

634
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,770
like I said, having the right
people, which you and that,

635
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,920
that give you good opportunities.

636
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,220
Those are the right people you want
around you. Now, when you were coming up,

637
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:55,110
um, who are you influenced by?
Like, who are you a big fan of? Um,

638
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,000
of Chavez, you know, all the Mexican
fighters. Moralez Barrera I got to meet.

639
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,050
Um, I've, I read, I was my first
time. It was a good honor over that.

640
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,490
The pack y'all fight. Uh, you
know, my Tyson, um, you know,

641
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:13,380
all the, all the big guys, all the
Mexican guys as well too. Yeah.

642
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:18,780
Um, so you're 29, so when you were,
when you first started out, who was, uh,

643
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,240
who was big? Fernando
Vargas hills man. Fernando.

644
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,140
Fernando on the plane was, yeah.
Mesa have the same haircut as him. I,

645
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,970
I painted my, my hair. That was crazy.
Yeah. No, he was a bad motherfucker.

646
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,200
He was a lot of fun to watch.

647
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,830
Didn't he had some reality show he was
doing it to write on it with him and his

648
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:41,260
family. What is he doing
now? Do you know? Um,

649
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:45,340
he's training fighters and his kids
too. They're really talented. Um,

650
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,210
we're at in Vegas. Yes. Yeah. Nice. No,

651
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:54,100
they have really good people. Nice
guys. Oscar de la Hoya. Your fan of his,

652
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,950
yeah. I'll share a little to this. I mean,

653
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,810
there's so many great Mexican fighters.

654
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:02,560
If you think about one country that
produced a basing boxers, I mean,

655
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,890
Mexico might be the top
of the heap. I mean,

656
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,110
if you really started to
think about it, I think, um,

657
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,580
I think we're missing one champion.

658
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,700
I think we'd have champions in
all the divisions except for one.

659
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,130
I think light heavyweight maybe. Probably
cruiserweight. Cruiserweight I think.

660
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,060
I think so. But you know what?

661
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:22,090
At least we got the first Mexican
heavyweight champion. Yeah,

662
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,490
that's a field man. So crazy. Those
good, you know, just my saying,

663
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,610
I'm going to be, I'm in
the records, you know, um,

664
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,760
hopefully nobody forgets
my name, but you know,

665
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,400
there's always going to be the first
Mexican heavyweight champion of the world,

666
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:40,060
especially for my kids. You know, for
them to look up and be like forever. Yeah.

667
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,290
My Daddy never kick your daddy's
ass. It'd be number one. I mean,

668
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,040
you're the first ever does. No one ever
can take that from front. That's it.

669
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,780
Forever. Blessing man. Read the books.

670
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,930
This is what I'd been working for for
so long. You know, my dad pushing me,

671
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:56,050
embarrassing me and with my friends. Um,

672
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,640
how do you actually just by kicking
me out by telling me, come on.

673
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,580
We had to go try and get the
fuck out of there. I Dunno.

674
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,390
It was crazy, man. My Dad's
always been there behind me,

675
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:12,070
so I don't think I would've been in this
position if he wasn't in the role of

676
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:14,200
all this. Is Your Dad a boxer? No,

677
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:19,000
but his dad used to train fighters and
my heat Kelly. Oh, a long time ago.

678
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,750
I never got to meet him, but, and
he never boxed himself. Um, no.

679
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,230
It was just in the streets. Did
he train? No, he'll just see.

680
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,780
It was just see his, his
dad trained other guys.

681
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,640
I didn't think he had the
discipline. I think it was,

682
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,280
he was more like a hustler basically.

683
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,200
So what was his thought when
you first started finding, well,

684
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,620
he's the one who put me into
it because, yeah, because, um,

685
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,400
I used the destroy your, I used to
destroy everything, all the, the toys, uh,

686
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,650
my mom's stuff, everything. So it
has so much energy as a little kid.

687
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:54,820
He just took me to, after my first
thing was karate. I tried karate.

688
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:57,070
I was six years old, didn't like it.

689
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:01,780
It took too long for action or
whatnot. And he put me in the boxing.

690
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,650
I was six years old. And what do you
know? I fell in love with the sport.

691
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,830
So what do you mean by t
took too long for action? Um,

692
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,180
I think we were practicing too much
or something. I like Katas and Chile.

693
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,050
And the first two weeks
when I went to a boxing gym,

694
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:21,010
they made me spar in the kick, kick the
shit out of me, man. They beat me up.

695
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,830
I knew he was seven. I was, no, I
was six and a half. You remember?

696
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,270
Cause I trained a whole year. And so I
turned the right. Um, they beat me up.

697
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,710
They put me this far my first time
and I was bleeding and I told my dad,

698
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,640
you know what? I don't want to fight
no more like that. What do you mean?

699
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:37,370
You just got to keep training and
you're gonna end up beating everyone up.

700
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,070
And what do you know? A year later
I ended up beating heroin up.

701
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,750
So your nickname came from you fucking
things up as a kid. Fucking things up.

702
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:45,890
Just showing things.

703
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:51,310
I could never have a toy or ar or even
like a the game boy or anything for like

704
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:55,600
more than a week or something cause
I would end up breaking it. Right.

705
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,510
So did your parents give you that
nickname? Yeah. That's hilarious.

706
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,310
That's what a great nickname. That
seems like a tough guy nickname.

707
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,770
But then when you find out it's because
you were a little kid and you would

708
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,200
break your toys. That makes
it even better. Every,

709
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:14,000
not just toys but everything classes.
Uh, I don't know. It was crazy.

710
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:19,270
So it must be wild for your dad to see
you come up from a six year old kid and

711
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,820
you know,

712
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,820
because of his pushing you and trying
to keep you in there that you eventually

713
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,400
start excelling and winning
amateur fight after amateur fight.

714
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:32,570
And then he's really happy
manager. They happy. And, um,

715
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,010
uh, like I said, he's really
happy. He's really blessed.

716
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,430
He's over here and over there
just enjoying life as well.

717
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,870
Now when you were coming up to,

718
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,240
was their fighter who
style you tried to emulate,

719
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,910
was there anyone that like really
stood out for you? You know,

720
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,090
I sparked a lot of guys in the hill.
All of them telling me that I have, uh,

721
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,070
my own type of style. You know,

722
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:56,660
they tell me that I have a calm
different style than, than everyone else.

723
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,930
And you know, I kinda, I like that would,

724
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:03,910
that is one of the beautiful things about
boxing and all martial arts like this.

725
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:06,860
A lot of people that don't like that
term martial arts cause they don't think

726
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:08,870
it's really an art, but it is an art.

727
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,250
I think it's harder man shit from
being in the ground and fighting up.

728
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,640
It's a lot of things you have to learn.
Oh, for mixed martial arts. Yeah.

729
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:20,660
But I mean even boxing as a martial art
and what I mean is that like the way you

730
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:24,680
knocked out Joshua, that was
beautiful. It was beautiful for a,

731
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:28,070
for a person like me who
loves boxing, it was art.

732
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,340
Like you expressed yourself in art.

733
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I mean that's no different than a badass
movie or a rap song or a symphony.

734
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,620
It's art. It's just art with your
fists. And you know, I mean, you saw,

735
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,870
I'm sure you saw that video that
I posted up on my Instagram.

736
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,440
Who was the guy that made that video,
that video where he hits Joshua and Josh,

737
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,580
his soul leaves his body.

738
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,920
He goes on the airplane and I was
a funny man. That guy's amazing.

739
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,880
What is his, what is it? Five, four?

740
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:02,320
What we're going to find out is it
Instagram and give them some prompts cause

741
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,990
seven 47 right around seven 47 put that,

742
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,720
put that up so we could watch that again.
This, that guy is a goddamn genius.

743
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,960
Cause he didn't just do it with that.
He did it with Deontay versus Brazil.

744
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,870
He gave him a fantasies, a power fist.

745
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,300
This guy does amazing. Animate.
This one's not on Jamie. Oh,

746
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,920
the guy does a amazing,
uh, animation. I mean,

747
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:28,280
I don't even know how the fuck he does
something like that. I'm what program,

748
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:30,980
but this was my favorite
play. Play this Jamie

749
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,533
through Joshua through

750
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,460
here. Boom. Look at that. What do you see?

751
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,700
The soldiers leaves his body a blue.

752
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:46,290
So he gets the roller bag. He's
on the, he's on the escalator.

753
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,660
He gets on the plane and they'll go,

754
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,360
the tweety birds are flying around
his head. That is hilarious man.

755
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,220
That guy's a God damn genius Ray Rod,
seven four seven. Thanks a lot buddy.

756
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
No, he's genius. How many
millions of views that should get?

757
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,410
Well I think you re posted it and I
got a lot more views than on his page.

758
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:09,411
His got like 730 (630) 730-5000
but on mine it was millions.

759
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,890
Yeah, no, it's crazy. He's,

760
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:17,130
he does a lot of great shit in MMA and
in boxing there's been a lot of that,

761
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,410
right? A lot of memes. Yeah,

762
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,690
I liked it, you know, and
now they have my own ones.

763
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,570
So it's amazing to have
your own one. What?

764
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,660
Like the Mimi's that they put out
above me hitting a Anthony Joshua,

765
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:34,410
you know, stuff like that. Having me
there and looking at it, I'm just like,

766
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:39,240
wow, man. It was crazy.
Yeah. Wild. Right. So you,

767
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,550
you didn't emulate anybody when you're
coming up. It's not like Chavez or,

768
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:47,970
or Barrera. You like tried to imitate
their style or type of course. Yeah,

769
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,020
of course. Like Tyson, you know,

770
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:52,980
everybody wants to knock
everybody out like Tyson and um,

771
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,110
Chavez always going to the body. You
know, I'm one of the heavyweights.

772
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,850
I like to hit the body of law,
you know, you get them tired. Um,

773
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,830
uh, but like I said, I think I have
my own style, you know, I like,

774
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,390
I like my style. Have you had the
same trainer your entire life? No,

775
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,660
I went through, I learned from a lot of
different trainers. You know, my first,

776
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:16,710
um, real professional trainer was
Freddy Roach. That's when I man, yeah,

777
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:21,570
that's when I met Manny Pacquiao, Freddy,
Freddy, me too. Um, great guy. Freddy,

778
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,200
uh, helped me out through my whole
professional career until like the,

779
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,250
my 10th or 12th fight. He had
me. So I learned a lot from him.

780
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,560
Why did you stop training with them?
They send me to Las Vegas, a top rank,

781
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:38,790
send me over there. Uh, and
then, um, some guy, Jeff,

782
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,860
Jeff's, I'm going to Jeff Gramada, some
big guy was trying to meet over there.

783
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,270
Then we moved from there when we went
to April Sanchez when I felt for the,

784
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,090
for the world title for the WBO again,
parking up in big bear, big Abel.

785
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,590
I was in big bear for I think for like
a month and a half for the Joseph Parker

786
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:01,980
fight was the only fight you've lost
and there was a close decision. Exactly.

787
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:04,650
What's your, what was your thoughts
on that fight? Um, you know,

788
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:06,600
I trained myself for that
fight. A lot of yelling.

789
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,530
A lot of people don't know the,
the training camp that we had,

790
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,740
April Sanchez had like eight different
fighters fighting at that same time.

791
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,540
So he was always flying out.

792
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,720
So he'll just leave us a piece of
paper and be like, you know what,

793
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:22,410
you guys do this, do that. And on our
own, you know, so that Kinda sucked.

794
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:27,330
Why did he do that? Uh, I
blew the Hill's obligation to,

795
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,910
to go to the too thin. Yeah. That sucks.

796
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,260
I'm a fan of Abel Sanchez too. He's
a bad motherfucker. Yeah, he sure is.

797
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,310
You know, I appreciate
everything that he's done for me.

798
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,750
He was so knowledgeable.
But for that fight, um,

799
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,150
I think I needed to the right trainer
and moving with many robe Liz and estate

800
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,510
dials. It was the best thing
I could have done, you know,

801
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:48,640
cause those guys are
really on me. It just two,

802
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,710
two guys just pushing you
and one telling you that one,

803
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,440
you have that and it just good.
You know, it keeps you focused.

804
00:47:55,441 --> 00:47:59,350
And so when Abel was training
you and you train by yourself,

805
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,610
you're up there in big bear and
training by herself. How you going nuts?

806
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,600
I was going Helen as man and
the fuck am I doing up here.

807
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:09,010
It ain't shit to do
that one movie theater.

808
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,410
I was going back and forth
from my hometown, you know,

809
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:14,860
cause I live in imperial valley. I live
like, so that's like four hours, right?

810
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:17,980
Three hours from big bear and I'm,

811
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:21,160
I was just going back and forth and I
wasn't really focused for that fight,

812
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:25,610
you know? So, um, a lot of people
don't know that that did you?

813
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,880
The UK? No, I fought them in New
Zealand. Oh Wow. And his hometown too.

814
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,690
Oh Wow. So I think if I would've
been over here with many real bliss,

815
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,810
I definitely would've won. What
was it? Close fight. It was a good,

816
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,280
that was a good fight. What, when you
think about what, what went wrong? I mean,

817
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:43,090
this is,

818
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:48,090
it's always so important for a fighter
to have to experience a loss because a

819
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:52,210
loss sort of lets you know like, hey man,
you don't want this feeling. You know,

820
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:55,770
and I didn't want to lose no more,
you know, and that's when exactly.

821
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,780
That's when everything went down and me
having child comes with a top rank and,

822
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,580
um, then not letting me go and I'll
Hayman helping me out. How him as the man,

823
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,460
you know, he's a man right now.
And he helped me out through,

824
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:12,550
through everything to get
me out of the situation and,

825
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,420
and giving me this
opportunity. So, top rank,

826
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,070
did they make you train with able, like
how did, how did that set up? Yeah,

827
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:24,640
we ended up going over there with
Abel Sanchez. Um, you know, it was a,

828
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,800
it was a good, good idea at first,

829
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,190
but we didn't know it was gonna be like
that Bryant cause he's just got too many

830
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,060
up to five.

831
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,820
There's too many obligations and the
triple g want to believe in him as well.

832
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:37,060
Right? Yeah. Triple g went with Jacobs,

833
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,500
Anthony and Jacobs or
something like that. Um, my uh,

834
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,870
bat triple, she's a
good fighter. You know,

835
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:46,660
I seen him over there at the
fights too, so he's a man. Good.

836
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:49,630
We're good friends now.
He's amazing. And you know,

837
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:54,100
I'm really interested to see his rematch.
If they tried to do a rubber match,

838
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,300
he's a strong man.

839
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:58,870
Me and him wrestled over there and
big bear and like literally wrestling.

840
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,560
And this guy picked me up
and she's, he's strongly,

841
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:05,950
those Russians are a different kind of,
you know, they're strong, different,

842
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,150
they got different tendons
or so, but he's strong now.

843
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:13,270
He is a bad motherfucker. He's
a really friendly guy too.

844
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:15,900
He's always smiling and shit.
He's humble his ass. Yeah.

845
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,200
I get along with him really good.

846
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,160
We're over there going crazy
together while we record. Um,

847
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,810
it was just some something that
some, some drill to warm up and,

848
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,430
and I'm grabbing our fist by, I mean our
hands, like shaking our hands to get,

849
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,590
so he gets strengthened our forearms
and shaking your moons. Those like can,

850
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:40,880
can we do it and like going like that.
Like, oh, just squeezing walls. Yeah.

851
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:44,720
We get like, uh, cramps right here. Yeah.
Here's how we're on this fucking big,

852
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,190
too strong. But why not like do like
a risk role where we do that one too,

853
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:52,770
but I guess I don't know that.
So this style of doing it,

854
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,910
picking each other up and
how weird is this shit?

855
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,370
So was able Sanchez gone with him too?
Or did he, was he focusing on, um,

856
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,720
triple g was in training at that time?

857
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:05,930
He had a different other
fighters he had to go. Oh, okay.

858
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,160
So he was just in camp.

859
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,350
So then you left Abel Sanchez and
now you're training with, with Manny.

860
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,070
Rob Lives in a state that at the
legends boxing gym in Norwalk.

861
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,670
So that is where you feel like
is your best fit. Yeah, that's,

862
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,600
I'm comfortable right there, you know. Um,

863
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,830
the gym is beautiful
facilities really big. Um,

864
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,700
you have everything that
you need. But for the, um,

865
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,070
Reese Joshua to, uh,

866
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:35,480
the training camps and to be in the
mountains somewhere private and, you know,

867
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:39,970
so we could just focus and
get ready for the Mexico.

868
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,430
Nice. Um, did you like
training at altitude?

869
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:46,170
A big bear was at the first time you
had trained at altitude? No, I kinda,

870
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,010
I went there a few times and
you know, I like it, you know,

871
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,900
the first few weeks is, it was
hard, you know, it was really hard.

872
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,330
He get tired fast and,
um, but I did like it.

873
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,080
But when you come back down to c
level, you, you feel the benefit.

874
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,830
I feel the benefit, the
I ca last more, you know,

875
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,540
more oxygen and your body, your
brain. Yeah, for sure. Now,

876
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,860
um, when you go to Mexico,

877
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,530
do you know what altitude
you're going to be up up there?

878
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,570
There's gonna be high in altitude too
cause there's like a point of diminishing

879
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:19,040
returns. So people feel like once you
get above like 6,000, 7,000, 8,000,

880
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,280
the idea is that you can't work hard
enough cause there's just not enough air.

881
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,580
Like they think that 5,000
is like the perfect line.

882
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,640
There's a lot of weird
this, this, you know,

883
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:32,930
people have had different philosophies
when it comes to training at altitude and

884
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:36,860
now many people feel like you should
actually live at altitude but you should

885
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:40,640
train at sea level because they think
that you, when you train at sea level,

886
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:41,990
you could put out more output,

887
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,140
you could do more work and then you go
and live up at altitude so your body

888
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,230
acclimates to the low oxygen and
you develop more red blood cells.

889
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,400
And that makes sense. Yeah.

890
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,220
So we thought about doing something like
that or you're just going to stay up

891
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:58,190
there. Yeah, I'm just going to stay out
there just for a few months, you know,

892
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:02,060
and a few months and come back
down, finish, finish it up,

893
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:07,061
finish the camp for like a month and go
where I'm going to fight that I can say,

894
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,300
well you're in such a great position
man and you're only 29 years old.

895
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,830
So like your athletic prime,

896
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,580
particularly as a heavyweight is like yo
like three or four years away from your

897
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:20,450
prime, which is really crazy. And
that's a good thing. You know,

898
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:25,040
I'm still young. I never had big wars.
You know, I never been hurt things to,

899
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,290
you know, and every fight
that I have, you know,

900
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,720
always pray for me and the
guy that I'm fighting. No,

901
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,590
cause I won both of us
who go with our families.

902
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,660
Cause I have two friends that have
died from one, from a heat galleon,

903
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,580
one from Costa Rica that I know
personally. So it's scary man.

904
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,220
It's really scary. It most certainly is.

905
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,010
I mean there's no getting away
from that man. It's, it's,

906
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,450
it's a fucking scares me more.
When you think about your career,

907
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:53,010
do you have longterm goals?

908
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:56,100
Do you have like a day that you like a
time where you want to get out of this?

909
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,810
You know what? I wanted to retire
when I was 35 years old and I'm,

910
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,390
I said that on a piece of paper. Like
I like I was telling everybody to,

911
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,660
if you want to join, if you
want a goal or something,

912
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,930
write it down and all that. And I said,
I won't, I wanted to retire when I'm 35.

913
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:13,560
So we'll see why in 35. I
don't know, I just had it.

914
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,210
That number seems like a good number.

915
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:20,280
What do you think you would do if you
weren't boxing? Um, do the houses. Mom,

916
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:22,410
my dad is a contractor. So, uh, we,

917
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:26,010
we buy lots and we make houses from
scratch and now, and we sell them,

918
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,220
we resell them or we rent
them out and or make, uh,

919
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,100
a lot of apartments, you know,

920
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:36,720
condos for the people that can
really afford, what was that called?

921
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,850
My Dad does it. Low income
houses, low income houses, um,

922
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:43,440
apartments like that in my hometown,
you know. Well, that's beautiful.

923
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,870
But for fighters,

924
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:51,230
the thrill of fighting is something
that is impossible to recreate.

925
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:56,220
It's almost like for a regular person
to experience what you experienced when

926
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:57,330
you knocked out Anthony.

927
00:54:57,331 --> 00:55:01,800
Joshua and Joshua gets counted off the
referee waves his arms and you're like,

928
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:06,660
oh shit. I started jumping like, oh
my God, I grab it. You went nuts, man.

929
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,990
But it'd been that feeling. You, you, you,

930
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:13,470
all of a sudden you're the heavyweight
champion of the world that, I mean,

931
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:16,050
if you could sell that, that, look
at that. Look at you right there,

932
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,250
man. I felt like so many stuff, um,
from my bag just came off, you know,

933
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:25,650
cause so much pressure.
So I'm like, oh yeah, man,

934
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,070
stuff that was going through my
mind. I mean everybody was stunned.

935
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:32,520
The home crowd was done, everybody
was, but the crowd was on your side.

936
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,210
It was really wild man. When you
routine off on him and that the roars,

937
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,740
the crowd and when it was over,

938
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,980
when the referee just shook
his hand and waved it off,

939
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:45,981
like that high is what bleeds fighters
back in the ring when they really

940
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:50,640
shouldn't be. They chase that dragon.
Yeah. And that's what I want to do,

941
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:53,970
you know, make a statement that
everything is possible. You know,

942
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:58,470
all the fighters that, that have low
confident or something in themselves,

943
00:55:58,471 --> 00:55:59,610
you know, anything is possible.

944
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:02,820
Just work hard and know
the opportunity will come.

945
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,540
Do you think you'll ever
train fighters? Me? You know,

946
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:10,320
I think the only person that will train
would probably be like my son or have

947
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:10,951
first, you know,

948
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:15,780
because it's not really good to be
training the son and well it depends what

949
00:56:15,781 --> 00:56:19,980
kind of relationship you guys have,
you know? But, um, I think my son,

950
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,860
I'll be trained. I'd rather be like
a promoter or something like that.

951
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,310
And your mouth promotions. I
like Oscar. I sure will. Yeah.

952
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,960
[inaudible] that's in the
works. Arj Promotion. Oh,
so you're a Knutson. Really?

953
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:35,620
You're an [inaudible]. Oh, no, shit.
Wow. That's rare. Where that's the plan.

954
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,590
You know, first I want to focus
on the fight and all that.

955
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:42,340
I don't want to jump in conclusions
of doing all kinds of other stuff.

956
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:46,750
I want to focus in my flight and um,
after that or when I want to retire,

957
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:51,100
I want to get fighters from med school,
giving them the opportunity and um,

958
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:55,240
you know, learn, learn like Oscar the
[inaudible]. Beautiful. That's beautiful,

959
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:59,200
man. Yeah. Anything else? Anything else
you want to tell people? Um, you know,

960
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:02,440
just to tune in, uh, December in December.

961
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:07,390
Anthony Joshua against Andrew Reese
or n or [inaudible] versus Anthony.

962
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,780
Joshua [inaudible]. You're the top
billing now, man. You're the champ.

963
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,060
Thank you. Bye. Um, you know,
uh, just gotta work hard, man.

964
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:20,860
Work Hard, stay, stay humble. Say
discipline and just focus on the,

965
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,750
on the room match. Well, Andy, listen man,

966
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,720
you're a great guy and a great role
model. Thank you. I appreciate it.

967
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:29,770
I think for young kids to look up to a
guy like you who's a really nice guy,

968
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:33,190
who's also a bad motherfucker, it
makes him realize, hey, you know,

969
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:35,380
you don't have to be a dickhead.
You don't have to be mean.

970
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:39,430
You can be a real cool dude who even
prays for his opponent and still be the

971
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,760
baddest motherfucker on the
planet. Congratulations to
you, sir. Thank you, man.

972
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,010
Appreciate it very much, and
good luck to you in December,

973
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:46,930
having meetings coming up.
We're going to be there, man.

974
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:50,620
I'm going to give you some tickets.
Shit. Oh Shit, man, that'd be there.
