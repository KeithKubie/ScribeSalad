00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the apple will actually appear to move backwards.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, this was a tricky one, but you can verify it for yourself.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you drive or if you know someone who does, get in the car, take an apple

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and wait at a red light.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Once that light turns green, accelerate forwards and drop the apple.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You'll see that it actually appears to land behind where you released the apple from.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When we accelerate this way, the apple appears to move backwards.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When we accelerate that way, likewise. The apple moves backwards.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course, if you're going to do this, make sure you're safe about it

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and make sure your car has wheels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What's really interesting about what we found here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is that acceleration seems to be somehow important.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Objects at rest behave in the same way as objects moving at constant speed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but acceleration is important.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Things no longer behave the same when what we call our reference frame starts accelerating.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We also saw that acceleration was somehow special when we looked at Galileo

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
who found that all objects fall at a constant acceleration.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Clearly, acceleration is a very important quantity,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and by the end of today you will understand it very deeply.
