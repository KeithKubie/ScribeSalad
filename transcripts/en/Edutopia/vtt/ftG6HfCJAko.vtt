00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:14.026
&gt;&gt;Susan: The United States
spends more money on education

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.976
than any other country in the
world except for Switzerland,

00:00:17.456 --> 00:00:21.896
and yet we still have these huge
disparities in opportunities

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:27.936
between kids, and mostly, it's
based on a student's zip code

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.376
or what neighborhood they live in.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.086
It's tied to their family background,

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.706
what kind of educational
opportunities are going

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:37.666
to be available to them
through public schools.

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.826
We know that we've got a
looming teacher shortage

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:44.306
in critical subjects, and
we're not going to be able

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:46.786
to solve these problems
through traditional means.

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.716
The example that I like to use
is in the state of Georgia,

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:58.446
there are 400 high schools and there
are 89 qualified physics teachers

00:00:59.056 --> 00:00:59.706
in the state.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:03.846
So right there, you know that not
all of your high schools have-

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.546
can even offer physics, so
how are you going to do that?

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:11.306
I don't know that we're going to
ramp up the number of teachers going

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:13.146
into those high schools,
unfortunately,

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:16.246
so we can offer online classes.

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:20.396
We can offer online physics
class and train teachers

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.226
to teach that class online.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.646
And what we're starting to see
is that in states like Georgia,

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:32.496
they're bringing teachers who have
5 or 10 years of experience, say,

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.906
teaching physics that may not
want to teach a full load.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:37.396
They can come back and all

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.636
of a sudden have adjunct
faculty positions.

00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:42.806
They have part-time
teaching positions,

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:45.336
and they're able to teach online.

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:49.766
Here, you've got a great experienced
teacher that has left the field.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.636
You can bring them back in and give
them new professional opportunities.

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.256
And the teachers are
loving it because they feel

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.836
like they have more one-on-one
interactions with the kids

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:04.056
in their classes, but it also
gives them some flexibility

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.746
in how they teach and a
broader range of kids to teach,

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:09.516
whether it's in that state or beyond.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:13.816
What online learning does, it
allows you to use time differently.

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:20.106
It allows you to work with every
child individually in how they move-

00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:25.776
move through the content and not
just use the time but the support,

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.906
the kind of student
support that comes

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:30.666
up with students working
together peer to peer,

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.166
students working with the teacher.

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:36.536
When you start looking at these kind
of reform movements that say, "Well,

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:39.396
let's take the existing
school model that we have,

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:42.866
but what we need is a longer
day," I think you're going

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.876
to see more kids frustrated.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:48.976
They don't want to be there
in the same system longer.

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:50.596
They want to do things differently.

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:54.436
They want- they want the relevance,
they want those relationships,

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.486
and they want that kind
of critical thinking,

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:59.626
and- and they want to be challenged.

00:02:59.906 --> 00:03:03.716
We need to really shift the way we do
professional development for teachers

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:08.306
and just modernize it, and that means
prepare them to go out and teach

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.776
in a digital, connected,
collaborative, networked world.

00:03:12.236 --> 00:03:13.316
Let's start there.

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:16.746
And then the students that are
coming into these schools are going

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:19.766
to be able to take more
self-responsibility

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.536
and be more self-directed because
they know they have to move

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.926
through this content and
curriculum by a certain time,

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:31.066
and they can make the choice whether
to take a- a few more minutes

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:35.916
on another project or to make
the choice to not do some work

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.286
for a while or make the choice
to go back and do the work.

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.126
The work's still going
to be there for them.

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:44.636
Online learning is connecting
people from all across the country,

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:48.566
even all across the world,
with students in every setting

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:51.976
and giving them individualized
learning opportunities,

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:54.106
connecting them with great teachers,

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:57.246
and really tracking how
well students are doing.

00:03:57.286 --> 00:04:00.686
So even if they struggle in a class
the first time when they take it,

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:04.616
they can be given new resources,
a broader range of resources,

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:06.756
and we're really starting to see

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:12.366
that students taking online
courses are more engaged and in many

00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:16.436
of the programs are having much
higher rates of success in terms

00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:21.216
of not just finishing the courses but
how well they learn and learning how

00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:24.776
to learn differently
in this new modern age.

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.536
