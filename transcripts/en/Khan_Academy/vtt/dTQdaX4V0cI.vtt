00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.963
- My name is Zia Sheikh.

00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:02.161
I am 35 years old.

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.795
I am Chef de Cuisine
at Paowalla Restaurant

00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:06.536
and I make 75 thousand a year.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.222
My main responsibilities
as Chef de Cuisine

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:11.231
is to oversee any type
of kitchen operation

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:15.116
from menu development to
dish washing, to working

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.184
alongside the cooks, to food labor costs,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.291
sitting down with Chef Floyd for about

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.124
10 - 15 minutes a day.

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:24.992
We talk about what's coming
down the line as far as menu.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.297
We are a very highly seasonal restaurant.

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.589
We try to use the Union
Square Green Market

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.333
as much as possible as
well as local farms.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.472
If it's not in season,
it's not on our menu.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:36.036
I almost wanna say that
this career chose me.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.751
I dealt with a lot of racism in school

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.676
when I was growing up, so I
spent a lot of time at home.

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.997
That being said, I spent
a lot of time to myself

00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:44.902
and I realized that I
had a love for the arts.

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:48.422
I spent a lot of time with my
mother at home in the kitchen.

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:50.704
So, she actually taught
me how to start cooking

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:53.253
when I was ten years
old, and the first thing

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.685
that I made at home was her meatballs.

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:58.127
She was cooking meatballs
for the family and I started

00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:00.521
mimicking her moves in
a smaller pot for myself

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.595
right next to her and ever since then,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.422
I've fallen in love with cooking.

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:08.522
It was so interesting to me
whereas a year or two later

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:10.250
I started accompanying her to supermarkets

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.594
and buying my own produce.

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:14.472
I taught myself how to hold a
knife, how to cut vegetables.

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.728
My favorite thing to make
was vegetable stir-fry

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:18.722
just because it involved
about 20 different

00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:19.623
vegetables in one dish.

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.031
My father passed away when I was 16.

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:25.096
He was always pushing me to
do something with science

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:27.868
and, almost to make him
happy, after he passed away

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:30.520
I enrolled in engineering
school, but then when I got to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.648
engineering school, I
realized that I just didn't

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:33.635
have a passion for it.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.074
That same semester one of
my close friends, Mary,

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:39.031
wanted to do something
nice for her boyfriend

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.457
for Valentine's day, so she invited me

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:44.182
and about five other friends
into the kitchen with her

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:46.537
to cook for her boyfriend.

00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:48.620
And, between me and these

00:01:49.623 --> 00:01:51.922
these five other girls, they were all

00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:54.186
impressed that I knew my way around

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.746
the kitchen and I almost kinda took over.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:57.577
After that it was just kinda
staring at me in the face

00:01:57.577 --> 00:01:58.567
what I should be doing with my life.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:00.798
So, I dropped out of college
and went to culinary school.

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:02.749
Now that you're in a
restaurant setting you realize

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.959
that everything happens
at a much faster pace

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.279
and you're working alongside
more experienced cooks

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.144
that can cut faster, that
can cook faster, that can

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:15.139
think faster and basically
the point of the externship

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.238
is for you to be immersed
in a new type of world.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.667
My very first job I was making
three hundred dollars a week

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:21.939
and working in a kitchen.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.911
I was doing what I loved
to do, but I didn't

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.376
have a lot of money to
spare, so they, my mother

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:28.772
let me still live at home.

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:31.743
It's not ideal for a 23, 24 year old

00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:33.443
to be living at home, but at the time,

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:35.187
it was what was necessary to do.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.916
Whatever money I had left
over, whatever money I saved up

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.910
to buy cookbooks to keep
reading, to immerse myself

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.652
in this world, to take
myself to the next level.

00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:45.834
And, I dined out at a lot of restaurants.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:48.236
I cooked for myself a lot at home, just

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:50.191
testing out new recipes and whatnot.

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.672
I did a lot of this at work.

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:55.113
I almost bugged my chefs with
questions about, you know,

00:02:55.113 --> 00:02:56.730
can you teach me this,
can you teach me this,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.563
can you teach me this.

00:02:57.563 --> 00:02:58.922
and I started taking
on more and more tasks

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.940
to see what I could handle
and what I enjoyed doing.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.857
And, starting out you
will take any job you can

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:10.598
for any amount of money,
for, to learn any part of it.

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:15.289
I used to switch jobs for 50
cents more, if they paid me

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.656
and, you know, at the
time I moved around a lot.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.237
I didn't keep a job more
than, for more than 10 months,

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:23.410
and then I went onto
another job after that,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.327
but it was all learning experience.
