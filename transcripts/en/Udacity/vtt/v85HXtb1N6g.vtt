00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.075
Now what is glucose? Glucose is a simple sugar in the blood, and it provides

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:09.330
energy for the cells throughout the body, including the brain. Now, if we go

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.693
for a long time without eating, our blood sugar drops, and in turn the

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:16.587
hypothalamus, which monitors glucose levels, will signal the drive to obtain

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:23.154
food. Thinking back to the homeostatic model for motivation, we see this

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:26.610
example of the brain detecting a lack of glucose, and then signaling for us to

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.744
obtain food. Some of the hormones that stimulate our appetite are neuropeptide

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:39.160
Y, melanin, and ghrelin. For example, when we are hungry, neuropeptide Y is

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.258
released from the hypothalamis. And that in turn causes us to be hungry.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:49.840
Similarly, ghrelin levels rise when we're hungry and fall when we are full.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.220
Another naturally occurring chemical that can increase our appetite are the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.688
endocannabinoids. This is one reason why marijuana is sometimes used

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:01.700
medicinally, to stimulate appetite, when other medicines make people nauseous

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.540
and unable to eat. On the flip side, research has shown that blocking the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.404
receptor sights for the endocannabinoids actually decreases eating and results

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.420
in weight loss.
