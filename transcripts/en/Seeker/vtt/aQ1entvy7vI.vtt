00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.380
In 2015, scientists observed gravitational
waves.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.640
For the first time ever, we could actually
‘see’ the distortion of space-time as

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.490
it reacted to huge events in space, like the
collision of black holes.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.029
This was one of the most exciting physics
discoveries of our age, and the team involved

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.180
were even awarded the Nobel Prize in physics
last year....so why is this discovery now

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.880
being called into question?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.630
Ok, this is some pretty earth-shaking, heck,
even space-shaking drama.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.380
Scientific tea, if you will.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.089
Some scientists are now questioning the methods
used at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.960
Observatory, which we all commonly know as
LIGO, where gravitational waves were first

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960
observed.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.609
It’s kind of like a really polite, but really
nitpicky episode of the real housewives of

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:45.609
astrophysics.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.049
Just so we’re all clear, detecting gravitational
waves is really freakin’ hard, which is

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.639
one of the reasons why it was such a big deal.

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:57.069
When black holes, for instance, collide with
each other, they can merge, and in that merging

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:01.800
process, some of the energy of that collision
is released into the universe as gravitational

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.839
radiation.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.450
This is essentially a ripple that distorts
the earth by about the width of an atomic

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.460
nucleus.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.940
So you can see why it was impressive when
the LIGO Scientific Collaboration said they

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.990
were able to detect this wave.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.870
But the minuteness of a gravitational wave
is not the only problem LIGO faces.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.170
Yes, the detector has to be unprecedentedly
sensitive to observe and measure a gravitational

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.480
wave, but it also has to be able to pick out
that wave from the endless buzz of other background

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.590
noise, like the natural vibration of the earth
itself.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.991
So, in order to make sure that what they’re
measuring is really a gravitational wave and

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:44.000
not something else, LIGO has two independent
sites: one in Louisiana and one in Washington.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
Between these two detectors, almost a continent
away from each other, there shouldn’t be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.480
any overlap in their noise patterns, but the
wave--the signal they’re actually looking

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.440
for, should show up in corresponding places
at both observatories.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.531
So we should be able to easily identify what
is noise--all that stuff that doesn’t match

00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:03.080
up between detectors.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.960
Then when you subtract that away you’re
left with only the signal--the gravitational

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960
wave.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
That’s the ideal, anyway.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.450
And this is where the friendly collegial discussion
starts.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.540
A team of physicists at the Niels Bohr Institute
in Copenhagen made their own analysis of the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.330
LIGO’s freely and publicly available data
and they take issue with some of the methods

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.330
used.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.379
When the Danish team re-analyzed LIGO’s
data, they found that while the wave signal

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.349
matched up between the two detectors, so did
some of the noise.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.560
Which it shouldn’t, because the noise is
supposed to be random and independent between

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.910
observatories.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.510
Which introduces the problem that maybe, the
signals that LIGO picked out are...less clear

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.959
than the world would like to believe?

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.540
As you can imagine, there’s been a LOT of
back and forth on this.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.160
The LIGO team has responded to the Danish
team’s concerns by basically saying that

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.529
the methods and computer programs they used
to extract the original data are extremely

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.019
complicated and the Danish team wasn’t using
them correctly.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.349
Which then prompts responses from some people
(like me) who say, “Ok, but even if your

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.499
science is right it should be at least be
repeatable for other teams in your field,

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.459
LIGO, ya diva”.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.790
And the Danish responded by saying “thank
you for teaching us more about your computer

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.730
program, we re-did our analysis and we still
think your results are funky”

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.049
And here’s the thing.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.939
This kind of kerfuffle...has happened before.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.359
Einstein predicted gravitational waves’
existence in 1916, and if we’ve actually

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.550
detected them, we’ve now observed his theory
of general relativity in the tangible, physical

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.299
properties of our universe.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.219
Which helps us better understand gravity and
where it comes from and why it behaves how

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.900
it does--pretty huge and important mysteries
we’re still facing in physics.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.299
Since Einstein’s original proposal, several
other noteworthy experiments have tried to

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.139
detect gravitational waves, with two standouts
claiming that they had, to much excitement...only

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.010
to then be debunked, very publicly.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.870
Rather embarrassing for all involved.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.349
So it’s right to be skeptical, especially
about something as huge and groundbreaking

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.329
as this particular phenomenon.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.329
But.

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.959
When all is said and done and when the dust
settles around this flurry of agitated physicists,

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.330
even in the most extreme scenario, scientists
agree that we’ve still definitely detected

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.879
gravitational waves.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.910
This is the real deal this time, guys.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.790
It’s not that LIGO didn’t detect the waves,
it’s simply that their analysis may need

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.850
improvement.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.000
And if it remains unimproved, these methods
could be introducing room for error that no

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.940
one wants to have to deal with.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.340
This is the scientific process in action.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.950
As you watch this video, LIGO is putting together
a detailed document revealing how they got

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.570
their results, so what could have been a potential
rift has instead opened up some important

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.070
dialogue in the scientific community and will
hopefully be productive and just help us do

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.520
the science better.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.400
And as of this early December,  LIGO detected four more black hole mergers while looking through their previous observational data.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.420
he researchers say that these dectections weren’t as “loud” and needed more careful analysis.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.980
With that in mind, maybe this new paper will help qualm any debates about their techniques.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.760
As dramatic as it sounded like 
it was gonna be, I don’t think it’s gonna

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.320
provide enough material for an ultra-exciting
Hollywood reimagining.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.320
At least not yet.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.440
I guess we’ll see what happens.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.920
