Oh

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720
 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.440
that the unified theory of autism

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
that the unified theory of autism
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.799
that the unified theory of autism
attempts to reconcile several

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809
attempts to reconcile several
 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.009
attempts to reconcile several
observations the first observation is

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019
observations the first observation is
 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:26.999
observations the first observation is
that siblings with autism is more common

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009
that siblings with autism is more common
 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.569
that siblings with autism is more common
than one would expect if each incidence

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579
than one would expect if each incidence
 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.270
than one would expect if each incidence
of autism was was random so if a child

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280
of autism was was random so if a child
 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.960
of autism was was random so if a child
is born has autism a brother is born the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970
is born has autism a brother is born the
 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.780
is born has autism a brother is born the
chance that that brother has autism is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
chance that that brother has autism is
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
chance that that brother has autism is
much higher than a male born to another

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260
much higher than a male born to another
 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.350
much higher than a male born to another
family and twins identical twins have an

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360
family and twins identical twins have an
 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.230
family and twins identical twins have an
extremely high concordance something

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240
extremely high concordance something
 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.330
extremely high concordance something
like 90% there is no other cognitive

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340
like 90% there is no other cognitive
 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.490
like 90% there is no other cognitive
disorder whose concordance among

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500
disorder whose concordance among
 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.490
disorder whose concordance among
identical twins is as high so those two

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500
identical twins is as high so those two
 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.690
identical twins is as high so those two
facts tell you that there's a genetic

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700
facts tell you that there's a genetic
 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.350
facts tell you that there's a genetic
component to autism however there are

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
component to autism however there are
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.910
component to autism however there are
families that have autistic children and

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
families that have autistic children and
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.410
families that have autistic children and
their large families and only one child

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
their large families and only one child
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.680
their large families and only one child
will have autism so the genetics would

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690
will have autism so the genetics would
 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.250
will have autism so the genetics would
look to be complicated there's inherited

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260
look to be complicated there's inherited
 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.690
look to be complicated there's inherited
component because siblings have a higher

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
component because siblings have a higher
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.690
component because siblings have a higher
rate of concurrence but there might also

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700
rate of concurrence but there might also
 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.490
rate of concurrence but there might also
be a sporadic component so the issue is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500
be a sporadic component so the issue is
 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.020
be a sporadic component so the issue is

the children of these parents have a

the children of these parents have a
higher chance of having autism but it's

higher chance of having autism but it's
 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.050
higher chance of having autism but it's
not a classical Mendelian pattern where

number of genes that can give you autism
 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.479
number of genes that can give you autism
then you could have a very large

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
then you could have a very large
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.149
then you could have a very large

children are then at risk from the

clues that is compatible with this model
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.550
clues that is compatible with this model
is that the risk of autism is much

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560
is that the risk of autism is much
 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.119
is that the risk of autism is much
higher in boys than in girls if the

that whatever genetic abnormalities

that whatever genetic abnormalities

that whatever genetic abnormalities
exists in the boy those genetic

abnormalities will exist in a girl so

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269
abnormalities will exist in a girl so
 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.490
abnormalities will exist in a girl so
girls have something that makes them

girls have something that makes them
 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.400
girls have something that makes them
resistant so girls in fact could be

natural carriers of genes that in a boy
 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.479
natural carriers of genes that in a boy
would give the boy autism and that girl
