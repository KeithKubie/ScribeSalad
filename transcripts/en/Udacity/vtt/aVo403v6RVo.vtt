00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.850
So that's really interesting.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.370
Everyone's heard of Watson,
IBM's Watson,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.030
and everybody knows that
Watson won Jeapordy!

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.610
I think a lot of people realize IBM
is now trying to move Watson into

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.910
healthcare.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.900
The results you just
described are really amazing.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.210
Do you think that we're heading
into an era down the road,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.550
where tools like Watson
are going to replace doctors?

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.940
&gt;&gt; So first,
before I answer that question,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.260
first I want to give a little background
about how Watson compete in Jeopardy.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
Besides the advanced analytics
techniques they have used,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.530
the amazing natural language processing
pipeline they have developed.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.120
Another secret I think is very important
for the success of Watson winning

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.140
Jeopardy is to reach training
data source that are available

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.215
that related to Jeopardy challenge.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:04.694
In fact, there is a website
called www.jarchive.com that

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:09.713
record all the historical competition
in the past in Jeopardy since 1983.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:15.005
And a lot of those questions
are general knowledge

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:20.065
that there are associate Wikipedia
articles that provide very

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:26.060
rich meta information
about those questions.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.000
So those two important data sources
helped the Waston Team to develop their

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.620
algorithms, to train their algorithms
on those historical questions.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.870
So that lead to a very amazing result.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.430
But in medicines,
neither of those sources are available.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.540
There is no good question database or
question/answer database that available.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.030
There's no good matter information
related to all those clinical concepts.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.560
So it's a lot more complicated
even to get to that stage.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.150
So what they have done before I left is,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.115
they look at the US medical
licensing exam questions.

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:14.810
And trying to at least
tackle that first.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.820
Because those are the available
questions and answers.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.520
But just the space of
the medical domain is so large.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.470
And the question and answers are a lot
of times there's no clear yes and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.650
no answers.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.270
So it's a lot harder.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.320
But clinical institutions are very
interested in using Watson.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.220
So there's a very big medical
research center at MD Anderson,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.540
I mean,
Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Centers.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.800
They all partners with Watson,
to use Watson for their diagnosis.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.040
So that's definitely
a promising direction.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.380
I hope they succeed.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.880
&gt;&gt; It's fascinating to speculate
about what something like

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.790
Watson might be able to do, if you could
train it on that vast amount of data.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.710
So as you look ahead for the next few
years, five years or so, where do you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.140
think we're going to be in terms of
big data and analytics in health care?

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
it's definitely a very hot area.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.370
Big data analytics in health care.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.180
And so there's a paradigm
shift from the traditional,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.630
more small scale statistic approach,
to a more system approach.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.680
When I say system,
I mean computing system.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.500
So they're not single
algorithm that going to work.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.070
It's a pipeline of sufficity
computational tasks that put together

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.140
and run in a various scalable platform
like high performance computing centers

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.450
or in a cloud environment
like Amazon web services.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.720
So, in particular,
I think there is a great need for

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.950
making the data more useable.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.110
Using analytics techniques.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.782
So, there's a new push
called phenotyping.

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:15.835
That really means, how do you
convert those messy electronic

00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:20.490
health records into meaningful
clinical concepts using algorithms?

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.910
Rather than require the data to be good
to begin with, why don't we develop

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.800
algorithm that can automatically clean
the data and turn them into more usable

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.570
high quality data that can
support research and discovery?

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.200
So that's the phenotyping effort
that a lot of people are working on.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.660
That's about the input to
the analytics platform.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.470
Then, there's the middle part,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.740
where people are trying to view those
analytics, predictive analytics.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.245
That used to take months, like for
every disease target, every data set,

00:04:56.245 --> 00:05:00.590
you have to spend months just to
get the right data, view the model,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.420
then validate that.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.120
But now, everybody want to use
predictive analytics and there's

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.420
thousands of disease and conditions
people want to view the model for.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.610
So how can you scale up to
view this model quickly?

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.820
You need a very scalable,
large scale platform to support that.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.890
So, alot of people leveraging
parallel computing and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.860
like map redo's to do that kind of work.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.750
That's the processing part.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.340
And also, finally, the output, right?

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.250
So we so far only talk about accuracy
and how good the models are.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.160
But in order to make use of those
model in clinical decision support,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.900
you really have to make
the model intuitive.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.250
So that the decision maker,
like clinician, doctor can understand.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.570
Can explain the result to the patients,
so that they believe and

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.570
follow through the recommendation.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.570
And their work on leveraging
similar patients' history and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.950
recommend what worked for
the similar patient to the current

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.148
patient as intuitive method to
explain the recommendations.

00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:13.390
So that's the final output part, right?

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.350
So all the entire system,
input processing and

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.260
output need to be new
computational method.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.430
And I think that's very a promising
future for health care analytics.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.380
&gt;&gt; Well thank you very much.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.950
I think you really helped
the students understand,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.580
not only where we are, but
to see that there are many,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.340
many years of interesting research and
development ahead of us.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.090
So maybe some students
will decide to join that,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.530
which would be a great result.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.520
So thank you very much.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
