LAUREN MERRIMAN: So my
name's Lauren Merriman.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.010
I'm a senior right now.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.510
I'm actually
graduating in February.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.624
I took this class
because I decided

00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:14.040
I really want to
make video games,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.300
and this is a good
class to take.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.020
My team is seven people,
and we are mostly seniors.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220
We made a game about
[? cholera. ?] The other team

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.750
focused on the younger 8 to 13.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.930
And we focused on a little bit
older-- about 13 and above--

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.360
so we could have a little bit
more complicated mechanics

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.620
and text where we needed it.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.990
So we didn't really have
to rely on figuring out

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.420
how to make everything
really easy to read.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.510
So it uses English
that assumes someone

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.960
who speaks English could read
and understand very easily.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.240
And our game is a strategy game.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.860
It's real time,
where the days are--

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.110
you have to survive a year
and the days are automatic.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.690
So you have you go and take care
of four different localities,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.170
and give them either
soap or water containers

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.320
or electrolytes
to help heal them.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.240
And later on you
get boiling water.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.830
And you just have to take
care of these four localities

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.330
for a year.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.780
So we learned early
on, the class, you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.947
start by your first project
is just paper prototype.

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:25.113
And then after, you have
to make digital prototypes,

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:27.390
but they usually expect you
to have a paper prototype.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.350
And for this one, they
expected you to do it however

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.330
you wanted to.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.650
And so we started off
with a paper prototype,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.800
and we sort of then quickly
implemented it digitally.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.430
Because there were certain
things that doing it with paper

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.020
would take a long time
to make a calculation.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.670
But we originally
had part of it was

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.010
you could see on the
screen what the localities,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.070
where they were.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.570
And then you would try
to implement things.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.430
But we didn't have a screen
to help you select that.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.950
And so you'd tell
us what you pick,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.154
and then we quickly put it
in the game and reset it.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:01.820
So that's what we
originally did, and it

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.020
was really hard to do it
that way because people

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.748
going from the screen to a paper
prototype, they were confused.

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:09.789
And they didn't really
see how things interacted.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.450
So then our next big thing
was make it all digital.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.280
And in the presentation
that you saw,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.310
we had that original shot of
what the game looked like when

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.750
we had it all digital.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.904
And it was just a really
poorly designed GUI.

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:26.820
And it was hard to read
and hard to understand

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.650
and people were really
struggling with it.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.430
So I actually was the one
who redesigned the GUI,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.780
and then it went through
a couple of iterations

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.640
with the new GUI.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.635
So we decided how to make it
the most clear, and I sat down

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:42.570
and I looked at other strategy
games, mostly Civilization.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.600
I'm actually not a big
strategy game player,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.430
so I actually had to
go look around and see

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.730
what other places do.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.570
And I stole a little
bit from Civilization,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.860
and a few other games that just
had good elements of design

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.912
that looked clear and
understandable-- even

00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:57.870
to someone who's never
touched the game before.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.880
And so that's what I
wanted in our game.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.510
So that's why we implemented
it the way we did.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.440
And then the game kind of
turned into the way it is now.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.660
So one of the biggest things
is I'm not a programmer.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.830
So I was doing either design or
product management or the scrum

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.000
master-- is what
they call it, which

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.600
is someone who has to
take care of the team

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.060
and make everything
fit together.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.170
Whether it's including art and
music and coding-- making sure

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.260
all those elements fit together
into one cohesive whole.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.690
And so that's sort of the
role that I started to do

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.170
and then really liked doing.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.550
At first I thought, on
some of these projects,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.180
I should take on a
coding role to try

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.460
to force myself to learn.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.800
But I realized I
didn't really want to.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.560
I really liked doing
this role instead.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.370
But you learn it's really hard.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.200
Especially in a class setting
where people aren't really

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.690
tied monetarily to this class.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.100
You can't lose your job
if you don't do your job.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.330
You can do poorly in the class,
but because it's a group thing,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.560
you might not do that poorly
because the group presented

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.520
like, this is our game.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.892
And so unless you specifically
call out that person,

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:08.600
they're still going
to get credit for it.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.330
And so it was really difficult
as the product manager

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.550
to get people to
do what they said

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.470
they were going to do
in a timely manner,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.510
and get people to
respond to my emails.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.250
And so it was really
something that you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.260
have to get people to
understand-- especially

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
towards the end where we
didn't have a lot done,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.441
and we needed to change a lot--
that there's not a lot of time,

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:29.690
and there's still a lot to do.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.220
And then when I finally
got everyone in a meeting

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.170
and they all sat down, we talked
about this, like, everyone,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.510
you just heard it-- oh,
that's when that's due?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.080
So I finally got people
in gear, and so I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.966
wish I could have done this
earlier in the semester.

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:46.550
It was just this project.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.604
With the other projects,
people didn't usually

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:52.020
fall into that trap as much
because it was only two weeks.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.154
So two weeks doesn't give
you a lot of time to fail.

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:56.320
You've got to do it quickly.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.310
And but when it was eight
weeks, it was a lot of time

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.060
and so people are like oh we can
push this off a little further.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.720
It was really hard.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.790
I actually ended up having--
I talked to the professors

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.820
to try to figure out a way to
get my team to listen to me.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.460
And it was still
really hard, but once

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.070
you finally get everyone
together and really lay

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.060
it out very clearly, like the
clarity is what I was missing.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.730
I thought I was
being very clear,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.270
and this is how things would do.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.630
And even with the way
I was assigning tasks,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.560
I thought I was being
very clear and I wasn't.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.890
I was really missing
concrete details.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.940
I said, guys, implement
this idea-- implement

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.190
that you can take the actions.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.240
But I didn't tell them
this is how it should look.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.160
This is how it should feel.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.440
And so when it got
implemented, it

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520
wasn't what I thought it was.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.395
And I was like, this is
really disappointing.

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:47.650
This is really ugly.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.070
So when I sat down and
redid it and then told them

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.320
exactly what I expected,
things got done faster.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.480
Because, like we said
in our presentation,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.620
people weren't really
motivated for this game.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.350
And so having the motivation
and really vague instructions

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.750
made it that people wouldn't
do it until-- you put that off.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.850
That's a really hard task.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.580
I need to figure out
what she expects,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.160
and then I need to do it,
and I don't really want to.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.180
So that's something
you put off to the end.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.140
And so when you give
people clear instructions,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.544
it makes it easier
just to do it.

00:06:19.544 --> 00:06:21.210
Because they're like,
oh, that's simple.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.780
I can do that really quickly.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.830
And so I think that was the
easiest way is when you really

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.230
set clear instructions,
clear deadlines,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.499
and you can't really
punish people.

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.540
There's no way of slapping
them on the wrist when

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.248
they don't do it.

00:06:34.248 --> 00:06:36.510
You can just not
assign them work.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.072
And you move it
to somebody else.

00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:40.030
And eventually people
realize that they weren't

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.280
getting assigned any work.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.155
And they realized just,
hey, I'm not actually

00:06:43.155 --> 00:06:44.460
doing anything for this.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.240
Can I have work?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.710
And I said, you have
to do it by this time,

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.860
and if you don't, then
we're pretty screwed.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.590
So really doing
that, really making

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.850
sure you have clear deadlines
and shifting the work

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.557
around so that people who will
do the work and can do the work

00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:01.640
and have the time to do
work are getting the work.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.260
And the people who either just
are doing the work or maybe

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.240
don't have the time that
week because that also

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.114
happens, where one week
will be really tough.

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:10.170
So you shift the
work away from them.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.120
So you have to be
better about-- I

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.960
think if I had
started being better

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.060
about how I gave assigned
work rather than just

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.080
evenly dividing it, that really
would help with the project.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.590
So working with
a client was hard

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.230
because he was
unavailable a lot.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.850
And the times he
did come to class

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.570
he said, if you have
to email me a question,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.200
it better be really
clear and concise,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.533
or we're not going to answer it.

00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:39.490
And so luckily,
in the beginning,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.270
we kind of knew what we
wanted to do with our game.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.940
And so we just went
in that direction.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.577
And then whenever
Pablo came into class--

00:07:46.577 --> 00:07:47.660
Pablo was our main client.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.050
We also had Ellie, but she was
only in class a couple times,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.290
and so we don't get as
much feedback from her.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.010
So whenever Pablo
came into class,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.760
he told us what
we needed to fix,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.270
and that was the biggest
interaction with him

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.392
that we had.

00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:05.850
At first, we didn't
really know who

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.200
to design it for
because they said,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.230
we need two cholera
games for everybody.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.430
And so we were really
unsure and so finally,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.492
three or four weeks
into the project,

00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:18.950
we talked to the
other cholera team

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.270
and said, what are you doing?

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.120
Because we're going
to do the opposite.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.599
Because they wanted
two games that

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:25.890
would be for different groups,
and so then we did that.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.130
We talked to Pablo the
next time he came in,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.000
and he said, yes,
this is what I want.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.280
So luckily we managed
to guess what he wanted.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.980
It could have gone worse
if we did something

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.049
that he didn't want.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.189
So if that had
happened, and he said,

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:41.230
you guys are really going
in the wrong direction,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.789
I think we would have made
sure to email him more.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.450
But most of the time,
he's like, I like

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.575
the direction you're going.

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:48.850
You just need to fix
these sorts of things,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.633
so that's what we did.
