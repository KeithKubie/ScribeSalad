00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 Religious figure. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 In Egypt and Syria 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 What I want is to give it a general overview 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 About the wars in which France participated at the time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 I will then speak in more detail 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Of what Napoleon wanted to reach 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 And its role both at the beginning and end of many of these wars 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
 From 1792 to 1797 was the first war in the First Alliance 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 The participants were in Russia 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 Austria, Great Britain 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 I will write "Britain" only for a brief 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 This war was first started by France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 King Louis XVI was alive at the time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
 He supported this war, because he believed that the French people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 May lose and re-establish him as king 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Or maybe it would make it popular 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 Revolutionaries loved war because they wanted to 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 The revolution has to spread 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 The revolution ended with the Campo Formio agreement 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.466
 In the history of 1797, the reason for the victories of Napoleon in Italy is due 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 (Thus the Treaty of Campo Formio) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 Napoleon was at the time responsible for the Italian campaigns 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 The government was in France at the time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 directory 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
 Has considerable power depending on Napoleon's ability to defend them 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 Then in 1798 (let me write this in a different color) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 From 1798 to 1802, the Second Alliance began 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 You may notice that Napoleon took power 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 At the end of 1799 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 So this war has expanded the control of the government of managers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 As well as the expansion of Napoleon's control as the first consul 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 The participants in the war are Austria and Britain - again - 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 (They tend to be next to France) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 At this stage - especially Britain) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
 Russia as well as Russia 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 And to help you imagine what Austria's empire is 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 At the time - and the empire of Prussia - 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 (This map does not show this) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 So let me down a bit for this map 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 This was in 1810 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Let's go to advanced time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 This is in the history of 1805 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 I will draw the border slightly wider 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.066
 This is France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 These are the borders of France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 Indeed, they were able to take some of the regions 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 Now called Italy 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 This is France here 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 I can put all the borders if you want 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 But I think you got the idea 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 One of the empires that was at that time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 Does not exist now in its present form, which is Prussia 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Not at all 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 There is no Prussian empire, or Prussian people, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Or a Prussian state 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 You can see that it interferes with Germany 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.466
 And interfere with Poland, and some countries (I will not go into these details) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Here is the Austrian Empire 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 (The Austrian Empire there) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 As you can see, it's more than being 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 A modern nation or an Austrian country 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 This Russian empire, which follows the policy of "take and give" 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Not so different from Russia now. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 The big difference in this part of the world 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 (There are many differences) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 Between the world now and the world at that time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Is that there was no German people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 There is a gathering of people who speak German 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
 But they were scattered in a group of small states 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Which this map does not show 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
 Some were under Austrian rule; some were under Prussian rule 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 This vast union of states and Germanic kingdoms 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 It was called the Holy Roman Empire. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 Let me write it down 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 (Writing: Holy Roman Empire.) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.133
 Like the famous saying of Voltaire, "they were not holy and were not Roman" 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
 The Romans did not speak Latin. They are not Italians 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 They were Germans. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
 She was not holy, and she was not in control 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 It was not an empire, it was not a tightly controlled state 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Which seeks to expand its borders 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 It was a union of vast kingdoms 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 This gives you a vision of 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Shaped the world at that time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 After you consider this, I return to complete 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 Then the Second Alliance ended in 1801 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 The Treaty of Launville was signed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 That was to defeat the Austrians 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 The military capabilities of [other States] 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 Napoleon is now the Chargé d'affaires of France. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 But he led, once again, an Italian campaign against the Austrians. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 This was his victory in Marino 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 (I will speak in more detail in this) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 This was a declaration of victory over Austria, and the permissibility 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 For Napoleon to take more areas 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Parallel to the Italian peninsula 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 You can see it here, parallel to the Italian peninsula 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 And then later signed the Treaty of Amien 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 With Britain in 1802. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 That was already the end of the alliance. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 I guess you might say that the alliance ended in 1801, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 Because Austria has emerged from the coalition 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Russia was just a passive observer 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 She was involved, but she did not give, take or lose anything. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 After that, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 It is likely that the best explanation is why war is called war 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 But we will see that they have not been tired for a long time 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 We call it the "French Empire" 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 The Third Alliance 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 And 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
 We have Russia here. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 We have Austria again 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 There were other participants 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 There was Portugal 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 These were key participants 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
 In this video we will see that the Third Allied War 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
 Of the Third Alliance ended with the domination of Napoleon 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 On power in Europe 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 He ended up believing he was the person who could not be stopped 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 I'll talk about it in more detail 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 This led, in 1805 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 We will speak how to become an emperor 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 But in 1805 Napoleon (probably must say 1806, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
 Napoleon was seeing himself 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 A person who can not be stopped and can not be conquered 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 His winning good wins fueled his own arrogance 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 This was the overview, let's review something 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Of the life of Napoleon and the great role he played 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 In these conflicts 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
 The first thing we heard about Napoleon was in the history of 1793 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 (I'll draw it here) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 Which suppressed the revolution in 1793 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 Thus gaining fame throughout France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 And worldwide 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 In 1795 you may remember that the government of managers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 They were trying to form in Paris 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 In 1793 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 And in 1795 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 (Let me write it in a better color) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 In 1795 he defended Tuileries 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 By sending weapons and subjugating people 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
 To keep the revolutionary government of the monarchies 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 And all this was happening during 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 First Allied War 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 After that, Napoleon became general 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
 Responsible for the Italian campaign 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 In 1797 he was able to finish a war 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 The first coalition victory over France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 Beating Austria and Italy. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 The first coalition ended 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 After the Campo Formio agreement 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 That was Napoleon 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 Gel is very popular 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
 He began publishing some newspapers 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 He sent some military generals to quell 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
 Counterrevolution by the Malikis 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
 Thus becoming more popular 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 But the government of the managers was a bit scared of him 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
 Because of this 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
 They told him to go and do what he wanted 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 When Napoleon left Toulon 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 He went to Egypt 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
 He went with his great visions 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 Where he brought down a lot of damage there, and killed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
 And won multiple wars against the Ottomans 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
 Unfortunately for him, his close friend, Horacio Nelson, 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Destroyed his entire fleet in the battle of the Nile 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 Horacio (I'll write it in dark color) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 Horatio Nelson destroyed the whole fleet there 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
 They were stranded 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 In 1799 Napoleon was ready to give up 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 About his forces and return to France on his own 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 If in 1799 Napoleon returned to France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 We saw the last video 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 In 1799 he became the first Consul 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
 And the dictator or dictator in France 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
 They were at war with a Briton (that's why Horatio Nelson went 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
 Broke his fleet) 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 However he managed to control in 1799 or early 1800s 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
 They are still at war 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 Napoleon decided to take over 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.266
 He led troops across the Alps heading for Italy 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 When people often use the word "Great Britain" 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 The word goes back to the United Kingdom and Ireland 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.333
 If you want to be official, "Great Britain" is just coming back 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.133
 To the British island of England and Scotland 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 And Wales, including Ireland 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 So I do not want to repeat the saying 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" have now united 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
 In the early 1980s. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
 I will only say Great Britain 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 If the war with Great Britain ended as well 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 The Amien Convention, as we said earlier 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 That was a short-lived peace 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 Because Napoleon in 1803, removed in power, the Third Alliance was formed 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
 In the next video we'll see exactly how 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
 Napoleon was able to be victorious over all this 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
 the authorities ,
