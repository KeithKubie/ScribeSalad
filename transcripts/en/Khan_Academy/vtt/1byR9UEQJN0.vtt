00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.400
In this expression, we're
dividing this third degree

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.300
polynomial by this
first degree polynomial.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.360
And we could simplify
this by using

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.229
traditional algebraic
long division.

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.020
But what we're going
to cover in this video

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.436
is a slightly
different technique,

00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:15.990
and we call it
synthetic division.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.640
And synthetic division
is going to seem

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.470
like a little bit of voodoo
in the context of this video.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.886
In the next few
videos we're going

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:24.450
to think about why it actually
makes sense, why you actually

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.690
get the same result as
traditional algebraic long

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.540
division.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.830
My personal tastes are not
to like synthetic division

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.240
because it is very,
very, very algorithmic.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.150
I prefer to do traditional
algebraic long division.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.670
But I think you'll see that
this has some advantages.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.950
It can be faster.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.900
And it also uses a lot
less space on your paper.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.380
So let's actually perform
this synthetic division.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.750
Let's actually simplify
this expression.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.640
Before we start, there's
two important things

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.450
to keep in mind.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.400
We're doing, kind of,
the most basic form

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.730
of synthetic division.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
And to do this most basic
algorithm, this most basic

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.650
process, you have
to look for two

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.370
things in this
bottom expression.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.970
The first is that it has to
be a polynomial of degree 1.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.262
So you have just an x here.

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.220
You don't have an x
squared, an x to the third,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.220
an x to the fourth or
anything like that.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.470
The other thing is, is that
the coefficient here is a 1.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.910
There are ways to do it if
the coefficient was different,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.493
but then our synthetic
division, we'll

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:26.329
have to add a little bit of
bells and whistles to it.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.870
So in general, what
I'm going to show

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.170
you now will work if
you have something

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.580
of the form x plus or
minus something else.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.230
So with that said,
let's actually

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.114
perform the synthetic division.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:39.530
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.260
is write all the coefficients
for this polynomial

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.800
that's in the numerator.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.230
So let's write all of them.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.210
So we have a 3.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.780
We have a 4, that's
a positive 4.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.460
We have a negative 2.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.900
And a negative 1.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.380
And you'll see different people
draw different types of signs

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.220
here depending on how they're
doing synthetic division.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.800
But this is the
most traditional.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.350
And you want to leave
some space right here

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.473
for another row of numbers.

00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:11.000
So that's why I've gone
all the way down here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.130
And then we look
at the denominator.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.200
And in particular, we're
going to look whatever

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.340
x plus or minus is,
right over here.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.570
So we'll look at, right over
here, we have a positive 4.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.540
Instead of writing a positive 4,
we write the negative of that.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.090
So we write the negative,
which would be negative 4.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.250
And now we are
all set up, and we

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.660
are ready to perform
our synthetic division.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.150
And it's going to
seem like voodoo.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.350
In future videos, we'll
explain why this works.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.700
So first, this first
coefficient, we literally just

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.130
bring it straight down.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.990
And so you put the 3 there.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.200
Then you multiply what you
have here times the negative 4.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.820
So you multiply it
times the negative 4.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.840
3 times negative
4 is negative 12.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.820
Then you add the 4
to the negative 12.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.960
4 plus negative
12 is negative 8.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.500
Then you multiply negative
8 times the negative 4.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.480
I think you see the pattern.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.610
Negative 8 times negative
4 is positive 32.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.180
Now we add negative
2 plus positive 32.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.400
That gives us positive 30.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.600
Then you multiply the positive
30 times the negative 4.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.200
And that gives you negative 120.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.220
And then you add the negative
1 plus the negative 120.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.272
And you end up with
a negative 121.

00:03:43.272 --> 00:03:44.980
Now the last thing
you do is say, well, I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.970
have one term here.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.924
And in this plain,
vanilla, simple version

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:50.090
of synthetic division, we're
only dealing, actually,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.820
when you have x plus
or minus something.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.760
So you're only going
to have one term there.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.760
So you separate out one term
from the right, just like that.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.770
And we essentially
have our answer,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.250
even though it
seems like voodoo.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.230
So to simplify this, you get,
and you could have a drum roll

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.040
right over here,
this right over here,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.750
it's going to be
a constant term.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.460
You could think of it
as a degree 0 term.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.769
This is going to be an x term.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.928
And this is going to
be an x squared term.

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.594
You can kind of just
build up from here,

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.520
saying this first one is
going to be a constant.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.810
Then this is going to be an
x term, then an x squared.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.851
If we had more you'd have
an x to the third, an x

00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:28.740
to the fourth, so
on and so forth.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:41.750
So this is going to be equal
to 3x squared minus 8x plus 30.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.060
And this right over
here you can view

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.910
as the remainder, so minus
121 over the x plus 4.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.740
This didn't divide perfectly.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.397
So over the x plus 4.

00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:02.730
Another way you could have
done it, you could have said,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.760
this is the remainder.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.850
So I'm going to have a
negative 121 over x plus 4.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.222
And this is going to be plus
30 minus 8x plus 3x squared.

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:14.680
So hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.510
I'll do another example
in the next video.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.795
And then we'll think about
why this actually works.
