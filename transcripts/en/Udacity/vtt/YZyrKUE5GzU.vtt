00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.360
The shortest distance here would be 29 miles. Good thinking if you found this

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.373
number. We can actually use the Pythagorean theorem in this case, since we have

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:13.590
a right triangle. We know that our town is due south of the interstate, and our

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.022
interstate runs from west to east. So, this means that the interstate and this

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:23.810
north south direction meet at a right angle. So, the distance between these two

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.270
mile markers is one leg of our triangle. And this distance, 21 miles, is

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.192
another leg of our right triangle. So, we can square this leg and add it to the

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:38.599
square of this leg to get the square of our hypotenuse. So, we'll have a

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:42.801
squared plus b squared equals c squared. When we square these numbers and find

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:46.366
their sum, we'll get 841 equals c squared. And then taking the square root of

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:50.300
both sides, we'll have 1c is equal to the square root of 841, which equals 29.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:02.056
Great solving if you applied the Pythagorean theorem in this situation.
