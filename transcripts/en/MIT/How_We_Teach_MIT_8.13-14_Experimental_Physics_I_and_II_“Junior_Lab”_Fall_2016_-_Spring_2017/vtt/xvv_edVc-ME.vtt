JANET CONRAD: So the
students are also

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.870
expected to write papers.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.160
The papers are in the format of
Physical Review Letters, which

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.290
I think is a really valuable
thing for a couple of reasons.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.350
First of all, they
actually learn

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.750
what's called LaTeX which
is the system of laying out

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.160
the papers.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.380
Also, they discover
how incredibly hard

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.020
it is to fit what you
have done into four pages.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.600
And I'm pretty strict, they have
to follow the PRL guidelines.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.900
They're not allowed to
go over on their papers.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.400
But they also learn a lot about
what the elements of a paper

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.900
are.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.858
Like for example, how do
you write an abstract?

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.010
A lot of people have
trouble writing an abstract.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.320
They don't want to give
the answer away early,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.200
and the abstract has
the answer in it.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.060
So they are-- so they're
really bothered by doing that.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.270
They also tend to write
these more like you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.560
would write a book report.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.240
So they have a whole
history section

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.060
at the beginning, which is
not what a paper is about.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.880
And so I think it's really
a very valuable experience

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.870
for them to learn to write.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.460
I really like teaching writing.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.850
I actually teach a
writing course here

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.030
that's a communications
intensive in the major.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.710
So I'm a little bit
unusual this way.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.760
I don't mind grading
all of the papers, which

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.755
I think that a lot of people
don't want to teach Junior

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:28.380
Lab because they
don't want to be faced

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.850
with grading these papers.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.960
But I think we've got a
very good way of doing it.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.250
We have a rubric,
and the rubric is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.580
what we use to make sure that
we try to stay as even as we

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.470
can on all of the students.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.050
All the students
have the rubric also.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.826
It always makes me laugh,
because I hand out the rubric.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.450
I say, this is what
I'm grading you on,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.019
and then the first paper
comes in for the short labs.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:54.810
And of course, they
haven't read the rubric

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.136
and check the paper against it.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.260
And luckily, that paper
doesn't count for anything,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.310
because I always
write across the top,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.480
if you read the rubric you would
find out that you need this,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.100
like a section on your
errors, or things like that.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.320
And I think that the students
really liked that aspect of it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.170
Another thing that I
do to try to make sure

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.420
that all the grading
is even and fair

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410
is that I grade all of the
papers and mark them up.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.670
And also, my TA grades all of
the papers, and marks them up.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.150
And then we get together, and
we compare notes, and make sure

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.460
that we've seen the
same things in them,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.396
and decide on what the
grade is going to be.
