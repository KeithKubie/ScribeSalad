00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.420
Find the perimeter of a
rectangle with the length and

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.760
width given below.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.260
Express your answer as
a simplified rational

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.550
expression, and state
the domain.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.960
All right, so they give us the
length-- the length is this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.690
rational expression, and the
width is that right there.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.820
If we just draw ourselves
a rectangle-- let's draw

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.470
ourselves a rectangle up
here, so we don't use

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.060
valuable real estate.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.120
If that's the width, and that
is the length, the perimeter

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.720
of this rectangle is going to
be the width plus the length

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.235
times 2, because you have two
widths right here, and you

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:31.960
have two lengths.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.970
So you could view that as w plus
w plus l plus l, which is

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.710
the same thing as 2w plus 2l,
which is the same thing as 2

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.120
times the width plus
the length.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.690
So, we have to find out what two
times the width plus the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.540
length is as a rational
expression, so

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.110
let's write that down.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:01.710
The perimeter is going to be
equal to 2 times the width

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.069
plus the length, or we could say
the length plus the width,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.890
either way.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.240
So the width is x minus 3y over
x plus 4, and then the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.110
length is plus 2x plus
5y over x plus 4.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.900
Let's add these two rational
expressions: we have the same

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.360
denominator, so we can just
add the numerators.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.050
So this is going to be equal to
2 times-- the denominator

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.700
is going to be x plus 4, and we
have the same denominator.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.640
This problem wasn't too hairy,
we didn't have to come up with

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.290
a common denominator.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.230
We're going to have x minus
3y plus 2x plus 5y in the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.080
numerator, so let's
just simplify.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.400
We have our x terms-- you have
an x plus a 2x, so that's

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.570
going to give us a 3x in the
numerator, and then you have a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.080
negative 3x, and a 5y
in the numerator.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.050
Negative 3 plus 5 is plus
2y in the numerator.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.010
And then we can multiply out
this 2-- we can distribute

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.760
this 2, and then we end up with,
we have 2 times 3x is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:17.680
6x, 2 times 2y is 4y plus 4y,
all of that over x plus 4.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
And there's really no way to
simplify this anymore-- here,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.760
we actually had the 2 factored
out, and 3x plus 2y, no common

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.610
factors, it's not going to
cancel with x plus 4.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.170
And when they say state the
domain, we just have to think

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.600
about the x values that aren't
part of the domain, that would

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.890
make either of these
expressions, or this final

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.470
expression, undefined.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.720
Actually, all they care about
is the final expression.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.070
And the thing that would make
the final expression undefined

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.350
is if this denominator is
equal to 0, and the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.540
denominator is going to be equal
to zero when x is equal

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.150
to negative 4.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.340
So we can just constrain the
domain and say x cannot be

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.600
equal to negative 4, that we are
not defining, that this is

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
undefined at x equals
negative 4.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.950
So the simplified, rational
expression for perimeter: 6x

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.730
plus 4y over x plus 4.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.070
x cannot be negative 4.
