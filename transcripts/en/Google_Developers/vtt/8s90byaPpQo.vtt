MIHAI LONESCU: Hello.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.760
Welcome to Wallet
Developers Live.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.650
We recently launched
Google Wallet Objects

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.910
and now we're creating a
series of short tutorials

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.520
to educate developers about
the Wallet Objects API.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.240
The topic of today's
session is account creation.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.860
And in particular,
we're going to talk

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.980
about creating two
accounts-- your OAuth account

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.150
and your Wallet
Objects issuer account.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.310
Wallet Objects works with an
OAuth to service account model.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.860
That means to grant access
to data in Wallet Objects,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
you need to tell Wallet
Objects your OAuth

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.770
to service account
and then authorize

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.600
using the OAuth credentials.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.410
And we'll go through
the steps of generating

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.340
those accounts and
the associated items

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.880
in them one by one.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.430
First, let's create the
OAuth service account.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.250
So to do that we'll go to the
new Google Cloud API console,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.010
which is at
cloud.google.com/console.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.560
And once we navigate
there, you'll

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.150
see a page which invites
you to create a new project.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.055
So to do that, click
on Create Project.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.880
And then let's select
the project name.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.510
So in this case, let's
say my new account.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.700
And you can use the
project ID as is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.720
or select another
unique identifier.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.640
Of course, agree to
the terms of service.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.410
And then let's click Create.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.350
I'll take a few seconds while
your project is being created.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.280
And there we go.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.390
Once your project
is created, we will

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.570
need to enable Wallet Objects.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.020
So for that, go to
the APIs and Auth link

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.890
on the left navigation side.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.360
And then in here, let's
search for Wallet Objects.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.150
And then let's enable
the Wallet Objects API.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080
Now the API is enabled.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.330
And all we have to do is
register our application.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.930
For that, click on Register
Apps on the left side,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.550
and then on the big red
Register App button.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.520
You can select any name you
want for your application.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.652
And leave the Web Application
radio button selected.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.485
Then click Register.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.460
Take a few seconds, and now
your new app is registered.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.990
This will take us
to a screen where

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.480
it shows available
credentials below

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.650
to access various types of data.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.790
In our case, we will
need to access data

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.880
on one of Google's servers.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.030
So select the
Certificate section.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.290
And in here click on the
Generate Certificate button.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.530
This will create a new
certificate for you.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.445
And now your
certificate is ready.

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:04.430
It's very important too download
the private key file somewhere

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.090
on your computer and
make a note of where

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.640
it is because we will need
this credential later on

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.110
to authenticate when we
access Google Servers.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.370
So let's click on
Download Private Key.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.630
And you can download
it anywhere.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.080
You can name it-- it's a
pretty long name in here.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.660
Just choose a shorter name
and save it somewhere.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.740
So let's save this one.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.120
And now we're done.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.540
So two things that are
important to note here.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.030
One is the email
address of your service

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.970
account, which is this one here.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.400
And it's a big string at
developer.gserviceaccount.com.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.080
So make a note of that
address and save it somewhere.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.490
And of course, remember
where you generated

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.100
and saved your private key file.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.320
You can always generate a new
key by clicking on the button.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.590
And you can use
that key as well.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.540
So in this case, we
keep the original one.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.220
Now we switch to step two
of our configuration, which

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.110
is setting up your
Wallet Objects account.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.300
The Wallet Objects
account is a dashboard

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.780
that allows you to manage your
Wallet Objects, your classes

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.960
and objects that you created.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.610
We'll have more sessions
in the future highlighting

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.870
the functionality here.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.470
For this session,
we'll just focus

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.370
on configuring and
setting up the account.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.830
To access your Wallet
Objects account,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:55.250
open your browser and go to
 wallet.google.com/merchant/walletobjects.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.380
So let's navigate there.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.750
And you see for our
newly created account,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.730
there is not much there.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.380
To set it up, click on Account
Management on the left nav bar.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.940
And here you have some
basic account information.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.660
So make a note of the issuer ID.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.240
This is your-- if you want
to call it-- merchant ID.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.880
And it's very important
to make a note of it

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.680
and know what it is.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.100
You will use it later
on when we make calls

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.870
to Google Wallet Objects.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.280
One extra step you have to do
to properly set up the account

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.990
is to associate it with
your OAuth service account.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.730
So let's share this account
with the OAuth service account.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.070
So for that, we will
need to select and add

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.840
here the email address that we
created in the OAuth service

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.340
account.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.370
So I'm switching back to
the OAuth service account,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.445
and I'll copy
paste this address.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.175
And then I'll go back here.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.941
And I'm going to share it
with my Google Wallet Objects

00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:15.440
account.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:18.805
Now you're all done.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.380
Your Wallet Objects
account is ready to be

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.810
used to issue REST
calls to Google Server.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.540
So to recap, make a
note of your issuer ID.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.040
Make a note of where you saved
your key file with the OAuth

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.970
credentials.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.845
And also make a note of your
issuer account email address.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.400
You can always go
to the Cloud Console

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.700
if you don't remember it to
copy paste it from there.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.735
Or if you don't remember
where your keys are,

00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:04.050
you can always
generate new keys.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.190
And the issuer ID can be found
in your Google Wallet Objects

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.750
account.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.790
And now that we have
our accounts configured

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.870
and all set up,
let's see what we

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.530
can do with all
that information.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.850
I will show you how easy
it is to use your OAuth

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.060
credentials to make JSON calls.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.350
In future session,
we will explore

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.360
how you can make more complex
calls using different languages

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.419
like Java, Python, PHP, Ruby.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.789
But for now, we'll just do
a very simple call in JSON.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.350
The first step
would be to generate

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.780
a bearer token as required
by the OAuth standard.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.720
We have created a
set of tools for you

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.470
that makes that very easy.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.090
To generate the bearer
token, have a look

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.880
at our testing section
in the documentation.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.310
And in particular, we have
created a Java-based utility

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.940
that will allow you to
obtain a bearer token.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.360
Our utility is
called tokenutil.jr.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.790
And it's open sourced in GitHub.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.580
We have a link from
our documentation.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.920
And you can very
easily download it

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:36.320
by selecting the Row
download and save it

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.060
somewhere on your machine.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.770
Once we have that
utility handy, then we

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.690
can go ahead and
request a bearer token.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.850
Going back to our
documentation, use the command

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:55.340
I'm highlighting here to
obtain the bearer token.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.660
Remember earlier we saved the
service account email address.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.790
And I told you to
remember where you

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.610
saved your private key file.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.860
So with that information, I'm
going to use this command here.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.320
Copy paste it and
issue a command

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.600
to retrieve the bearer token.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.080
So with some information
I already saved,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.940
this is my test
service account email.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:35.820
And I saved my credentials
in a file called key.p12.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.030
So let's issue that command.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:42.680
It takes a moment.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.900
And we retrieve
back a bearer token.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.890
So now you can copy paste
this guy here, and save it

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.450
somewhere in a notepad.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:00.140
And we will use that to issue
a JSON command to the Wallet

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.490
Objects service.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.630
Remember, this bearer token,
it's valid for an hour.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:13.270
So if later on you want to play
again with issuing JSON calls,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.140
remember to generate a new one.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.670
How do we generate calls
to Google Wallet Objects?

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.700
So we have some examples
where we can very easily test

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.420
the REST API on
our testing page.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.210
So if you page down a little bit
to the Test REST API section,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.420
you will see a few
examples how you

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.800
can query for existing
objects or classes,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.080
or how you can get a list of
classes, a list of objects,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.940
how we can insert the class.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.410
In future sessions, we'll go in
more detail over all of these.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.950
For now, let's just show
you how you can easily

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.750
retrieve all these tough
classes for an account that

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.510
has already a few classes in it.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.630
So the command is the
one highlighted here.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:10.680
And very nicely you can use
call to issue the command.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.090
So what do you need to
change in this template?

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.520
Of course, you have to
specify a class type.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.870
And in this example,
we'll use a loyalty class.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.760
You will need to change the
issuer ID with the issuer ID

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.470
we generated earlier.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.460
So I'll switch again to your
Wallet Objects dashboard.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.495
And remember, the issuer ID is
here under Account Management.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.180
And finally, we will
use the bearer token

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.040
we just generated using the
utility tool we provided.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.670
So if in this command we
override all this information

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.520
and copy paste it
somewhere in Notepad.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.640
And I have an example here.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.740
I'll just copy this, and
then go to a terminal.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.560
And then we are now ready
to issue a command to Google

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.040
Wallet Objects to retrieve
a list of existing classes.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.360
And here we are.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:23.660
We received the JSON with
all the existing classes

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.117
in this Google Objects account.

00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:27.700
So in future session,
of course, we'll

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.680
go in more detail
what everything means.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.050
And you'll get a better
understanding of the response.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.000
But for today, we
accomplished quite a lot.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.840
We set up our OAuth account
and our Google Wallet Objects

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.940
account.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.485
And with that information,
we obtained a bearer token,

00:13:47.485 --> 00:13:50.780
and issued a JSON
call, and received

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.330
a list of existing loyalty
classes from our account.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.570
And that concludes the first of
our Wallet Objects Tutorials.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.570
In a future session, we'll
talk about templates, objects,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.730
and classes.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.200
Until then, goodbye.
