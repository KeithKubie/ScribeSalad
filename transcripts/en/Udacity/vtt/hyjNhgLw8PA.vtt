00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.554
9x-7 is the simplified
version of 4x+5x-7.

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:10.790
To simplify this algebraic
expression we combined like terms.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.500
Like terms, which are sometimes also
called common terms, are terms that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.230
have the same variables and those
variables are raised to the same power.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.500
So in this equation,
4x and 5x are like terms.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
They combine to get 9x.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.150
Are these pairs of terms like terms?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.812
Select yes or no for each pair.

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:35.019
