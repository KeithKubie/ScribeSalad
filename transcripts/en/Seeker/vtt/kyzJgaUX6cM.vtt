00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.950
There are places in the world which are being
eaten away as sea levels rise.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.259
What's going to happen to them!?

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.840
Hey friends, it's Trace, thanks for tuning
in to DNews!

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.040
Whether you call it global warming or climate
change, this shiz is going down -- it's happening.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.960
According to a study in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, for every

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.970
2 degrees (1 C) increase in global temperatures,
the seas will rise seven feet (2.3 M).

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.970
That's HUGE.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.329
Sea levels are rising because of melting ice,
yes, but ALSO warming oceans -- as you might

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.010
remember from physics, warm things expand,
and that includes water.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.450
But when you're talking about quintillions
of gallons, even a small expansion can up

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.859
sea levels.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.769
Places like Kiribati -- a 33 island-nation
in the Pacific, are already being affected.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.469
The 100,000 people that live on Kiribati's
islands have already started to feel rising

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.379
seas encroach on their way of life.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.749
Perhaps as soon as 30 years from now, their
country will become uninhabitable.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.620
Because of seawater creeping into their fields,
the government purchased 6,000 acres (2428

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.899
hectares) on nearby Fiji so they could provide
food security and a refuge if people become

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:13.899
homeless.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.899
This is happening now!

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.149
And they're not the only ones, the 350 archipelago
chains of Panama are being lost to sea level

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.159
rise, and though they're lucky to have the
mainland of Panama to move onto, the indigenous

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.170
Kuna people have lived there for thousands
of years -- and now, thanks to global climate

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.289
screwery -- their islands will be underwater
in maybe 20 years.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.289
20!

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.689
Tuvalu is a famous island nation, for two,
rather saddening reasons.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.000
One, they are like 10 feet (3 meters) above
sea level, and they're slowly disappearing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.469
And two, they blame two of the largest carbon
emitters for destroying their nation and threatened

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.770
to sue them in the International Court of
Justice in the Hague.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.820
Those two countries were the United States
and Australia.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.909
Kiribati and the Maldives joined the lawsuit,
but it never came to fruition.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.999
The seas of Funafuti, the atoll Tuvalu is
on, have risen about a quarter inch (5.5 mm)

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.030
every year for the last decade.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.850
During World War II, US soldiers placed a
gun embankment on a Tuvalu beach, and it's

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.380
now 20 feet offshore.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.490
But this isn't just happening on tiny, far-flung
Pacific islands.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.670
The city of Venice is 118 islands built up
over 1,500 years.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.220
As sea levels increase 2 millimeters every
year, they're trying to build seawalls to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.250
stop the oceans, but in the next 20 years,
they'll be fighting 3.2 inches (80 mm) more

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.630
ocean, with more coming every year.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.500
More to splash around, more to flood, and
more to try to hold back.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.610
And holding back the sea is only part of it,
a warming climate means more intense storms

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.790
and higher levels mean bigger storm surges…

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.910
The Sydney Opera was built 11 feet above sea
level and is only 41 years old, and scientists

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.450
are worried the pier it's built on will be
increasingly vulnerable to storm surges and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.450
extreme weather.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.610
And 2012 study by the U.S. Geological Survey
predicts the sea levels on the eastern seaboard

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.170
of the United States will rise three to four
times faster than the global average!

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.190
After Superstorm Sandy, Liberty Island where
New York's Statue of Liberty stands, was 75

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.320
percent under water and Ellis Island was completely
submerged.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.940
These monuments might seem like they'll be
there forever, but as seas rise and the earth

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940
warms…

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.940
We don't know...

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940
How does stuff like this make you feel?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.460
Should island nations be able to sue carbon-spewing
ones?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.070
Tell us what you think in the comments below,
we do actually read them, ya know.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.870
And if you wanna know more island facts, our
friends at AllTime10s talked about 10 uninhabited

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.510
islands.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.900
Check out their video by clicking on this
link, or the link in the description.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.900
