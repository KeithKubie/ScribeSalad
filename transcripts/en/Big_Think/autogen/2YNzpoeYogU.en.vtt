00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870
 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.740
when we want to change people's behavior

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
when we want to change people's behavior
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.320
when we want to change people's behavior
we often say do this don't do that right

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
we often say do this don't do that right
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.380
we often say do this don't do that right
basically we are a lot of times giving

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
basically we are a lot of times giving
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.529
basically we are a lot of times giving
orders whether it is to our kids people

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
orders whether it is to our kids people
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.659
orders whether it is to our kids people
in our family people that we work it

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669
in our family people that we work it
 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.409
in our family people that we work it
with we are exerting control over others

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419
with we are exerting control over others
 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.059
with we are exerting control over others
or at least attempting to exert control

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:29.069
or at least attempting to exert control
 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.630
or at least attempting to exert control
over others but what we find is that

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640
over others but what we find is that
 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.880
over others but what we find is that
what the brain is trying to do it's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
what the brain is trying to do it's
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250
what the brain is trying to do it's
trying to control its environment that's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
trying to control its environment that's
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.800
trying to control its environment that's
one of the the major goals of what the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810
one of the the major goals of what the
 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.400
one of the the major goals of what the
brain is trying to do and it's trying to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
brain is trying to do and it's trying to
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260
brain is trying to do and it's trying to
do that in order to get rewards and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
do that in order to get rewards and
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.340
do that in order to get rewards and
avoid losses and because of that in the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
avoid losses and because of that in the
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.440
avoid losses and because of that in the
brain control has been associated with

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450
brain control has been associated with
 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.300
brain control has been associated with
something good with a reward and it's

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310
something good with a reward and it's
 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.870
something good with a reward and it's
something that people seek out if people

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880
something that people seek out if people
 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.210
something that people seek out if people
can make a choice the same part of the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220
can make a choice the same part of the
 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.670
can make a choice the same part of the
brain that is activated when people get

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
brain that is activated when people get
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.800
brain that is activated when people get
a piece of food like a piece of

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810
a piece of food like a piece of
 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.630
a piece of food like a piece of
chocolate is activated when people have

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
chocolate is activated when people have
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370
chocolate is activated when people have
an opportunity to make a choice when

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
an opportunity to make a choice when
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929
an opportunity to make a choice when
people don't have an opportunity to make

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
people don't have an opportunity to make
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.940
people don't have an opportunity to make
a choice when they feel they don't have

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
a choice when they feel they don't have
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.590
a choice when they feel they don't have
control what is triggered is anxiety and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
control what is triggered is anxiety and
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.069
control what is triggered is anxiety and
so what this means is that giving people

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079
so what this means is that giving people
 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.739
so what this means is that giving people
a choice giving people a sense that they

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749
a choice giving people a sense that they
 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.080
a choice giving people a sense that they
are in control that they have agency is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
are in control that they have agency is
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469
are in control that they have agency is
more likely to motivate them is more

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
more likely to motivate them is more
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.139
more likely to motivate them is more
likely to put them in the frame of a

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149
likely to put them in the frame of a
 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.609
likely to put them in the frame of a
reward rather than a loss and because

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
reward rather than a loss and because
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.699
reward rather than a loss and because
control in and of itself is rewarding a

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709
control in and of itself is rewarding a
 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.340
control in and of itself is rewarding a
lot of times people will be willing to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
lot of times people will be willing to
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.679
lot of times people will be willing to
give up other kind of rewards like

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
give up other kind of rewards like
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120
give up other kind of rewards like
monetary rewards in order to have

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
monetary rewards in order to have
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.099
monetary rewards in order to have
control for example in a study that I

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109
control for example in a study that I
 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.620
control for example in a study that I
conducted with my colleagues we gave

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
conducted with my colleagues we gave
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.269
conducted with my colleagues we gave
people the opportunity to either make

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279
people the opportunity to either make
 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.480
people the opportunity to either make
choices themselves about random shapes

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
choices themselves about random shapes
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910
choices themselves about random shapes
that can give them rewards or give

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
that can give them rewards or give
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789
that can give them rewards or give
another person an expert an opportunity

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
another person an expert an opportunity
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.769
another person an expert an opportunity
to make a choice for them and what we

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779
to make a choice for them and what we
 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.529
to make a choice for them and what we
found is that people stopped optimally

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539
found is that people stopped optimally
 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.039
found is that people stopped optimally
make the decision to have to keep the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
make the decision to have to keep the
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.109
make the decision to have to keep the
agency to keep the choice themselves

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
agency to keep the choice themselves
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969
agency to keep the choice themselves
rather than have an expert make the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
rather than have an expert make the
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.460
rather than have an expert make the
choice for them even if the expert was

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
choice for them even if the expert was
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930
choice for them even if the expert was
more likely to choose a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
more likely to choose a
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.550
more likely to choose a
correct thing to choose a thing that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
correct thing to choose a thing that
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.980
correct thing to choose a thing that
will get them more money so a way to

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
will get them more money so a way to
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.600
will get them more money so a way to
think about it it's a bit like the stock

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
think about it it's a bit like the stock
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.330
think about it it's a bit like the stock
market so a lot of people like to pick

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
market so a lot of people like to pick
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.090
market so a lot of people like to pick
their own stocks right instead of giving

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
their own stocks right instead of giving
 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.950
their own stocks right instead of giving
someone else the opportunity to choose

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960
someone else the opportunity to choose
 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.200
someone else the opportunity to choose
for them experts so even better going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210
for them experts so even better going
 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.840
for them experts so even better going
according to an index right and the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
according to an index right and the
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.220
according to an index right and the
reason that people like to pick their

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
reason that people like to pick their
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.690
reason that people like to pick their
own stocks it because it gives them a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
own stocks it because it gives them a
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520
own stocks it because it gives them a
sense of control it gives them a sense

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
sense of control it gives them a sense
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800
sense of control it gives them a sense
of agency and that gives them reward and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
of agency and that gives them reward and
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.750
of agency and that gives them reward and
many times people realize that there

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
many times people realize that there
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.910
many times people realize that there
might be a monetary loss some people are

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
might be a monetary loss some people are
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800
might be a monetary loss some people are
overconfidence they think well I'll pick

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
overconfidence they think well I'll pick
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.270
overconfidence they think well I'll pick
the right thing and that's fine but they

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
the right thing and that's fine but they
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.800
the right thing and that's fine but they
still are willing to lose parts to have

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
still are willing to lose parts to have
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.270
still are willing to lose parts to have
a monetary loss to make the choice

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
a monetary loss to make the choice
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460
a monetary loss to make the choice
themselves so in fact in in general

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
themselves so in fact in in general
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.020
themselves so in fact in in general
people people prefer to make their own

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
people people prefer to make their own
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.910
people people prefer to make their own
choices but the there are incidents

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
choices but the there are incidents
 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.040
choices but the there are incidents
where people would rather give away that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050
where people would rather give away that
 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.410
where people would rather give away that
choice and for example when the choice

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
choice and for example when the choice
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.560
choice and for example when the choice
is so complicated the effort is so so

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570
is so complicated the effort is so so
 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.540
is so complicated the effort is so so
much effort has to be put in it that I

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
much effort has to be put in it that I
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.670
much effort has to be put in it that I
would rather not do it and give someone

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
would rather not do it and give someone
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
would rather not do it and give someone
else the opportunity to make the choice

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690
else the opportunity to make the choice
 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.800
else the opportunity to make the choice
for me or for example under high amounts

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
for me or for example under high amounts
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.620
for me or for example under high amounts
of stress people sometimes realize that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
of stress people sometimes realize that
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.030
of stress people sometimes realize that
it's better to have someone else make

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
it's better to have someone else make
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.229
it's better to have someone else make
the choice for them or for example when

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
the choice for them or for example when
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.710
the choice for them or for example when
making a choice people are afraid that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720
making a choice people are afraid that
 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.110
making a choice people are afraid that
they will regret what they choose such

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
they will regret what they choose such
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.630
they will regret what they choose such
as in medical decisions they sometimes

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640
as in medical decisions they sometimes
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.220
as in medical decisions they sometimes
actually prefer to have someone else

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
actually prefer to have someone else
 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.030
actually prefer to have someone else
make the choice for them and in the book

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
make the choice for them and in the book
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.670
make the choice for them and in the book
I talk about the things that people are

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
I talk about the things that people are
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.990
I talk about the things that people are
scared of the most

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
scared of the most
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840
scared of the most
and the fears that we have are not

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
and the fears that we have are not
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.470
and the fears that we have are not
necessarily rational so people for

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
necessarily rational so people for
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.970
necessarily rational so people for
example are a lot of people are scared

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
example are a lot of people are scared
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.000
example are a lot of people are scared
of flying right so if you look at the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
of flying right so if you look at the
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.340
of flying right so if you look at the
numbers flying is not necessarily the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350
numbers flying is not necessarily the
 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.890
numbers flying is not necessarily the
most dangerous thing that you do driving

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
most dangerous thing that you do driving
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.690
most dangerous thing that you do driving
your own car is more dangerous but

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700
your own car is more dangerous but
 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.790
your own car is more dangerous but
people are afraid of flying because one

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800
people are afraid of flying because one
 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.190
people are afraid of flying because one
of the reasons is that once you're in

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200
of the reasons is that once you're in
 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.870
of the reasons is that once you're in
the plane you don't have control anymore

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
the plane you don't have control anymore
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.430
the plane you don't have control anymore
you don't have control over the plane

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
you don't have control over the plane
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.900
you don't have control over the plane
you don't have control of anything

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
you don't have control of anything
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.360
you don't have control of anything
really of your environment so the sense

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370
really of your environment so the sense
 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.759
really of your environment so the sense
of being in this space where you're

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
of being in this space where you're
 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.680
of being in this space where you're
losing control completely giving it to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
losing control completely giving it to
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.360
losing control completely giving it to
someone else is something that people

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
someone else is something that people
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.000
someone else is something that people
feel anxious about now they don't want

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010
feel anxious about now they don't want
 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.530
feel anxious about now they don't want
to take control I don't want to fly the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540
to take control I don't want to fly the
 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.060
to take control I don't want to fly the
plane right I know I will be dead if

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
plane right I know I will be dead if
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.860
plane right I know I will be dead if
I'll slide the pain but nevertheless I

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
I'll slide the pain but nevertheless I
 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.390
I'll slide the pain but nevertheless I
feel anxious and I think that's true in

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
feel anxious and I think that's true in
 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.330
feel anxious and I think that's true in
other domains like health

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340
other domains like health
 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.400
other domains like health
one of the reasons that being in a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410
one of the reasons that being in a
 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.850
one of the reasons that being in a
hospital is anxiety-provoking not only

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860
hospital is anxiety-provoking not only
 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.770
hospital is anxiety-provoking not only
because you're sick and that's very you

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780
because you're sick and that's very you
 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.480
because you're sick and that's very you
know anxiety floating but also because

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
know anxiety floating but also because
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.730
know anxiety floating but also because
again you lose control everyone's making

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740
again you lose control everyone's making
 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.590
again you lose control everyone's making
the decision for you as they should the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600
the decision for you as they should the
 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.000
the decision for you as they should the
doctors and the nurses I mean people

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010
doctors and the nurses I mean people
 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.280
doctors and the nurses I mean people
should have some say but they realize

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290
should have some say but they realize
 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.650
should have some say but they realize
that the experts are making the choices

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
that the experts are making the choices
 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.750
that the experts are making the choices
for them and that sense of losing

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760
for them and that sense of losing
 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.500
for them and that sense of losing
control again can cause anxiety and one

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510
control again can cause anxiety and one
 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.379
control again can cause anxiety and one
thing that studies have shown is that as

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389
thing that studies have shown is that as
 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.640
thing that studies have shown is that as
we age as we go into older age we lose

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650
we age as we go into older age we lose
 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.830
we age as we go into older age we lose
some of our control right especially if

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840
some of our control right especially if
 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.750
some of our control right especially if
we go to nursing homes other people make

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760
we go to nursing homes other people make
 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.330
we go to nursing homes other people make
the choices for us and that induces

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340
the choices for us and that induces
 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.490
the choices for us and that induces
stress on the individual as well because

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500
stress on the individual as well because
 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.890
stress on the individual as well because
no longer can I choose what will I do

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900
no longer can I choose what will I do
 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.790
no longer can I choose what will I do
and when will I do it and giving people

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800
and when will I do it and giving people
 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.590
and when will I do it and giving people
a sense of control back can help them

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600
a sense of control back can help them
 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.000
a sense of control back can help them
again with kids

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010
again with kids
 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.670
again with kids
people tell tend to tell kids exactly

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680
people tell tend to tell kids exactly
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.100
people tell tend to tell kids exactly
what to do when to do it and so on and

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
what to do when to do it and so on and
 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.950
what to do when to do it and so on and
there's a lot of you know kids are not

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960
there's a lot of you know kids are not
 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.290
there's a lot of you know kids are not
happy with that but we could change that

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300
happy with that but we could change that
 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.030
happy with that but we could change that
you know until instead of telling the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040
you know until instead of telling the
 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.290
you know until instead of telling the
other kids well you have to eat your

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300
other kids well you have to eat your
 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.510
other kids well you have to eat your
salad maybe say oh why don't you create

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520
salad maybe say oh why don't you create
 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.920
salad maybe say oh why don't you create
your own salad here are the different

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
your own salad here are the different
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.030
your own salad here are the different
ingredient they're putting them together

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040
ingredient they're putting them together
 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.640
ingredient they're putting them together
create them and one study that we've

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650
create them and one study that we've
 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.700
create them and one study that we've
done shown that when people and it's not

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710
done shown that when people and it's not
 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.440
done shown that when people and it's not
only us we did one example of this

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450
only us we did one example of this
 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.820
only us we did one example of this
there's many many studies showing that

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830
there's many many studies showing that
 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.340
there's many many studies showing that
that when you create something you value

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350
that when you create something you value
 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.800
that when you create something you value
it more so we did a study where people

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810
it more so we did a study where people
 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.670
it more so we did a study where people
created their own converse shoes and

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680
created their own converse shoes and
 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.219
created their own converse shoes and
they liked a converse shoes that they

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229
they liked a converse shoes that they
 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.290
they liked a converse shoes that they
created much more than a Congress shoes

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300
created much more than a Congress shoes
 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.840
created much more than a Congress shoes
which looked exactly the same that

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850
which looked exactly the same that
 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.640
which looked exactly the same that
someone else created the same colors the

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
someone else created the same colors the
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.110
someone else created the same colors the
same shape everything was exactly the

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120
same shape everything was exactly the
 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.800
same shape everything was exactly the
same but if I created it I liked it more

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810
same but if I created it I liked it more
 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.570
same but if I created it I liked it more
moreover even if I didn't create it but

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580
moreover even if I didn't create it but
 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.370
moreover even if I didn't create it but
I thought I created it I believed I

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380
I thought I created it I believed I
 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.560
I thought I created it I believed I
created I wrongly had a memory that I

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570
created I wrongly had a memory that I
 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.130
created I wrongly had a memory that I
created the shoe I liked it better so if

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140
created the shoe I liked it better so if
 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.250
created the shoe I liked it better so if
you feel like you had agency and

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260
you feel like you had agency and
 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.279
you feel like you had agency and
something in whether it's a product

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289
something in whether it's a product
 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.260
something in whether it's a product
whether it's an idea then you feel like

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270
whether it's an idea then you feel like
 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.909
whether it's an idea then you feel like
it's worth more and it doesn't actually

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919
it's worth more and it doesn't actually
 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.320
it's worth more and it doesn't actually
have to be a true perception you just

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330
have to be a true perception you just
 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.990
have to be a true perception you just
have to have a perception of an agency

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000
have to have a perception of an agency
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.600
have to have a perception of an agency
the perception of a control in order to

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
the perception of a control in order to
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.960
the perception of a control in order to
value that thing

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970
value that thing
 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.990
value that thing
and that's what we've shown in our study

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000
and that's what we've shown in our study
 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.790
and that's what we've shown in our study
looking at how people create shoes and

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800
looking at how people create shoes and
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.340
looking at how people create shoes and
how they value them

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350
how they value them
 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.600
how they value them
