00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.299
In all the studies of procrastination, what
they’ve basically said are two things: &nbsp;number

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.889
one, you can’t find some work reward that’s
going to take the place of procrastination.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.889
&nbsp;Right?

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.990
&nbsp;If the reward for procrastination is that
you get to spend five minutes distracted by

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.820
Facebook, you have to allow yourself to do
that.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.830
That has to be part of your work day.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:32.090
&nbsp;If you need five minutes every hour to look
at tweets or to just surf the internet, you

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.699
need to schedule that into your schedule,
allow yourself to do that.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.379
&nbsp;Because when people start procrastinating,
what they’ve done is, they’ve tried to

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.410
ignore that urge.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.540
&nbsp;They try to deny themselves time on Facebook
or time surfing the web.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.539
&nbsp;And then all of a sudden, it erupts and
they go and they say, I’m just going to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.510
check for five minutes, and 45 minutes later,
they’ve lost, you know, all of this time.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.390
&nbsp;It’s because they haven’t accommodated
that need.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.390
&nbsp;

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.600
Again, once the habit exists, you can’t
just quelch it.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.190
&nbsp;You can’t pretend it’s not there.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.280
&nbsp;You have to sort of accommodate this need
in your life.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.520
&nbsp;And so the answer is, to give yourself five
minutes every hour.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.390
&nbsp;In fact, you can set an alarm at the end
of every hour give yourself five minutes to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.440
surf the web.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.600
&nbsp;Because if you allow yourself five minutes
every hour, it won’t explode into 45 minutes

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.170
because you’ve been trying to suppress it.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.170
&nbsp;

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.560
But the other thing we also know, and this
is very interesting, and this is something

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.910
I actually found when writing the book.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.160
&nbsp;The more you focus, the more that focus
becomes a habit.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.030
&nbsp;So, willpower is like a muscle, right?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.220
&nbsp;It’s this muscle that you can build up,
and it gets tired, but the more you exercise

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.610
it, the stronger it gets.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.380
&nbsp;The same is true of our ability to focus.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.130
&nbsp;The more you practice focusing, the easier
focusing becomes.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.130
&nbsp;

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.110
And so the other answer for procrastination
is, don’t beat up on yourself.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.810
&nbsp;Let yourself practice going longer and longer
and longer without taking a five-minute break

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.959
to check Facebook because after three or four
weeks, after three or four months you’ll

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.680
be able to sustain focus much longer, but
the key is, you can’t change everything

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680
overnight.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.280
&nbsp;You can’t suddenly say, I want a brand
new habit tomorrow and expect it to be east

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.540
and effortless.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.720
&nbsp;It’s something you have to give yourself
permission to take a little bit of time to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.620
practices because you’re building up neuro
pathways associated with certain behavior

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.730
and those neuro pathways just build up over
time.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.969
&nbsp;You can’t speed up that process any more
than is natural. &nbsp;&nbsp;
