00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.674
- [Instructor] So why do we care

00:00:01.674 --> 00:00:03.570
about the Market Revolution?

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.805
The Industrial Revolution
and the Transportation

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.175
and the Communication Revolutions
of the early 19th century

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.945
had a major impact on American society,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.615
both in the short term
and in the long term.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.418
In this video, I want to talk
about three major effects

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.454
of the Market Revolution,
and those were changes

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.959
in labor, entry into a national

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.862
and international market system

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.932
and the Second Great Awakening.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:35.835
All right, so what effect

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.004
did the Market Revolution have on labor?

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.074
Well, we've already talked
about this a little bit

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.512
in the earlier videos, but here is a view

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.947
of a textile factory floor.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.550
Now this is from a slightly later period,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.920
but I think it gives you a
good sense of what it was like

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.889
to work in a textile factory.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.561
With the Market Revolution
really comes the emergence

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.799
of factory labor in the United States.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.402
And there are a couple of
ways that, that's important.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.238
One is that people
start working for wages.

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:17.310
It's a move away from subsistence farming

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.032
and a barter economy,
which also means that

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:25.710
people aren't necessarily in
charge of themselves anymore.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.514
And there's a lot that
goes along with that,

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:31.552
which means that people
stop being their own bosses.

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:35.395
Instead, they report to other bosses.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.505
And that can be problematic because

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.137
it means that you have a lot less control

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.839
over your daily life.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.976
So imagine that you're a
farmer and you're really sick.

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.413
Oh well, you know maybe you
don't plant some seed that day

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.615
and you do it the next day.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.617
Imagine that you work at a textile mill

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.119
and you get really sick,
you don't report to work

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.588
and you get fired.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.625
So people are no longer
able to set the pace

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.964
of their own lives by and large.

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:13.312
And with things like
interchangeable parts, for example,

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:19.234
fewer and fewer artisans,
so masters of a craft,

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.743
are making goods from start to finish.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:28.653
So it used to be perhaps you
would be a master shoemaker,

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:33.653
a master cobbler, and you would
make every part of that shoe

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:39.498
from tanning the leather
to nailing in the sole.

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:44.065
The system of interchangeable parts,

00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:47.898
which will later become even more codified

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:51.140
as the assembly-line system,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.685
means that most people are only doing

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:58.859
one part of a task.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.048
So instead of doing all of
making a shoe and saying

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.317
at the end of it, "I made this shoe,

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:08.688
"I am a master maker of
shoes," now your entire job

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.392
might just be to hammer in one nail

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:16.429
and then hand off the
shoe to the next person.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.132
So there's never anything
that you can point to

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.234
and say, "I made that."

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.703
So a lot of people say
that this is a period

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:28.209
when people stop being able to
take pride in their own work

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.039
or at least not as much pride.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.983
But what's even more
important about this process

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:40.019
of interchangeable parts,
assembly-line labor,

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.019
is that it leads to an overall,
what they call, deskilling.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.618
So removing the skill from labor.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.966
And what's important about that is that

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:57.888
if you've broken down a
task into enough small parts

00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:01.578
that you've got people
literally hammering in

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:05.612
the same nail on a different
shoe 12 hours a day,

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:10.310
then you don't necessarily
need highly trained artisans

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.086
to do that.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:18.086
And what happens if you
are not highly trained,

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:24.030
we'll call this unskilled labor,
and you decide you want to

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.765
strike for higher pay?

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.935
Well, your boss doesn't
need to train anyone

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.505
to hammer in that nail
so you'll just get fired.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.641
So it makes the labor force in general

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.610
a little bit more precarious
because you don't need

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.047
an exceptional skill
to have a factory job,

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:45.284
but you are easily replaced.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:48.421
All right, let's talk about
entry into a market system.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.623
Now what do I mean by this?

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:54.260
In this time period, the
United States develops

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.130
what's called a market economy.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.501
And that's different from what
most people had been doing

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:05.171
up until that point because
people in the United States

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:09.008
had mainly shipped raw materials

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:13.630
over to Europe, England particularly,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.816
to be processed and made
into finished goods.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:20.019
And this is similar to
the system of mercantilism

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.856
that you might be familiar
with from the colonial era.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.826
Well, the war of 1812
and some of the conflict

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:31.826
leading up to it, led the United
States to embargo England,

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.901
which was a manufacturing center.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.003
So people couldn't send
their raw materials there.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.707
They responded by investing
in their own factories.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:45.044
So the war of 1812 is actually
a pretty important moment

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:49.965
for the development of domestic
industrialization at home.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:55.722
And so now, instead of
this kind of import/export

00:05:55.722 --> 00:06:00.722
or barter economy, people are making deals

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:07.300
with other investors all
over the United States,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.335
all over the world.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:13.506
So this gives people an
opportunity to invest

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.743
and to speculate.

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:19.479
And that means that as they're a part

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.479
of an international market
of investment speculation,

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.954
they're prone to the
kinds of booms and busts

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:32.924
that characterize capitalism, right?

00:06:32.924 --> 00:06:35.194
Now we often think of the Great Depression

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:38.464
as having been the first
major American depression.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:42.135
But really, it was the
largest and most recent

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:46.205
up until that point, because
after the war of 1812,

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.075
the United States kinda
goes through approximately

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.611
a 20-year cycle of boom and bust.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.380
So boom is when things are getting better,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.717
things are looking up, the
economy is going really well,

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:01.587
and then a bubble of some kind bursts.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:06.587
And in 1819, they had the very
first of these bubbles burst,

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:12.126
it's called the Panic of
1819 in land speculation.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.267
And this is the first time
that the United States

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.537
had actually experienced any
kind of economic depression.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:22.508
So imagine how frightening
that would have been to them.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.745
One of the hardest things
about market-based capitalism

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:29.715
is that individuals
don't really have control

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.150
over the larger market.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.554
It's not one person that made
the Great Depression happen.

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:37.824
It was an overall loss
in consumer confidence

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.092
or perhaps overproduction, right?

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.796
If too many people are
supplying the same commodity,

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:48.401
the price is dropping through
the laws of supply and demand.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:52.471
So now, the laws of supply
and demand and the pressures

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:55.408
of an international
market are really changing

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.244
the nature of American commerce because

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.246
they're enmeshed in that market.

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:04.784
And that has all kinds of
political and social ramifications

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.986
for the United States.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.356
Understanding the volatility of belonging

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.326
to an international market

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.461
kind of helps explain why Andrew Jackson

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.630
was so obsessed with the National Bank

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.465
at this time period, right?

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:23.636
Because it represents
this confusing matrix

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.805
of international supply and demand

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:29.242
and people getting credit
or not getting credit.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.712
And being part of this
international market

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:36.082
is something that's going
to have a major effect

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:38.317
on the American South, and particularly

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:41.953
the enslaved population that
lives in the American South

00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:44.657
because they're going
to be supplying cotton

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.659
to the world's textile mills.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.661
And those are textile mills in New England

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.930
and textile mills in England.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.166
And as the world demands
cotton for processing,

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:57.069
the South is going to supply that cotton,

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:01.340
which is picked by enslaved individuals.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.511
And one of the reasons that
the Confederacy believes

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:09.282
that it can succeed as
an independent nation

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.218
is because they're
supplying cotton to England.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.254
And when England managed to
find its own supply of cotton

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:20.254
from Egypt and India, the economic chances

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:24.297
of the Confederacy were sunk.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:27.166
And the last thing that I
think is related to this

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.835
Market Revolution is the
Second Great Awakening.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:32.038
Now I don't wanna go into
too much detail about this

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.807
because of a whole
separate series of videos

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.809
about the Second Great Awakening,

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:40.713
but this Second Great Awakening
was kind of an explosion

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:44.583
of religious fervor, which was happening

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:49.583
at almost exactly the same
time as the Market Revolution.

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:54.393
And many American
historians actually think

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.797
that it's these confusing and confounding

00:09:57.797 --> 00:10:00.569
and anxious forces that
lead a lot of people

00:10:00.569 --> 00:10:02.134
to take up religion.

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:05.438
Because as the world is
changing around them,

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:09.075
as people now have to
relate in different ways

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:13.179
to their neighbors as bosses and employees

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.715
rather than bartering partners,

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:20.252
and as they're swept up
in international markets

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.155
that are outside their control,

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:27.509
people look for new explanations

00:10:28.754 --> 00:10:33.335
and comfort in an increasingly

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.507
confusing world.

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.649
So that's one explanation for
the Second Great Awakening.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:44.210
So I started out this series
of videos by saying that

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.080
some historians have argued
that the Market Revolution

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.616
was actually more revolutionary

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.852
than the American Revolution.

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.388
Now that's a difficult question to answer

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:58.758
because we're talking about
a revolution in politics

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:03.295
as opposed to kind of a
revolution of economics.

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.699
But I will say that though
the American Revolution

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:11.203
dissolved the political bonds
between the United States

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:16.203
and Great Britain, its
social and economic impact

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:17.943
were relatively limited.

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:21.580
Most people kind of ended
up in the same place

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.950
socially after the American Revolution

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.752
as they were before it.

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:30.823
But the Market Revolution
changes an awful lot

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:33.259
in American society in terms of

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.962
how they participate internationally

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.865
and how people organize their daily lives.

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:43.769
So I think there is a
strong argument to be made

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:48.374
that this revolution of
economics, technology,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.911
even religion, is
considerably farther reaching

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:54.213
than the American Revolution.
