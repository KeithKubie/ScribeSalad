00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:11.776
&gt;&gt;When we started this process twenty
years ago, what it looked like then

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:12.766
and what the products looked

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.206
like then were very different
than they look like now.

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:19.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These teachers at King
Middle School in Portland, Maine,

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:23.276
are pioneers of expeditionary
learning, a teaching method

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:27.156
that uses project based learning
and real world experience

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:30.286
to engage students and
encourage collaboration.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:32.766
&gt;&gt;And now we're fine
tuning more than we were.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.716
Before, we were sort of
going at it with a hatchet

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.376
and we were hacking stuff to pieces,

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:38.766
'cause we didn't all understand
what was going on and a lot

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.046
of people were resisting the change.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:43.866
But now, I think it's fine tuning
a product to a certain extent.

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:46.776
&gt;&gt;I do know that after
our first expedition,

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:50.746
the thing that we all sat
back and looked at was,

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:55.746
prior to when you had parents'
open house, you would go

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:57.946
and select the best and
put that on the wall,

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:00.306
and you would hide the
others in the drawer.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:04.896
And with the-- our first expedition,
every end product was just unreal.

00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:08.816
From your gifted student
to your special ed student,

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:10.056
every end product was unreal.

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.916
So we bought into it,
and we said okay,

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:16.656
and then developed
the other expeditions.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.946
As long as it was relevant
and we also made sure

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:23.596
that it was curriculum driven,
not just pie in the sky,

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:25.636
but driven by our curriculum.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.536
&gt;&gt;Yeah, and just one
piece that I think is one

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:30.486
of the most challenging things about
expeditionary learning practice is

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:32.656
that when you have seven adults
around a table who are trying

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:36.526
to figure out what they're gonna
make with kids, it's very difficult

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.676
to have a really deep, meaningful
conversation around curriculum

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:40.866
and how that's all gonna fit together

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.836
if you don't actually have the thing
made and can look at it and say,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.816
"For science, I know how I can
contribute to that, or for math,

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.176
I know how I can contribute to that."

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:52.256
And if the thing that you make
doesn't match everybody's needs,

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:55.196
then you can change it so it
does match everybody's needs.

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:58.596
So I'm hoping that our work
around getting exemplars made

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:02.516
in advance will help that whole
dialog around how to connect the kind

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:03.846
of learning that's most important.

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:05.926
Instead of just making
the thing we can make,

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:07.546
we're making the thing we can make

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:09.436
because it makes the
most sense for learning.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.066
&gt;&gt;And the debrief piece is a huge
thing at the end of an expedition.

00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:16.036
The kids give us feedback
and they're the real--

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.686
in my opinion, they're the real
places where we want feedback,

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.126
because they point out
things that we may not get,

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:24.096
or it may not be a direct feedback.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.686
It may be you notice that
none of them get one idea,

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:33.926
or that all of them-- only 30 percent
of them completed this aspect of it,

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.966
or this assignment,
getting ready for it.

00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:40.186
And a lot of times, that's where
you can really see how they struggle

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:41.236
with certain aspects of it.

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:45.886
&gt;&gt;To me, what's challenging in an
expedition is the schedule, is like,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.606
it's just so hard to predict
where the kids are gonna be.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:52.656
And you know, sometimes if they
wanna go off on this, you know,

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:58.456
kinda dig a little deeper, it kinda
throws everything off and it just--

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.236
so having that deadline
is tricky for me.

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:05.276
&gt;&gt;Yeah, I think deadlines,
'cause like we had a snow day.

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:05.426
[laughter]

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:06.216
&gt;&gt;We had the flu.

00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:08.056
&gt;&gt;And it killed us.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:09.646
I mean, that was a work day.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:12.756
We had one expedition where
it was a culminating event,

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:19.286
was a dinner for about 150 people
on a Friday and we had a snow day.

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:19.916
&gt;&gt;Twice, right?

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:20.826
&gt;&gt;Yeah, twice.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:22.506
And we're panicking.

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:25.976
And just to find the space or what
to do with it, but it all works.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:30.396
&gt;&gt;So it all comes down to the
way we approach it as teachers

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:33.396
and how we organize for kids'
learning, using the laptops.

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:39.856
So we've been asking people to look
at putting these learning materials

00:03:39.856 --> 00:03:42.786
and organizing these learning
materials in an index, online,

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.256
so that when we ask kids to go
and do this kind of research,

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:46.926
they're not off in left field.

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.186
And when we tell them
that they're accountable

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:52.866
for finding good information, we
know that information's out there,

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.946
because we're already
organized it and it's there,

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:55.946
so we hold them accountable

00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:57.696
in the same way we've always
held them accountable.

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.986
But we used to do it-- I remember in
the old expeditions, at the beginning

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:02.976
of an expedition, you would
hand out a big journal

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.566
of all the reading
assignments, in a binder.

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:07.526
&gt;&gt;We'd go to the library
and get all the books that--

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.636
&gt;&gt;Every single thing
would be all there.

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:12.956
And now what we're saying is,
that's still the right way to do it,

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:16.626
except we have a huge world
of options open to us,

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.286
and now that means we can
grab so many better pieces.

00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:21.676
But again, it ups the
ant in terms of planning.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:24.546
We have to plan harder and plan
better and we have to make sure

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:27.266
that we have what I call the
developmentally appropriate materials

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:27.976
for all learners.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.486
