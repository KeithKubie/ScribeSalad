00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.050
The Gruesome Tale of Lady Bluebeard

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.450
You probably remember Bluebeard, the title
character in the French folk tale by Charles

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.900
Perrault, which you might have stumbled across
in a fairy tale book or two.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.929
Bluebeard was a man who had been married several
times, but no one knew what had happened to

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.480
his previous wives.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
When he takes on a new wife, she discovers
the murdered bodies of the old wives in a

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.430
small, forbidden room.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.170
It’s the kind of thing you hope will stick
to the storybook pages, but for one Belle

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.060
Gunness “The Lady Bluebeard,” that was
not the case.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.790
Gunness was virtually unknown before she immigrated
to the United States from Norway between 1881

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.230
and 1886.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.800
There is a story that she was beaten by a
man while pregnant at the age of seventeen,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.180
causing a miscarriage and a distinct personality
change.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.200
Supposedly the man died shortly thereafter
with symptoms akin to those of poisoning,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.570
but there’s little documentation to support
this.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.530
Nevertheless, the incident could have been
what spurred her to move to America… or

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.930
it’s possible that she simply moved to be
with her sister, who had emigrated some years

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.930
before.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
Whatever the case, Gunness met the (first)
man of her dreams in Chicago, where they married

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.059
in 1893.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.460
His name was Mads Ditlev Anton Sorenson, and
he didn’t know it yet, but he was going

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.659
to be Gunness’ first known victim.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.250
Together, the seemingly happy couple opened
a confectionery store and had four children

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.200
together—Caroline, Axel, Myrtle, and Lucy.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.280
According to one census report, they also
had a foster child named Jennie living with

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
them.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.790
A year after starting the confectionery store,
business wasn’t so hot.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.100
That is, until the building caught fire and
Gunness and her husband were able to collect

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.890
insurance for the “accident.”

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.870
It’s possible that Gunness actually started
the fire, or that collecting insurance gave

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.680
her the idea to collect more insurance from
other sources.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.180
Over the next few years, two of their children,
Caroline and Axel, died officially from acute

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.180
colitis.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.790
However, many of the symptoms of acute colitis,
such as abdominal pain, are in line with the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.150
symptoms of poisoning.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
It’s possible that a doctor, unwilling to
believe that a mother would poison her own

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.130
children, didn’t look into the two deaths
as well as he should have.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.850
Both Caroline and Axel had life insurance,
and the insurance company lined Gunness’

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580
pockets after her tragic loss.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.340
As for Gunness’ husband Sorenson, he died
in 1900—conveniently on the one day that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.010
his two life insurance policies overlapped.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.660
There are a few different theories about how
he died, but officially it was recorded that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.040
his heart gave out.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.730
The doctor attending him originally thought
he was suffering from strychnine poisoning

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.709
but was later convinced not to look into it;
the death wasn’t considered suspicious by

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.940
most (though Sorenson’s family requested
it be investigated, their demands were never

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.940
met).

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.340
Gunness was paid $8000 dollars (about $217,000
today) in insurance money.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.280
In 1901, Gunness used the money to purchase
a farm in La Porte, Indiana.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.730
Shortly after the purchase, part of the property
burned down and, you guessed it, she collected

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.140
money for it from the insurance companies.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.410
A short while later, Gunness met the (second)
love of her life: Peter Gunness.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.959
Mr. Gunness was a recent widower with two
daughters.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.489
The pair married on April 1, 1902, and the
three Gunnesses moved in to the farm house

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.690
with Mrs. Gunness and her two remaining daughters
from her previous marriage.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.940
Unfortunately, bad things tend to happen to
children when Mrs. Gunness is around, and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.390
the younger of Mr. Gunness’ two daughters
died shortly after the wedding from “unknown

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.300
causes,” though it is known that she passed
while she was in Belle’s sole care.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.590
In December 1902, Mr. Gunness himself met
a terrible fate when a meat chopper fell on

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.290
his head, killing him.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.430
Foster daughter Jennie arrived on the scene
shortly after and saw Mrs. Gunness sobbing

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.940
over his body.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.380
Anyone suspicious yet?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.500
Jennie apparently was.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.450
She was overheard saying, “”My mama killed
my papa.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.670
She hit him with a meat cleaver and he died.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.959
Don’t tell a soul,” which prompted an
investigation into Mr. Gunness’ death.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.640
The coroner was at first convinced that he
had been murdered, but was later persuaded

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.390
by Mrs. Gunness that she hadn’t done anything
wrong.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.720
As she was pregnant at the time, it’s possible
that she used her condition to underline how

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.830
innocent and harmless she was.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.290
Gunness later cashed in on $3000 (about $81,000
today) from Mr. Gunness’ insurance policy.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.390
She gave birth to a son, Phillip, in May 1903,
adding to her brood—Jennie, Lucy, and Myrtle

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.640
remained in the house.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.310
Mr. Gunness’ elder daughter was taken away
by a kindly uncle who likely saved her life

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.140
by getting her out of the house.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.469
Not happy without someone to prey upon, Gunness
put a personal ad in some big city papers.

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.489
It read:
“comely widow who owns a large farm in one

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.749
of the finest districts in La Porte County,
Indiana, desires to make the acquaintance

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.410
of a gentleman equally well provided, with
view of joining fortunes.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.629
No replies by letter considered unless sender
is willing to follow answer with personal

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:33.629
visit.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.229
Triflers need not apply.”

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.689
Many men did answer her ad.

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.680
They came bearing gifts of cash, such as John
Moe who brought $1000 to Gunness to demonstrate

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.689
his wealth, and disappeared shortly thereafter,
never to be heard from again.

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.250
To the people of La Porte, it simply looked
like Gunness had a lot of suitors, and no

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.650
one was entirely surprised.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.879
Even with age and filling out quite a bit,
Gunness was considered a beauty with her blonde

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.669
hair, tall figure, and shining white smile.

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.590
Yet all of those disappearances couldn’t
go unnoticed in her own home.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.349
Jennie, who had already proven something of
a liability after the death of Gunness’

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.569
second husband, suddenly disappeared in 1906.

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.270
Gunness claimed she had been sent to a finishing
school in Los Angeles, but the girl was never

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.619
seen alive again.

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.139
In 1907, Gunness was seen with a man purchasing
an expensive wedding ring in town; he soon

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.139
disappeared.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.339
Later, she won the affections of Andrew Helgelein,
a poor misguided fellow who withdrew all of

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.089
the funds from his bank account before meeting
a similar fate.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.589
However, Gunness was starting to run out of
luck.

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.029
All of her suitors had people who cared about
them, and sooner or later they traced them

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.169
to Gunness.

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.129
Andrew Helgelein’s brother was particularly
interested in his brother’s whereabouts,

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.430
and wrote to Gunness to enquire after him;
she replied that she hadn’t seen him before,

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.819
but Asle Helgelein still decided to travel
to La Porte to investigate.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.139
He arrived too late.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.659
On April 27, 1908, Gunness could be found
writing up her last will and testament, claiming

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.110
that she feared for her life because her ex-handy
man, Ray Lamphere, was deeply in love with

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.669
her and extremely jealous of her suitors.

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.240
That same night, her house burned to the ground.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.189
Inside the house, four bodies were found:
three children, presumed to be Lucy, Myrtle,

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.819
and Phillip, and the decapitated body of a
woman.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.800
Ray Lamphere was arrested for murder and arson,
but there was some speculation about whether

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.009
or not the body of the woman was actually
Gunness; without the head, the dentist couldn’t

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.430
check dental records, and the shape of the
body seemed too small to be Gunness.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.259
That’s when the whole morbid tale began
to unfold.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.499
Items like watches were being found in the
rubble of the Gunness house, and Asle Helgelein

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.349
showed up alleging that Gunness was a “gold
digger” who was murdering men and taking

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.349
their money.

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.289
The sheriff remained unconvinced, so Asle
took it upon himself to ask Joe Maxson, the

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.960
Gunness’ most recent handyman, if Gunness
had a place where she dug holes for things

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.990
like cinders.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.279
The answer was a place near the hog pen—which,
incidentally, had an unusually high fence.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.439
Asle grabbed a shovel and started digging.

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.939
He ended up finding his brother, the most
recent of Gunness’ killings.

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.569
His body had been chopped up and stowed in
flour sacks.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.529
They found several more bodies, one of which
was quite obviously Jennie, who hadn’t gone

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:05.629
to California at all; the theory is that she
got suspicious of the suitors leaving in the

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:08.849
middle of the night and was going to raise
the alarm.

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.219
Around twelve bodies were found near the hog
pen; it could have been more, but with so

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.460
many body parts, it was difficult to tell.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.669
The digging continued, and more and more bodies
were found in the fields.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.030
Most of the bodies were never identified,
but reports flooded in from relatives of missing

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.370
people who believed their loved ones had made
their way to La Porte before meeting their

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.509
untimely demise.

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.999
Lamphere, who was found guilty of arson but
not murder, later admitted to helping Gunness

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:33.219
bury the bodies.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:36.159
He claimed that she had murdered 42 people
all told.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:40.149
She would give her victims a nice meal and
then drug their coffee; after, she would sometimes

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:41.729
smash their heads with a meat chopper.

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.729
Other times, she would simply poison her victims.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:48.370
After dissecting them and chopping them into
pieces, she buried them in the yard or fed

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.309
their remains to her hogs.

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:54.330
As for Gunness, a lot of evidence points to
her escaping the fire that killed her children.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.180
Lamphere claimed he lured a woman to the house
where she was killed and her head was chopped

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.180
off.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.339
Gunness then drugged her children, killed
them, and left them in the house to burn.

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.279
She took off, never to be seen again.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:08.270
Whether or not Lamphere was to be believed,
Gunness’ bank backed his story, saying that

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.639
Gunness had withdrawn nearly all of her money
the day before the fire.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:16.029
That, combined with creating a will shortly
before her supposed death, made people suspect

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.929
that she had intended to fake her own death
and skip town.

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:23.369
However, Gunness’ dentures were found in
May of that year, convincing the dentist and

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.560
some of the townsfolk that she had indeed
died in the fire.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.680
That said, the skull wasn’t recovered.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.289
Many people remained convinced that she was
still at large somewhere, living off the fortune

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.490
she made from her victims.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.719
Her death was never confirmed and she was
never tracked down.

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:53.209
Numerous sightings were made around the Chicago
area, but none of them were confirmed.
