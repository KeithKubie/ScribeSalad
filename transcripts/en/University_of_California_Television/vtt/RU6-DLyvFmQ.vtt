00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.220
(whooshing)

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.160
- This program is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.303
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:13.830
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.710
- Welcome to A Conversation With History.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.750
I'm Harry Kreisler,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.870
of The Institute of International Studies.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.040
Our guest today is senior
judge, J. Clifford Wallace,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.723
of the United States Court of
Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:51.250
He is the recipient, in 2008,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.170
of the University of California
Berkeley School of Law,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.390
Judge D. Lowell and Barbara
Jensen Public Service Award.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.540
Judge Wallace, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.410
- Thank you very much.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.155
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.130
- San Diego, in both instances.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.810
- And looking back, how
did your childhood shape

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.940
your thinking about the
world, do you think?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.023
What did you learn?

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.633
- I learned how to survive, primarily.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:22.130
I grew up in a poor area of San Diego.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.690
My father was an immigrant, and
had a third grade education,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.430
and suffered from alcoholism.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.733
He had difficulty supporting us.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.530
My mother was a high school
dropout, very fine person,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.330
but she had her own series of challenges.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.313
So I don't think there was
much that happened in my home,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.700
nor particularly in school,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.610
and that wasn't the
school's fault, either.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.210
I was just in an area and ran with people

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.130
that didn't put much high
mark on going to school

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.280
or education or otherwise.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.860
As a matter of fact, I went
all the way through high school

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.060
without ever reading a book.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.050
I found you could always get a C or a D

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.070
just by reading the book
cover and saying something,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.239
so I was not an achiever at all.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.100
But someplace along the line,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.060
I got the idea I wanted to be a lawyer,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.430
and never having been a
lawyer, it's rather striking,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.680
but all the time I wanted to be a lawyer,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.950
but it never computed that
you have to do something

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.813
to do that, and three years
in the Navy helped me out.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.200
I qualified to go to a school for a year

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.270
under the Secretary of
Navy's Annapolis program,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.010
and getting ready to take the exam,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.130
so while other people were brushing up,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.800
I was learning for the first time.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.610
At the end of that year, I'd
done all my high school work

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.510
that I didn't do earlier,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.310
and although I'd received an appointment

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.710
to go to the Naval Academy,
I decided against it,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.390
because I decided that it was better off

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.007
if I went, continued my
process of going towards law,

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:02.488
and I did.

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:04.050
I came back and I went to
San Diego State University,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.250
and ended up at Berkeley.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.130
- In the law program.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.310
So it's a fascinating
story, and I'm curious,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.800
are there any influences

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.220
that shaped your character
that you can look back now,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.627
see, I mean, clearly,
from what you just said,

00:03:22.627 --> 00:03:25.713
you had intelligence going for you.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.650
What else?

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.200
- Well, I wasn't aware of that.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.210
I think I came to grips,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.130
I came to grips with,
that I'm an individual,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.951
that I have a purpose,
I have responsibility,

00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:43.847
and that there's a certain
vision of life that I got,

00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:47.430
and it was primarily finding a religion

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.280
with which I was compatible,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.620
and got me to start
thinking in those lens,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.900
so I give a lot of credit
to that, in shaping my view,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.720
and in shaping my service,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.764
the idea of being of
service to other people

00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:02.140
came a lot out of that experience.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.391
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:08.391
I think our audience would
be interested to know

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.610
what do you think are the
skills required to be a lawyer?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.400
- Well, essentially,
you have to really care

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430
about what you're doing
and not just how much money

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.730
you're taking to the bank.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.870
It's a service organization.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.610
We're doing something
for people they can't do.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.650
It's hard work.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.970
You have to be willing to put in the time,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.710
whether you get paid for it or not.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.760
There has to be a
feeling of accomplishment

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.330
of being of help to people,
and then secondarily is,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.840
of course, taking care of your family,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.143
and that's helpful, that's important, too.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:49.810
It's problem solving,
and to the extent people

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.160
can learn how to solve
problems, it's helpful.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.810
For example, they did a study
on what undergraduate courses

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.027
help the most to be a lawyer,

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:01.420
and I always thought it
was economics and poli sci,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.263
and so I went through that,
but it turns out to be math.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.070
So I think those skills are necessary,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.590
but a person has to be
dedicated to a goal.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.590
I think that helps a lot in
making success of the law,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.325
and making it fulfilling for your life.

00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:20.158
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:24.800
Now what about history and a
sense of the broader society?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.590
I mean, for students, would
the taking of history,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.520
to understand, for example,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.690
the history of the Constitution,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.890
of the nature of our
political system, and so on?

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.030
- Oh, I think that's a fair statement,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.710
that looking at the
Constitution and the framers,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.300
and understanding better what
they were trying to accomplish

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.370
gives you a better feeling,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.720
a setting of what the law's all about,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.720
and certainly, later on,
as your view broadens,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.380
there's a lot of catch up that takes place

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.750
of things that you didn't study,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.630
because you didn't think
they were that important,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.460
and now they've become rather critical

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.335
in what you're trying to accomplish.

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:09.168
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:13.803
And you mentioned that your
religion was important to you.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.090
Is that the source of
notions of equity and justice

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.090
or is it philosophy that
you have to turn to,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.140
as you're weighing the pros
and cons of the arguments

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.670
in a particular case?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.430
- Well, it'll impact
on all of those things,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.730
but for my purpose, it was
just becoming sensitive

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.380
that I'm supposed to be doing something,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.960
that I should be doing
something with my life,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.210
that I can be of help,
that I can be creative,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.468
that I can show some leadership,

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:51.960
and that I would be
disappointed in me after that

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.970
if I didn't do the work
necessary to accomplish that.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.223
- But what about, as you
look at a particular case,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.290
does your religion help you
find that notion of justice

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.210
and equity as you weigh
both sides of the argument,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.210
or is it really just the
logic and the precedents

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.700
that you have before you,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.400
and the particular facts of the case?

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.260
- I'm sure that it has
some indirect values,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.230
but one of the things that you learn to do

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.439
is you must be guided by the law,

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.240
and it's the Constitution,
the statutes of the Congress

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.680
that we must apply,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.680
not shaping them to our
view of what society

00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:40.140
or whatever should be.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.790
So in that regard, one has to be careful.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.382
Someone asked me one time,

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:46.410
if you had to decide a case,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.830
and it was against the
tenets of your church,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.720
but consistent with the Constitution,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.913
what would you do?

00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:53.780
Well, that was an easy answer for me.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.610
You'd follow the Constitution.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.210
That's where I've taken my oath.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.940
If I can't do that, I should step down.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.460
So it has an indirect influence on you

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.220
to the extent it teaches

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.140
that we should be looking
outside ourselves,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.260
to be of help, things like that.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.707
But our main goal is to
apply the Constitution

00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:17.270
and the statutes, and we can't allow

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.894
anything outside of that, no
matter how virtuous they are

00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:22.270
to be an influence.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.673
That's what people expect of
us, or should expect of us.

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:29.130
- I guess as a judge and as an attorney,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.600
you really have to have a
command of the English language.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.440
You need to know how to write well,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.800
and write clearly so
people will understand

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.750
what you're saying.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.230
Talk a little about that,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.840
and where did you get this
sense of the importance of words

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.130
and of writing, at law school?

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.950
- I think as an undergraduate.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.960
I think as I was going through
San Diego State University,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.270
I became aware of that,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.260
and became very fascinated with the idea

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.140
of developing ideas and
being able to carry,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.993
to develop them crisply
and yet, carry meaning,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.190
and I became impressed with the idea

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:13.990
that it is not my goal to
write to be understood.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.400
It's to write so that I'll
never be misunderstood,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.540
and that takes a lot of writing,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.500
and I became very aware,
there are not good writers.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.180
There are good editors,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.740
and one has to be able to
constantly relook at their work

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.160
to make it more effective
and that takes time.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.226
That takes time, but with
skills that you pick up,

00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:39.440
it isn't insurmountable,
but it is time consuming.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.310
- After you graduated from law school,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.400
you practiced law in San Diego,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.780
and talk a little about that.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.110
In other words, what was that
learning experience like?

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.440
What kind of cases did
you handle and so on,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.142
and how long did you do it?

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:55.521
- It was an exciting part of my life.

00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:57.250
I was very fortunate.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.803
The major firm in San Diego selected me,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.140
I think a lot because I went to Berkeley,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.900
and they've had good experience
with Berkeley graduates,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.330
but those firms were
very small in those days,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.200
and I wanted to be a trial lawyer,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.827
and they gave me that opportunity,

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:18.620
so I was primarily a civil
trial lawyer for 15 years

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.081
before I went on the bench,

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:22.780
and I didn't leave the practice of law

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.253
because I didn't like it.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.580
There's a lot of things I miss
about the practice of law,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.240
but I enjoyed it, it brought
out the better things in me.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.220
It required me to do far more

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.503
than I thought I was capable of,

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:41.460
and that was a very
good experience for me.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.913
Going into trial, representing people,

00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:49.170
it's a fascinating thing that you do.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.400
You're doing something they
can't do for themselves,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.370
and you wanna do it well,

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.881
and it was, I enjoyed that
part of the law very much.

00:10:57.881 --> 00:11:01.010
- And were you involved on
the side in politics at all?

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.500
Or did you just practice the law?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.610
- I just practiced law.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.840
There were a few things helping out,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.072
doing a few things, committee,

00:11:10.072 --> 00:11:14.603
but between raising a family,
which was my first priority,

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:19.060
and my religious involvement
and practicing law,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.480
there wasn't much time left,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.100
and I never played golf or went fishing.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.373
It was 24 hours a day,

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.730
but that was good for me.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.720
That was good for me, too.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.610
It learned, it taught me a discipline,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.880
that I got more out of life,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.230
but I learned most of that at Berkeley,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.430
where I never went to
the drinking fountain

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.700
and sat and talked to people.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.960
I went down and got into the books again.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.580
Discipline was something
I learned in law school.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.992
- Mm-hmm.

00:11:46.992 --> 00:11:49.800
And hard work, I guess?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.565
- Indeed, indeed.

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:56.565
- And is there any one experience

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.340
when you were a practicing attorney

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.700
that something clicked in your mind,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.360
that it's kind of enhanced
your ability as a judge,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.620
some recollection, or was
it just the whole body

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.570
of the experience?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.379
- I think it was the whole experience.

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:12.720
I had, in the back of my mind, someday,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.200
I might wanna go on the bench,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.568
but I had turned it down several times

00:12:16.568 --> 00:12:18.653
to go on the state bench.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.059
The federal bench is, it's
a different type of work,

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.560
much more consistent
with what I wanted to do.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.960
I actually went on a little earlier

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.290
than I would've preferred.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.239
I was 41 when I went
on the district court.

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:35.560
- And that would be what year?

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.053
- 1970.
- Okay.

00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:43.110
- And I was just in a partnership

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.499
where I was beginning to make some money,

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:47.636
after struggling along,

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:52.636
and it was a time that was not
the most convenient for me,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.461
but a partner from another
law firm came to me and said,

00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:01.409
this opportunity's here; we'd
like to have you take it,

00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:06.000
and we gave it serious
consideration, decided to do it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.840
- And you were appointed
to the district court

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.060
by President Nixon and where
we you based, in San Diego?

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.893
- I was.

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.720
I was in the Southern
District of California,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.757
and the courthouse there
is in downtown San Diego.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.410
Then two years later,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.510
one of my colleagues
on the court of appeals

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.250
was going senior, and he
wanted me to take his place

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.680
and I got another telephone call,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.010
whether I'd be willing to
go on the court of appeals,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.600
so I did, in 1972.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.020
- And that, you were also
appointed by President Nixon,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.893
to that, yeah.

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:43.515
And how do these, conceptually,
these courts differ?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.048
In other words, as a district judge,

00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:52.590
you are lower in the
hierarchy of the court system,

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.933
the federal court system.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.240
What is the breadth of the kind of cases

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.570
that come before you,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.370
and are they closer to real human beings

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.083
in their conflicts and
so on in that sense?

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.602
- Yes, they certainly are.

00:14:11.602 --> 00:14:15.710
Anything that's a federal crime
or a federal civil matter,

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.410
anything of federal
jurisdiction came before us,

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.920
and of course, we're next to the border,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.820
so we had a lot of crime,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.990
and I had never even tried
a criminal case before then,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.360
so that was a new area.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.050
There wasn't much of a change
of going from being a lawyer

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.723
to being a trial judge.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.960
I pretty well, I developed
that fairly easy,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.580
and the criminal law's not difficult.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.940
The civil law is more difficult,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.640
and I had been working with civil law.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.354
So I didn't find it a big transition.

00:14:45.354 --> 00:14:49.674
It was nice, and I enjoyed doing that,

00:14:49.674 --> 00:14:52.200
but the thing that struck me

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.670
about going to the court of appeals

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.820
was I could change my primary skill.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.293
My primary skill was oral
when I was a trial lawyer,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.890
as a trial judge.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.777
Now at the court of appeals,
it would be written skills,

00:15:04.777 --> 00:15:09.250
and I just thought that'd
be an interesting challenge

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.740
to see the broader picture of establishing

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.740
the fabric of the law would
be something I would enjoy,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.573
and it turned out, I did.

00:15:20.573 --> 00:15:25.573
- And talk a little about the
dynamics on an appeal court.

00:15:27.012 --> 00:15:29.050
Now, let me ask this first.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.130
Tell us, you are on the 9th circuit.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.700
Where is the 9th circuit?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.070
Where do the cases come
from that you deal with?

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.530
- The 9th circuit is
the nine western states,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.230
and the islands of the Pacific.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.430
It's the largest circuit
in the United States,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.560
has about 55, 60 million
people within the circuit.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.960
The cases come from the
district court, the trial court,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.640
and also from the
agencies, federal agencies.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.300
They also have an access to our court.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.373
So that's where our jurisdiction is.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.860
It's a very dynamic area.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.060
We have more diversity
than any other circuit.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.685
Unfortunately, we have more cases, too,

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:10.503
and that creates some problems,

00:16:13.748 --> 00:16:16.910
but it's very meaningful,
the types of cases,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.363
the types of issues.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.358
I've never been bored.

00:16:21.358 --> 00:16:24.461
- Mm-hmm, and you mentioned the diversity

00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:28.230
within the courts covered by,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.970
and we're gonna talk
about this a little later,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.260
about the work you've done
in trying to bring diversity

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.570
to the court system, but talk a little

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.570
about how your sensitivity to
issues of diversity emerged.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.340
Was it through the nature

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.130
of the cases that you were getting,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.700
was it the political dynamic
in the country and so on?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.443
- The political dynamic
never entered at all.

00:16:55.584 --> 00:16:59.930
I was never asked once how I'd
vote on a particular issue.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.720
In those early days, they
had some way of finding you,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.090
but it was largely the
people who had achieved

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.160
within the profession and were willing

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.112
to take the necessary sacrifice in salary

00:17:14.112 --> 00:17:17.060
in order to go on the bench.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.580
So that wasn't the issue.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.910
What really took place
was all of a sudden,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.470
instead of finding the law to apply it,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.150
I was going to apply the law,

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.100
and I found that there were a lot of areas

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.140
where it wasn't clear,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.490
and what you were trying to do was decide

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.900
what that law should be.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.570
Now some feel that the court

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.294
should be a social instrument for change.

00:17:43.294 --> 00:17:45.310
I never believed that.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.130
I believe too much in democracy.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.170
The people don't always get it right,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.730
but there's a dynamic

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.330
to letting people make those decisions.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.170
So I have been in the group of judges,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.335
which they call judicial restraint judges.

00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:02.940
That's neither conservative nor liberal.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.626
It's just how you approach your task,

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:09.816
and as I worked longer and longer within,

00:18:09.816 --> 00:18:11.960
being an appellate judge,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.640
this became more and
more significant to me

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.380
on how I approach
problems that come to us,

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.620
and all my brothers and
sisters on the court

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.740
don't feel the same way I do.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.320
Some of them feel the
other way, and that's okay.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.278
I just don't think it's the way

00:18:29.278 --> 00:18:32.500
that we were supposed to be, as judges.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.760
So there's still a great disagreement

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.530
across the United States among judges,

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.423
and among law professors and other,

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:40.580
what is the real role of a judge?

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.580
Is a judge someone, when
they don't get it right,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.147
through the democratic process, we fix it?

00:18:46.147 --> 00:18:49.920
Or do we require the democratic
process to move forward

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.580
and get the job done,

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.900
and we just make the
application of the law itself?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.640
It's a very interesting question.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.570
- And I wanna explore
this, but as part of a,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.450
to give a fuller sense
of what a judge does.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.750
As I listen to you, you
reminder of the philosophers

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.250
who I've had on this program,

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.260
in the sense a philosopher will tell me,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.120
well, what we try to do is
bring order to the chaos

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.480
of a particular phenomena,
and it sounds to me,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.390
is it fair to say that
you're saying, in a way,

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.130
that there are areas
where the law is not clear

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.160
about what should be done,
but this, in your view,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.830
is not about making political decisions,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.830
but rather, coming up with
rules that will sort out

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.870
a particular area and
offer greater definition

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.920
of where one can go
and where one can't go?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.123
That's maybe superficial, but is that,

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:54.970
can we help our audience understand

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.030
what it is you're sorting
out as you decide a case

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.580
at the appellate level?

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.090
- Well, as an example, the
Congress isn't always as careful

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.800
as they oughta be with their legislation.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.640
I understand that.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.510
They have to go through compromises,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.200
and they have much work to do,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.051
but it leaves certain
gaps as to what is meant,

00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:17.040
and then they come to court,

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.130
because there's a dispute,
and we have to make a decision

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.750
what is the law going to be,
what is the rule going to be,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.440
and then it depends on how
you go about doing that?

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.470
Do you look at some view that you have

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.280
of the way society should
be, or do you look,

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.250
and try and find out what it
is the legislature had in mind?

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.920
And then, whether you agree

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.457
with what the legislature did or not,

00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:41.810
that's not the issue.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.020
The issue is does that rule,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.140
is it consistent with
what they were trying,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.840
the elected representatives,
were trying to do?

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.530
And to that extent, you're
developing less chaos,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.440
because you're establishing rules.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.170
They may not be rules that you like,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.640
they may not be rules that Congress likes,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.500
but they can always amend their statutes,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.860
so that's not a a problem.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.950
If you get it wrong, they
have the great erasure,

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.510
and they can take care of it.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.130
But that's, I think there's a lot to that,

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.560
to the extent we're able to define

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.930
what they have made unclear,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.700
there's less chaos in the world.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.380
- Now, you know, of course,
the Berkeley tradition,

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.130
which you know is activism
and social change and so on,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.390
but you're suggesting that
you fall in the category

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.060
of judges who wanna
defer to the legislature,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.530
and what are the rules
about drawing that line?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.890
I mean, are there criteria in your mind

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.650
that help you navigate this area

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.600
where you're trying to clarify
the rules on the one hand,

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.680
but I think what you're saying

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.791
is you don't wanna make
the rules of the law,

00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:57.040
you wanna defer to the legislature.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.930
- Yes.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.210
I think there's times when you can't tell

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.960
whether a person believes
in judicial restraint

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.300
or judicial activism, but certainly,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.103
the approach is different
and the idea behind

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.628
what I like to call judicial restraint

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:20.140
is that it gives the greatest opportunity

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.060
for democracy to work.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.120
Now it's slower, I understand that,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.790
and people get concerned.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.280
They wanna do an end run
around the democratic process

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.010
to get to the courts,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.950
but the Constitution wasn't
made to solve all problems.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.660
It's very small, and the
idea behind the Constitution

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.060
was restrict the national government,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.630
and those rules were ones that would allow

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.830
this great democratic force to start,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.640
not only through the states,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.420
but the national government, as well.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.250
So I don't see this as,
judicial restraint as one

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.410
in which your foot is on the brake pedal.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.010
On the contrary, I think what it does

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.010
is excite the democratic process,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.130
to get people to get out and get involved.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.010
Now we haven't done very
well in that, as a country.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.969
I mean, look at how many
people come out to vote.

00:23:09.969 --> 00:23:14.410
We say we're a democracy,
but we haven't been able

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.690
to catch the view that it really matters

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.860
that one vote, and I think
it's best for the United States

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.180
to move in that direction.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.880
I just believe, well, it's
like Winston Churchill said,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.800
that democracy is
absolutely the worst type

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.750
of government there is,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.450
except for all others have been tried.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.360
It's not perfect, but I think
it's best for the people.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.370
So my philosophy, my judicial
philosophy is consistent

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.130
with that approach.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:49.130
- Now over the years that
you have been a lawyer,

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.270
a judge, at the district level,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.270
and then at the circuit
court level, the judiciary,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.260
in a way, has become a kind of a football,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.490
a political football,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.620
and there have been a lot of complaints

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.670
about politicization,

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.793
some of them more than
complaints and so on.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.390
Talk about this era that you've
lived through as a judge,

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.200
and what are the factors
that helped the system

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.970
write itself, restore the balance?

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.103
Is it the fact that parties are in power

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.210
at different times,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.600
and it's about the
election of our leaders,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.203
who then write the balance
on particular issues?

00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:41.880
- There's been a substantial change

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.360
in the way federal
judges are selected now.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.030
When I went on the bench in the 70s,

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.500
of course, the President
was gonna pick people

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.350
from his own party, most of the time.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.912
Richard Nixon didn't.

00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:58.450
He picked Democrats as
well as Republicans,

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.090
but most of them would
pick from their own party.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:07.090
The question is, do you want
somebody who is going to be,

00:25:07.314 --> 00:25:10.660
have the views of society that you have,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.880
or are you looking for a good lawyer?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.520
Now in the early days, they
looked for the good lawyer.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.130
What was most important
was the ABA going out,

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.510
and making sure you're a
good lawyer, and of course,

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.158
the FBI to make sure you
weren't a crook someplace,

00:25:24.158 --> 00:25:28.550
but that, well, there was no
question asked of me of that.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.420
I didn't fill out any forms,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.330
and when I went back to the Congress,

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.630
no one asked me how I
would vote on abortion,

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.370
or how I'd vote on this or that.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.117
That was not part of the process.

00:25:39.117 --> 00:25:42.879
Now over a period of time, that changed,

00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:47.390
where presidents felt that
they wanted to get people

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.320
that had their view of society,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.920
and so they would be these litmus tests,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.001
and things like that,

00:25:54.001 --> 00:25:57.560
and so it became very politicized

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.900
because they wanted that kind of a judge,

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.630
and then those judges
would come out and say,

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.090
I've got a mission to change,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.170
and it skewed the whole
process, in my view.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.730
Now that's true of Republicans,
it's true of Democrats.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.880
It turned into a process in
which they not only politicized

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.220
but they looked at the
jury, at the judiciary,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.800
as a way of achieving a
certain goal politically,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.540
sociologically, as they saw it,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.410
and I think that's been very unfortunate.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.210
I think that's it's damaged our judiciary,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.840
and I think it's caused the
judiciary to look at itself

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.530
in a different way, and I think
a way that is not consistent

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.540
with what the founders had in mind,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.190
nor what's best for America.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.810
- So your ideal, it sounds like,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.540
and I think you're arguing

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.490
that this was really the tradition

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.490
until the more recent times
was a kind of insulation

00:26:53.313 --> 00:26:58.250
of the judiciary from a political process,

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:03.250
which then empowers it to do
this sorting out of the rules

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.840
based on the law that's been created

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.230
by the democratic process.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.453
- Yeah, yes.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.453
- Interesting.

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:17.913
So how, then do you sort of
navigate the system back?

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.751
Let's assume that we want,

00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.630
the audience wanted to buy
into what you're saying,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.380
the way the judiciary was in the past.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.380
How does one best achieve that
return to the kind of vision

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.590
that you had, and that really
was the way the courts worked

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.261
in earlier period?

00:27:41.261 --> 00:27:44.970
- Well, I think it's gonna
take an educational process.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.890
I just don't, I mean, if you
talk to the average person,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.804
what they want the court to do
is make a decision they like,

00:27:51.804 --> 00:27:55.990
not one that's consistent
with some other goals,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.380
and to get the view of what a judiciary,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.320
what will be the best type
of judiciary for the future,

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.840
it's gonna require an educational process.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.080
Now whether that's gonna
take place in high school

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.770
and college or whether it's
gonna place through the media,

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.319
I have no way of knowing,

00:28:13.319 --> 00:28:15.768
but it will take a change of view.

00:28:15.768 --> 00:28:19.100
Politicians react to majorities.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.570
If the political feels this isn't the way

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.310
they want judges selected,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.150
there's less likelihood they're
gonna go that direction,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.360
and that's right.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.070
That's the way it should be,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.610
so until the people become interested

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.760
in making those kinds of modifications,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.890
I don't see much happening.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.182
Now and then, there'll
be a convert to my view.

00:28:40.182 --> 00:28:44.830
I remember when I made my
first determination on this,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.681
that I was gonna come
out and talk about it,

00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:50.100
I gave a lecture at George
Washington University

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.240
called The Jurisprudence
of Judicial Restraint:

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.670
A Return to the Moorings,

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.820
and that was how I felt about it.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.020
We were returning to something
that we should get to,

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.290
and I would like to see
more people involved.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.100
- Now as part of this education process,

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:12.720
it would seem that the
people, the activists,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.240
the community that wants change now,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.160
and doesn't wanna wait,
and I think this is true,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.090
one could say, of both
the right and the left.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.390
- Oh, there's no question.

00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:30.877
- So what is the handle for
making those constituencies

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.400
understand the costs of
what they're proposing?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.110
Because they may win today,
I think you're saying,

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.910
if the courts get politicized,

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.250
but then the pendulum
will swing the other way,

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.130
and then everybody says, well,
we can't trust the judges,

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.620
because they've been politicized.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.910
- Yeah.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.210
I think it's just a question

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.750
of seeing what they're asking for.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.460
For example, they're saying, I
believe in judicial activism,

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.400
but only if it's activists
in my point of view,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.550
and for example, suppose all nine members

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.500
of the Supreme Court,
this will never happen,

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.850
suppose all nine members
of the Supreme Court

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.100
belonged to the Ku Klux Klan,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.690
would you want that
court to be activistic?

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.530
Well, the answer is no,
you wouldn't want them.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:20.930
Well, that means that it's a
result oriented philosophy.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.400
Judicial activism is result oriented,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.470
and there are conservative
judicial activists,

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.498
and there are liberal judicial activists.

00:30:28.498 --> 00:30:32.380
So if people can understand that,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.550
that they may want activists,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.160
but they want them if
they'll go the direction

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.980
and maybe they won't have them,

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.563
then they may think about
is there a better way?

00:30:42.494 --> 00:30:44.380
In the grand scheme of things,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.970
what's the best way for us

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.020
to have governance in our country?

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.110
And maybe when we ask those questions,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.001
we'll come out with a different answer.

00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:56.330
- You were the chief judge
for a number of years, right?

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.163
- Five years.

00:30:57.163 --> 00:30:58.770
- Five years, from what year to what year?

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.497
- '91 to '96.

00:31:00.497 --> 00:31:02.301
- And in that capacity,

00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:06.050
you were also an
administrator of the court,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.010
the chief administrator.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.193
What is involved in those tasks?

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.180
- The administration is
what makes the machine work,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.670
and most judges don't care
much for administration.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.400
They like to be on the bench.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.720
In the early '70s,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.890
I got interested in
judicial administration.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.660
I started studying it, writing it,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.900
and even taught courses in
judicial administration,

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.298
so by the time I became chief
judge of the largest circuit,

00:31:30.298 --> 00:31:33.790
I had a tremendously interesting challenge

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.116
and we made a lot of
progress, in my judgment.

00:31:38.116 --> 00:31:40.260
You continue to be a judge,

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.360
you continue to sit on cases,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.460
but you get to deal with

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.500
how can you make the process better?

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.220
That is, how can you get
the cases through quicker?

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.730
How can you provide the necessary things

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.470
to make us more efficient, more effective?

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.233
It's a little like going into a business.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.860
You sort of look at what your stock is

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.513
and how you can best get it out.

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:08.070
Now we get chief judges
by staying the longer,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.520
so it's a little, sometimes
like getting a good teacher

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.120
and making him a principal, and they fail.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.440
There's no test you take
to be a chief judge.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.750
Some like it better than others.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.760
But it is an exciting time,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.930
and we did some interesting
things that I really enjoyed.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:29.040
- And what does it take
to reform the courts

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.230
in the capacity that you have?

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.980
Can you give an example of
something that you want done

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.650
and you were able to do it?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:41.650
Is it just by virtue of
the power of your role,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.500
or is it by virtue of
your ability to persuade

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.780
your colleagues or the
courts under you to follow?

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.150
- I wish it were by the power.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.600
It would've been much easier.

00:32:52.564 --> 00:32:56.400
When you're a chief judge, it's
a little like herding cats.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.350
Keeping them together in
one group is very difficult,

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.420
and you have to have a critical
mass of the court in favor,

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.450
so it is talking to people,
getting people convinced,

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.150
and that means it's slower.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.710
There's none of them you can fire.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.880
You're not running General Motors,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.540
so you deal with what you've got,

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.880
and you try and move towards the process.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.410
Now it wasn't very often
than I had 100% unanimity

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.590
of these views, because it required judges

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.900
to change what they're doing,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.737
and judges are very conservative,

00:33:27.737 --> 00:33:31.614
most conservative people,
maybe lawyers, too.

00:33:31.614 --> 00:33:34.200
Once they do something,
they wanna continue

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.453
the way they're doing it,

00:33:35.453 --> 00:33:39.460
and they keep saying, if it
ain't broke, don't fix it,

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.010
and I would say, is there a better way?

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.477
And the two philosophies
have a tendency to collide,

00:33:45.477 --> 00:33:49.500
but I think as we
continued to work together

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.240
on these issues, we did
some remarkable things

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.320
during those five years.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.500
I'm very pleased with what
my colleagues on the court

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.070
allowed us to do.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:03.070
- Now one of the issues in
your role as a court leader,

00:34:03.147 --> 00:34:07.470
both on the 9th circuit
and in the judicial system,

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.620
and your role as an administrator,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.510
you've actually been
involved in bringing issues

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.400
to the table, I think as
part of the organization,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.479
and so you've been very active
in bringing greater diversity

00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:26.479
to the courts system, I
assume in terms of judges

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.790
and personnel, and the way the courts act,

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.713
and then talk a little about that,

00:34:34.617 --> 00:34:38.200
and what was the obstacle there,

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:43.200
the sense that the country wasn't prepared

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.400
for the challenge of diversity,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.970
I'm not talking about
places like the Bay Area

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.280
or California and so on.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.258
- No, we had that same process.

00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:56.248
I think the one thing
that we had to make clear,

00:34:56.248 --> 00:34:59.180
that we hire people and they're retained

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.154
for their abilities, not
for their own social views

00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:06.910
or their own particular ways of living,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:11.910
so long as they create
an example on the court

00:35:12.549 --> 00:35:15.947
that gives what the
judiciary example should be,

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:19.760
and we did, I think a
very good job with that.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.550
We have a very large clerk's office,

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.820
and if you walked in there
and talked to people,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.923
you would see a very diverse group.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:31.550
The more difficult process
was trying to figure out

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.160
what do we owe to the people as far

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.510
as the courts are concerned,

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.370
the judges are concerned,
the system itself?

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.683
And just before I came on,
we had started this effort

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.991
to find out whether or not
there's gender fairness

00:35:46.991 --> 00:35:49.265
and that was just coming to an end,

00:35:49.265 --> 00:35:52.270
and we were very successful in that,

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.540
and so my role was taking
the second step of race,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.120
religion and ethnicity,
and we had a taskforce

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.360
that we put together, and I
had to talk to a lot of judges

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.750
to make sure that I wasn't
gonna get a lot of opposition,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.880
and let them know why
I'm doing what I'm doing,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.808
and we got David Levi, who
is now Dean of the Law School

00:36:13.808 --> 00:36:18.808
at Duke, he was a judge, his
father was Attorney General,

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.520
very bright guy, and he agreed
to chair that taskforce,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.350
and it was very successful.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.910
But those are the kinds of issues,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.870
to see if there are headwinds
within the court system.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.060
We can't solve everything in the world,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.861
but we can make sure our court system

00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:39.770
is as pure as it can be, and
that was a good experience.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.190
I enjoyed that.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:46.190
- And were there any
particular obstacles to this?

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.280
In other words, I guess, in a way,

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.060
what we're saying is that when
the country faces a challenge

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.253
that the court system is
a microcosm within that,

00:36:55.253 --> 00:36:57.260
when we're talking about reforming itself,

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.590
and with the right
leadership, it can adapt.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.080
- Yes, and we just have to make sure,

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.400
and very often, we're
doing things inadvertently.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.090
For example, a judge says, Mr. Smith,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.890
what's your position on this?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.730
Mary, what's your position?

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.360
Now, he doesn't mean to
push the gender button,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.430
but it's just people got
used to doing those things,

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.340
and what we had to do was
call it to their attention

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.994
so they just give thought to it,

00:37:22.994 --> 00:37:27.570
and judges are fine people, but they, too,

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.370
have to be reminded that
they are setting an example

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.830
for the judiciary, and if inadvertently,

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.580
they do something, it reflects
on all of the judiciary.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.330
- Now I know one of
your great achievements

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.410
in public service has been the work

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:47.810
with court systems abroad,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.450
and I think that you were
involved in this process,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.383
an active leader with
Chief Justice Burger,

00:37:55.383 --> 00:37:59.430
for establishing the
American Inns of Court.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.387
Explain what that was, and what
you were trying to achieve.

00:38:03.387 --> 00:38:07.030
- Chief Justice Burger believed in change,

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:12.030
and he was leading a team in
an Anglo-American exchange.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.020
He invited me to the team.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.290
Lord Diplock had the English side,

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.380
and we were looking at procedure.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.000
The result of that was that we visited

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.134
the English Inns of Court.

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.760
Chief Justice Burger and
I were sitting in the bus,

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.457
waiting for the rest of the
group to come one morning,

00:38:28.457 --> 00:38:32.300
and I pointed out to him that
I thought that the English

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.370
had a very good idea of
how they trained lawyers,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.230
and I thought we could
maybe adapt that principle

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.940
to what we have in the United States,

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.000
so Chief Justice Burger
said he liked my idea,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.780
he said, why don't you go ahead and see

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.230
what you can find out about it,

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.510
so I started talking with a lot of people,

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.870
spent a lot of time, developed a process,

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.708
and then developed the first pilot program

00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:57.890
for the American Inns of Court,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.890
and now there are 26,000
people in the United States,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.792
judges and lawyers who are
involved in this process

00:39:05.792 --> 00:39:10.310
of trying to make lawyers
learn the importance

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.240
of how they function in court:

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.690
civility, professionalism, preparation.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.210
It used to be that you
learned from the person

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.430
who you carried the bag
for, in the big firm.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.640
They don't have that experience anymore.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.600
- Are you talking about
the lawyers abroad?

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.433
- No, here.

00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:29.180
- Here, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.656
And so this was to take the place of that,

00:39:31.656 --> 00:39:34.369
and it's been very well-received.

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:37.611
We now have our first Inn overseas.

00:39:37.611 --> 00:39:40.790
I work with a conference
of Chief Justice of Asia

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.620
in the Pacific, 34 chief justices

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.027
representing two thirds of
the population of the world.

00:39:48.027 --> 00:39:52.210
We are going to have a presentation
on Inn of Court process

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.160
for them this coming November,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.190
when we meet in Ho Chi Minh City,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.720
and we hope, now that this example

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.480
that we've been able to show as successful

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.485
in the United States can be exported.

00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:03.318
- Mm-hmm.

00:40:03.318 --> 00:40:05.072
- Lawyers need it everywhere.

00:40:05.072 --> 00:40:10.072
- And what is it about the process,

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.560
first at home, is it having courses

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.890
or people coming, lawyers coming,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:20.890
or judges coming as observers
to leaders in the field?

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.230
- It's actually like an inn.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.090
There will be so many senior people

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.000
made up of lawyers and judges,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.820
so many in medium and
some that are very new.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.460
They meet together and
discuss these processes.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.700
They have pupillages,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.630
they have small groups and large groups

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.360
and then, the younger people
and the medium people,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.140
they phase out, and they
bring more people in.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.690
So it's not trying to lecture hundreds.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.100
It's just changing a few
people so that good examples

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.680
go into court, and that's
the theme behind it,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.830
and that's what's working pretty well.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.860
- What is your idea
about how this could help

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.339
spread the rule of law abroad?

00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:03.690
Because listening to you,

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:08.690
I think you have a respect
for the process of democracy,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.370
and it would seem that
the process of democracy

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.928
in different parts of the world

00:41:14.928 --> 00:41:18.070
are gonna reflect national culture,

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.320
political history, and so on,

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.320
and so the question becomes,
are there particular problems

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.874
with teaching the American example,

00:41:29.874 --> 00:41:34.874
with regard to law in
different national settings?

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.840
Obviously, that's a better way to go

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.112
than to try to do this through
military force, in my view.

00:41:42.112 --> 00:41:45.973
Talk a little about what the
challenges might be there.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.570
- I've now worked directly
in over 60 countries

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.310
throughout the world, on every continent,

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.050
where I've spent actual
time with the judiciaries,

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.740
and through international meetings,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.183
I've probably interacted
with over a hundred.

00:42:00.556 --> 00:42:03.680
I don't try to sell the American model.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.690
The American model is
wonderful for America,

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.230
but it very often is not relevant

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.760
to those individual countries.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.500
I may see something in
Indonesia that I think

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.016
is far more important, or
I was in, two weeks ago,

00:42:18.016 --> 00:42:22.810
I was in Vietnam, and they were
trying to develop a program

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.650
and I remembered a program
I worked on in Nigeria

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.590
that had a better model,
and so that's the model

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.773
that I recommended.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.580
So the idea is to try and
work with these court systems,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.350
to make them more effective,

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.170
but based upon their
religious, their culture

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.311
and their local legal culture,

00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:46.500
and what fits best with
them, and very often,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.500
what we have won't, then,
developing their judiciary,

00:42:51.632 --> 00:42:54.850
so it's more effective,
that they buy into it,

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.970
it's their idea, they
develop their judiciary,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.776
they develop their lawyers.

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:03.776
Then, that is a piece of
getting towards democracy.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.840
Obviously, I don't have any feeling

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.720
that I'm changing the world,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.550
but there is a small area
that I can be of help,

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.730
and that is developing,
helping them to develop

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.520
their legal system so
it can take the place

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.800
that a judiciary should
in a democratic process.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.000
- I detect, in all that you've said

00:43:26.742 --> 00:43:30.520
a philosophy of modesty and humility

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.293
tied to intellectual rigor,

00:43:36.143 --> 00:43:40.450
if I can say, that reflects the way

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.270
you see the Inn of Courts abroad,

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.970
but also in the way you see the judiciary

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.580
in our political system.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.850
Is that fair?

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.980
I mean, you seem to recognize the limits

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.430
of what courts do, and if that's true,

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.330
do you feel, sometimes,
that we overemphasize,

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:02.907
that we think, we expect too much

00:44:02.907 --> 00:44:04.860
of both lawyers and courts?

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.070
- Mm-hmm, I do, and I
think one of the things

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.970
that I've always talked
about is the importance

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.650
of judicial humility, that is,

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:14.337
the humility to recognize
what our role is,

00:44:14.337 --> 00:44:18.080
and we shouldn't usurp the
role of the political branches,

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.000
and I think that that's true,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.050
that if we focus on what we
were supposed to be doing,

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.950
that requires the political branches

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.410
to focus on what they ought to be doing,

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.980
and I think that's true, not only here,

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.420
but it's true overseas.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.432
The best thing that we can do
overseas in these countries,

00:44:37.432 --> 00:44:41.160
from my view of what
little I can contribute,

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.940
is to make their
judiciaries more effective,

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.906
so that they are protecting rights,

00:44:45.906 --> 00:44:48.204
they're enforcing the Constitution.

00:44:48.204 --> 00:44:51.880
I always said the best
thing we can do for dictator

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.480
is to give them a good
independent judiciary.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.400
It'll take time.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.350
I mean, all of these
countries are in transition,

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.760
and in judicial administration,

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.554
there are no bandaids.

00:45:02.554 --> 00:45:04.800
It takes years.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.300
Former Chief Justice
Vanderbilt of New Jersey said,

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.191
judicial administration is
not for the short winded,

00:45:12.191 --> 00:45:13.440
and that's true.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.180
We're distance runners, and
we talk in terms of decades,

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.900
and not years or months.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.230
But there are things we can do

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.600
and we should start doing more of them,

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.970
to assist overseas the
judiciaries and the lawyers,

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.220
to make them more effective.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.560
It's nice we're sending
them guns and planes,

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.049
and I think maybe that's important,

00:45:33.049 --> 00:45:35.250
but for longterm benefits,

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.268
we shouldn't overlook the possibility

00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:40.210
of helping them develop structures,

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.943
which will protect human
rights within the country.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.660
- As we think about the
role of lawyers and judges

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.270
in the future, it would
seem that maybe we have

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.260
too many lawyers in the legislature,

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.260
and not enough theologians
and other educators

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.150
and others who can bring different skills,

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:07.150
so I'm curious about what you
see is the overuse of lawyers.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.589
I'm not asking you to
criticize the legislature,

00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:15.133
but clearly, lawyers
have something to add,

00:46:17.584 --> 00:46:21.750
but is it sometimes the
case that too many lawyers

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.630
is not a good thing as we're looking

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:27.021
at different institutions
besides the courts?

00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:28.034
- I don't know.

00:46:28.034 --> 00:46:31.360
I think that we get there for a reason.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.360
What is there about lawyers
that become politicians?

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.587
And lawyers, of course, are focusing

00:46:37.587 --> 00:46:42.527
upon a very important process
in the judicial system,

00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:44.685
and they do it on a daily basis,

00:46:44.685 --> 00:46:49.685
where a doctor is operating on a table,

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.399
a professor is teaching in a school,

00:46:54.399 --> 00:46:57.810
but lawyers are right in
the middle of this mix,

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.780
and I think that it's just the very nature

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.300
of the type of person
who's drawn to the law

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.120
and their experience
being constantly immersed

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.580
in this process that sort of makes people

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.490
gravitate towards that,

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.949
so I'm not sure that we
have too many lawyers.

00:47:13.949 --> 00:47:16.640
Maybe it's just that whatever they are,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.093
we need more statesmen.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:20.663
- Well said.

00:47:20.663 --> 00:47:23.411
One other area that I
wanted to ask you about.

00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:27.590
We're in kind of a
foreign policy crisis now.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.630
We're also in an economic crisis,

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:34.060
and so there's gonna be
a lot of looking back,

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.700
with regard to the economic collapse,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.350
a lot of cases coming before judges,

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.660
and then, in the war on terrorism,

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.250
clearly, there's a lot of rule setting.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:49.250
Now I'm curious as to what
you see the role of the courts

00:47:49.926 --> 00:47:52.130
in dealing these two areas,

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.200
where we're really gonna have to have

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.970
a lot of new rulemaking.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.050
We're gonna also have the possibility

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.090
of investigations about what went wrong,

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.970
what should we do about it, and so on.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:10.390
But I'm curious is,
are there any red flags

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.790
that you would like to hold up
about what the courts can do

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.720
and what they can't do,
and the contribution

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.600
that judges and lawyers can make,

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.020
even if we have a commission, say,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.530
and it's not thrown at the courts.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.940
On the other hand, all this may come

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.910
before the different courts
to solve different problems

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.300
related to these two
very important issues,

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.430
where we're really unsure
about the way to proceed.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.263
- Mm-hmm.

00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:40.810
I think there are issues that
are coming along the pike

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:41.750
that are gonna be that way.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:46.550
The whole idea of genetics
is going to change markedly

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.593
how courts function, what kinds of issues

00:48:48.593 --> 00:48:50.800
they're gonna have to deal with.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.170
I was involved in a
three year study on that.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.253
It was enough to frighten me.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.187
But I think that we have
to be flexible enough

00:49:00.187 --> 00:49:02.530
to meet those that come along,

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.800
that'll require judges to become educated

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.460
in certain fashions

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.160
and to the extent that we
are called upon to do it,

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.490
we have to prepare.

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.976
On the other hand, we
can't use the judiciary

00:49:14.976 --> 00:49:17.334
as a universal fix it.

00:49:17.334 --> 00:49:22.085
In the recent coup that
took place in Thailand,

00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:26.770
the story is told of the king
calling the judiciary over

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.330
in a private meeting, and
saying democracy needs fixing;

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.726
you fix it.

00:49:34.726 --> 00:49:39.726
Well, we're not qualified,
either by our individuality

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.480
or by our role to fix democracy.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.320
Over the longterm we can help
it by not taking it over,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.440
but the idea to fix a democratic problem

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.310
that they had there, we just couldn't do,

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:56.320
and I think we have to be careful trying

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.634
to give those things to the court.

00:49:58.634 --> 00:50:01.730
Very often, for example,
in many countries,

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.950
they get judges to behead commissions.

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:04.840
Why?

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.376
Because they think the
people with the black robe on

00:50:07.376 --> 00:50:10.310
will be thought better of by the people.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:15.166
We did that once with President
Kennedy's assassination,

00:50:15.166 --> 00:50:19.460
and the chief justice thought
it was a great mistake,

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.912
and he was sorry he ever decided

00:50:20.912 --> 00:50:23.120
that he would go along with it,

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.037
because it changes the role of the judge,

00:50:26.037 --> 00:50:28.870
which you have to be very
careful to not do that,

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.396
and England does it all the time,

00:50:30.396 --> 00:50:32.499
but it's not our philosophy.

00:50:32.499 --> 00:50:34.410
So I think we're gonna have to be careful

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.120
what role the court should play

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.042
in these very important areas.

00:50:38.042 --> 00:50:40.748
Critically, we have to play the role

00:50:40.748 --> 00:50:42.541
of defending the Constitution,

00:50:42.541 --> 00:50:44.740
to the extent any of these things,

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.080
the war on terrorism, or whatever,

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.597
is inconsistent with the Constitution,

00:50:49.597 --> 00:50:52.010
those cases have to come to court,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.278
and we have to be strong
enough to make those decisions.

00:50:55.278 --> 00:50:57.770
No matter what the future is,

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.525
no matter how difficult it is,

00:50:59.525 --> 00:51:02.051
the Constitution is so fundamental

00:51:02.051 --> 00:51:05.240
that we have to find a way
of solving our problems

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.750
without violating it.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.950
So the Constitution, I
think, puts us in a position

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.830
of having to be very vigilant.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:13.420
On the other hand, there are many things

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.140
that could occur outside the Constitution,

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.170
and the political process is
gonna have to sort that out.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.370
- One final question.

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.470
If students were watching this program,

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.310
and they look at your career,

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.260
and they say, yeah, I
would like to do that,

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:32.260
how should they prepare for law in a world

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.530
that's gonna be changing a lot,

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.421
and the change we're experiencing?

00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:42.320
- Yeah.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.030
I don't have any real answer to that.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.230
I think it's more a matter of interest.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.530
If a person really wants to come into law,

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:50.900
there's so many different areas

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.850
of law they can deal with now,

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.338
not only domestically,
but internationally,

00:51:55.338 --> 00:52:00.338
and so a very broad educational process

00:52:00.373 --> 00:52:03.700
that gives a person a very substantial,

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:06.030
wide ranging experience,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.440
will be of great help to them,

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.960
because judges more and more now

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.290
have to have peripheral vision.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.720
We used to just focus this way,

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.420
but we've gotta see what that means.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.900
If we're gonna make that decision

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.480
having to do with the anti-trust law,

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.800
but what does that mean outside here?

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.366
And we have to be able
to see that process,

00:52:23.366 --> 00:52:26.970
what that means, and I think to the extent

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.140
that we get better strengthening

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.176
of educational process,

00:52:31.176 --> 00:52:33.051
more in the liberal arts,

00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:36.620
that we seem to think
is not necessary now.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.620
If it is, two and two doesn't equal four,

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.810
we're not interested.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.260
I see it different.

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.511
I think we have to have that wider vision

00:52:43.511 --> 00:52:47.680
to bring to the task what's
gonna be necessary in the future

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.200
'cause truly, it is gonna be different.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.720
- Judge Wallace, I wanna
thank you very much

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.290
for coming back to the Berkeley campus.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:57.230
Congratulations on your award,

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.070
and thank you for being on our program.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:52:59.910
- My pleasure.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.820
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.943
for this Conversation With History.

00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:08.514
(upbeat music)
