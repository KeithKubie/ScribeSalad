00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.040
&gt;&gt; Teresa Sierra: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.310
Hi. My name is Teresa Sierra.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
I'm the chief of the [inaudible]
government [inaudible] division

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.530
that's sponsoring this program.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.430
And it is my great pleasure to
introduce to you a real good friend

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.940
of our division and of the library.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.350
Professor Joe Campbell.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.890
He has been here before.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.270
He's a regular coming to our
reading room at least twice a year.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.110
We see him sauntering in followed
by a bunch of his students,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.910
and he's introducing these students

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.210
to primary sources,
namely newspapers.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.510
He's become an expert, if
you guys need help out there,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.060
with the scan view
microfilm readers.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.580
That's your guy.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.120
Anyway, seriously he has
a PhD from North Carolina.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.420
Right? Am I right?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.140
He's a tenured professor
at American University.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.770
He has written numerous
books, articles.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.680
I've seen him on TV
a number of times

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.780
where he makes appearances
on a regular basis.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.550
I was talking to somebody
this afternoon --

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.870
this morning about one
of the books he wrote

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.090
that I found very intriguing.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.000
It's called "1995:
The Watershed Year."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.300
Did I say that right?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.960
Okay. And why is 1995 all that
important, you might wonder.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.680
Well, Professor Campbell
has an idea.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.330
That was the year of the
Oklahoma City bombing,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.690
the trial of the century
[inaudible] in Florida.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.860
Monica Lewinsky.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000
Anybody remember that?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.690
And the launching of the internet.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.310
So he has something going on there.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.190
But I won't bore you with all my
great interest in what he writes

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.710
and how he approaches
his teaching career.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.290
He has received many awards
and I think perhaps --

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.160
Maybe I'm wrong, and maybe
he'll tell me someday.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.470
His greatest award that he
treasures the most is the year

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.330
that he was named faculty
member of the year

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.710
by the student body of
American University.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.450
So it's a great honor.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.070
So why don't you help me bring him

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.740
to the podium, give
him a warm welcome?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.540
Thank you.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.100
[ Applause ]

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.970
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Thank you.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.270
Terri, thanks very much.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.560
That was a great introduction.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.470
In 1995 I -- The subtitle was "The
Year the Future Began," but I kind

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.770
of like yours a little better.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.830
It's -- The watershed year.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.170
And what? What did we say?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.690
The internet, Oklahoma
City, the bombing there,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.150
the O.J. Simpson Trial of the
Century, Clinton meets Lewinsky

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.940
and begins the dalliance
that led to his impeachment.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.690
And also the Dayton
Peace Accords in 1995

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.900
that ended the long war in Bosnia.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.360
And it was really a moment in which
the United States found itself

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.560
at the peak of its post war power
as the unrivaled superpower.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.540
It was able to bring an end to this
long and bloody conflict in Bosnia.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.410
So yes. Those are the
respective chapters of "1995:

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.550
The Year the Future Began."

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.150
But that was a book that
came out two years ago.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.780
Today we're talking about --
Related to a book that came out,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.420
a second edition that came out,
just about a year ago titled

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.640
"Getting it Wrong:
Debunking the Greatest Myths

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.340
in American Journalism."

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.450
And it takes a look at media driven
myths which are prominent stories

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.070
about and/or by the news
media that are widely believed

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.240
and often retold, but which under
close inspection, under scrutiny,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.650
dissolve as apocryphal or wildly
exaggerated media driven myths.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.860
And they so happen to be fairly
close cousins to fake news.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.740
You can think of media myth as
prominent cases of fake news

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.180
that have masqueraded as
factual for many, many years.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.770
So that will be the
essence of the talk today.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.760
I look forward to engaging you all
with some questions and answers

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.610
and comments during the Q and
A section that will follow.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.850
But first let me say it's a
terrific pleasure to be back

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.450
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.720
I have, as Terri was suggesting,
done a lot of my research

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.410
at the Library of Congress
over the years.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.990
And what better way to do
it than reading microfilm,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.990
squinting in to the
microfilm reader?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.530
And I can't say that I am up
to speed on the view scans.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.320
I do get training every
once in a while on that,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.090
and then I completely
forget about it and I'm back

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.050 position:56%
on the old crank machines, you know.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.080
Which I love, and I've done
a good deal of my research

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.140
over the past 20 years here
at the Library of Congress.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.040
So it's really a pleasure
to be back,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.110
to be invited back, to give a talk.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.550
And to talk about some
of my research.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.850
And not only do I do a lot

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.170
of research here, but
many of my students.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.640
I bring students to the Library
of Congress, and over the years --

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.760
I've been [inaudible]
about 20 years.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.800
And over those years hundreds
of my students, undergrad

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.580
and grad students, have come
to the Library of Congress

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.050
and have come mostly
for the newspaper

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.250
and current periodical
reading room to do research

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.130
on research related
assignments in my classes.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.200
And they have, without
exception, enjoyed the experience.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.600
For undergrads especially it
is kind of cool for them to say

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.300 position:56%
that they've been able to do
research at the Library of Congress.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.460
This fantastic only in
Washington institution.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.570
And for the students studying in
D.C., this is a must do to come

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.870
to the Library of Congress.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.490
Not to get the reader's
card and take a tour,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.450
but to actually do research,
to crank the microfilm.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.390
Here's a couple of
students doing just that.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.420
So my thanks again to Terri
and Georgia [inaudible]

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.490
and their colleagues for
the invitation today.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.140
It is an opportunity to talk
about some of my research,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.740
and also to explore with you
some of the recent developments

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.430
in what is known as fake news.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.730
Fake news.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.370
Now, believe it or not,
there are people who think

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.870
that fake news is not really
all that big of a problem.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.260
And there was a fair amount of
discussion earlier this year

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.700
in journalism reviews and
journalism periodicals

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.960 position:56%
about whether this is serious enough
to really merit a lot of attention.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.650
The thinking was, "Well, fake
news is kind of ephemeral."

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.050
It appears on these
way out there websites,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.180
and it's really not getting
all that many eyeballs compared

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.550
to mainstream media outlets.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.060
Both traditional and online.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.970
So there's this thinking that
maybe we're overstating fake news,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.870 position:56%
especially the effects of fake news,
that maybe it's not as important

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.110
or as decisive as some people
have tried to make it out to be.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.210
That it really may not be
such a problem after all.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.440
But then again you
might want to tell

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.660
that to [inaudible] the pizzeria
on Connecticut Avenue that had --

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.840
These episodes of fake news
are so bizarre, but this one,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.680
as you probably remember, was
the site of an encounter back

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.530
in December in which a guy, a
28 year old from North Carolina,

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:09.440
drove up to the restaurant and
to investigate, as he said.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.300
To self investigate reports
that the pizzeria was being used

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.820
by Hillary Clinton and her campaign
manager to run a child sex ring

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.350
in the back rooms and
in the basement.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.860
I mean it's just a bizarre store.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.400
It's not even close to being
plausible, but nonetheless it was

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.230
out there in these --

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.140
the Netherland, the
netherworld of the internet.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.810
And this was an example of fake
news that really went viral.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.210
And this episode in which a
guy from North Carolina came

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.630
up to self investigate,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.470
and he discharged a firearm
inside the restaurant,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.400
you know causing a complete
shutdown of that restaurant as well

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.030
as restaurants and
businesses nearby.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.320
It was a serious, serious problem.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.330 position:56%
And the story continues to circulate
even though it's been widely

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.130
debunked, routinely
rejected as implausible.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.000
But it exists, and it's out there,
and it continues to circulate.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.390
So it is an example of fake
news being a serious problem

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.930
or turning into a serious problem.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.590
And then just the other day, just
the other day, we were reminded

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.760
of the reach of fake news as this

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:31.260
"New York Times" article reports
Google and Facebook feeds,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.930
newsfeeds from those
two platforms, were --

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:40.210
Recipients were receiving
word that the shooter

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:51.600 position:56%
at the Las Vegas casino was a
liberal, was a fan of Rachel Maddow,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.780
not a fan of Donald Trump,
supported by MoveOn.org,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.070
and that he had been
linked to the Islamic state.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.390
All of which was untrue.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.620 position:56%
None of this stuff is accurate, but
it was out there and had been passed

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.730
on through the algorithms of
Facebook and Google to many,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:16.300
many unsuspecting recipients
of these platforms.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.620
And Facebook has other problems,
as you no doubt have been aware.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.520
I mean it's not just
a fake news problem,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.530
but fake ads have circulated on
Facebook, including those linked

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.480
to accounts linked to Russia

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.780
over the past several months during
the presidential campaign last year

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.170
and in to this year as well.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.350
So Facebook and Google in
particular have problems in terms

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.780
of letting algorithms
drive their content,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:50.100
what appears on their
platforms, on their newsfeeds.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.190
And this is no minor issue.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.020
This is no minor problem.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.150
And it's hard to see how Facebook
and Google can let this go

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.520
on without -- by just allowing
algorithms to drive content.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.410
And that's essentially
where we are now.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:11.550
So anything, almost anything, wild
stuff, phony ads, can get up there

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.300
and reach incredible
numbers of people.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.330
Because these platforms, two-thirds
of American adults every day log

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.500
in to social media of one
kind or another for news.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.060
So this is a serious issue in terms
of undercutting popular discourse.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.020
One thing I will say
about fake news, though.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.510
It's not new.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.960
We have dealt with fake
news for many years.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.420
Perhaps not with the intensity
that algorithms transmit news

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.250 position:56%
to newsfeeds at Facebook and Google,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.880
but nonetheless it
has been out there.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.610
It has circulated.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.700
For example, the "New
York Sun" in August

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.710
of 1835 published a six part
series in which it reported,

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.690
this penny newspaper
in New York City --

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:05.010
reported that there was
life found on the moon.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.390
And that the lunar landscape was
populated by exotic animals as well

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.550
as bat wing humanoid characters.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.130
The "New York Sun's"
ostensible source

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.450
for this reporting was the work of
an astronomer named John Herschel

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.020
who was reporting from the southern
hemisphere that had been able

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.900
to see these objects
on the lunar surface.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.950
Even to the degree of being
able to determine the gender

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.350
of these winged humanoid figures.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.940
The "New York Sun," 1835.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.920
Later in the 19th century in 1897 a

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.700
"New York Herald" reporter named
George Bronson Rea published a book

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.180 position:56%
called "Facts and Fakes About Cuba."

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.310
"Facts and Fakes About Cuba."

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:03.690 position:56%
And he was lamenting, this reporter,
he was lamenting the circulation

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:10.000
of fakes, fake news, about the
Cuban insurrection that led in 1898

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.220
to the Spanish American War.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.300
And he was complaining and laid
out his case in a book that came

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.740
out in early 1897 about
the correspondence

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.360
for New York newspapers
as well as others who were

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.770
out there peddling this
garbage, this made up stuff,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:32.560
these extreme stories about
Spanish atrocities on Cuba.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.490
Intended, he thought, to whip
up public sentiment at home

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.600
in the United States to
support U.S. intervention

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.360
in the war for Cuban independence.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.380 position:56%
That's what happened, but not
because of news content necessarily.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.740
It's because of other
factors that diplomatic clash

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.600
between the United States, Cuba,
and Spain, the colonial rulers,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.600
and that's what led in
1898, April of 1898,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.470
to the Spanish American War.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.040
But the point here is that fakes
and facts had been long disputed,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.020
and had been long a subject
in American journalism.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.300
Now one problem with fake news

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.000
in the contemporary context
is what do we mean by this.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.270
What do we mean?

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.880
It's a term that's proven
very flexible, very fluid.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.820
In fact, so fluid that the

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.170
"Washington Post's" media
writer Margaret Sullivan came

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.340 position:56%
out earlier this year and said, "You
know, this term ought to be banned

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.220
because we can't make
any sense out of it."

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.520
It's been corrupted.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.310
It's been appropriated.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.520
Yeah. It's been appropriated by
the president of the United States

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:43.020
who routinely invokes the term
fake news to criticize and comment

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.610
on anything that he doesn't
think is entirely accurate

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.460
or at least does not
put his administration

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.210
and his policies in the best light.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.990
Fake news, he calls them.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.280
Now Trump, of course, as we know,
has been one of the purveyors

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.830
of fake news for many
months, if not years.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.460
He was an advocate of the
Birther interpretation

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.030
of Barack Obama's birthplace.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.620
He was -- Oh yeah.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.150
He was also one of the -- During
the primary campaign last year

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:21.070
in 2016 he accused Ted Cruz's
father of being complicit

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.840
in the JFK assassination.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.760
Something he picked up presumably
from the "National Enquirer"

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.330
or something akin to that.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.620
But Trump has been out
there even from his --

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.490
The day he took office
he was saying, "You know,

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.750 position:56%
that crowd out there was the biggest
crowd ever for an inauguration.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.390
More people saw my
inauguration than anybody else's."

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.110
You know, demonstrable not true.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.580
I mean a lot of photographs
suggested that, you know,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.770
there was a pretty thin turnout
in the streets of Washington

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.070
for Trump's inauguration.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.470
But nonetheless it just
is emblematic of his use

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:59.100
of exaggeration, hyperbole,
falsehoods,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.640
to push an agenda, I suppose.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.940
His own agenda.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.090
He's very narcissistic.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.720
Anyway, he has made
great use of fake news,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.680
and is one of the reasons why the

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.130
"Washington Post" suggested
we bury this term.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.940
But it's out there.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.320
And again the definitions are
very difficult to pin down.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.580
The online site Vox says that
false news -- Defines it this way.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.010
False news claims are presented
in an official looking way,

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.680
often online, and in a way to --

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.770
that's intended to deceive
readers, intended to deceive.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.560
The "Post" has said
it defined fake news

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.780
as deliberately constructed lies
in the form of news articles

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.150
that are meant to mislead
the public.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.550 position:56%
So you see both of these definitions
include a sense of intention.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.340
Intentionality.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.610
Now I would offer a definition
that sort of takes us away

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.080
from intentionality and just
embraces everything that is false,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.520
erroneous, dubious, media driven
tales that circulate widely

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.890
and serve to corrupt or
warp popular discourse.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.990
And, as we can see from the
examples I mentioned earlier,

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.030
that's exactly what fake news does.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.660
It corrupts and warps
popular discourse.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.110
Now my definition has
these advantages.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.510
It removes intent which can
be very difficult to prove.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.750
How do you know what's
going on inside the mind

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.900
of somebody who's intentionally
or not putting

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.090
out erroneous information?

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.160
So we just get rid of intent.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.940
It also recognizes that there
is this potential warping

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.100
or corrupting effect of fake news.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.110
A serious problem, in my view.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.380 position:56%
And thirdly, this definition insists

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.080
that this is not just
a social media problem.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.520
This is not just a
problem of the internet

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.920
and its far out there fringes.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.330 position:56%
This also includes mainstream media.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:08.460
It is far more than just -- Fake
news is far more than just postings

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.770
at obscure websites on the
fringes of the online world.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:24.690 position:56%
In fact, the news media these days
are widely distrusted for an ability

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.740
to present news in a fair
minded and accurate fashion.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.230
And you can see from this
chart these are Gallup polls

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.250
that go back 40 plus years.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.670
And what is shown here goes back

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:42.680
about 20 showing how popular
recognition of the trust

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.190
in the media has subsided,
has eased down,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.390
has ebbed consistently
since the late 1990s.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:56.210
And has reached a low during the
presidential campaign of 2016.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.660
Less than one-third of
American adults responding

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.130
to the survey found
that the news media --

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.830
They could have a great deal
or a fair amount of trust

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.780
in what the news media
were reporting.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.690
So I submit that fake news
includes, and should include --

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.100
A discussion of fake news should
include mainstream news media

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.400
as well.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.810
And the media do have a
trust problem, as we can see.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.480
And there are a number of examples
of mainstream media putting

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:35.920 position:56%
out stories that had to be retracted
or walked back or modified.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.650
These are dubious tales that
corrupt the popular discourse.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.880
And would meet my definition
of fake news.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.460
The first one there is from the
"Washington Post" in which the

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:52.250
"Post" reported that a Russia
linked operation had hacked

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:58.280
in to the U.S. electrical grid
through a utility in Vermont.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.580
Serious stuff.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.880
Serious stuff.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.850
The Russians are tapping
in to the electrical grid.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.320
You know, there's potential
problems ahead.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.090
The story turned out to be
considerably less than that.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.130
There was one laptop at a Vermont
utility that had some malware

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.230
that was like that used by
some Russian hackers that may

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.100
or may not have been
connected to the grid.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.790
In fact, the Vermont
utility said it hadn't been.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:32.680
So there's -- From this one case of
malware on a laptop the "Post" blew

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680
up the story to Russian
intervention, Russian hacking

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.290
in to the U.S. electrical grid.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:43.990
That's kind of fake news.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.790
Another one that got
wide attention right

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:51.630
after Trump's inauguration was the
"Time Magazine" report that Trump

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.010
or his aides had removed the bust

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.400
of the Reverend Martin Luther
King Junior from the Oval Office.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.960
"Time" put this out there.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.710
It was a pool report, and the

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.350
"Time" reporter was the
pool reporter of that time.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.620
Reported it apparently without
checking or asking or looking

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.070
around and had to retract it.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.010
But this story is often
invoked by conservative critics

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.730
of the news media as an example
of the media getting it wrong.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.370
Putting out fake news.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.670
And then, of course, there
was the case this summer

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.070
in which three top
level CNN staffers,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.490
including a Pulitzer Prize winner
for the "New York Times" had

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:41.060 position:56%
to resign because of a story linking
Scaramucci, a Trump associate later,

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.410
for what, 10 days, a
Trump White House staffer,

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.100
to a Russian investment house.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.400
A story that CNN put out
there, posted online,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.400
on the basis of a single
anonymous source.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.910
One anonymous source.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.740
And retracted the story.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.410
And forced the three
staffers to resign.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.530
The exact details of what
went on in that case,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.020
and why the story was
totally erroneous

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.320
or poorly reported has
never really been disclosed.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.770
There's still questions about why
they took the steps that they did.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.350
But nonetheless this is an
example of a story that was

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.210
out there supported by an
investigative team at CNN

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:30.250
that later blew up in its face.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.880
And, you know, I'm thinking that
maybe these examples are not all

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.870
that surprising because some
of the best known stories

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.170
that journalists tell
about themselves

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:48.670
and about their profession
are themselves exaggerated.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.960
Mythical. They're media myths.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.470
And among them is the
tale of Watergate.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.290
Watergate.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:07.640
That the dogged reporters of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein for the

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.790
"Washington Post" uncovered the
evidence that forced Richard Nixon

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.210
to resign the presidency.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.350
This is the dominant
narrative of Watergate.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.160
You find this everywhere.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.820
It's in journalism textbooks.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.270
It's in the popular media.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:31.030
It's a shorthand version of
what this scandal was all about.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.120
And it is derived from
in part Woodward

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.590
and Bernstein's very
successful book that came

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:42.100
out just months before Richard
Nixon resigned in August of '74.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.240
Based also on the very
successful film

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.070
that they -- based on their book.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.370
Same title.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.480
"All the President's Men"
that came out in 1976.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.730
And also based on the 20 or
so year long guessing game,

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.980
more like 30 year guessing
game, about the identity

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.050
of the super secret source

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.590
that Woodward had whom was
identified only in the book

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.190
and movie as Deep Throat.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.810
Turned out to be Mark Felt, number
two at the FBI, who was the subject

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.990
of a movie now that's just out
these days called "Mark Felt:

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.640
The Man Who Took Down
the White House."

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.310
The reviews have been
pretty terrible,

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.140
but I still plan to see it.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.340 position:56%
In any event, it's not as good, I
guess, as "All the President's Men,"

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.940
the movie version or
the cinematic version

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.780
of "All the President's Men."

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:40.220
It's interesting that even
at the "Post" the principles

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.520
on the news side of the "Post"

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.480
over the years have
rejected this interpretation,

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.560
this heroic journalist
narrative of Watergate.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.590
They've scoffed at it.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.440
Katharine Graham who was the
publisher before, during,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.790
and after the Watergate period
said at the 25th anniversary

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.840
of the break in, the seminal
crime of the Watergate scandal,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.040
a break in at Democratic National
Headquarters, in June of 1972.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.800
She said at the 25th anniversary of
this, "Sometimes people accuse us

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.550
of bringing down a president,
which of course we did not do."

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.720
The processes that caused
Richard Nixon's resignation

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.630
were constitutional.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.930
And she's not alone.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.770
Ben Bradley, the executive
editor of the "Post" at the time,

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:29.780
shown here on your right,
said about the same time

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.640
that it must be remembered
that Nixon got Nixon.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.970 position:56%
It wasn't the "Post" that got Nixon.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.710
And he's referring here to
the secret White House tapes

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.720
that Richard Nixon made of most
conversations in the Oval Office

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.640
between 1971 and '73, tapes that
captured him approving a plan

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.180
to divert the investigation
in to the Watergate break in.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.120
Clear obstruction of
justice that led

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.200
to his resignation
in August of 1974.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:02.880
Nixon got Nixon.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.180
The "Post" didn't get Nixon.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.240
According to Ben Bradley.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.910
And Bob Woodward, in Earth year
terms, has said somewhat the same.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:16.270
"To say that the press brought
down Nixon, that's horse poop."

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.920
I think that's what those are for.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.750
Anyway, he is -- He
too has been adamant

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.930
about this heroic journalist
interpretation being a wrong headed

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.870
interpretation of Watergate.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.760
And I think the ombudsman
for the "Post" back at the 10

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.190
or 12 years ago, a great guy by
the name of Michael Getler --

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:46.090
He was ombudsman after that
for PBS for a number of years.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.590
Getler captured it correctly,
that it was not the "Post,"

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.340
but it was the FBI [inaudible]
acting in bipartisan fashion,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.180
and the courts, that brought down
the Richard Nixon administration.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.480
It wasn't the "Post."

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.780
And I think that was quite right.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.190
Because to roll up a
scandal of the dimensions

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.470
of Watergate required
the collective,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.260
if not always the coordinated
efforts, of many forces

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.300
and factors including special
prosecutors, federal judges,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.940 position:56%
both houses of Congress, the Supreme
Court, Justice Department, and FBI.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.070
And even then, even then
with all these forces arrayed

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.830
against Richard Nixon,
he would have walked,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.860
he would have survived
the Watergate scandal,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.750
had it not been for those tapes.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.170
Had it not been for
the clear cut evidence

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:37.040
that showed Nixon was culpable
of obstructing justice.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.020
It needed that kind
of certain evidence

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.640
to dynamite the president
from the Oval Office.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.040 position:56%
He resigned in August of '74 before
he could be impeached and convicted.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.670
He certainly would have been both.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:55.450
So why does this interpretation,
this media myth

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.690
of the heroic journalist,
why does this live on?

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.390
Why does this persist?

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.760
Why is it the dominant narrative?

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.290
At least three reasons.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.800
It's convenient shorthand

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.790
for explaining the
Watergate scandal nowadays.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.070
It's been 45 years
since the burglary

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.730 position:56%
at the Democratic National
Headquarters, and there's been a lot

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.440
that happened during those 2 and a
half years of the Watergate period.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.300
Who was doing what, and
where, and who was Haldeman,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.830
who was Mitchell, who
were all these guys?

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.620
It's -- It was hard to keep
it straight at the time.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.320
It's impossible to keep
it straight these days.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.000
So what we have as the dominant
narrative is a simplified easily

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.520 position:56%
accessible shorthand that explains
Watergate, that embraces the essence

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.500
of the scandal, I.E.
Richard Nixon resigned,

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.170
but adds a little media
centric window dressing to it.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.920
That it was because of these
dogged intrepid reporters

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.510
that Richard Nixon lost his office.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.400
Easy to explain.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.300
It's convenient.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.940
It's simplistic.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.620
It avoids the complexities

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.430
of what was a very
sprawling and complex scandal.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.830
And it's also very
reassuring to journalists.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.080
It lives on because
it's a reassuring tale.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.110
It's an affirmation tale that
journalists can make a difference,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:30.760
that they can be decisive forces
and factors in the greater scheme

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.110
of things in American politics.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.410 position:56%
It's a media centric interpretation,

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.700
but it's also one that's
reassuring to journalists.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:47.680
Let's move on to another more
recent, if you will, media myth.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.230
That of the coverage of Hurricane
Katrina 12 years ago, 2005.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.320
The media themselves patted
themselves on the back saying,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.050
"This was a triumph,
a media triumph."

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.630
I call it the myth of
superlative reporting.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:11.380
There was a lot of self referential
praise in the immediate aftermath

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.660
of the hurricane's passage.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:20.080
It made landfall just east of
New Orleans, and in the aftermath

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.060 position:56%
of the hurricane's passage the dikes
protecting the city were breached,

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.830
flooding much of New Orleans.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:34.180
In the aftermath the likes of
Dan Rather were very extravagant

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.400
in saying that this was
a high heroic moment

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.830
in American journalism.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.730
He called it one of the
quintessential great moments

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.460
in television news
ranking, right up there

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.660
with the Nixon/Kennedy debates,
the Kennedy assassination,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.520 position:56%
the Watergate coverage, you name it.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.710
It was a landmark, Dan Rather said.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.080
And the media narrative about
Hurricane Katrina was much

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.990
like that, that this
was a memorable moment

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:08.820 position:56%
in which the media found their voice
and were able to confront and stand

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.740
up to public officials,
local, state, and federal,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.920
holding them accountable for what
was a pretty muddled response.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.300
Especially by federal and local
authorities in New Orleans

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.370
in the aftermath of the hurricane.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.710
The reality, though,
was quite different.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.040
The reality of the
reporting was quite different.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.610
There was no high heroic
moment in American journalism.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.820
And in important respects
the coverage

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.410
of Hurricane Katrina's aftermath
was badly flawed and exaggerated.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.820
They got it wrong.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.380
Crucial details.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.490
Journalists were in error.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:56.920 position:56%
They described scenes of apocalyptic
horror and mayhem, and lawlessness

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:03.160
that the storm supposedly had
unleashed across New Orleans.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.370
They told of snipers
firing at medical personnel,

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:11.270
snipers firing at helicopters.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:16.560
They told of bodies being stacked
up like cordwood in the Superdome

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.030
and convention center
where people sought refuge

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.680
from the storm's after effects.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.410
They talked about roving
gangs preying on tourists,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.450
terrorizing people who took
refuge in the Superdome.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.420
They said children were the
victims of sexual assault,

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.240
how one seven-year-old was raped
and had her throat slashed.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.880 position:56%
They also spoke about other horrors.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.480
Sharks plying the flood
waters of New Orleans.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.780
Things like that.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:53.340
This was a U.S. and an
international media response.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.610
International media,
particularly the British media,

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.250
just loved this story about
the apocalypse of New Orleans.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.340
This was a moment in which
the United States was going

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.270
to -- being brought down.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.810
And the British national
media just ate it up.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.170
But so did the U.S. news media.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:14.240
The media narrative, the dominant
media narrative, was of chaos,

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:21.270
anarchy, mayhem, and few, if
any, of these horrific accounts

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.190
of lawlessness, anarchy,
and the aftermath

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.480
of Hurricane Katrina's
passage were true.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.300
Some reporting of that
afterwards found

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.730
that almost all these stories
were based largely on rumor,

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.690
were exaggerated, and untrue.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:46.830
The effects were to paint
for America and the rest

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.090
of the world scenes of
unimaginable horror.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:55.670
And they had the effect of
defaming a city and its people

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.190
at a time of their greatest need.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:05.290
And these misreported stories
about anarchy and chaos and mayhem

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.620
in New Orleans also had the
effect of slowing the arrival

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:16.160
of federal aid and
assistance to New Orleans.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.240
The deployment of aid was slowed
down because the situation seemed

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.070
so untenable that you could
not put people in there

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.480
until you were certain that
everything was under control.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.060 position:56%
These news reports in the first days

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.670
after Hurricane Katrina's
passage made it clear

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.780
that the situation
was not under control.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.920
In fact, it was one
of mayhem and chaos.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.320
As I say, that was untrue.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.810
It was largely debunked.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:48.660 position:56%
In fact, a bipartisan congressional
committee looking in to the response

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.590
to Hurricane Katrina touched
on the media's coverage too.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.300
It came to the conclusion that
if anyone rioted in the aftermath

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.850
of Hurricane Katrina,
it was the media.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:05.350
But, as I say, chaos
was the media narrative.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:09.680
And I believe we have some front
pages on the display table there

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.380
that suggest as much, including
the one that is on your far right

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.060
from the "Times-Picayune,"
the New Orleans newspaper.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.370
"Help Us Please."

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.620
The subheading read,
"After the Disaster Chaos

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.300
and Lawlessness Ruled the Streets."

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.850
And that, as I say, was the
dominant media narrative.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:33.770
So I think it's important to
keep in mind that early accounts

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.460
of disasters often are in error.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.780
Not always, but they often are.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.500
Hurricane Katrina was
one of those cases.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.460
And it's also I think
useful to keep in mind

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:57.090
that mainstream media are not
always going to get it right.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.290
They're not always
going to get it right.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.020
So, with that in mind, I'd

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.370
like to offer a few practical
straightforward suggestions

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.010
that may be useful in
combating fake news.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.570
From whatever the source.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.620
From whatever the source.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.270
My first suggestion --
There are five of them.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.080
My first suggestion was that
one about the mainstream media.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.060
They can get it wrong in the
early reporting about disasters.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:32.780
My second suggestion is develop
an ability to take the sniff test.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:38.740
The sniff test, it's akin to when
you open the refrigerator door

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.660
and the milk has gone bad.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.960
You know, you know it.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.990
And it's like that
with news stories.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:54.890 position:56%
If something just doesn't seem quite
right, if it smells a little off,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.190
then maybe you should treat it

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.300
as something that's
maybe not quite accurate.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.270
Like the shooter in Las Vegas.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.150
I mean those early reports
that appeared on Facebook

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:12.420
and Google were probably a little
too exaggerated to be true.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.830
To pass the sniff test.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.960
Be wary of sources of stories

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.770
that rely exclusively
on anonymous sources.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:29.170
One of my favorite examples of that
is the "Washington Post's" report

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:33.870
in early April 2003
about Jessica Lynch,

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:40.850
a young 19 year old waif-like army
supply clerk from West Virginia

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:45.210
who signed up for the army to be
able to use the benefits later

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:49.760
on to go to college
and get a degree.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.090
She was in a supply unit.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.970
She was in a maintenance company.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.760
Never expected to see
combat in Iraq.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:01.260
But because of a wrong turn that
her unit took in the early days

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.790
of the Iraq war, right after the
invasion began in March of 2003,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.690
Jessica Lynch's unit came
under ambush in the city

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.540
of Nasiriyah in southern Iraq.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.980
And the unit was badly shot up.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.610
11 people were killed in the unit.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.380
Several were taken prisoner,
among them Jessica Lynch.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:27.380 position:56%
She was badly injured and was
rescued by a special operations unit

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.400
on the first of April, 2003.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.390
It was the first time
that an American prisoner

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:36.400
of war had been rescued from
behind enemy lines during

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.700
combat operations.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.830
The first time since World War II.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.630
Two days after the rescue the

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.260
"Washington Post" reports
this story on the front page.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.120
That she was fighting to the death.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.610
Based on two anonymous sources.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.650
And the "Post" has
never identified them.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.600
Jessica Lynch was reported to
be fighting like a female Rambo,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.970
taking on the -- Attacking
Iraqis, firing her weapon

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.540
until she ran out of ammunition.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.700
She kept the Iraqis at bay despite
herself being shot and stabbed

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.530
and seeing colleagues
fall all around her.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.830
It was an electrifying story.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.310 position:56%
It was a story that was picked up by
news organizations around the world.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:25.770
It was a story that was
irresistibly good in a lot of ways.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.240
It was based on two
anonymous sources.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.880
Neither of the "Post"
reporters whose bylines appeared

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.270
on that story were
in Iraq at the time.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.670
They reported the story
from Washington.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:43.260
The story turned out to be
wrong in all important respects.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.230
Jessica Lynch was in Iraq.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.110
She was in Nasiriyah with her unit.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.850
She did not fire a
shot during the ambush.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.830
Her gun jammed.

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.940
And she was in the
backseat of a Humvee

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.770
as it tried to escape the ambush.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.420
And she, as the Humvee was trying
to make its escape from the city --

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.720
She was in the backseat
with her head

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.520
down between her knees
saying, "Oh, my god.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.820
Please get us out of here.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.120
Oh, my god.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.500
Please get us out of here."

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.120
The Humvee was struck by a rocket
propelled grenade and was thrown

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:22.260
in to the back side of a
disabled tractor trailer truck.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.690
And Jessica Lynch was
seriously injured in that crash.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:29.760
She did not suffer
gunshot or stab wounds,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.010
but she was badly injured
in that crash.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:38.870
The "Post" never explained how
it got it wrong, so badly wrong.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.190
It never discussed
who its sources were.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:47.180
On one occasion one of the
reporters said in an NPR interview,

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.230
"Our sources for that story
were not the Pentagon.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.470
They were not military sources.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.020
We could never get
anybody at the Pentagon

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.600
to talk about Jessica Lynch."

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.340
Which left people wondering, "Okay.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.830
Who could it have been?"

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.410
Who could it have been?

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.910
Anonymous sources in Washington.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.550
And the town is just full of them.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:13.840
The point here is to be wary of
stories based on anonymous sources.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.770
Here are a few more suggestions.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.070
Wait. Wait.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.370
I'm not done.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.630
Try to cultivate a little
viewpoint diversity.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.960
Check your biases.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.170
I guess this is a recommendation
that students hear a lot.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.470
Check your biases.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.490
You know, if you're used to reading
the "New York Times," why not pick

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.310
up the "Wall Street Journal's"
opinion page every once in a while?

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.020
Just to see what else is going on.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.060
Develop a taste for
viewpoint diversity.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.620
And don't be fooled
by satire either.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.920
Don't be fooled by satire.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.620
People are, and it's out there.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.900
And it's plausible, but
really would kind of fit

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.200
in to the fake news
definition, I guess.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.640
And some of the best satire
appears in the "New Yorker."

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:05.420 position:56%
Andy Borowitz is great, and his
satiric column appears periodically.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.170
And this is one example
of Borowitz's satire.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.470
People get fooled by this.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.370
They think it's true because
it's so good, and it's --

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.450
You know, it's on the
cusp of plausibility.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.840
On the cusp of plausibility.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.410
So let me just recap.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:24.740
Remember that early accounts
of disasters often are untrue.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.440
There are errors there.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.530
And to be wary of those.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.090
Hone that ability to
develop the sniff test.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.330
If stories don't seem to be quite
right, you're probably right.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.830
Applying your logic, applying
your experience, saying, "Hmm.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.120
Maybe it's not quite true."

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.690
The sniff test.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:51.030 position:56%
Be wary of stories based exclusively
or largely on anonymous sources.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.460 position:56%
This is a real trap for journalists.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.840
They need to do more about this.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.710
This is a toxic equation
many times in which they rely

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:02.790
on anonymous sources, and do
so cavalierly, in my view.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.110
Cultivate viewpoint diversity.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.980
And don't be fooled by
satire in the media.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.030
And to close, another
example from Borowitz.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:18.970
People believe this.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:25.600 position:56%
This one went viral in the immediate
aftermath of the 2016 election.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.310
Again, just plausible enough.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.520
It's just believable enough.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.060
So maybe it was true.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.410
Thank you folks.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.230
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.810
[ Applause ]

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [Inaudible]
time for some questions.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.590
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Questions?

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:50.890
Comments? Yes, sir?

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I would take issue

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.170
with two things [inaudible]
what you said.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.870
I think in your definition
of fake news in not allowing

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.690
for intent then you
don't acknowledge

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.290
that news media do make mistakes.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.390
They've always made mistakes.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:11.370
Out of sometimes carelessness,
sometimes bad sources,

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.320
sometimes misinterpretation.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.360
But there's [inaudible] in
there that when they find

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.610
out about the mistakes
they correct them.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.550
Which malicious fake news doesn't.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:22.850
Second point --

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.150
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: I
think on that one I --

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.540
Let me just answer that
because it's so good.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.210
I would take issue with that.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.260
I don't think the news
media are very good

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.520
about making corrections
on big mistakes.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.900
When they get somebody's age
or address, you know hometown,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.190
wrong, they'll quickly do that.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:43.970
But on a major story that they
screw it up, the tendency is not

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:46.310
to roll it back, not to retract it.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:48.460
The Jessica Lynch story,
granted it's 12

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.040
to 15 years old now,
it's an example.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.340
They never explained.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.300
The "Post" never explained
how it got it so badly wrong.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But other
media corrected it.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.520
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Not exactly.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.860
We don't know exactly how
the "Post" got it wrong.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.960
We know that she herself later
said that she was no hero,

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.940
although she also said,
"I could have taken credit

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.800
and no one else would have known."

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.260
It would have been
a [inaudible] there,

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.120
but nonetheless she never
did say, "I was a hero."

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:18.470
And, you know, she never
acknowledged hero status.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.130
To her credit.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.140
So anyway, I would argue that
news organizations really hate

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.570
to roll back major
stories that are wrong.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.110
And we can think of other
examples, perhaps more recent.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:32.910
The Hurricane Katrina case
is a more recent example.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.100
There was like a one off look
back by many news organizations.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.550
The "New York Times," the "Post,"
the "Philadelphia Inquirer,"

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:43.600
the "Times of London," sort of
took a look back to say, "Okay."

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.050
The "Times-Picayune" in New
Orleans, to its credit, as well,

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:48.350
took a look back and said, "Okay.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.650 position:56%
How did we get this story so wrong?"

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:55.390 position:56%
The story of mayhem and violence and
Mad Max like mayhem in New Orleans.

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.420
And they did a one
off shot about that.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.830
That wasn't really a retraction.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.890
It was just sort of saying, "A
lot of news reports were based

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.490
on rumors that were out of hand."

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.310
And that was it.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.610
It was a one off.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.910
So yeah. I'm a little
reluctant to embrace that notion

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.680
that there is this
corrective mechanism

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.610
that news organizations
really like to embrace.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.730
And your second question is?

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think you're
giving short shrift to Woodward

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:26.640
and Bernstein's role in Watergate
that you don't acknowledge the role

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.760 position:56%
that the media did play in revealing
the depth of the corruption

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.530
of the Nixon administration.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.720 position:56%
If the media hadn't kept the heat
on in the summer of '72 and the fall

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.950
and so on, we wouldn't have
had congressional committees.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.640
We wouldn't have had
deeper investigation.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.410
So I think you leave the right
impression there when you say,

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.300
"Well, the Post didn't
bring down the president."

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.340
But the "Post" and other papers

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.770
and organizations laid
the groundwork for that.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.070
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Maybe.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.370
I think you're right.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.670
There were other organizations
reporting the story

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.290
in the early days of Watergate.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:06.580
But the news organizations
were clearly behind the Justice

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.860
Department's investigation,
the FBI's investigation.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.630
They never learned
anything from the news media

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.070 position:56%
that they didn't uncover themselves.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.280
This is not to tout the FBI
or the Justice Department,

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.070
but they had a pretty good
understanding of the scope

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.150
of the scandal well
before the news media.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.710
And sources for the "Post" as well

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.440
as other news organizations
were the FBI and the like.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:36.390
So Sam Ervin who was the chair
of the Senate Select Committee

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.460
on Watergate, which held hearings
in the spring and summer of 1973,

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.720
identified a number of forces and
factors, including the news media,

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.450
but many others as well who
helped prepare the ground

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.990
for the hearings of that summer.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:54.560
So I would argue, and do argue in
my book, that it's a marginal role

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.100
that the news media had in
uncovering and keeping the heat

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.250
on during the Watergate scandal.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.070
Even if you -- Even if we accept
that the news media were good

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.950
in keeping the attention
level up there, it's far --

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:09.280
It's a far cry from saying
that the news media brought

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.580
down Richard Nixon.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.280
It's quite a different
interpretation.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.990
Finally on that point, Woodward
and Bernstein themselves have said

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.780 position:56%
in their book that they were kind of
like out of ammunition on Watergate

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.600
by the end of October 1972.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.300
And they were talking about
writing a book and so forth,

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.130
"All the President's
Men," which they did late

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.580
in that year and early in 1973.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:39.570
So they too were sort of at bay
by the end of October in '72.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.870
Yes, ma'am?

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:43.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [Inaudible]
their ideas

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.650
in getting the biggest headline
the fastest because [inaudible] now

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.300
that Trump in Puerto Rico saying

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.980
that at least this is not the
catastrophe that Katrina was.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.880
And I think that he's referring
to the narrative of [inaudible].

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.350
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell:
He may have been.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.220
Look. It's -- You know, the
president is going to, you know,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.070
command -- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:16.850
Yes. I knew I was going
to forget to ask you to --

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:20.840
ask myself to repeat the
question which was related

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.230
to the biggest headline and
Trump's visit to Puerto Rico

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.560
and linking the hurricane damage
there to Hurricane Katrina.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.870
Did I do justice to your question
or is that just totally butchered?

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well, I [inaudible]
use that one as an illustration

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:51.390
of why various media want to
get a dramatic first statement

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:56.390
of particular events,
and this is one

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:57.690
that we had a recent [inaudible].

00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:58.990
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Sure.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.290
The media's preference
to get a prominent story,

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:01.750
a big headline story, first, yeah.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:05.980
There's no denying that
the news media are sort

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:10.860
of inherently programmed
that way to get --

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:18.250 position:56%
To report something major accurately
and in a very, very timely fashion.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.810
And that's one of the
elements that's one

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.740
of the fundamentals of
American journalism.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:27.450
You see it in the long history
of the Associated Press.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.920
The news service that goes
back to the 1850s and continues

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.850
to be a thriving source
of news today,

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:40.930
its two imperatives are
to be fast and accurate.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:44.170
You don't always get both, but
that is what they seek to do.

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:50.310
And then in this age of the digital
world everybody's becoming a wire

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.100
service reporter essentially.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.910
All journalists from major
news organizations are posting

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:00.350
to the online sites very quickly.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.700
And very swiftly.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.260
And that's essentially
the AP imperative,

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.750
to be fast and first with the news.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:11.080
And so I think what we're
seeing is this little understood

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.540
transformation of American
mainstream journalism

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.190
into wire service journalism.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.410
Everybody's becoming a
wire service journalist.

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.590
Hope that answers your question.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.890
Yes, ma'am?

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:27.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was interested to
hear what you said about journalism

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:37.670
and heroes because I've noticed
the last several disasters

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:44.360
that you see the CNN reporters
or the ABC reporters, whatever,

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:51.580
out there capturing
themselves on tape, you know,

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.870
either using their
boat to rescue someone

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:02.300
or help them lift the rubble.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.500
You know? Pass out water and stuff.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.320
And I'm just wondering
what the profession --

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.890
the ethics of the profession.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:18.140
Or what ethics are taught in
journalism schools that sort

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.520
of allow you to get so involved

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:26.420
or to use this tragedy
for self promotion.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.960
Is this -- It seems
to be the norm now.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.260
I don't know.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.560
It seems like [inaudible].

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.860
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: It's
a really great question.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.390
The question was the ethics
of injecting one's self

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:38.740
in to the coverage of a major
story such as a hurricane

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:44.550
in which you would be using your
own boats or other equipment

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:50.440
to help people or to call attention
to the dimensions of the disaster.

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:55.640
There was a very interesting
"New York Times" article

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.220
on this very subject in
the immediate aftermath

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:03.030
of Hurricane Harvey, I believe,
in which they were talking

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:07.770
about the TV reporters who
were standing out in the winds

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.920
and the rain and the storms.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.920
It got to be so --
such a cliche anymore

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.150
that it's like almost unwatchable.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.770 position:56%
My wife will watch this stuff, but I
just can't put up with this anymore.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.590
It's just like so routine
and predictable

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:27.530
and doesn't tell you anything.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:31.620
Okay. We know the winds
are high and there's a lot

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.730
of rain, but that's a hurricane.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.030
And it's -- I don't
know why they do it.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.510
I don't think it's a way to
get, you know, new ratings.

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:44.490
In fact, the ethics of it
are a little bit dubious.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:49.100
One of the touchstones of
American journalism is not

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.310
to involve yourself in the news.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:55.140
I think that that barrier, if
you will, is eroding somewhat.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.650
It's not as hard and fast
as it may have once been.

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:07.940
And I think there's also a historic
tendency for journalists to want

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.960 position:56%
to inject themselves in to the news.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.410
And William Randolph Hearst did it

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:20.910
with his New York journal
back in 1897.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:27.450
He came up with an approach to news
called the journalism of action,

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:32.340
saying, "We're not just going to
report and comment on the news.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.840
We're going to step in
and make a difference

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.580
to the extent that we can."

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.060
So we're going to right the wrongs
to the extent that a newspaper can.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.190 position:56%
And, you know, Hearst was doing
this with some forethought, I think,

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:54.920
because he wanted to become
president of the United States

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.710
and used his newspapers as a
stepping stone to the White House.

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.970
Never happened, but
nonetheless he came

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:05.150
up with this participatory
journalism, the journalism

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:09.060
of action, that we can see echoes
of today in some of the episodes

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.510
and examples that you mentioned.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.500
Journalists coming out there,
you know, rescuing people

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.750
on their own and so forth.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.640
And I mean it's -- Look.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.560
A lot of news coverage
is ratings driven.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:32.210
And this is one way to help
drive the ratings is to --

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:37.310
If you have the dramatic rescue and
the heroic journalist out there.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:38.610
Absolutely.

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:39.910
Absolutely.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.300
There was a question on this side.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.600
Yes?

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: yeah.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.270
So I'm a folklorist and folklorists
are actually quite interested

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:53.040
in fake news for a
number of reasons.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.040
The American Folklore Society
meeting is in two weeks,

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.050
and we have four organized
panels on fake news.

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:04.350
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Fantastic.

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:06.930
Listen. If you need a
last minute replacement,

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.980
I'd be happy to step in.

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:10.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But the --

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.140
So my interest here is that I
find it's true with fake news

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:22.730 position:56%
that often even though -- Whether
or not you want to include intention

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:30.520
as part of the definition of
fake news, it's often the case

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:36.450
that someone's agenda is being
served by the fake news story,

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.330
whether it's the source and
the reporter's just a dupe

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.230
or whether it's the reporter.

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:47.150
I mean -- And this is true
both in very specific cases

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:50.540
like [inaudible] Pizza
was aimed at the election,

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.960
but also in general cases.

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.580
I mean I think that in the case
of New Orleans there's an agenda

00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:01.550 position:56%
of sort of [inaudible] conservatives
to say, "If the police were unable

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:04.060
to help you for five minutes,

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.520
everyone would loot
and you'd be murdered."

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.020
And there's also an
agenda of rapists

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.130
to say black people are
always looting and raping.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.430
And you see this.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:17.150
You -- All the footage of alleged
rapists and looters were black,

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:21.330 position:56%
even though those people weren't
really doing what was being claimed.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.170
So I think you can
often find these kinds

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.530
of agendas underlying the stories
even if they're not the agendas

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.210
of the reporters themselves.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.950
Can you comment on that?

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.250
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: Sure.

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.800
Comment about the agendas
that may be behind,

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.100
lurking behind, fake news.

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.900
In the case of New Orleans
post Katrina the agenda --

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.140
Some of the most lurid tales
about violence and mayhem

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:45.680
and so forth were coming from the
mayor and the police commissioner,

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.180
the most senior authorities
in the city

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.130
who journalists would be I guess
excused for thinking that they were

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.430
in positions to know what
they're talking about.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:53.730
I mean it's not like
journalists were following up

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.030
and pressing them on, "Okay.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.330
Where did you get this
information, Mister Mayor?"

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:57.630
Because he was saying 10,000
were going to be, you know --

00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:58.930
the death toll would be
10,000 in New Orleans,

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.230
which would be just staggering.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.530
It was about a tenth or so of
that, but anyway their agenda --

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:02.830
The police commissioner also
was putting out lurid tales

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.130
about little babies being raped in
the Superdome and stuff like that.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.430
His reasoning he said later was
that he didn't want to be held --

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:06.970
He didn't want people to think
that he was covering anything up

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:08.270
or withholding information.

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:09.570
Therefore he was pushing everything
that he heard, including rumors

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:10.870
and lurid tales of violence
that were unconfirmed --

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.190
just pushing them out in to the
media because he didn't want

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.490
to think that people were --

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.790
that he could later be
accused of covering things up.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.090
Within a month or so he had lost
his job, and the mayor finally --

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.530
Although he was reelected, he
was later indicted and convicted

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:18.880
on corruption charges and
is now a federal prisoner.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.530
Not related to Hurricane Katrina,
but I think sort of speaks

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:22.240
to the quality of public officials
in New Orleans at that time.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.540
So they were pushing
an agenda for sure.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.840
Absolutely.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.140
And I think that there
probably was an unspoken agenda

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.440
that the journalists were
pushing too, that we can expect

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.740
that this kind of thing would
happen in a largely black city.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.040
There were columnists for the
"Washington Post" who pointed

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.340
that out in the immediate aftermath
of the coverage of the lurid

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.640
and exaggerated coverage.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.940
And I think they were right.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.240
Absolutely right.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.540
One more question?

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.840
Yes, sir? You were very eager.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:40.440
How much time do we have?

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.210
We could -- This is it?

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.740
Okay. Okay.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.240
Make it a good one.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.510
Hardball here.

00:58:50.510 --> 00:59:14.670
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.920
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: The
question has to do with fake

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.970
or spurious quotations that
run rampant on the internet.

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:23.270
That's for sure.

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:28.940
The internet can be a good way
to debunk if belatedly some

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:34.160 position:56%
of these lurid and exaggerated tales
and bogus quotations among them.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:42.360
The Monticello site has also a page
devoted to phony quotes attributed

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.500
to Thomas Jefferson, and it is the
first item that if you do a search

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.990
for Jefferson quotes, that's
the first return on Google.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:53.290
Fortunately.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:56.030
So I guess the algorithms were
working well in that case.

00:59:56.030 --> 01:00:02.210
But some of these tales are just
so bizarre that you almost --

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:03.790 position:56%
So bizarre that maybe they are true.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.180
One of my favorite
Jefferson quotes was --

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.840
And you may appreciate this
because of the agenda behind it.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:18.180
It's that -- Says that
Jefferson in 1781 said,

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.170
"Some of my finest
hours have been spent

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:29.930
on my back veranda smoking hemp
and watching as far as I can see."

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:34.780
There is no evidence in his
papers, his letters, his speeches,

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.490
his correspondence
which was voluminous,

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.260
that he ever smoked hemp.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.900
They made hemp at Monticello
for clothes

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.720
and for rope and things like that.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.150
It wasn't really smokable
quality, I don't think.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:54.960
And he himself was not a
smoker, Monticello says.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.020
There are no accounts of
any of his many visitors

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.410
to Monticello ever seeing
Jefferson lighting up.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:04.780
You know, they grew tobacco
there, but he never smoked it.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.080
He never smoked hemp.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.300
And yet this quotation -- It's
one of my favorites, actually.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:15.740 position:56%
Appears to have been born digitally.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:19.580
It was made up somewhere
early in the digital era,

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.810
and has been used as
an example of, "Okay.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:29.410
If Jefferson smoked hemp, then
why lot legalize marijuana?"

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:34.380 position:56%
In fact, Gary Johnson, the
libertarian candidate for president,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.990
not this most recent
time, but his -- 2012?

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:43.710
In 2012 he was on a talk show
and invoked this quotation.

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.380
Didn't Jefferson say that
he liked to smoke hemp?

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.520
And as an example of, okay,
third president and one

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.830
of the founding fathers and
author of the "Declaration

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:54.510
of Independence" smoked hemp.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.520 position:56%
Then it's good enough for us, right?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.200
So there is an agenda behind
that, and it's one of these quotes

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.080
that you just find on
Twitter all the time.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.340
There is no, no attempt to knock
it down or to say, "This is bogus."

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.980
But it is quite clearly.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.060
And there are many others.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:19.240
I mean great men and women are
often -- who are deceased are --

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.050
Great quotes are put
in to their mouths

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.810
and they never ever
said these things.

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:27.930
And Einstein, Benjamin
Franklin, you know, you name it,

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.380
George Washington, there are
lots of phony quotes attributed

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.090
to these famous people of the past.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.130
And that's one way these famous
quotes or these bogus quotes live

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:39.190
on by attachment to famous people.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:43.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: One case with
Washington is something

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:48.200
from a newspaper in the '30s
that quoted [inaudible] and then

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.140
in the next sentence
editorializing about gun rights,

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.170 position:56%
but those two sentences [inaudible].

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.120
&gt;&gt; Joseph Campbell: They
get mashed together,

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.500
and then lesser known
people who made a comment,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:04.050
it sort of gets transferred
to the likes of Lincoln

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.780
or Jefferson or Einstein.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.400
I mean they're out there.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.850
There are people who like,
you know, follow this stuff.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:15.760
And one of the best debunking sites
that I know and I encourage you

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.200
to check out is called
Quote Investigator.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.960
And he does a fine job of
debunking bogus quotations.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.800
And he has a presence on Twitter.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.380
It's social media, and it's
refreshing to see that kind

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:32.940
of debunking done of
bogus spurious quotes.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: [Inaudible] bring this
discussion to an end unfortunately,

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:40.070
but let's thank Joe one more time.
