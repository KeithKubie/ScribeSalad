00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.620
Divide x squared minus 3x
plus 2 divided by x minus 2.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.580
So we're going to
divide this into that.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.880
And we can do this really
the same way that you first

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.796
learned long division.

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:13.930
So we have x minus
2 being divided

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.625
into x squared minus 3x plus 2.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:19.000
Another way we
could have written

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.250
the same exact expression is
x squared minus 3x plus 2,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.520
all of that over x minus 2.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.710
That, that, and that are
all equivalent expressions.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.549
Now, to do this type
of long division--

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.300
we can call it algebraic
long division--

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
you want to look at the highest
degree term on the x minus 2

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.890
and the highest degree term on
the x squared minus 3x plus 2.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.250
And here's the x, and
here's the x squared.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.590
x goes into x squared
how many times?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.160
Or x squared divided
by x is what?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.270
Well, that's just equal to x.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.254
So x goes into x
squared x times.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:53.170
And I'm going to write
it in this column right

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.870
here above all of the x terms.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
And then we want to
multiply x times x minus 2.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.770
That gives us-- x
times x is x squared.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.770
x times negative
2 is negative 2x.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.470
And just like you first
learned in long division,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.970
you want to subtract
this from that.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.970
But that's completely the
same as adding the opposite,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.670
or multiplying each of
these terms by negative 1

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.570
and then adding.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.370
So let's multiply
that times negative 1.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.670
And negative 2x times
negative 1 is positive 2x.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.870
And now let's add.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.270
x squared minus x
squared-- those cancel out.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.870
Negative 3x plus 2x--
that is negative x.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.970
And then we can bring
down this 2 over here.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.770
So it's negative x plus 2 left
over, when we only go x times.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
So then we say, can x minus
2 go into negative x plus 2?

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.520
Well, x goes into negative
x negative one times.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.770
You can look at it right here.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.470
Negative x divided
by x is negative 1.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.270
These guys cancel out.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.370
Those guys cancel out.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
So negative 1 times x minus
2-- you have negative 1

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.470
times x, which is negative x.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.970
Negative 1 times
negative 2 is positive 2.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.970
And we want to subtract
this from that,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.770
just like you do
in long division.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.770
But that's the same thing
as adding the opposite,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.104
or multiplying each of
these terms by negative 1

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:14.770
and then adding.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.970
So negative x times
negative 1 is positive x.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.770
Positive 2 times
negative 1 is negative 2.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.170
These guys cancel
out, add up to 0.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.370
These guys add up to 0.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.770
We have no remainder.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.270
So we got this as being
equal to x minus 1.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.470
And we can verify it.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.170
If we multiply x minus 1 times
x minus 2, we should get this.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.670
So let's actually do that.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.670
So let's multiply x
minus 1 times x minus 2.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.670
So let's multiply negative
2 times negative 1.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.770
That gives us positive 2.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.370
Negative 2 times x--
that's negative 2x.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.070
Let's multiply x
times negative 1.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.170
That is negative x.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.070
And then x times x is x squared.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.870
And then add all the like terms.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.370
x squared, negative 2x minus
x-- that's negative 3x.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.670
And then 2 plus
nothing is just 2.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.400
And so we got that
polynomial again.
