the tumor cells so the kind of cancer
 

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.430
the tumor cells so the kind of cancer
doesn't make any difference it's

00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440
doesn't make any difference it's
 

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.590
doesn't make any difference it's
make any difference because you know all

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600
make any difference because you know all
 

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.990
make any difference because you know all
tumors have neo antigens and that really

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000
tumors have neo antigens and that really
 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.550
tumors have neo antigens and that really
doesn't matter what kind of cancer say

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560
doesn't matter what kind of cancer say
 

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.350
doesn't matter what kind of cancer say
we don't have to make a new drug for

since it started by cross priming you
 

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.310
since it started by cross priming you
can take advantage of that priming by

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320
can take advantage of that priming by
 

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.010
can take advantage of that priming by

of the immune therapy as well and so

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800
of the immune therapy as well and so
 

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.400
of the immune therapy as well and so
there we go sorry and so the idea of

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.410
there we go sorry and so the idea of
 

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.710
there we go sorry and so the idea of
course is wonderful idea but does it

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720
course is wonderful idea but does it
 

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.360
course is wonderful idea but does it
work and so this just shows one of the

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.370
work and so this just shows one of the
 

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.660
work and so this just shows one of the
first experiments we did we've got you

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:48.670
first experiments we did we've got you
 

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.760
first experiments we did we've got you

metastatic melanoma was 11 months so it

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:27.670
metastatic melanoma was 11 months so it
 

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.100
metastatic melanoma was 11 months so it
was essentially a death sentence and

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.210
here very interesting thing happens
between two and three years it's a

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.220
between two and three years it's a
 

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.700
between two and three years it's a
survival curve flattens out and stayed

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:08.710
survival curve flattens out and stayed
 

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.320
survival curve flattens out and stayed
that way for the duration of the trial

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.330
that way for the duration of the trial
 

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.350
that way for the duration of the trial
which means basically nobody is dying of

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360
which means basically nobody is dying of
 

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.510
which means basically nobody is dying of
the disease after about three years and

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:15.520
the disease after about three years and
 

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.410
the disease after about three years and
so at by 2015 there was follow-up data

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:19.420
so at by 2015 there was follow-up data
 

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.720
so at by 2015 there was follow-up data
of several thousand patients what you

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:21.730
of several thousand patients what you
 

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.640
of several thousand patients what you
can see here is it's the same at three

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:23.650
can see here is it's the same at three
 

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.590
can see here is it's the same at three
years and kind of flattens out stays

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600
years and kind of flattens out stays
 

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.440
years and kind of flattens out stays
that way for ten years and about twenty

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:28.450
that way for ten years and about twenty
 

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.700
that way for ten years and about twenty
a little over twenty percent of the

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:29.710
a little over twenty percent of the
 

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.860
a little over twenty percent of the
patients so I think for all intents and

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:31.870
patients so I think for all intents and
 

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.140
patients so I think for all intents and
purposes for this disease people that

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.150
purposes for this disease people that
 

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.820
purposes for this disease people that
make it past four years I really think

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:35.830
make it past four years I really think
 

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.010
make it past four years I really think
you can consider them to be cured and

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.020
you can consider them to be cured and
 

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.420
you can consider them to be cured and
they don't have to worry about you know

they don't have to worry about you know
 

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.490
they don't have to worry about you know
what's going to go on I wouldn't say

a hundred percent you know why isn't
 

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.620
a hundred percent you know why isn't
just a fraction there's a number of

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:52.630
just a fraction there's a number of
 

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.270
just a fraction there's a number of
mechanistic reasons why that might be

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.280
mechanistic reasons why that might be
 

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.240
mechanistic reasons why that might be
true but of course there's another

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.250
true but of course there's another
 

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.440
true but of course there's another
possibility that there were other

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.450
possibility that there were other
 

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.900
possibility that there were other
checkpoints and and dr. hangzhou had

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:00.910
checkpoints and and dr. hangzhou had
 

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.060
checkpoints and and dr. hangzhou had
discovered a molecule called pd one and

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.070
discovered a molecule called pd one and
 

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.850
discovered a molecule called pd one and
by about 2001 it was shell there was

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:05.860
by about 2001 it was shell there was
 

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.550
by about 2001 it was shell there was
another checkpoint actually and it

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560
another checkpoint actually and it
 

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.310
another checkpoint actually and it
differs in a couple of important ways

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320
differs in a couple of important ways
 

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.250
differs in a couple of important ways
one of them is that one of its ligands

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:14.260
one of them is that one of its ligands
 

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.320
one of them is that one of its ligands
could actually be expressed on the

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.330
could actually be expressed on the
 

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.990
could actually be expressed on the
surface of tumor cells an induced by

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000
surface of tumor cells an induced by

gamma interferon made by the cd8 cell
 

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.000
gamma interferon made by the cd8 cell
what that means is they

that is and you know way around it so

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.190
that is and you know way around it so

together so this is a trial when if

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.080

right now when you combine those two

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.070
right now when you combine those two
 

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.430

functionally different checkpoints and

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440

the last time I checked the survival is

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:54.840
the last time I checked the survival is
 

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.540
the last time I checked the survival is
out to about four years on these

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:56.550
out to about four years on these
 

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.310
out to about four years on these
patients so we're getting close to the

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320
patients so we're getting close to the
 

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.500
patients so we're getting close to the
point of knowing whether this is going

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.510
point of knowing whether this is going
 

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.510
point of knowing whether this is going

to be as durable as if you do them
abalone and there's no reason to think

abalone and there's no reason to think
 

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.470
abalone and there's no reason to think
that it won't be and so I think we've

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480
that it won't be and so I think we've
 

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.970
that it won't be and so I think we've
gone hears of this remarkably from a

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:09.980
gone hears of this remarkably from a
 

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.120
gone hears of this remarkably from a

able to get meaningful responses the

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079
able to get meaningful responses the
 

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.310
able to get meaningful responses the
last perhaps for decades as well with

so that's the best response thing and a
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.569
so that's the best response thing and a
lot of people say well this is just a

and so for the rest of the talk I want

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320
and so for the rest of the talk I want
 

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.990
and so for the rest of the talk I want
to really talk about the differences

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000
to really talk about the differences
 

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.639
to really talk about the differences
between these two there's a tendency to

00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:18.649
between these two there's a tendency to
 

00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:20.289
between these two there's a tendency to
say you know we've got two checkpoints

00:24:20.289 --> 00:24:20.299
say you know we've got two checkpoints
 

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:22.120
say you know we've got two checkpoints
and one of the things that people

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.130
and one of the things that people
 

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.100
and one of the things that people
figured out right away is that is that

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.110
figured out right away is that is that
 

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.580
figured out right away is that is that
PT 1 has fewer adverse events then and

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:27.590
PT 1 has fewer adverse events then and
 

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.340
PT 1 has fewer adverse events then and
seek late for blockade and so let's just

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:30.350
seek late for blockade and so let's just
 

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.720
seek late for blockade and so let's just
use PT 1 but point I want to make here

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:34.730
use PT 1 but point I want to make here
 

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.940
use PT 1 but point I want to make here
is that these are very different drugs

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:36.950
is that these are very different drugs
 

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.519
is that these are very different drugs
it's not just that they're but

it's not just that they're but
 

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:41.139
it's not just that they're but
checkpoints and you don't have to think

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:41.149

00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:43.000

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100
because we mix everything and analyze it
 

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.010

group things by a tizzy plot called by

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:27.870
group things by a tizzy plot called by
 

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.110
group things by a tizzy plot called by
just putting things which look more like

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120
just putting things which look more like
 

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.900
just putting things which look more like
the cells in the grouping here and then

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:32.910
the cells in the grouping here and then
 

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.490
the cells in the grouping here and then
we can identify what those are by

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500
we can identify what those are by
 

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.000
we can identify what those are by
different markers and then we measure

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.010
different markers and then we measure
 

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.430
different markers and then we measure
different clusters of the frequency of

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440
different clusters of the frequency of
 

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.630
different clusters of the frequency of
the cells in different clusters and then

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640
the cells in different clusters and then
 

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.060
the cells in different clusters and then
we keep track for every mouse that we

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:47.070
we keep track for every mouse that we
 

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.920
we keep track for every mouse that we
look at we keep track of the size of the

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:48.930
look at we keep track of the size of the
 

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.170
look at we keep track of the size of the
tumor when it was harvested and then we

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:51.180
tumor when it was harvested and then we
 

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.900
tumor when it was harvested and then we
can relate any particular changes that

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:53.910
can relate any particular changes that
 

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.170
can relate any particular changes that
we see with the ones that the changes

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:57.180
we see with the ones that the changes
 

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.710
we see with the ones that the changes
that are important to the size of the

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720
that are important to the size of the
 

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.080
that are important to the size of the
tumor and so the way that experiments

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.090
tumor and so the way that experiments
 

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.830
tumor and so the way that experiments
done is that we give mice to MERS give

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840
done is that we give mice to MERS give
 

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.870
done is that we give mice to MERS give
AM antibody different intervals and then

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:40.490
late for treatment if you look at the
 

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.340
late for treatment if you look at the
cd4 effector cells there's there's

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:42.350
cd4 effector cells there's there's
 

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.160
cd4 effector cells there's there's
really two major populations there's

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.170
really two major populations there's
 

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.930
really two major populations there's
these cells that I'm going to talk a lot

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:46.940
these cells that I'm going to talk a lot
 

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.340
these cells that I'm going to talk a lot
about these cells for the rest of the

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:48.350
about these cells for the rest of the
 

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.150
about these cells for the rest of the
lecture

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:49.160
lecture
 

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.280
lecture
these cells are th one like would call

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:51.290
these cells are th one like would call
 

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.860
these cells are th one like would call
them teach one like because they have T

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:53.870
them teach one like because they have T
 

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.020
them teach one like because they have T
bet and so they make a lot of get'em

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.030
bet and so they make a lot of get'em
 

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.840
bet and so they make a lot of get'em
interferon and TNF alpha but they also

00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:58.850
interferon and TNF alpha but they also
 

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.140
interferon and TNF alpha but they also
have AI costs which is makes them a

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:02.150
have AI costs which is makes them a
 

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.390
have AI costs which is makes them a
little bit strange and I'll come back to

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:04.400
little bit strange and I'll come back to
 

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.820
little bit strange and I'll come back to
what this is a little bit later but

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:06.830
what this is a little bit later but
 

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.840
what this is a little bit later but
those cells are very strongly associated

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:10.850
those cells are very strongly associated
 

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:16.210
those cells are very strongly associated
with decrease in tumor size whereas this

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.220
with decrease in tumor size whereas this
 

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.400
with decrease in tumor size whereas this
other population which do it just looks

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.410
other population which do it just looks
 

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.490
other population which do it just looks
like an uninvited T so don't really do

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:21.500
like an uninvited T so don't really do
 

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.090
like an uninvited T so don't really do
anything

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.100
anything
 

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.130
anything
and then I activate a cd4 they don't

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.140
and then I activate a cd4 they don't
 

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.490
and then I activate a cd4 they don't
really do anything with PT one what you

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:27.500
really do anything with PT one what you
 

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.670
really do anything with PT one what you
see is a preference for preferential

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:30.680
see is a preference for preferential
 

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.970
see is a preference for preferential
increase in a subset of cd8 cells that

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:33.980
increase in a subset of cd8 cells that
 

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.240
increase in a subset of cd8 cells that
have high PD one hi Tim three you're

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:37.250
have high PD one hi Tim three you're
 

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.529
have high PD one hi Tim three you're
also high lag three

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539
also high lag three
 

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:41.389
also high lag three
so these are what we call exhausted

00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399
so these are what we call exhausted
 

00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:43.159
so these are what we call exhausted
they're terminally differentiated but

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:43.169
they're terminally differentiated but
 

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:45.440
they're terminally differentiated but
they're also functionally exhausted they

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.450
they're also functionally exhausted they
 

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.049
they're also functionally exhausted they
do not divide left themselves but

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059
do not divide left themselves but
 

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:50.239
do not divide left themselves but
they're dividing here when you give a

00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:50.249
they're dividing here when you give a
 

00:32:50.249 --> 00:32:53.659
they're dividing here when you give a
tacitly and a PD one they start dividing

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:53.669
tacitly and a PD one they start dividing
 

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:55.909
tacitly and a PD one they start dividing
and these are also very strongly

00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919
and these are also very strongly
 

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:59.180
and these are also very strongly
associated with smaller tumor size but

00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.190
associated with smaller tumor size but
 

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.659
associated with smaller tumor size but
what is obvious from from these data is

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:02.669
what is obvious from from these data is
 

00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:04.519
what is obvious from from these data is
that despite the fact that they've been

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:04.529
that despite the fact that they've been
 

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:06.169
that despite the fact that they've been
treated with data PD one antibody

00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179
treated with data PD one antibody
 

00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:08.719
treated with data PD one antibody
they're still expressing PD one so if

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:08.729
they're still expressing PD one so if
 

00:33:08.729 --> 00:33:10.460
they're still expressing PD one so if
the antibody goes away these cells are

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:10.470
the antibody goes away these cells are
 

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.560
the antibody goes away these cells are
going to stop dividing again we haven't

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:12.570
going to stop dividing again we haven't
 

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:15.529
going to stop dividing again we haven't
changed the phenotype at all and this is

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539
changed the phenotype at all and this is
 

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:17.509
changed the phenotype at all and this is
also supported by some work from John

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519
also supported by some work from John
 

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:20.450
also supported by some work from John
weary who's shown there's epigenetic

on in these cells you can't do anything

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:24.869
on in these cells you can't do anything
 

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:28.430
on in these cells you can't do anything
about that and those are not increased

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440
about that and those are not increased
 

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.919
about that and those are not increased
significantly by ctla-4 treatment then

00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:30.929
significantly by ctla-4 treatment then
 

00:33:30.929 --> 00:33:34.399
significantly by ctla-4 treatment then
there are cells here that are pd-1

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:34.409
there are cells here that are pd-1
 

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:38.989
there are cells here that are pd-1
intermediate they also are terminally

00:33:38.989 --> 00:33:38.999
intermediate they also are terminally
 

00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:41.359
intermediate they also are terminally
differentiated and that they express the

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:41.369
differentiated and that they express the
 

00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:43.909
differentiated and that they express the
openings at civil other markers but

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919
openings at civil other markers but
 

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:46.339
openings at civil other markers but
they're they're not exhausted and you

00:33:46.339 --> 00:33:46.349
they're they're not exhausted and you
 

00:33:46.349 --> 00:33:48.349
they're they're not exhausted and you
can see these are expanded by both seats

00:33:48.349 --> 00:33:48.359
can see these are expanded by both seats
 

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.930
can see these are expanded by both seats
like four and pd1 those also are

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940
like four and pd1 those also are
 

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.759
like four and pd1 those also are
strongly associated with decrease in

00:33:52.759 --> 00:33:52.769
strongly associated with decrease in
 

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:55.599
strongly associated with decrease in
tumor size and then there's these cells

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:55.609
tumor size and then there's these cells
 

00:33:55.609 --> 00:33:58.789
tumor size and then there's these cells
which look like naive t-cells again and

00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799
which look like naive t-cells again and
 

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.399
which look like naive t-cells again and
these cells which are they're expanded

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:01.409
these cells which are they're expanded
 

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:03.769
these cells which are they're expanded
by seats like four as well then these

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779
by seats like four as well then these
 

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:05.749
by seats like four as well then these
cells which look like recently activated

00:34:05.749 --> 00:34:05.759
cells which look like recently activated
 

00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:08.139
cells which look like recently activated
t-cells and and they're actually

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:08.149
t-cells and and they're actually
 

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:11.599
t-cells and and they're actually
associated with bigger tumor size so

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:11.609
associated with bigger tumor size so
 

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:12.740
associated with bigger tumor size so
these are getting in the way of the

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:12.750
these are getting in the way of the
 

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.869
these are getting in the way of the
responses so we've really got three

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879
responses so we've really got three
 

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:18.950
responses so we've really got three
populations one cd4 which expanded just

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960
populations one cd4 which expanded just
 

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.520
populations one cd4 which expanded just
by seats left for one cd8 which is

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:22.530
by seats left for one cd8 which is
 

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.470
by seats left for one cd8 which is
expanded just by PD one and then this

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480
expanded just by PD one and then this
 

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.020
expanded just by PD one and then this
group which expanded by both that

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:27.030
group which expanded by both that
 

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.730
group which expanded by both that
associated that if those are the cells

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740
associated that if those are the cells
 

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.990
associated that if those are the cells
that are playing the main role in

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000
that are playing the main role in
 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.010
that are playing the main role in
shrinkage of tumor cells and so this

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020
shrinkage of tumor cells and so this
 

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.409
shrinkage of tumor cells and so this
just sort of summarizes that the

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419
just sort of summarizes that the
 

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:41.869
just sort of summarizes that the
mechanist is very you know are different

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879
mechanist is very you know are different
 

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.869
mechanist is very you know are different
and that may be why when you put these

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879
and that may be why when you put these
 

00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:45.889
and that may be why when you put these
two things together

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899
two things together
 

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:47.869
two things together
everything works it works much better

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879
everything works it works much better
 

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:50.470
everything works it works much better
we're working on that now and have some

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480
we're working on that now and have some
 

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.040
we're working on that now and have some
data in review but measuring these

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.050
data in review but measuring these
 

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.960
data in review but measuring these
subtypes is a lot more informative than

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:55.970
subtypes is a lot more informative than
 

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.260
subtypes is a lot more informative than
just measuring total cd4 and cd8 it's a

00:34:59.260 --> 00:34:59.270
just measuring total cd4 and cd8 it's a
 

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.740
just measuring total cd4 and cd8 it's a
telling who's going to respond and the

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:02.750
telling who's going to respond and the
 

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.290
telling who's going to respond and the
other thing is that the therapeutic

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:04.300
other thing is that the therapeutic
 

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.970
other thing is that the therapeutic
details didn't really matter in this

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:06.980
details didn't really matter in this
 

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.160
details didn't really matter in this
experiment and so does this happen in

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.170
experiment and so does this happen in
 

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.140
experiment and so does this happen in
humans well this is not obviously as

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:11.150
humans well this is not obviously as
 

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.849
humans well this is not obviously as
easy to do as it is it - we could only

00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:12.859
easy to do as it is it - we could only
 

00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:16.569
easy to do as it is it - we could only
find because the standard of care now is

00:35:16.569 --> 00:35:16.579
find because the standard of care now is
 

00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:20.500
find because the standard of care now is
both antibodies we can only find one

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:20.510
both antibodies we can only find one
 

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.630
both antibodies we can only find one
patient that was treated with just at a

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640
patient that was treated with just at a
 

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.280
patient that was treated with just at a
PD Watt and a few that were treated just

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:24.290
PD Watt and a few that were treated just
 

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.260
PD Watt and a few that were treated just
with and a fantasy too late for and only

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:29.270
with and a fantasy too late for and only
 

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.170
with and a fantasy too late for and only
a small group that were been treated

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:32.180
a small group that were been treated
 

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.710
a small group that were been treated
with and a PD wand and so this just

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720
with and a PD wand and so this just
 

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.450
with and a PD wand and so this just
shows the same roof and the point is
