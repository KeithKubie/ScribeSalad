00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.104
Today... today is
Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:05.806
I don't think
I could say anything

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.075
that would live up to his legacy
in any way.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.644
But he was courageous and
uncompromising, and I think,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.879
above all,
he believed in justice,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.147
and I believe
we should all strive for that.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.983
And if you haven't read
his words or watch him speak,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.451
do yourself a favor
and do that today.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.286
They're as powerful
as they ever were.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.721
Tributes have been all over
social media,

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.257
like this tweet honoring King
and his, quote,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.025
"incredible career
fighting for civil rights,"

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.561
using an excerpt from King's
letter from a Birmingham jail,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.829
which reads,

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.298
"Injustice anywhere is a threat
to justice everywhere."

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.300
That's a wonderful quote.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.302
I wonder who tweeted that.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.237
-Oh, it was the FBI. The FBI.
-(laughter)

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:41.542
-This is the same FBI who
spent... -(applause &amp; cheering)

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.777
Hang on.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.180
Same FBI who spent years

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.015
spying on him
and blackmailing MLK

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.383
'cause their director and

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.785
constipated bullfrog in a
miniskirt J. Edgar Hoover...

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.353
(laughter)

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.190
...called King, quote, "The most
notorious liar in the country."

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.725
The only thing that would be
crazier-- if Mel Gibson tweeted,

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:02.863
-"Happy Hanukkah, sugar tits."
-(laughter)

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.565
-(applause and cheering)
-So, comedians...

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:08.836
in light of this MLK tweet
from the FBI,

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.306
what's another surprise reversal
tweet the FBI might send out?

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.208
John Hodgman.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.345
"Hey, Anthony Weiner--
cool dong, dude."

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:22.115
(laughter, applause)

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.422
-Points. Cool dong.
-It's a pretty cool dong.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.625
-Dude... tweeted...
-Chris.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.794
Not just "cool dong."
Just, "Cool dong, dude."

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.963
-Dude.
-(laughter) -Eugene Mirman.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.031
Hey, Vladimir Putin,
where do you want us

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.168
-to drop off your laundry?"
-HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.637
-(laughter, applause)
-Josie Long.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.607
Just, "Hey, Stanley Kubrick,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.343
you did such a great job
faking the moon landings."

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:52.513
And then, hashtag, "Jet fuel can
melt steel beams." That's all.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:52.613
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
All right. All right. Points.
