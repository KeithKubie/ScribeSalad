(upbeat music)

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.840
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.860
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.100
with the Institute of
International Studies.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.720
Our guest today is V.S. Ramachandran

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:59.040
who is Director of the Center
for Brain and Cognition

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.160
and Distinguished Professor
with the Psychology Department

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.020
and Neurosciences Program

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.460
at the University of California San Diego.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.400
He's also Adjunct Professor of Biology

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.290
at the Salk Institute.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.843
He is the 2016 Foerster Lecturer

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:21.843
on the immortality of
the soul at UC Berkeley.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.520
Welcome to our program, Doctor.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.380
- Thank you, Harry, I'm
delighted to be here.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.500
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.610
- I was born in Chennai in India,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.640
and early schooling was in Chennai.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
But then I also spent part of
my time in Bangkok, Thailand

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.900
where my father was a diplomat.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.770
- And looking back, how did your parents

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.510
shape your thinking about the world?

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.210
- My father was a bit aloof, by and large,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060
a man of the world, and
always wanted to push me

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.720
into medicine and do well in life.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.904
Mother was more idealistic and religious,

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.030
steeped in Indian mythology and tradition.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.770
So I had these two different
influences on my life.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.430
My mother was more academically inclined.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.580
- And who pushed you into sciences,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.790
or was that just something
you embraced on your own?

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.150
- I embraced on my own, but partly,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.770
I had very good teachers in school.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.510
I went to a British school.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.615
- In India now?

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:15.448
- In Thailand.

00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:16.281
- In Thailand, yeah.

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.790
- My father worked for
the United Nations there.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.810
And I had a teacher named Mrs. Vaneet,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.980
Mrs. Panatura there,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.940
who demonstrate chemistry
experiments in the lab,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.980
give us chemicals to take to our homes,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.440
experiment with, something
that would never happen

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.644
in this day and age because
of liability issues.

00:02:32.644 --> 00:02:34.987
I remember Mrs. Panatura showing us

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:37.070
if you take a piece
of, if you take a nail,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.470
an iron nail, put it in copper
sulfate, a blue solution,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.850
the iron became copper.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.683
This is like magic.

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:47.120
You have a blue solution, you
can't see anything red in it,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.490
you put an iron nail in
it and it becomes red,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.820
it becomes copper, how is this possible?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.890
And that's how we got
started on chemistry.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.712
- And what was it about
science at that early age

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:58.940
that attracted you?

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.910
Besides the good teachers, obviously.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.950
- I think the idea that it's,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.840
in a funny way, the
idea that it's divorced

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.250
from the real world,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.860
that you have this microcosm
where you're on your own,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.200
and you do your experiments
with a few kindred spirits.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.730
I felt isolated from other kids.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.110
I was not very much into sports.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.620
There was one other kid
named Samtao Sujeritco,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.970
Cookie, this classmate of mine.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.463
He and I would sneak off and
do experiments in the basement.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.039
- And there must, from what
you said about your mother,

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.890
there must be an influence there

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.300
in sort of seeing things
that are latent basically

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.460
because you see the experiment,
you see what happens,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.150
but to understand it, you have
to come to understand laws

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.930
that aren't visible in a way.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.210
- Now I won't say it's that specific,

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.320
more the general academic
slant in my mind,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.840
exploring natural phenomena,
making discoveries,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.010
that came from my mother,
the urge to do that,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.027
but the specific strategy
of doing experiments,

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:01.040
and the excitement of doing experiments

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.000
came from my school
teachers primarily I think.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.860
I like to think it's party
also innate, but who knows.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.410
- And you wound up doing
experiments on your own

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.300
as a young person?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.210
- Yeah but always in
consultation with my teachers,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.430
and I'd do it at home, go
tell my teachers about it,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.260
they'd get excited about it,
they'd tell other students,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.980
very, very iterative process, those days.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.170
- And what was it like
growing up in Thailand?

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.640
Did you experience that
setting and that culture,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.303
or were you isolated?

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.460
- I was more or less isolated.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.470
I went to this school called
the Bangkok British School,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.140
or Patana School, and the
teachers were excellent,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.933
that made a huge, big difference.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.530
Very inspiring and inspired teachers.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.120
- And so when you went on to college,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.320
where did you go to college,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.719
and was it inevitable that
you would do the sciences?

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.330
- Well, yeah, I decided very early on

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790
I'm gonna go do science.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.410
And I decided on a career in medicine.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.110
My father was insistent
that I take medicine

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.150
rather than science.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.750
- He was worried about
you making a living.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.920
- Right, especially in India in that time.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.277
It'd be very difficult to make a career

00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:14.210
out of pure science, so,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.610
and my mother encouraged me to do science.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.120
I was conflicted.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.311
And then one of my
uncles, one of my aunts,

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.100
one of my cousins is a
distinguished physician.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.940
And she told me you can
get the best of both worlds

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.700
by doing medicine because
you can have one foot

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.807
in academic science, academic medicine,

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:32.640
and one foot in medical practice.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.970
If you ever fail as a scientist,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.733
you can always be a good doctor.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.060
- And so what, in the early years,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.870
what sub-fields in science attracted you?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.870
- I would say mostly chemistry
very early on was exciting.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.300
Just the big bang and
the colorful displays,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.260
to put it crudely,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.460
but also just the notion

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.700
that from a few elementary interactions,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.350
a whole spectrum of
phenomena in the universe

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.730
is derived from the
elementary interactions.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.990
The periodic table and
things of that nature.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.120
So that excited me in chemistry.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.880
Biology was interesting
because of its complexity.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.880
So I was always interested
in evolution and fossils

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.140
and dinosaurs as most kids are,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.330
had an interest in archeology.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.163
If you think about these things,

00:06:17.163 --> 00:06:21.860
archeology, chemistry,
paleontology, evolution,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.050
most kids are interested in this,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.550
and they lose interest very quickly.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.490
I don't know why, I just
happened to retain this interest,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.850
and if I weren't doing neurology,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.824
I would be doing probably archeology,

00:06:33.824 --> 00:06:37.400
or evolutionary biology,
developmental biology.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.390
- And we'll talk about this later,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.306
but evolution is something
still in the back of your mind

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:49.306
as you look for the origins
of phenomena in the brain.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.230
- Absolutely.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.134
- Now what about medicine?

00:06:53.134 --> 00:06:57.080
One thing that must have
really made a difference

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.540
in your life in medicine
was the clinical experience.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.350
- Absolutely, yeah, fascinating.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.183
- Yeah.

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:09.183
- And a bit like Conan Doyle
being inspired by his teacher

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.523
to write Sherlock Holmes novels.

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:15.100
Pardon the lofty comparison,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.520
but what I meant to say is that

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.730
when you're doing medicine,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.440
often you have little clues
you have to latch onto.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.510
In those days, we don't
have CT, we don't have MR,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.400
we don't have fancy diagnostic
tools, so very often,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.200
very quickly you had to arrive

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.033
at what we call a spot diagnosis

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.943
based on few simple clues
you see in the patient.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.380
- And also talking to
the patient is important.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.240
- Exactly, one of the first things

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.880
every medical student is taught

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.280
is that 90% of the time
we arrive at the diagnosis

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.240
from the history.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.930
You don't need to do any testing.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.200
Then the physical exam
will clinch the diagnosis.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.370
You don't need to do any
lab tests most of the time.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.430
This is no longer practice of course.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.893
We don't need to in a sense.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.020
But that gives you,
emphasizes the detective,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.973
like the Sherlock Holmes
aspect of medicine.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.073
- And you also obtained a PhD?

00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:05.400
- Yeah, from India, I went
to Cambridge, England,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.452
obtained a PhD in visual neuroscience,

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:09.290
visual perception.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.410
- And so you lay the groundwork

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.210
for what would later become
your study of the brain,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.960
and vision was, the study
of perception and vision,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.630
was an important stepping stone

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.784
to the way you would
think about the brain.

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.180
- That's a very accurate description.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.440
When I was in India,
fascinated by neurology,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.840
but not much research I
could do at that time.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.000
And I finally could do
experiments in vision

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.330
using very simple equipment

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.460
which was available at that time,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.890
and what I specialize in is
studying visual illusions.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.970
We look at the world, it's all out there,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.410
and we think, we take it for granted.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.300
You open your eyes in
the morning and viola,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.540
so a lot of that, you take it for granted.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.220
But in fact if you think about it,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.943
there's two little distorted
image in your eyeball,

00:08:54.943 --> 00:08:58.210
what you see is a three
dimensional world out there.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.643
How does this transformation come about?

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.170
It's taking place in all the
visual areas in your brain.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.150
So brain is using a code,
creating a symbolic description

00:09:08.324 --> 00:09:10.250
of objects and events in the world,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.510
and we're like cryptographers

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.210
trying to crack these alien code,

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.520
that's what the study of vision is.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.243
So an illusion is an anomaly,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.220
gives you a golden key,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.220
to understanding normal visual function.

00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:28.717
- You actually quote in your book,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.500
beginning of one of the chapters,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.660
you quote Sherlock Holmes,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.147
and you say, where Holmes says,

00:09:37.147 --> 00:09:40.867
"I know, my dear Watson,
that you share my love

00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:44.839
"of all that is bizarre
and outside the conventions

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:47.780
"and humdrum routine of everyday life."

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.720
So that's another element,
- Yeah.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.960
- That came into your thinking.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.500
Hallucinations and then
the bizarre in a way.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.340
- Yeah, I mean I don't know
if it's healthy or not,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.550
and I don't know how much
it's helped my research,

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.240
but I like to think it has.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.063
I go after anomalies, things
which seem like oddities,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.600
which people have ignored for a long time.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.000
And neurology is full of
oddities and anomalies.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.969
There are syndromes
which nobody has studied

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:15.980
that have been around for a hundred years,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.342
and I've made a career out of this,

00:10:18.342 --> 00:10:21.150
going to the clinic, bringing the patient

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.840
from the clinic to the laboratory,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.790
studying them intensively,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.480
finding out what's wrong with them,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.330
and then sometimes devising a therapy.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.446
We did this with synesthesia,

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:32.220
with not a patient but an
otherwise normal person,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.310
every time he sees a number,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.950
he sees a particular color.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.860
We did it with phantom limbs.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.350
Of course the strategy
doesn't always work.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.310
You only hear the success stories.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.770
Nine out of 10 times, we fail,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.004
and it's just some cooky disorder,

00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:49.120
sometimes outright bogus,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.740
and I'll give you an example of this.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.963
The disorder called de
Clérambault syndrome,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.030
have you heard of this?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.863
- No, no.

00:10:56.863 --> 00:10:58.770
- This refers to, it's
officially recognized

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.952
by the psychology establishment,

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.240
it refers to a young woman
who develops a delusion

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.307
that this old, rich, famous
man is madly in love with her

00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:08.610
but is in denial about it.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.930
An actual named syndrome.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.200
Of course it's nonsense,
there's no such syndrome.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.700
Ironically there's no name
for the equivalent syndrome

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.790
where an older, famous, rich
gentleman holds the delusion

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.867
that this young hottie is in love with him

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:21.450
but in denial about it.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.850
This is much more common
and because syndromes

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.430
are described by male psychiatrists.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.731
- So this is the stuff of screenplays.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.200
- That's correct.
- But not neurology.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.560
- Not neurology, yeah.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.250
There's another one called
chronic underachievement syndrome

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.893
which we used to call stupidity.

00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:40.143
(laughing)

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.880
- In your book I think in the epilogue,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.997
you have a quote which I
wanna read now, you say,

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:50.397
"Neurology, we now are at the same stage

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:53.277
"that chemistry was in the 19th Century,

00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:55.267
"discovering the basic elements,

00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:56.977
"grouping them into categories,

00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:59.160
"and studying their interactions."

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.810
I raise that because one of the things

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.480
that come up in your
background in your early years

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.114
you were fascinated by
19th Century science.

00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:08.947
- Yeah.

00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:13.510
- And the simplicity of
the early experiments

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.180
when the fields were being established.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.970
Talk a little about that.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.850
- Yeah I mean all the famous
experiments in science

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.410
should be included in our
undergraduate curriculum I think

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.000
as a separate course.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.894
We're starting to do this at UCSD,

00:12:26.894 --> 00:12:28.030
and it should be done
at all the UC campuses,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.810
indeed all the universities.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.333
For example, take Faraday,

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:36.040
you know, you took a wire,
simply out of a hunch,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.213
took a coil and moved a rod, an iron rod,

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.440
to and fro in the coil, and
generated an electric current,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.960
thereby bridging two completely unrelated,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.070
seemingly unrelated fields of physics,

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.220
electricity and magnetism.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.290
It took him five minutes
to do the experiment.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.450
Another one of my favorite examples,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.540
Newton's prison experiment.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.630
I'm stating the obvious here,

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.560
everybody learns this in
school, but just to recap.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.350
Everybody thinks Newton passed white light

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.590
through a prism and discovered
it's made of seven colors.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.100
In fact that's not true.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.170
Known long before Newton,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.300
people were using
chandeliers for that reason.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.277
They knew white light would
be converted to colors.

00:13:10.277 --> 00:13:13.160
But people thought it was because
of impurities in the glass

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.150
and the prism was converting white light

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.070
into colored spectrum.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.680
Newton said it's not
impurities in the glass,

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.540
it's just white light is
made up of seven wavelengths.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.740
And so what they did was,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.490
the critics kept claiming that
it's impurities in the glass,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.590
the people who supported Newton

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.080
spent years and years, decades,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.290
polishing the glass,
removing the impurities,

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.230
and showing the colors were still there.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.390
This went on and on for years and years,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.980
no matter how pure the glass was,

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.840
the critics would claim there's
some impurities in there.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.070
Newton looked at this debate,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.240
and it took him five minutes
to disprove the opposition.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.010
All he did was he took the prism,

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.110
passed white light through it,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.240
it split into seven colors.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.690
Then you put another prism upside down.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.240
Now the impurities should
become even more colorful.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.550
In fact it turns back into white light.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.546
This is what he calls
the crucial experiment.

00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:03.730
In science, it doesn't work
if you just keep doing more

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.560
and more experiments to prove your point.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.360
What's important is you
do the crucial experiment

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.870
for the experiment at hand.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.390
So I was fascinated by the
simplicity of Newton's approach.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.390
And indeed hundreds of
Victorian scientists,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.223
not just Newton.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.160
- It's interesting because that embrace

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.460
of a 19th Century science combined with,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.630
you were working in India
and then in Thailand,

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.700
a place where low tech
was not only a virtue,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.385
but it was a necessity.

00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:35.380
- Yes.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.600
- Talk a little about that

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.280
because what I'm really
getting of sense of

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.680
is how these forces all
from your background

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.110
come together to shape where you wanna go.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.090
- Yes, I mean especially
in clinical medicine,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.660
the absence of technology, high
tech diagnostic techniques,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.730
we had to rely on
intuition, rely on logic,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.240
rely on simple observation of the patient

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.270
using a sort of Bayesian approach,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.057
and then come up with
a plausible diagnosis,

00:15:03.057 --> 00:15:06.690
and 90% of the time you have
your diagnosis right there,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.888
so the emphasis is on
simplicity and elegance

00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:12.833
of approaching a problem, rather than,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.150
it's concept driven,
not methodology driven,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.570
I've always believed that about science.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.870
You don't want to be a Luddite obviously,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.180
science is driven by technology,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.680
where would we be without
the microscope or telescope,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.340
it opened up whole worlds,

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.340
but the instrument should
not be the end in itself.

00:15:32.543 --> 00:15:37.161
- And so in a funny way,
all the technology now

00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:39.680
is for you a dessert, basically,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.190
because you really are starting out

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.774
at a very simple, conceptual level,

00:15:45.774 --> 00:15:48.460
interacting with the patient,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.724
and then maybe using
the machinery to confirm

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:53.163
or disconfirm.

00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:54.580
- That's absolutely right,
that's exactly the way

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.609
it should be done, not
a fishing expedition.

00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:02.421
Very often you adopt the
role of a five year old child

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.640
given a knife.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.180
A five year old child given a knife

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.840
just goes and cuts everything.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.023
That should not happen obviously.

00:16:11.055 --> 00:16:13.470
- I like to ask my guests

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.058
what they see as the
skills and temperament

00:16:18.058 --> 00:16:23.058
that students should
manifest or acquire or learn

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.499
so that they can do the work in your case

00:16:26.499 --> 00:16:29.140
of studying the brain.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.375
- Well I think studying
any area of science,

00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:35.040
to become a creative scientist
who enjoys what you do,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.570
it's important to hang around people

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.090
who are passionate about what they do,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.110
it seems like an obvious thing,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.850
but there's nothing more
contagious than passion,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.380
so that's the first thing.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.220
And then read widely outside your field,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.890
not just in your own narrow cul-de-sac

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.660
because often cross-fertilization of ideas

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.720
is what leads to major
discoveries in science.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.007
And I also notice, this
may be an odd thing to say,

00:16:58.007 --> 00:17:01.850
humor helps, and some
of my best experiments

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.810
came out of jokes, saying
this guy has a phantom limb,

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.080
what would happen if we put
a mirror in front of him,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.323
or what would happen if
you touched his face?

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.960
I can give you lots of examples.

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:18.039
- So there's a joking, but
also there's a playfulness.

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:19.285
- That's correct, that's correct.

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:20.190
- Yeah.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.060
- The playfulness is important

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.520
because in humor, humor involves
an unusual juxtaposition

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.950
of ideas, seeing things
from a novel vantage point.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.180
That's also the basis of
scientific creativity,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.430
so it may not be a coincidence
that one can often lead

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.263
to the other.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.300
- And in a way in humor,
implicit in humor,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.483
is a sense of the structure,

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:44.230
that is, how things
hold together in a way,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.100
and then making a humorous comment,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.220
and people may not see the structure,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.726
but they get the humor.

00:17:50.726 --> 00:17:51.559
- That's correct.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:56.430
- Yeah, and what about patience
as part of the temperament

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.110
because it must be the case in your work

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.110
that a lot of what you think
may be a useful concept

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.993
turns out to be a dead end.

00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:13.880
- Patience or patients? P-a-t-i,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.740
- Patience meaning,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.230
- Impatient versus patience.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.990
- Yeah, not being impatient.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.823
- Right.

00:18:20.823 --> 00:18:23.820
- Being able, and this must
go with the playfulness,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.870
to sort of hold things, look at them,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.800
go in a particular direction,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.410
but then find out it's not the right.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.170
- Know when to give up, too.
- Yeah.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.980
- As I mentioned, there
are these bogus syndromes.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.813
- Yeah.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.810
- And you can waste a whole lifetime

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.950
studying the bogus syndromes,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.200
so you have to have tenacity,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.035
but you also have to have good judgment,

00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:46.160
enough to realize this is a dead end,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.440
and patience is of course
a virtue in this case.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.450
- Now at one point in your book,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.797
you say something which
I found intriguing,

00:18:54.797 --> 00:18:55.630
you said,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.957
"If an elaborate theory cannot predict

00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:03.427
"what your grandmother
knows using common sense,

00:19:03.427 --> 00:19:05.410
"then it isn't worth much."

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:10.410
So the simplicity and elegance in method

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:16.450
also leads to a simplicity in stating

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.485
what you think is going on.

00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:23.710
- Yeah, I think the
grandmother example is twofold.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.940
First of all, you should be able

00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:27.993
to express your ideas clearly enough

00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:29.460
that your grandmother understands them.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.707
If I do an experiment on phantom limbs,

00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:33.030
I should be able to tell my grandmother

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.730
this is what we did, and
she should say, "Wow."

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.750
So if it doesn't excite or
surprise your grandmother,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.332
there's something wrong
with your experiment.

00:19:39.332 --> 00:19:40.165
It's not always true, of course,

00:19:40.165 --> 00:19:41.909
but it's rough rule of thumb,

00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:44.040
I think that's what I
was getting at there.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.610
- You keep mentioning the
phantom limb experiment,

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.870
tell us a little about that

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.950
because our audience might
not be familiar with it, yeah.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.630
- There are two experiments
we did, actually,

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.670
three experiments we did.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.990
One was when you amputate an arm or a leg,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.750
the patient continues to
vividly feel the presence

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.675
of that missing arm for
weeks, months, decades,

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:07.090
as long as 30 or 40 years,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.480
and often it's excruciatingly painful.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.580
Now one of the things we found was

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.400
if you touch the patient's
face on the ipsilateral side,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.400
so let's say I'm the
patient, left arm is missing,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.390
I take a Q-tip and touch
the left side of the face,

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.630
the patient feels the sensations

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.143
in his missing phantom arm.

00:20:21.982 --> 00:20:25.070
Phantom limbs have been
studied for over a century.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.990
People have discovered
there's a map of the hand,

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.240
a complete map of the hand on
the face of these patients,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.130
not all of them, but many of them.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.526
So here's a mystery fit
for Sherlock Holmes, right?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.730
Why would you touch somebody's face,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.660
and he feels their missing arm?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.570
And it turns out the
hand portion of the map,

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.530
the entire body surface

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.759
is mapped on the surface of the brain

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:47.730
on the contralateral
side in a vertical strip.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.340
It's a complete map of the body surface,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.924
including the hand, face, everything.

00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:54.300
And it's systematic map, point to point.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.920
It turns out that the map of the hand

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.270
is right next to the map
of the face in the brain.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.009
So when you remove the hand,

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:02.540
the hand area of the brain becomes hungry

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.410
for new sensory inputs, deprived of input,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.460
and it becomes hungry for new input,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.330
so the face input which is adjacent,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.300
invades the territory
corresponding to the missing hand

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.030
and activates the cells there,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.180
so there's a cross-wiring going on.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.890
So that part of the brain now signals,

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.570
even though you're touching the face,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.323
it misinterprets the signal as coming

00:21:19.323 --> 00:21:21.970
from the missing phantom hand.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.937
Therefore you say, my
hand is being touched.

00:21:24.937 --> 00:21:26.810
And this shows that the brain is capable

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.362
of considerable reorganization
even in an adult

00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:31.670
in a matter of a few days.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.850
- And when you started out,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.850
the notion of placidity
was not generally accepted,

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.730
and that is a major insight
that has come to neurology.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.660
- That's correct, the
notion of neural plasticity,

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.330
there was always a minority group

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.392
who thought it was important,

00:21:51.392 --> 00:21:52.880
but it was not widely accepted,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.580
and nobody had shown it
in an adult human brain

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.383
in a simple manner that
we had set out to do.

00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:02.227
The other experiment on
phantom limbs by the way,

00:22:02.227 --> 00:22:05.870
many people have an arm
that's fixed or immobilized,

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.380
they have a paralyzed phantom limb,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.903
sounds like an oxymoron, but they do,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.300
and it's frozen, and it's
often an excruciatingly painful

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.283
position like that.

00:22:15.184 --> 00:22:17.933
And I said what if you
get the guy to kind of,

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:20.650
volitionally open the hand
to make it less painful,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.220
and I tell the patient
this, and he laughs at me

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.347
and says, "I've been
trying that for years,

00:22:23.347 --> 00:22:26.647
"and it doesn't work, I
can't volitionally unclench

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:29.917
"my clenched phantom hand,

00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:32.640
"the nails are digging into
my palm, it's painful."

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.700
So I hit upon the idea of
putting a mirror there,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.960
so he could then clench his normal hand,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.180
look at the reflection of the
normal hand in the mirror,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.450
it'll look like he's seeing
his phantom hand clenched,

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.040
he's actually seeing the mirror reflection

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.320
of the normal hand.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.890
Then he would send commands
to both hands to open,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.968
he would unclench the normal hand,

00:22:51.968 --> 00:22:54.720
it would look like his phantom hand,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.490
which has been resurrected by the mirror,

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.004
is now unclenching.

00:22:58.004 --> 00:23:00.160
He's getting visual feedback telling him,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.380
hey look, your phantom is
moving again, it's unclenching.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.960
And that's not surprising,
it's just an optical trick.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.770
What's surprising is it causes the phantom

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.460
to actually move, it animates the phantom,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.980
the phantom hand opens,
and the pain is relieved,

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.870
often instantly.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.920
And this has now been
confirmed in clinical trials

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.510
and is being used throughout the world

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.150
as a treatment for phantom limb pain.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.650
- And so what should we understand here,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.070
that the fact that the limb is gone

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.030
has not registered with the brain?

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.050
- That's the main source
of the phantom limb,

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.700
but there are many things
going on in terms of the pain,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.150
which is still being explored.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.360
But what we had meanwhile
was a simple hunch

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.060
which led to a discovery that
enabled us to treat the pain.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.780
What's even more surprising
is another disease

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.710
called RSD, reflex sympathetic dystrophy,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.570
which is also considered intractable.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.022
So normally when you think of pain,

00:23:54.022 --> 00:23:56.040
there are actually two kinds of pain.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.570
One is chronic pain,
which is like the pain

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.150
of a fracture or a bee sting,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.360
and the pain then immobilizes a hand.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.415
So you have a fracture
of the metacarpal bone,

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:11.460
a hairline fracture,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.540
it would still be excruciatingly painful,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.360
immobilized, inflamed,
swollen and painful.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.270
The acute pain, like
you touching a kettle,

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.950
you withdraw the hand,
you mobilize the hand,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.470
nothing else happens, you're fine.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.890
But chronic pain is different.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:28.016
It leads to inflammation,
swelling, redness and pain,

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:30.560
leads to all of those things.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.733
Now usually in a matter
of a few days or weeks,

00:24:35.727 --> 00:24:37.710
the injury heals, and
when the injury heals,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.890
the pain subsides, swelling subsides,

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.170
redness goes away, the warmth goes away,

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.760
everything back to normal.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.310
But in about 1% of people,
that doesn't happen.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.760
The pain persists even
after the injury is healed.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.650
The pain persists with a vengeance,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.130
the swelling persists,
the redness persists,

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.510
the warmth persists, not only persists,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.680
it extends into the hand, the
entire hand becomes swollen,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.900
red and painful.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.480
The entire arm becomes
red, swollen and painful.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.840
And you're stuck with this
for life, for decades,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.460
excruciatingly painful,
and it torments the patient

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.623
for their entire life.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.050
How do you treat this?

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.380
Extraordinarily, we had
the idea of using a mirror,

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.400
and we suggested this, and
other groups have tried this.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.650
You put a mirror there, and
you can look at the reflection

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.470
of the normal hand, a non-swollen hand,

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.560
in the mirror, optically
superimposed on the swollen hand,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.010
so the swollen hand looks normal.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.890
You move your normal hand,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.477
the swollen, quote-unquote paralyzed hand,

00:25:35.477 --> 00:25:38.490
starts moving again,
feels like it's moving,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.560
not only feels like it's moving,

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.510
it actually starts moving,

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.250
and the swelling subsides,
the redness subsides.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.083
You put a thermometer there,

00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.790
you can measure the change in temperature.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.890
All from visual feedback through a mirror.

00:25:50.725 --> 00:25:52.170
This is the first time anybody had devised

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.978
a simple, non-invasive treatment

00:25:54.978 --> 00:25:57.700
for RSD, and it's the treatment of choice,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.900
now being used throughout
the world for RSD.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.520
- What led you to the mirror?

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.533
Was it just a coincidence?

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.050
- Well, no, not entirely.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.973
I said this guy is missing his arm,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.250
and he feels if only he could move it,

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.030
move his phantom, it
would relieve him of pain,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.040
so how do I make him move his phantom?

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.280
There is no arm to move there.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.920
And I said maybe you can
visually resurrect the phantom,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.420
maybe use virtual reality.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.110
Then I saw this $5 mirror
laying around the lab,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.260
and I said why use virtual reality

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.000
when you can use a $5 mirror,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.930
so I placed the mirror there

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.220
and used it to resurrect his phantom,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.567
so it was all through
accident and circumstance,

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:44.390
but my mind was primed to
think of this possibility.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.320
- Do you think that virtual reality,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.500
as that technology is developed,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.015
will be an important
element in interfacing

00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:56.960
with these visual mechanisms?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.940
- Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.410
For example, the mirror can only be used

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.210
in unilateral amputees.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.070
One arm is missing, use the other arm

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.370
to optically create the illusion

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.940
that his missing arm has come back.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.160
But if you have both arms amputated,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.510
you can't use a mirror, you
need to use virtual reality,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.330
and in fact the parameters
are easier to control,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.630
so now there are many,
many, many, many groups

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.330
throughout the world
implementing virtual reality

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.220
for stroke paralysis, for
RSD, for phantom pain,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.590
for all these different types
of neurological disorders.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.470
- In talking about your methodology,

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:31.470
I noticed you talk about science
should be problem-driven,

00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:39.130
so on the one hand, it's problem-driven,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:44.130
but insight comes from
anomalies basically,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.370
and those two things
interact with your foundation

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.510
in what has come out
of different sciences,

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.773
in your case visual
sciences that you study.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.270
- Yeah, I mean anomalies have the power

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.500
to drive new discoveries,
new directions of research.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.140
Classic example of course
is continental drift

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:10.140
where Wegener saw the west coast of Africa

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.300
making a perfect fit with
the east coast of Brazil

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.930
and then looked and the
continents seemed to fit,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.850
and he said how is this possible,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.050
and everybody laughed at him
saying that that's absurd,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.350
it's just coincidence.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.630
He pushed his idea forward.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.960
It's a classic example of an anomaly,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.610
later turning out to be very important,

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.360
as a driving force in science,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.960
in that case in geology.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.810
Another case is bacterial transformation

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.490
where you take pneumococcus A

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.860
and incubate it with pneumococcus B.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.370
One strain of bacteria being incubated

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.000
with another strain of bacteria.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.440
And strain B changes into strain A.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.899
This was reported long
before the discovery of DNA,

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:49.711
about a decade before
the discovery of DNA,

00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.443
but it had no impact at all
in the world of science.

00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:56.570
So here I am taking one
species of bacterium,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.760
incubating it with another
species of bacterium,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.010
A changes into B,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.277
and it had absolutely no
impact on the world of science.

00:29:03.277 --> 00:29:05.650
I'm exaggerating, there
were one or two people

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.380
who perked up, but by and
large it had no impact.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.030
Now supposing I bring a goat to the room

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.210
and then bring a pig to the
room, put them in a room,

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.878
out come two goats, what would you say?

00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:17.711
- Mm-hm.

00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:19.600
- You'd jump up and
down and say, "My god!"

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.140
That's what these guys had done.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.700
It just was bacteria
rather than goats and pigs,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.720
but nobody paid any attention

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.350
because it didn't fit
mainstream thinking in science.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.880
The notion of immutability
of species was so entrenched.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.867
The notion that you
could change one species

00:29:32.867 --> 00:29:36.080
to another species was unacceptable.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.140
And then when somebody came along

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.940
and said you can just take
the juice of the bacteria

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.110
and inject it, juice turned out to be DNA,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.523
so DNA was the genetic material,
people focused on that,

00:29:45.523 --> 00:29:47.290
discovered the genetic code,

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.850
and the rest is history.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.962
And I can give you dozens
and dozens of examples

00:29:50.962 --> 00:29:52.070
in the history of science
where turning points

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.440
were anomalies or oddities.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.950
Not the only way of doing
science, but it's one way

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.450
of approaching it.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:03.450
- And in your background,
it's very interesting

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.720
because you have a philosophical sense

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.720
of the big issues that we need
to address in the long term,

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.980
but in the short term,

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.410
since neurology sort of
is in its early stages

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.043
of development if we compare
it to 19th Century science,

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.390
we are still mapping the brain

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.390
and figuring out what part
is related to what anomaly

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:40.350
or to what function, so
your medical background

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.580
as I understand it, leads
you to a clinical approach,

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:49.580
to actually find patients,
or patients come to you

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.580
with anomalies, and you really believe,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.580
and for you it has worked,
to explore these anomalies,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.520
to validate them, to make
sure there actually is

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.050
a pathology there, and then relate that

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.120
to the mapping of the brain.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.660
- Couple of examples come to mind,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.630
clinical applications.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.083
One is the concept of metaneurons,

00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:18.170
which is widely publicized these days,

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.110
where neurons in the front of your brain

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.350
ordinarily fire, motor neurons,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.920
they're called motor neurons,
garden variety motor neurons,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.340
they fire, messages go
through the spinal cord

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.180
out to the peripheral
nerves to the muscles

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.770
when I wiggle my finger or rub my thumb,

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.850
they're done by motor neurons.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.007
Now 10% of these motor
command neurons in the front

00:31:38.007 --> 00:31:42.812
of the brain will also fire
when you wiggle your thumb,

00:31:42.812 --> 00:31:44.814
and I'm simply watching
you wiggle your thumb,

00:31:44.814 --> 00:31:46.080
nothing supernatural in here,

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.520
visual input is transformed into,

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.670
it's computed to create
an internal representation

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.710
in my brain of your finger wiggling,

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.290
so the same neuron is firing
as when I wiggle my finger

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.770
as when you wiggle your finger,

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.580
and I'm watching you wiggle your finger,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.130
so I'm creating a virtual
reality representation

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.433
of your movements, your
impending movements in my brain.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.760
Now okay, this is fascinating,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.660
it's a sort of mind-reading neuron

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.490
allowing me to predict your actions,

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.980
predicting your intentions
and so on and so forth.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.030
That much everybody agrees,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.400
but you could say it's
an arcane phenomenon,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.920
what use is it clinically?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.270
Well, one of the things
that a student of mine,

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.820
Jalal Baland, and I have
been exploring is OCD,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.110
which is again a strange anomaly,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.700
obsessive compulsive hand washing rituals

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.530
where people, they touch a doorknob,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.780
they feel the urge to
incessantly wash their hands

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.180
with soap and water, go to
the bathroom repeatedly,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.510
make sure it's completely spick and span

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.830
before they return.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.020
Extremely really made an
impediment to their lifestyle.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.630
So we thought, we hit on
the idea of simply saying,

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.323
well, why do you have to wash your hand,

00:32:54.323 --> 00:32:55.660
there are metaneurons,

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.259
why not just watch somebody
else wash their hand?

00:32:58.259 --> 00:32:59.095
- Hm.

00:32:59.095 --> 00:33:00.120
- Now this seems like a cooky idea,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.220
seems like a joke when
we first thought of it,

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.650
but it turns out it
works in some patients.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.060
When they touch the doorknob,

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.860
and they get the urge to wash their hands,

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.100
they simply watch another person

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.840
washing their hands, and they get relief.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.810
Not only that, you create a videotape

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.800
of somebody washing their
hand, they get relief.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.480
Now the next step to
that is creating an app,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.380
so when they get the urge,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.440
all they need to do is look at a videotape

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.210
of themselves washing their own hands,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.780
and it produces relief.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.510
So it's a surprisingly simple solution

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.110
to a very, very intractable problem.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.940
Now we need to do clinical
trials with placebos

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.490
to make sure this works.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.470
All our experiments in
mirrors and phantom limbs,

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:41.130
already have been tested in
double-blind controlled trials.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.610
This has not been tested yet,

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.491
but if it holds up, it's an
example of clinical application.

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:50.060
- And you also believe that mirror neurons

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.603
can help us understand autism.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.650
- Yeah, well, mirror neurons
are undoubtedly involved

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.910
in empathy and in
constructing what we call

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:04.160
a theory of mind, and imitation,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.090
and a lot of those human attributes

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.680
which we take for granted

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.210
which are part of being human,

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.180
and we were struck by the fact

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.100
that these are the very abilities

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.810
that are often missing
in autistic children,

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.420
so the link was obvious to
mirror neuron deficit in autism,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.560
and we found some preliminary results,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.180
but right now the evidence is in turmoil.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.650
About half the labs in the world

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.340
claim that there's mirror
neuron deficiency in autism,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.870
half the labs claim that there's nothing,

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.810
no difference in mirror neuron activity,

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.510
so I would say the evidence is suggestive

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.503
but not compelling.

00:34:35.338 --> 00:34:38.150
We need to wait for the dust to settle.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.220
- And in the way your mind works

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.470
as you study the mind,

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.150
what struck you and led you down this path

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:52.510
is when you list what we know

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:56.850
that mirror neurons are known to do,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:01.720
and you list the deficiencies
of an autistic person,

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.570
those two match perfectly.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.000
- Match perfectly.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.650
- And so that is what opens a door for you

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:13.330
to explore this even if
ultimately it's disproven.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.660
- Yeah, it's fine to be disproved

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.700
because as Darwin said, false conjectures

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.810
don't do any harm in science

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.770
so long as they're plausible

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.170
because in disproving them,
people take great delight,

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.300
so you made a lot of
people happy. (laughs)

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.300
- And science is as I learned
from Dr. Cicerone last week

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.090
is self-correcting.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:34.923
- Yeah.

00:35:34.923 --> 00:35:37.830
- And that's what its great virtue is.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.073
- Yeah, psychologically speaking,

00:35:39.073 --> 00:35:42.540
if you get everything
wrong, it's troubling,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.470
but if you have a good
track record of getting,

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.030
let's say, four out of five
things right on average,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.090
then you're doing well.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.060
So you establish your credentials,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:54.210
and then you have fun going on
a lot of fishing expeditions,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.860
that's acceptable in science.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.693
- Now.

00:35:56.693 --> 00:35:57.770
- Only thing is when you're speculating,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.960
you gotta be absolutely clear

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.710
when you're walking on thin ice,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.050
you're saying this is speculative,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.570
we don't know yet, we
haven't done the experiments,

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.730
this is just a theory,

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.104
versus when you have actually shown it,

00:36:07.104 --> 00:36:08.870
then you can claim that you've shown it.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.550
People often don't make that distinction,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.990
even eminent scientists
and science writers

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.800
don't make that distinction.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.610
It's important for the
scientist to make it clear

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.650
because the reader
doesn't have the expertise

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.483
to know when you're speculating

00:36:19.483 --> 00:36:21.993
and when you're on unsure footing.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.350
- Now interestingly enough,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.057
your focus on mirror neurons

00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:35.057
also leads you to a door that allows you

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.370
to speculate on culture

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.500
and how culture is transmitted

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.228
and what separates humans from apes,

00:36:47.228 --> 00:36:49.090
talk a little about that

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:54.090
because this is a case where
you move from the particular,

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.930
you move from the pathology,

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.638
but then you see a way to talk about

00:37:00.638 --> 00:37:02.853
how we transmit culture.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.540
- Well there are two
aspects of mirror neurons

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.373
that I would emphasize,

00:37:06.373 --> 00:37:07.500
one is the practical aspect,

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.164
which is often overlooked in the clinic,

00:37:10.164 --> 00:37:12.230
and the other aspect is
the theoretical aspect,

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.840
which is what you're alluding to.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.450
I just mentioned the practical
example of OCD being treated,

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.410
and we need to see if that holds up.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.460
Another example is, by
the way, I'm going off

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.700
on a tangent here, but another example

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.850
is we know there are sensory
mirror neurons as well

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:27.820
in addition to motor mirror neurons.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.820
If you go to the sensory
cortex in the brain,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.353
the touch neurons, if I touch you,

00:37:32.353 --> 00:37:35.500
somebody will touch me,
my touch neuron fires.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.980
If I watch you being touched,
same touch neuron fires.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.950
This is called, we call
them empathy neurons.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.373
I like to call them Gandhi neurons

00:37:43.373 --> 00:37:45.160
because they dissolve the barrier

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.017
between self and others.

00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:51.300
Now, turns out however,
even though the same neurons

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.070
are firing, if somebody touches me,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.750
or I'm watching you being touched,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.840
when I watch you being touched,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.670
I empathize, but I don't say,

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.110
I don't literally feel
the sensation in my hand.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.890
Somebody pokes you with a needle,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.500
somebody pokes me with a needle,

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.620
cells in my pain neurons
imitate a similar fire.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.930
Somebody pokes you with a needle,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.570
a subset of my empathy neurons fire,

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.300
same subset fires.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.200
So why don't I shout "Ouch!"
when I watch you being poked?

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.790
Right?

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.450
Even though the same
neurons are being fired.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.900
Well partly it's because I'm sensing it

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.600
but from my skin, it's
giving a veto signal,

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.310
it's saying, look, buddy, look, Rama,

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.480
Harry's being poked,
empathize by all means,

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.620
know what it's like to be poked,

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.443
but don't actually
experience it and shout out,

00:38:34.443 --> 00:38:38.670
it would just be silly,
don't feel the pain, right?

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.660
So so far, so good.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.880
So these neurons are
dissolving the barrier

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.610
between self and others
as far as quality of pain

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.681
is concerned, but so what?

00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:50.760
So here is a patient with
excruciating phantom pain

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.500
in his phantom hand, there is no hand,

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.090
he wants to massage his phantom fingers,

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.000
he can't do that because
there are no fingers.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.350
So he simply watches his
wife massage her hand,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.060
and he gets a phantom
massage in his phantom limb,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.430
and that relieves the pain
as effectively as mirrors.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.280
So we need to do controlled experiments,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.350
clinical trials on this,

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.603
but here's another example
of a clinical spin-off

00:39:12.603 --> 00:39:16.200
for mirror neurons, but I'm
jumping ahead of myself.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.520
Going back to your question of culture,

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.090
surely the important part
of cultural revolution

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.130
it's freed homonids

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.980
from the constraints of natural selection

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:30.562
at least in its very simple
form, is imitation learning.

00:39:30.562 --> 00:39:33.570
A polar bear takes hundreds
of thousands of years

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.450
to evolve a fur coat through
laborious natural selection.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.987
A human mother slaying a
polar bear, skinning it,

00:39:41.987 --> 00:39:44.580
maybe learned as a trial and error,

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.570
a child watching her can use
his mirror neuron system,

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.090
I say mirror neuron system
because it's not just

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.460
the mirror neurons, to
imitate that behavior,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.570
and that behavior is
transmitted in one generation

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.260
instead of evolving over
hundreds of generations,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.158
so this surely must be origin of,

00:39:59.158 --> 00:40:00.840
imitation learning is an important source

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.420
of what we call cultural
transmission of knowledge,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.620
so I was speculating on that
aspect of mirror neurons

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.090
and arguing that it's a major step

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.270
in the evolution of
transmission of culture,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.120
but not obviously, not the only step.

00:40:12.898 --> 00:40:14.010
I mean it couldn't have been the only step

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.370
because the great apes have
mirror neurons I'm sure,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.150
monkeys do we know for sure,

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.790
they don't have great culture.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.320
So it may have been a necessary
step but not sufficient.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.380
- You pointed out something a minute ago

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.490
that I think is important,

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:32.490
and that is the ability of
parts of the brain to cut off,

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.600
to stop going too far
in identifying with the,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:47.140
what's going out that's not
part of your body basically.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.290
Talk a little about that

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.140
because there is a tension in the brain

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.829
to on the one hand look
outward and identify,

00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:01.590
but on the other hand to
draw lines that say, no,

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.650
this is me, and that's not me.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.630
- Yeah, the me and not me distinction

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.710
is still being studied by many scientists

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:09.543
throughout the world.

00:41:09.543 --> 00:41:12.940
It's a very tricky problem,
tricky philosophically,

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.693
tricky scientifically.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.700
One example that comes to mind

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.153
is a study that I did with Jalal Baland,

00:41:21.153 --> 00:41:22.511
who is a student of mine,

00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:26.270
and what we found was,
we were looking at papers

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.610
on out of body experiences.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.430
Now let's take metaneurons
again, in the front of the brain,

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.440
they allow you to adopt
another person's vantage point,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.410
my mirror neurons allow
me to adopt Harry's,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.910
your vantage point on the world,

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.520
temporarily enact your
view of the world, right?

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.670
Create a simulation.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.210
But I don't feel myself drifting off

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:51.080
and fusing into you, a
kind of silly thought,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.730
but that's what might,
you probably might expect

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.740
would happen.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.930
Partly that's because of
anchoring provided by my own body,

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:02.930
so a chimp can, in watching another chimp,

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.790
temporarily adopt the other
chimp's point of view.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.460
A human can adopt it even
when you're not here.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.920
I can adopt another human
being's point of view.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.253
I see myself rehearsing this
even in lecture in my mind,

00:42:14.778 --> 00:42:16.820
an outsider's point of view,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.700
but I don't leave my body,

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.230
that's sort of what you're asking.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.130
Partly the anchoring comes
from the body itself,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.220
from afference,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.823
and in fact in a condition
called sleep paralysis,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.900
where there's a complete deafferentation,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.480
temporarily deafferentation,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.220
sensory impulses from the
spinal cord to the brain,

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.890
temporarily while you're asleep,

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.490
while you're in REM sleep,

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.840
you do get out of body experiences.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.720
One third of people in REM sleep

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.330
experience out of body experiences,

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.210
they feel like aliens are abducting them,

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.870
they are outside their own body.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.440
This we think is caused
by the mirror neurons

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.860
being disinhibited.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.330
This may have given rise to the notion

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.280
of disembodied souls, too,

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.050
which is relevant to the lecture

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.550
I'm going to give later today.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.210
- Let's talk now about synesthesia,

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.550
you raised it a minute ago,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.950
because in the case of that,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.950
describe that condition,

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:12.950
but also the insights it
gave you about the brain.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:16.850
- Yeah, well it's another
classic example of an anomaly.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.660
It doesn't fit mainstream
thinking science,

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.020
and that was ignored for a hundred years,

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.560
discovered by Francis
Galton in the 19th Century,

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.690
first cousin of Charles Darwin.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:29.310
He noticed that some people
in the general population,

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.350
he thought it was very rare,

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.470
people thought it was one in a thousand,

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.590
one in 10,000, we find
one in 50 people has this,

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.030
have this peculiarity that is
when they look at a number,

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.890
black and white number, black letter,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.400
black number five or six or
seven printed on a white page,

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.800
they see the number colored.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:46.150
There are two kinds of synesthesia,

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.380
called projectors and associators.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.330
The projectors literally see the color,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:51.870
if you go by their description,

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.487
they'll say, "The five
is, I know it's black,

00:43:54.487 --> 00:43:55.868
"but it looks red to me,

00:43:55.868 --> 00:43:57.257
"and it even has a halo of red around it

00:43:57.257 --> 00:43:58.890
"like a neon light."

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:01.787
Some people say, "I know it's black,

00:44:01.787 --> 00:44:05.580
"but it looks a beautiful
pink color to me."

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.300
So this is a classic
example of an anomaly.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.130
First of all, why are they saying this?

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.140
Are they crazy?

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.490
Secondly, who gives a damn,

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.920
who cares whether these
people see numbers as color.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.240
I can answer both those questions.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.240
We embarked on this about 10
years ago for the first time.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.690
First of all we showed they're not crazy,

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:23.523
they see the colors,

00:44:23.523 --> 00:44:26.140
I'm going to touch on this
in my talk this evening,

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.870
they see the colors perfectly clearly,

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.340
just like you and I do.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.270
You can show this by various experiments.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.872
For example, if you have the number five,

00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:38.872
and it's red, and you surround
it by a bunch of twos,

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.680
you have a black five surrounded
by a number of black twos,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.110
normal people find it really difficult

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:47.400
to spot the black five

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.820
because it looks very much like the twos,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.380
made up of the same vertical,
horizontal components,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.070
so you got a matrix of fives
with a two in the middle.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.400
You ask them is there a
two in the display or not?

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.230
And they find it very
difficult to answer that,

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.260
or take several seconds,
maybe 20, 30 seconds.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.417
These people say, "Oh, I see a red two

00:45:04.417 --> 00:45:05.927
"in the middle of green fives,

00:45:05.927 --> 00:45:07.210
"in a forest of green."

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.459
And they do it much more quickly,

00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:11.080
twice the speed of normal people.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.210
This shows that we're dealing with

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.480
a genuine, authentic phenomenon.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.950
Jamie Ward in London has
replicated this result.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.350
This is what got us going initially,

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.543
and then what causes the
phenomenon of synesthesia,

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.060
it turns out that the
brain is of course modular,

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.290
the adult brain,

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.580
but in early infancy and in the fetus,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.150
almost every part is
connected to every other part,

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.270
there's tremendous
redundancy of connections.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.630
There are pruning genes
which then prune off

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.010
excess connections
between adjacent modules

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.310
to create the modular architecture

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.150
that characterizes the adult brain,

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:47.620
so you get for example,

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.380
an area for color in fusiform gyrus

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.500
in the temporal lobes,
little brain section

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.010
called the fusiform gyrus,

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.122
an area for color called V4,

00:45:57.122 --> 00:45:59.950
then an area for number right next to it,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.650
visual appearance of numbers.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.450
These are normally segregated
in the adult brain,

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.650
but if there's a defect
in the pruning gene,

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.670
they get connected, and there's a mutation

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.570
in the pruning gene,
there's hyperconnectivity

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:12.837
between adjacent brain regions,

00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:14.690
and if this hyperconnectivity is expressed

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.930
by transcription factors exclusively

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.990
in the fusiform gyrus, which can happen,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.870
you get number-color synesthesia.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.820
Every time you see a
black and white number,

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.670
it activates the number area,

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.550
and it cross-activates the
color area in the brain,

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.570
evoking a particular color,

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.630
so five is red, six is
blue, seven is green,

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.760
so we have a solution to the mystery.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.927
So we did the perceptual experiments,

00:46:34.927 --> 00:46:37.210
and we did the brain imaging experiments,

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.940
and showed that we're on the right track,

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.890
but now comes the speculated part.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.160
What this gotta do with creativity?

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.490
- Mm-hm.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:44.660
- Think about creativity,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.670
what do all artists, poets, novelists

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:48.503
have in common?

00:46:48.503 --> 00:46:49.680
It turns out that synesthesia

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.760
is seven or eight times more common

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.593
among artists, poets and novelists

00:46:52.593 --> 00:46:54.320
than in the general population.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.153
Why would that be?

00:46:55.153 --> 00:46:57.320
What's the link between synesthesia

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.430
and artists, poets and novelists

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:01.905
and genes pruning excess connections?

00:47:01.905 --> 00:47:06.350
Well, if the defective pruning gene,

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:08.950
it's expressed not just
in the fusiform gyrus,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:09.783
if it's expressed in the fusiform gyrus,

00:47:09.783 --> 00:47:11.970
you get a color-number synesthesia,

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.430
this quirky phenomenon.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.263
If it's expressed throughout the brain,

00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:17.897
then assume that concepts and ideas

00:47:17.897 --> 00:47:20.600
are also represented in
far-flung brain regions,

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.520
and you get a propensity to
link seemingly unrelated ideas

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.790
and thoughts, which is
the basis of metaphor.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.367
For example when I say "It is the east,

00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.880
"and Juliet is the sun,"

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.680
if I say Juliet is the sun,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.050
you don't say she's a
glowing ball of fire,

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.540
you say she's warm like the sun,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.120
radiant like the sun,
nurturing like the sun,

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.400
rises in the bed like the
sun rises in the east,

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.660
your brain forms all these associations,

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.760
and if you assume
concepts like young woman,

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.520
like Juliet, and sun, and radiance,

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.200
and all that are also in
different brain regions,

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.290
if you've got more connections

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.130
between different brain regions,

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:54.280
you have more scope for linking
seemingly unrelated ideas,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.420
which is the basis of metaphor,

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.570
something that George
Lakoff here at Berkeley

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.240
has published on extensively.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.240
- So from an apparent pathology

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.410
that you prove to be a pathology,

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:13.410
you come to an understanding
of the causes in the brain,

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.000
and then from that, in addition to saying,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.100
yeah, this is real and
this is what's going on,

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.610
you wind up speculating,

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.564
and it is just speculation,

00:48:24.564 --> 00:48:28.720
that we can get to the big questions.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.560
- Correct.
- Namely, what is creativity,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.140
is a process like the
one we've identified,

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:40.120
going on to a greater extent in the brain

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.230
and helping us understand
what creativity is.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.400
- Exactly, so from the particular

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.823
to the broad, general questions.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.730
Gives you an experimental foothold

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.960
for understanding things like metaphor,

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.550
which is, being so elusive.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.380
- So in a way what's
really kind of interesting

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.290
as one has this conversation with you

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:05.080
is all of these factors that led you

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.253
to become a neurologist
in a study of the brain,

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.360
build pieces of a platform

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.760
from which you can not
only look at pathologies,

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.290
but also speculate
about the big questions.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:22.511
- Yeah, absolutely, and neurology

00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:23.950
is one of the few professions

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.820
where you can do that,
behavioral neurology

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.590
and cognitive neuroscience,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.689
where any time you see a
patient with a disorder,

00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:32.980
it's a curious disorder,

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.940
you come face to face with
the fundamental questions

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.366
that philosophers have raised
about the mind and brain

00:49:37.366 --> 00:49:40.330
since, for the last 2,000 years.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.850
- And you, in the last
chapter of your book,

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.960
you talk about consciousness.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.530
Think aloud here and explain to us

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.920
how you're thinking about consciousness

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.230
based upon what you've learned
about the brain thus far.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.870
- Well, unfortunately,
it's a loosely used word,

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.240
and somebody, Stuart Sutherland,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.110
once said consciousness is a topic

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:01.490
about which a great deal has been written

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:02.792
but nothing is known.

00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:03.625
(laughs)

00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:07.093
And I feel sympathetic to his view.

00:50:07.093 --> 00:50:08.550
There are two different questions.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.300
One is a question of qualia,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.610
how you can look at something red

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.530
like a red apple, and neurons firing away,

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.880
little wisps of jelly in your brain,

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.040
where's the red sensation come from?

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.490
An ancient question,
still not been solved.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.160
And then there's the question of self,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.170
the person who experiences a qualia.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.283
They're two aspects of the same problem.

00:50:23.283 --> 00:50:26.230
Now if you think of self
as one monolithic entity

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.670
but in fact there's many components to it,

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:31.170
it's a sense of continuity
in time and space,

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.380
your calendar, your sense
of being anchored in a body,

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.510
your sense of unity,
you, despite a diversity

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.160
of sense impressions and memories,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.820
you feel like one person
and so on and so forth.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.600
I think each of these
components can be studied

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.260
by neurologists looking at patients,

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.780
or doing brain imaging.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.610
And finally some sort of
big picture will emerge,

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.170
but at this stage, we're still studying

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.559
the basic phenomenology,

00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:59.410
phenomena tangentially
related to the problem

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.515
of consciousness, not a head-on collision

00:51:01.515 --> 00:51:02.910
of the problem.

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.468
Your whole question
about what the self is,

00:51:05.468 --> 00:51:07.770
it's called into question

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:09.820
when you see patients with a disorder

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.950
called anosognosia somatoparaphrenia.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.120
The patient's right hemisphere stroke,

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.420
ordinarily the left side
completely paralyzed,

00:51:17.893 --> 00:51:18.970
and they agree they're paralyzed,

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:19.803
they're bothered by it,

00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:20.910
they wanna be treated.

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.010
But a subset of these
patients are paralyzed,

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:24.752
so here is a patient
with complete paralysis

00:51:24.752 --> 00:51:25.990
of their left arm and left leg,

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:28.260
an elderly woman, and been paralyzed

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.110
for the last week or so,
right hemisphere stroke.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.890
Normally, 90% of them,
95% of them will complain

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:34.993
about their paralysis.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.672
Now there's about one or 2%

00:51:38.672 --> 00:51:41.360
who are blissfully
indifferent to the paralysis.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.110
You'll say, "Is there anything
wrong with you, Mrs. D?"

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:44.837
And they'll say, "No, I'm fine."

00:51:44.837 --> 00:51:46.527
"Can you move your right hand?"

00:51:46.527 --> 00:51:47.997
"Yes, I can move my right hand."

00:51:47.997 --> 00:51:48.867
"What about your left hand?"

00:51:48.867 --> 00:51:50.167
"I can move my left hand."

00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:53.247
"Mrs. D, what is this?"

00:51:54.767 --> 00:51:56.677
"Oh, that's my mother's hand,"

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.607
she would say with a
completely straight face.

00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:03.357
"Your mother's hand?" I say,

00:52:03.357 --> 00:52:04.507
"Where is your mother?"

00:52:07.087 --> 00:52:09.620
"Oh, she's hiding under the table."

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.630
These are intelligent people,

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:11.760
there's nothing wrong
with their intellect,

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.250
and they're not obviously
emotionally disturbed,

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.480
but she makes up some
completely absurd reason

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.350
for her mother not being visible.

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.490
She's under the table.

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:20.360
Here comes the best part.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.597
I say, "Okay, can you touch
my nose with your left hand?"

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:25.710
Sorry, "With your right hand?"

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.687
Of course she does.

00:52:26.687 --> 00:52:28.460
"Can you touch my nose
with your left hand?"

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.410
She does this.

00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:36.640
Now this implies that somebody in there,

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.320
despite her denial that
the left arm is paralyzed,

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.600
knows that the left arm is paralyzed,

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.000
otherwise why would you go and grab it?

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.380
Somebody in there also
knows this is her left hand,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.840
not her mother's,

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.616
otherwise why should she grab it?

00:52:48.616 --> 00:52:50.967
So there are many layers of iterations

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:53.620
that go into composing
what we call the self,

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.634
and this was brought
home to me very vividly

00:52:55.634 --> 00:52:57.203
in this patient.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.020
- So in a way you're
learning that the brain

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:06.300
does not like what you call equilibriums.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.470
It comes through plasticity

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:15.680
to a way to configure itself

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.240
so it makes up for the
deficit, is that fair?

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.220
- Well there's some sort
of coherencing mechanism

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.310
undoubtedly, and we don't
quite clearly understand

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.830
what's going on, especially in disorders

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.040
like anosognosia somatoparaphrenia,

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.680
so I have sort not studied it in detail

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.763
for that very reason,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.590
but the reason I raised is
not because you've studied it,

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.890
or understood it, but to
point out these enigmas

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.600
in neuroscience, surely
relevant to understanding

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.850
the concept of self.

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.070
Some cases, another example
I'd like to give you,

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:46.890
in which we have solved
the problem, I think,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.660
is apotemnophilia, unpronounceable name,

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.960
so we changed it to an equally
unpronounceable xenomelia,

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.980
which means, the patient,
or a person I should say,

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.523
they don't regard themselves as patients,

00:53:56.523 --> 00:53:58.290
as a problem,

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:01.060
all his life has harbored
a deep-seated urge

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.970
to have his left arm removed.

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.680
He's a perfectly normal person,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.230
led a normal life in society, held a job,

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.833
had a family, had friends,
had a good sense of humor,

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:15.406
I recently saw a dean
from a medical school

00:54:15.406 --> 00:54:18.800
with the syndrome. He came
to see me at the age of 70.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.520
It happened five years after retirement.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.270
And he said he's always had this urge

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.110
to have this arm removed,

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:24.570
and he wants to understand
what's going on.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.470
He doesn't want to be cured,

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:28.680
but he dearly wants to
get his arm removed.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.420
He doesn't see anything
abnormal about that.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.747
And this it turns out, it's rare,

00:54:33.747 --> 00:54:35.340
but not quite as rare as people thought.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.991
You go onto the internet,
you can find people

00:54:36.991 --> 00:54:39.260
with this, quote-unquote, this disorder,

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.250
or this wish to have their arm removed.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.320
What's going on in their brain?

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.520
So I guess you have to
wait for the lecture.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.120
- Well, one final question.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.520
You wear so many hats,

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:56.520
philosopher, medical doctor, neurologist,

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.040
just to name a few.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:03.040
How do you separate on
the one hand these roles,

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.360
but on the other hand
learn from each of them

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.390
because you have to be clear

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:13.590
that when you're a philosopher,
you're speculating.

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:14.423
- Yeah.

00:55:14.423 --> 00:55:15.256
- It's not science.

00:55:15.256 --> 00:55:17.280
- You sort of have to keep the
compartments quite distinct

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.710
in your brain, in your mind.

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:20.300
When you're seeing a patient as a patient,

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.370
I don't see patients clinically,

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:27.200
but I do help with the
treatment, devise new treatments,

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.130
and when you see him as a patient,

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.620
it's a very different mindset

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.490
when you're doing experiments on them,

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.580
and that's very important obviously.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.180
And the philosopher aspect of it

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.230
is yet again is a different matter.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.360
I haven't thought about it in detail,

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.720
so I'm not sure how easy it
is to answer that question.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.611
- Well, on that note, I
wanna thank you very much

00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:55.260
for being here and helping us understand

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.250
how you understand the brain

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:02.010
and this emerging field of
neurology, thank you very much.

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.300
- Thank you very much.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.456
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:09.096
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:09.096 --> 00:56:11.679
(upbeat music)
