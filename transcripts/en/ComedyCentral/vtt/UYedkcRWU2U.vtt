He's like, Are you trying to
bribe me?

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.306
Are you trying to
bribe me right now?"

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.042
I'm like, No, man, no.
I'm not trying to bribe you.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.912
I'm just saying, is there
something that Americans do

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.381
when they get arrested
in Mexico

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.518
to make it like it never
existed?

And I gotta tell you guys,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.603
it feels great

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.313
[laughter]

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:24.217
I'm getting older, and I'm
trying to smile more.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.551
I am.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.053
Because I realize
that sometimes

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.989
people will look at me
and they'll get nervous

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:33.559
that I'm gonna freestyle rap
at their house party.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:38.264
[laughter]

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:39.932
I might do it.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:43.069
It's gonna be all originals
with a limited vocabulary.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:47.740
[laughter]

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.509
But really, sometimes people
will look at me

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.912
and they'll think
that I'm a dick.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.414
Because I have a resting dick
face.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.751
[laughter]

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.587
And I have to think about why
do I look like that?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.422
And I feel--I really think
it's because

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.258
for a long period
in my life,

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.793
I sold drugs in Brooklyn.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.830
And when you work in that kind
of line of work,

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:14.133
it's good to look like a dick.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:14.934
[laughter]

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.569
You just want to like--

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.143
Just turn it up.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.513
[laughs]

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.048
It started when I was young,
man.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.217
Like, before 18, I used to go
on drug adventures

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.986
with my best friend Gary
and, like, we'd fly

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.722
to Portland, Oregon, and
we'd buy an ounce of meth,

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.391
and then we'd fly it back
on the plane

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.894
hidden in our butt cheeks.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.863
And it was before 9/11,
and before 9/11,

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:50.236
it was so easy
to fly drugs on an airplane.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.572
Our favorite trip that we
used to take is,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.373
we'd go down
to Tijuana, Mexico,

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:55.641
and we'd buy ketamine.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.577
It's the '90s, I'm sorry.

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.746
And we'd get ketamine,
and we'd take it back

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.815
across the Mexican border.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.016
And we did this a whole bunch,

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.818
and we knew a lot of bad people

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:07.186
and a lot of good people
doing bad things.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.021
And people were overdosing
and dying,

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:10.690
people were going to jail,

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.525
and I felt like I was running
out of chances,

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.693
so I had to get out of
Brooklyn,

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.328
so I joined the Air Force.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.163
And that straightened me out
enough to go to college

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.198
and it gave me money
to go to college.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.901
So shortly after that,
I found myself

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:25.071
going to California Polytechnic
State University

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.940
in San Luis Obispo, California.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.777
It was very different than
Brooklyn.

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.549
It's like the first time
where I understood

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:39.085
why people didn't like
white people.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:46.425
Like, I met people whose
parents were still married.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.695
[laughter]

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:53.299
People whose parents wore suits
to work.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.101
They were saving themselves
till marriage.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.236
They were going to church every
Sunday.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.238
I was terrified.

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.308
[laughter]

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:04.910
But I was doing well
and I was cleaned up

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:06.779
and I was healthy,
I was happy.

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:08.748
And my best friend
back in Brooklyn, Gary,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.249
he did the same thing.

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:11.884
He went to college; he was
happy; he was healthy.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.052
Got a little money,
decided to visit me.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.554
So he comes out to California.

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:18.090
And Gary is a Russian Jew.

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.259
And the only reason that
I mention he's a Russian Jew

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.963
is because he's a walking
cartoon of a Russian Jew.

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:27.933
He knows where you could
buy a wife

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:30.370
and he'll haggle the price
for you.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.244
He came to San Luis Obispo and
we were there just three hours

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:39.912
north of Mexico,

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.315
and we were feeling good,
we were feeling healthy,

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.684
and we decided,
hey, for old time's sake,

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:49.322
let's just drive to Mexico
and commit a federal crime.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:56.829
And we had a ritual
that we do every time;

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:58.464
we rent a car and we go down

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:00.599
and we'd be the first one's
there at the granero

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:01.967
when they opened up
to buy ketamine.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.269
First ones in line.
Well, there was no line;

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:08.207
we're the only ones
buying ketamine.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.611
But if there was ever a line,
we'd be first.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:14.113
Then we would take the
ketamine,

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:17.883
and we'd immediately
shoot it up with syringes.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.318
All right, listen.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.454
I didn't shoot it in a vein,
okay?

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.788
I'm not like a heroin addict.

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.558
I'm better than them.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.228
I would shoot in the butt cheek
or a arm muscle.

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:32.498
In the muscle.
I'm gross.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.636
[laughter]

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.071
And then we get high
on ketamine

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:40.740
and we walk towards the beach.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:42.742
On the way to the beach, we
would hit the fruit stand.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.845
I would buy a mango because I
don't know how to cut a mango.

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.847
The nut's too big.
I always slip.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.986
I cut my hand.
I'm too dainty for that.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.522
Then when we finally
got to the sand,

00:05:56.555 --> 00:05:59.825
we would rent sad horses.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:03.062
[laughter]

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:08.868
And by the time the horse ride
was over,

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.103
we'd be sober enough to get
back in the car

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:12.738
and go back to America.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.741
And this was the ritual we did
over and over and over.

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.276
We had it like clockwork.

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:18.878
Must have been, like, 30 times
we bought K.

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.012
30 different mangos.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.747
We went and we rode 30 horses.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.183
I mean, there probably wasn't
30 different horses, you know?

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.018
It was probably, like,
repeat horses,

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.453
because they only had,
like, 17 horses

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:28.754
and horses get sick

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.389
and they're hard
to take care of and stuff

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.891
and, like, you couldn't
keep a stable of 30 horses.

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.026
That'd be crazy.

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.263
But still, I got on 30 saddles
is what I'm saying.

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.203
And everything
went according to plan.

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:45.638
We got back in the car,

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.407
and then we would drive deeper
into the city

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.043
to a quiet place
where we would find a place

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:52.878
to transfer the drugs
and hide them

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.914
to go back to America.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:58.050
What we'd do is, we'd empty
tequila bottles

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.718
and then empty
the liquid ketamine

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:02.221
into the tequila bottles
and reseal them.

00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:03.889
So then we'd get to the border,

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.257
and the border patrol
would be like,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.959
"Yo, dog,
what are you bringing back?"

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.427
And I'd be like, "Yo, son,
I just got this tequila."

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.062
And he'd be like, "No doubt.
Enjoy America."

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:14.066
And then I'd play
the national anthem,

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.569
and I would cross the border.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.104
[laughter]

00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:21.240
That might not be how border
patrol agents talk.

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:22.741
I don't know.
I--might be--

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:25.178
I might be misremembering
that part.

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:31.083
So I see a place
that looks quiet,

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:33.252
and I turn up this block,

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:37.623
and I end up going the wrong
way up a one-way street.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:43.629
And on that street is an SUV
filled with four Federales.

00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:46.265
They see me, lights and sirens;
pull me over,

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:48.834
pull me out of the car,
search the car,

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:51.036
find all of our ketamine.

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.538
So now we're screwed.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.608
I'm on the curb there.
I got a gun in my face.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.343
And I'm actually nervous
about this gun thing.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.015
This is the first time
I've ever been nervous

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.717
when I had a gun in my face.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.386
In my life, it was the third
time I had a gun in my face.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:09.121
The first time I had a gun in
my face

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:11.123
is when I was 16 years old

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:12.958
and I got caught writing
graffiti in Brooklyn

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.393
and a cop put a gun
in my face.

00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:16.328
But I wasn't nervous that I'd
get shot

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:18.797
'cause I'm a white dude in
America, and we don't get shot.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.299
[laughter]

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:22.334
I could literally be waving a
gun around,

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:24.904
and they'd be like,
"Sir, calm down.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:28.641
Calm down, sir.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.809
Can we get you a soda?"

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:34.046
[laughter]

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:40.319
The second time
I had a gun in my face,

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:44.323
it was put there by
archnemesis in Brooklyn,

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.359
a white Crip
named Willie Boats.

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.595
[laughter]

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:53.332
And I wasn't nervous when
Willie put a gun in my face

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:56.702
because Willie Boats is a bitch
who ain't gonna do shit!

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.204
[laughter]

00:08:59.237 --> 00:09:02.475
[cheers and applause]

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:13.118
But this time, the third time
I got a gun in my face,

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:14.453
I'm nervous, and the reason is

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:17.890
'cause this time,
I'm an actual bad guy.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:18.924
I'm a drug trafficker.

00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:20.459
I'm a drug tourist.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:22.194
You know, to the people
back in San Luis Obispo

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:23.462
where I came from,
they don't see a difference

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:25.864
between a drug tourist
or a sex tourist

00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:27.366
or a hit man for the mafia.

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.234
It's all just bad people
to them, and I think,

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:31.937
"Shit, if this cop thinks
I'm a bad person,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.406
he might feel it's within his
rights to actually shoot me,

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.575
and I don't know
if I blame him for it.

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:39.812
'Cause I'm taking advantage
of his country."

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:43.282
But I've been in a lot of
situations with cops before,

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:45.818
so as soon as they try
to talk to me,

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:47.886
I knew exactly what to do.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.422
I immediately started crying.

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:53.058
[laughter]

00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:57.496
It was wet tears
down rosy cheeks.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:01.900
There might have been a little
snot involved.

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:03.636
The goal was for him
to be like,

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:06.973
"There's no way I'm gonna put
this little bitch in jail."

00:10:11.476 --> 00:10:14.113
And they separate us like cops
do to interrogate us,

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.981
try to get us to mix up
our stories.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.616
And I'm such a drug addict
at the time,

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:20.486
there was no way I was gonna
rat out my drug dealer.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.788
So I wound up screaming
the story loud enough

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:27.359
for Gary to hear so he could
repeat the story.

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:30.429
So I'm like, "We bought it off
some weird Mexican dude

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:34.734
outside of the hotel that looks
like a festival!"

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.477
And Gary screamed back, "I
don't know, we just bought it

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.446
"off some weird dude outside
of a hotel

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:50.316
that looks like a carnival!"

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:55.221
Close enough, Gary.
You're a gangster.

00:10:56.488 --> 00:11:02.327
That's my G right there.
Kept the connect.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.696
So now they realize nothing's
gonna happen

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.230
with the interrogation,
and we reached

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:06.999
the final part of this,
where it's like,

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:08.701
what--are we gonna go
somewhere?

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.069
Like, to a dirty Mexican prison
or what?

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.671
What's gonna happen?

00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:14.740
And so I stopped him and I was
like, Hey, man,

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:17.142
is there, like--is there,
like, something I could do

00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:18.177
to make this go away?

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.511
And the cop got mad.

00:11:19.544 --> 00:11:21.013
He's like, What are you
talking about?

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:22.081
What are you saying to me
right now?

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.415
And I was like, I don't know.

00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:24.750
Maybe like, can I give you
something,

00:11:24.783 --> 00:11:26.218
and then this doesn't happen,
you know?

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:27.519
Like, what--
is there something--

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:29.021
He's like, Are you trying to
bribe me?

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:30.022
Are you trying to
bribe me right now?"

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:31.090
I'm like, No, man, no.

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.691
I'm not trying to bribe you.

00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:35.260
I'm just saying, is there
something that Americans do

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:38.363
when they get arrested
in Mexico

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:42.868
to make it like it never
existed?

00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.170
And the dude was like,
Yeah, you give me money,

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:46.572
you give me money.

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:52.044
But I didn't have no cash
on me,

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:53.579
and Gary didn't have no cash
on him,

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:56.081
because we spent every dime
we could on drugs.

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:57.182
So I was like,
"Listen, man, I gotta go,

00:11:57.215 --> 00:11:58.250
I can get it out of an ATM."

00:11:58.283 --> 00:11:59.618
And for some reason,

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.186
Gary didn't have any money
in the ATM.

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.223
I still don't know why,
to this day,

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.092
he didn't offer up
his ATM card.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.527
They were like,
All right, no doubt.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.929
You go to the ATM and get
some money for us,

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.564
and we're just gonna hold Gary.

00:12:12.597 --> 00:12:15.868
[laughter]
We're just gonna hold Gary

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.603
to make sure you come back.

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:21.440
So now I'm on my way to an ATM,

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:24.276
and I'm nervous 'cause,
like, I got my boy's life

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:25.611
in my hands.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.246
I mean, we turned around
at this point.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.881
We weren't hard-core
drug dealers no more.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.216
We were just, like, kids trying
to have fun again.

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:32.417
Like, we were college kids now.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.752
We were straightened up.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:35.287
This is not supposed to be
happening.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.922
I couldn't let myself
go out like that,

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:40.225
and I certainly couldn't let
my boy go out like that.

00:12:40.258 --> 00:12:41.960
So I hit an ATM.
I put the card in.

00:12:41.993 --> 00:12:43.929
Doesn't work--something with my
card being an American card--

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:45.464
and I'm getting nervous.

00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:48.300
I hit another ATM; the same
thing, it won't work.

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:50.435
So that's it, I'm at
the, like, last point

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:53.438
where I'm just like,
God, please, God.

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.341
If you just let me get this
money out the ATM

00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:57.810
and get out of this situation,

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:01.346
I promise I will never, ever
do drugs again.

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:04.950
And I hit the third ATM,
and boom, I get the money out.

00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.618
I pulled out, like, 250 bucks,

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:08.821
which is, like, 3 million pesos
or something.

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:12.090
It just kept coming, like--

00:13:12.123 --> 00:13:14.827
[mimics mechanical clicking]

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.628
Just fuckin'--

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:17.830
Just--

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:22.601
[laughter]

00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:24.870
And I rush back
to go save Gary.

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:26.538
And when I get back,
the situation's changed.

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:28.140
Gary's now sitting in our
rental car,

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:29.675
white as a ghost.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.310
I don't know
what they said to him

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.712
to make sure he didn't move
that fuckin' car.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:35.814
And then I look in the back
and all the cops

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:37.549
are back in the SUV,

00:13:37.582 --> 00:13:40.619
and the SUV door just opens
on its own like a horror movie,

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:44.223
and I know that they want me to
enter their little horror SUV.

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:47.860
So I get into the backseat
and I climb in,

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.328
and now I'm in between
two Federales

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.796
and there's two in the front.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.531
The dude who's driving asked
for the money;

00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:54.633
I give it to him,
he counts it.

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.168
And he was happy with
the amount,

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:57.236
and he's like, All right,
get out of here.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.904
And I'm just like, I did it.

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.806
And I'm climbing out, and I was
like, that was so easy;

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.174
I can't believe it was--
just took 250 bucks

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:03.508
to get out of this.

00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:07.079
And I'm halfway out the back
of the SUV

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.680
and I get a hand
on my shoulder.

00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:09.915
And a cop's spinning me around.

00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:11.483
I'm like, "This is it.

00:14:11.516 --> 00:14:12.551
This is the gun in my face,
the knife in my gut,

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:13.886
they're gonna cut my head off,

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.488
put it on a tortoise in
the desert."

00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:18.023
This is the--
I knew it's too easy.

00:14:18.056 --> 00:14:19.324
And the cop spins me around.

00:14:19.357 --> 00:14:20.559
I look at him;
we make eye contact.

00:14:20.592 --> 00:14:21.693
And he's like,
"You forgot this,"

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:24.196
and gives me back all my drugs.

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:27.466
[cheers and applause]

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.606
And I jumped out of the SUV,
I'm like, Screw you, God!

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:37.609
I don't even believe in you!

00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:41.280
I'm getting high, baby!
See you on my deathbed!

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:44.583
[cheers and applause]

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.892
I jumped back into our car.

00:14:53.925 --> 00:14:55.861
We get going, we transfer
our drugs, and we're going.

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.729
We don't say anything
to each other.

00:14:57.762 --> 00:14:59.631
We've just been through this,
like, traumatic experience.

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:03.135
And we're driving, and I feel
Gary turn in to look at me,

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.237
and he's gonna say, like,
the first thing he said to me

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.539
in probably 40 minutes.

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:09.074
And I'm like, This is it.

00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:12.778
This is gonna be our first
best friend "I love you."

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:17.582
I've been waiting for him
to say it.

00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:19.785
I'm gonna say it back.

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:26.224
And I look at him
and I'm waiting for it

00:15:26.257 --> 00:15:28.660
and he turns to me and he looks
at me and he's like,

00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:33.732
"You paid them
way too much money.

00:15:33.765 --> 00:15:35.567
You could have gave 'em, like,
$50, man.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.237
Why are you wasting--
that's more drug money!

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.272
Screw you, Gary.

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:44.443
You owe me money now.

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.244
But we made it back,
and we were safe,

00:15:46.277 --> 00:15:47.846
and we did our drugs.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:50.082
But--
- We did our drugs.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.249
We did our drugs.

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:53.952
[laughter]

00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:56.421
And we haven't gone back to
Mexico since then

00:15:56.454 --> 00:15:58.123
to smuggle any drugs.

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:00.826
But I did--I learned a really
important lesson from that.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.662
And it's that you should never,
ever

00:16:03.695 --> 00:16:06.431
drive the wrong way
up a one-way street.

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:08.100
[laughter]

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:11.337
[cheers and applause]

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.610
And also I'm not smuggling
drugs no more from Mexico.

00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:21.646
But if by chance anyone
has some ketamine

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:24.616
already in America...

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:26.184
I'm just saying, I got a
birthday every year.

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:27.285
Hook me up.

00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:29.388
[laughter]

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:30.389
Peace.
