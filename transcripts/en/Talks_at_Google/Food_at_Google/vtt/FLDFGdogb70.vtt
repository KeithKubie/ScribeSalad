JENNA TAYLOR: Welcome
to The Teaching Kitchen

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:04.640
at Kitchen Sync.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.370
I'm Jenna Taylor.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm a Food Services Manager
here on your Google Food

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.080
team in Mountain View.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.160
Very excited to be
your hostess today.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.500
So today we're very lucky to
have Chef Nathan Lyon with us.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.690
Chef Lyon is the Emmy-nominated
chef and co-host of "Growing A

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.420
Greener World" and host of "Good
Food America" with Nathan Lyon.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.180
You also might recognize him, as
I did from, Food Network Star.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.930
NATHAN LYON: Yeah.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.730
It's a long time ago.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.380
I had hair down to here.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.700
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a long
time ago, but I recall it.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.980
You're also, what, a
sustainable seafood ambassador

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.560
with the aquarium, and
author of "Great Food Starts

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.970
Fresh," which a lot of us
are paging through right now.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
So I'm going to leave it at
that and step out of the shot.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.440
But welcome, and thank you
for being here with us today.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.523
NATHAN LYON: Thanks, guys.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.040
Exciting.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.509
So thank you, Jenna.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.300
Huge round of applause
for this young lady,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450
Victoria, because I
wouldn't be here otherwise.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.650
My girlfriend and executive sous
chef is out there with Chef--

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.760
her name is Sarah Forman.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.220
And also, when you go
to in the cookbook,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.990
numerous places it'll say,
for additional information

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.310
go to chefnathanlyon.com I have
a bunch of cards right here,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.020
takes you to the same place.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.850
Sarah and I started doing
drought-friendly recipes, also,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420
that get picked up by NPR.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.690
The French version of CNN
came to our humble abode

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.000
and kind of watched us cook.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
Our voices will be
dubbed in French,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.330
so I can't wait to
actually see it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.594
I'll be like, what's my
French voice going to be?

00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.260
I hope it's not squeaky
and really high.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.760
Who knows?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.250
I don't know.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.574
And you can find
those online also.

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:43.990
So because you all
have cookbooks,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.397
this book took me
six years to finish.

00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:48.980
The reason why is
I'm a perfectionist,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.420
and I just keep going
back and I think I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.670
can do it a little bit better.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.182
But it's based on my 10 years
of working at farmer's markets.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:57.140
And the thing about
working at farmers' markets

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.550
is you develop this amazing
Rolodex of information

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.790
that makes it so that your
life is a lot simpler.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.510
Going to culinary
school and teaching

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.820
people how to cook
on TV also make sure

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.960
your life a lot simpler.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.290
So for example,
when you know how

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.680
to pick out a tomato,
or you how to pick out

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.260
a peach without smelling it or
touching it-- because that's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.102
what I used to sell
for 10 years-- that

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:19.560
makes your job a
lot easier, so you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.280
use a lot less mental energy.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920
Like, if you're
typing something,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.610
return key is always here.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.100
You don't have to go, hm-hm,
oh, there it is, return, right?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.580
So I'm going to show you
a couple knife skills that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.720
will be, like, a habit.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.010
It'll be a new habit.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.147
So you don't have to worry
about cutting certain things

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:39.730
because as you're
cutting them, you're

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.830
thinking about something else.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.120
So we're sort of multitasking.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.010
I am the youngest of three boys.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.460
I'm from Arlington, Virginia.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.910
I love attention.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.130
I had no idea that I
would be a teacher.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.780
I love to teach, and
this is what I do.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.830
I was an art major,
meaning before I switched

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.130
to a health science major.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650
I was a medical technician.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.210
I did landscaping.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.814
I'm a chef.

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:04.230
So I'm kind of all
over the place.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.650
But this is what
I love the most,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.550
and it's sort of like everything
I've ever done in my whole life

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.230
has come to fruition here.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.320
So does anyone not
have a blender at home?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.730
You don't have a blender.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.749
OK, so whoever she lies--
whoever lives next to her,

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.790
we need to make sure that
she comes to your house

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.367
to make this first recipe.

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.450
If your birthday is coming
up, and then we can all

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.070
pitch in five bucks, right?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.440
And we can get you
an immersion wand.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.330
Those are really
great things to have.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.860
So if you don't
have a blender, you

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.980
can get an immersion and, which
is like a-- it's like this,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.350
but it's got the blender
thing on this end--

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.790
bzzz- that whole thing, right?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.360
So you can make this first
recipe with one of those.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.630
Whatever sound effects--
bzzz-- that's mine.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.030
You can come up with
your own sound effect.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.000
But this is a spicy
watermelon gazpacho.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.170
This first recipe is an
homage to all the things

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.480
that summer has to offer.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.110
So when I was in
school, I realized

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.610
that when you eat in
season, it's better for you

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.770
physiologically.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.270
So these types of fruits--
these are all fruits-- these

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.980
are all very
cooling to the body.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.540
So if it's 100 degrees
outside, and I said,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.290
so today I'm making a
roast Tahitian squash

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.597
risotto with, like,
cream and butter,

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.400
and you're like, blaahhh, right?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.930
Because it's just so hot
you don't want those things.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.652
Luckily for us,
they're not in season.

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:33.860
So everything you should be
eating is in front of you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.260
when you should be eating it.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.600
It has the most flavor,
it costs the least,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.180
and has the most nutrition.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.330
And that's why I
did this cookbook.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.340
So first things first.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.542
Does anyone not like watermelon?

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:47.910
I love watermelon.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.040
I'm, again, from Virginia.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.990
We used to go out--
my buddy Jason Hicks

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.450
and I used to go to
the watermelon fields,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.654
and actually go out and
it was $0.25 a watermelon.

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:57.820
So we used to go out there
with a knife and a spoon,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.990
and just be like, eat the heart,
$0.25, eat the heart, $0.25.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.809
Isn't that cool?

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:05.600
Well, we were stuffed
and peeing ourselves,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.940
but at the end of the day,
it was absolutely delicious.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.900
So this first recipe, because
it is so warm outside,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.440
I thought I'd do this one first
because it is very cooling.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.964
I know the chef has made
it absolutely delicious.

00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:22.380
And you can make
it ahead of time,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.692
and then put the entire blender
in the fridge to cool down.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.150
And then when your
guests come over

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.316
on a hot summer day like
this, you just pour it out.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.010
And they're just so stoked.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.910
And if it's a weekend, you
through in vodka if you want.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.520
They'd be like crazy stoked.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.762
Just grab yourself a Google
bicycle and bike one home.

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:42.178
[BRIEFLY HUMS WICKED WITCH THEME
 FROM "THE WIZARD OF OZ"]

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.100
So don't go crazy.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.390
Thank you for picking that up.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.270
That was very sweet
of you to do that.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.730
So here's the watermelon.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.300
You guys are so funny.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.170
And what I said before,
everyone came in,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.589
don't hesitate to
ask any questions.

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:59.630
Picking out a watermelon.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.160
Does anyone know how to
pick out a watermelon?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
That's a great question.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.118
Great question, Nathan.

00:06:04.118 --> 00:06:05.580
That's a fantastic question.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.320
You thump on it.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.310
You'll thump on it,
and it needs to sound

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.732
very resonant and hollow,
like a deep hollow.

00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:15.940
If it's tinny, like ding,
ding, ding, it's underripe.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.890
If it's like, phoomp, like
a wet shoebox, overripe.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.389
And plus it's just fantastic.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.430
Do you have one of these?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.310
Vegetable peeler?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.010
Doesn't have to be this one.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.970
It could be this one.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.870
I'm so going to tease you.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.450
I'm so sorry.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.695
I just feel bad that the
tier, the second tier.

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:34.850
When the third tier happens,
it's just something bad.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.150
So if you don't
have one of these,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.690
you'll have like the
old metal grandma style

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.610
one, which I have at home.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.950
Is this a left- or
right-handed peeler?

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.650
Great question.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.740
Peelers are all
for ambidextrous.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.670
It doesn't matter if
it's left and right.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.360
So if you're a right-handed
person like I am and you're

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.390
always peeling away,
that means that side's

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.040
duller than the part
coming towards you.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.360
Does that makes sense?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.660
So if I have a peeler-- and
when you're in restaurant work

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.580
and you figure out how to
peel like this-- like this

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.759
is a carrot, right,
so that's done.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.300
So you don't always
have to be, like,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.100
one, and then turn,
and two, then turn,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.655
because both sides
peel exactly the same.

00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.280
So the reason I'm
sharing that with you

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.154
is because when you have
friends coming over,

00:07:22.154 --> 00:07:24.520
and you're like, oh my god,
I have to make a salad,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.200
or whatever going to be
making, in 15 minutes,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.680
there are numerous
items in that cookbook

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.000
that you could bang
out in 15, 20 minutes.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.160
And that's just one of
those time-saving things

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.070
that you can use the
peeler both ways.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.210
And I guarantee, as I'm
gesturing with this thing,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.960
that when you go home
and use your peeler,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.834
you'll be like, I'll be
darned, and just peel

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:45.740
both ways, away and toward you.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.900
It's just a sharp, if not
sharper, on the opposite side.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.890
Now if you have a Japanese
cucumber or a Persian cucumber,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.150
you don't necessarily
have to peel it.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.670
But for this one, because
you eat with your eyes first,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.900
I want to make sure it's red,
if not kind of rosy pink.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.040
And the green peel will sort
of make it a little bit more

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.420
on the brown side.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.490
That's the only reason
why I'm peeling this.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:16.210
Otherwise I would totally just
eat this peeled, everything.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.872
Any questions, guys?

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.080
And again, this first one,
I'm just making it simple,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.710
if you have a
blender--except for you--

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.334
you just throw
everything in a blender.

00:08:23.334 --> 00:08:27.230
And that's really
the first recipe.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.142
These are a little
bit on the small side,

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:30.350
meaning which is what I like.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.880
If you get the big,
massive, tube sock,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.440
hothouse massive ones, they
don't have a lot of flavor,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.047
and plus they're very watery.

00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:38.880
If you get those and
you have those at home,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.588
you can cut them in
half and use the back

00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:44.981
of a-- like this little spoon,
you scoop out the seeds.

00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:45.980
It's just really watery.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.500
There's not a lot of
flavor in that area.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.140
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
totally pull you up and say,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.570
make us all gazpacho,
and you would totally

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.210
be able to do this.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.490
Any questions about anything?

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.130
Now let's do an
onion, a red onion.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:09.080
Now the thing about onions
and cutting, and just the way

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.220
that you approach food itself,
because my background is

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.270
sort of like
physiology, cadaver lab,

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.980
that whole thing in college,
I always watch people cook.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.690
And sometimes it looks
uncomfortable when people cook.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.356
So if you're one of those people
that after you're done cooking,

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.500
you're like, geez, man,
that took it out of me--

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.060
chances are the way you cook
has something to do with that.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.110
I have to make it so
you can all see here.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.360
There's nothing up the sleeve.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.700
There's nothing up the sleeve.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.370
So with an onion,
what I like to do

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.540
is because it's in the
blender, you can quarter it.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.331
But I'm just going to
chop this pretty fine

00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:48.490
so you can see how I'm going
to be approaching this.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.270
If I'm relaxed--
if I'm relaxed--

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.770
this is relaxed to me.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.230
Do I look relaxed?

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.740
So my hands are actually
not facing forward.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.267
They're facing in a little bit.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.100
And I could all I ask
you to stand up and do

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.391
the same thing, which is silly.

00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:05.500
We'll just pretend that
we're all human beings.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.880
So if I put this knife
in my relaxed hand,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.300
it's actually facing
inward, not this way.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.280
So if I want to cut
something straight,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.640
I'm not going to do this.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.170
I'm actually going to do this.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.680
I'm just going to do this.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.965
You can all do this, right?

00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:26.590
So if I want to cut
something straight,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.870
I'm going to turn this
onion to the same angle

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.409
as the knife would normally be
if I'm just totally relaxed.

00:10:33.409 --> 00:10:35.700
And people always do this
because this is perpendicular

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.850
and you know that's
straight, so you're like,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.620
this is going to be
totally straight.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.650
And you're just like,
what are you doing?

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.890
It's like Cirque
du Soleil cooking.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.432
So if this was straight,
I would just do that,

00:10:45.432 --> 00:10:46.640
and it's completely straight.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.770
And I could literally
do this all day.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.900
Where you looking?

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.980
Where you looking?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.777
Where you looking?

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.110
And it's just-- I know it's
straight, just because all I

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.920
have to do this, up and down,
up and down, that's all,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.870
and let the knife do the work.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.050
So I'll throw some
red onion in there.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.850
Next thing is tomato
with the gazpacho.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:12.810
Now tomatoes-- you don't ever
want to refrigerate a tomato.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.310
You just don't.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.325
They cry and scream
a silent scream.

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:17.450
You won't be able to sleep.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.710
It's horrible.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.850
Because it messes up the inside.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.510
The integrity gets
a little bit mealy.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.586
So you can put them
on the counter,

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:26.710
not in the direct sunlight.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.540
But when they're ripe,
that's good to go.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.454
Or, if you go to your farmer's
market and there's a lot

00:11:31.454 --> 00:11:33.870
of tomatoes, you're like, oh,
$1.00 a pound for heirlooms,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.260
that's great.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.430
You can just grab a whole
flat--it's totally worth it--

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.050
get freezer zip bags, put
them all in a freezer zip bag,

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.940
and just put them
in the freezer.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.210
The reason for that is
because when you can a tomato,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.480
you're kind of boiling it.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.670
You're heating it,
so you're canning it.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.900
So you're actually breaking
down the flavor of that tomato

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.660
by heating it for a
long period of time.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.860
When you freeze it, it doesn't
break down the flavor at all.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.410
And then, come winter time,
when you want to make yourself

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.868
like a really delicious grilled
cheese sandwich with tomato

00:12:02.868 --> 00:12:05.720
soup, you just put it
under cold running water,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.770
and then the frost just
on the inside of the skin

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.960
peels off like a sock.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.975
And you just throw the
whole thing in your pot.

00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:13.850
It has a lot of flavor
in there, so you don't

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.058
have to actually do anything.

00:12:15.058 --> 00:12:18.140
You can neglect your produce
and have amazing food.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.210
That sounds pretty good.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.793
I don't know if
that's the Google way,

00:12:20.793 --> 00:12:24.040
but let me tell you, that
could be the lion way.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.550
So that goes in.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.870
Does anybody have a knife that
they really like that they use?

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.620
Anybody have a knife they like?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.210
You're like, well, kind of.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.500
That's like saying, do
you have a cat you like?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.374
You're like, kind of.

00:12:36.374 --> 00:12:38.440
I guess I kind of have
a cat that I like.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.850
So a knife is the
most important thing.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.050
It's just the most important
thing that you have.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.000
Not more than loved ones, but
it's the most important thing

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.041
you have in your kitchen.

00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:47.490
Keep it really sharp.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.590
I have a $250 knife that I never
use because the handle's too

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.500
small for my hand.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.780
So I kind of try
to overcompensate

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.380
because the handle's too small.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.535
This handle fits my hand.

00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:01.660
What size shoe do you have?

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.580
It's totally personal, but
what size shoe do you have?

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.310
Five.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.267
I have a 12.

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:07.475
So you're like, Nathan,
those are some killer Aasics.

00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:09.900
I wants size 12 Aasics.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.370
Not that great.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.470
So if our hands are
the different sizes,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.900
you need to go try on knives
like you try on shoes,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.340
or clothes, or whatever.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.110
Just because it's
shiny and looks amazing

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.140
doesn't mean it's
a better knife.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.940
This knife you can get on
Amazon, delivered for like $38.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.190
There's a photo of this
very knife in the cookbook.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.782
So if you ever forget what the
knife is, look in the cookbook.

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:33.490
You all have one.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.580
You guys are just sponges.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.390
I love you.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:39.890
OK.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.300
So onion.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.030
We have tomatoes.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.750
We have watermelon, mint.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.090
Mint is one of those things
that's absolutely fabulous.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:52.927
If you like to garden but
only have a little pot,

00:13:52.927 --> 00:13:55.010
mint is one of those things
that's actually better

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.360
to do in a pot, or
else it just takes off.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.042
It's crazy.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:13:58.750
It's like bamboo.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.200
You can't stop it.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.140
And fresh mint, or fresh
herbs, any fresh herbs

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.280
are so much better.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.950
It's just like, fresh herbs
are like the really talented

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.180
backup singers to a not very
talented but very attractive

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.850
front singer, you know?

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.100
You're like, oh, she's
great, but the backup singers

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.730
make it amazing.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.260
That's what fresh
herbs are for me.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:22.820
And cilantro.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.460
Does anyone not like cilantro?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.664
Is anyone one of those people?

00:14:27.664 --> 00:14:29.894
OK, well, that's what I thought.

00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:32.060
Not liking-- because it
tastes very soapy to people.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.050
They just don't
like that flavor.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.000
Fresh lemon.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.160
Always have fresh
lemons on hand, OK?

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.010
And I'm a big person that
likes to use my hands.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.350
So I don't like to have to
get out the little strainer,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.410
and then do that, and
then wash the strainer.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.340
Just wash your hands
like an adult person,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.500
and it'll be totally fine.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.460
I'll see a lot of
chefs put on gloves.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.420
And then I'm just dying
to go to their house

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.220
and see if they put on gloves
when they cook themselves

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:00.730
dinner.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.510
And if they don't, then
you're totally fine.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.843
You don't have to put on gloves.

00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:05.180
Just wash your hands.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.580
Red bell pepper, or
orange, or yellow.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.670
Not green.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:16.080
There's a reason why you can get
five green bell peppers for $1,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.880
and you can get one
red bell pepper for $1.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.080
It tastes a lot better.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.120
It's just a sweeter product.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.930
Also, from a sort of
medical standpoint,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.670
sometimes green bell peppers
can have a little lower GI tract

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.570
issues with people, all right?

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.620
So as a chef, I want the
most flavor possible.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.190
So I'm on a quest for flavor.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.720
And I know the red
has a lot of flavor.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.400
That goes in.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.120
And then the gentleman
had a question

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.210
about extra virgin olive oil.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.490
And they do vary.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.260
They vary greatly.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.790
This is the olive
oil that I like.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.630
There is a photo of this
olive oil in my cookbook, OK?

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.360
I've tried a lot of olive oils.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.850
And what my girlfriend
and I have historically

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.230
done-- actually,
only once, I think--

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:10.960
is go to a grocery store
and say, that costs $15.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.094
I'm not going to buy
it unless I taste it.

00:16:13.094 --> 00:16:14.760
That's why farmers
markets are so great.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.930
So really, all of us
could get on a Google

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.910
bus-- I know they exist now--
and we can go to the store,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.849
and say all of us want to
try that one olive oil.

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:24.890
None of us are going to
buy it without trying it.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.014
And we can totally do that.

00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:28.700
And you can do that, and they'll
be like, that's a good idea.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.960
I've never tried that either.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.610
So olive oil.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.570
I like extra virgin
olive oil because I

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.090
like the flavor of it.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.150
But you also need to taste a lot
of different extra virgin olive

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.650
oils.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.590
So you can make an olive oil out
of any olive, and some of them

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.670
are not very palatable.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.480
I like this one because it has
a green but fruity taste to it

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.389
at the same time.

00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:54.430
And we can actually pass
this around and have you

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.195
guys take shots, hold
you by your ankles

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:57.320
or whatever you want to do.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.440
I don't even know
what works over here.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.600
But an olive oil is one
of those things that will

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.690
take care of lots of issues.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:12.800
So if something is too spicy,
the olive oil, the fat,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.510
will actually coat your
palate and make it less spicy.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.140
It'll make it more thick.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.569
If it's too thin, you can
emulsify it, like this will be,

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.300
and it thickens
up really nicely.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.849
And plus it just tastes amazing.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:26.900
Salt and pepper.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.280
Pepper, freshly ground.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.690
Does anyone like coffee?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.600
Coffee?

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.160
OK.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.840
Has anyone ever made coffee
with 10-year-old coffee grounds?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.590
It's disgusting.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.360
Even the thought makes
me want to puke, sort of.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.280
So fresh spice is
the same thing.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.660
So if you get the grocery store
fresh spices-- tomatoes takes

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.100
a lot of salt-- if you get the
grocery store fresh spices that

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.650
are already ground,
they could be years old,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.450
just like if you got
pre-ground coffee.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.290
It could be-- you don't know
how old it is, necessarily,

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.715
so you always get the whole
bean, freshly roasted, grind

00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:03.559
it yourself.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:05.600
Same thing with black
pepper, any sort of spices.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.880
It's totally, totally worth it.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.670
And the salt that I
use in here is just

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:14.740
regular kosher salt. $2.19
for the however many pounds

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.950
or whatever it is.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.680
And that's it.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.077
Unless you talk incessantly by
yourself in your own kitchen,

00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:23.910
you can certainly make
this faster than what

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.850
I'm making it here, OK?

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:26.790
But that's just me.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.450
I talk a lot by myself.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.170
We'll start out low just to
kind of see what happens.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.940
I feel like I'm on an
infomercial right now.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.590
And then you just keep
pressing it, and whatever,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.160
and then you--
Sheila, I need help.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.150
And then you just--
we have one of these.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.730
But I like the immersion
little wand guy.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.620
But this bad boy,
if you have one

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.040
of these, the you can
make it super silky,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.430
like really smooth.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.092
It's happening!

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.570
Maybe.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.081
We'll see.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.350
That's it.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.670
So I would normally
put this in the fridge,

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.030
let it chill out for a bit.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.120
Taste it.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.174
Tasting is also very important.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.180
If it needs more salt,
decide whether or not

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.710
you want to add a bit more acid.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.440
So acid will bring out the
natural sodium in food.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.523
So if you have anybody in
the family, or yourself,

00:19:41.523 --> 00:19:44.172
you're watching how much sodium
you intake, the last little bit

00:19:44.172 --> 00:19:46.130
you're like, hmm, does
it need more brightness,

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.390
or does it need more salt?

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.610
If it needs salt, salt it.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.880
If it needs brightness, you
can add a little more red wine

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.181
vinegar or lemon juice,
and that will actually

00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:55.430
bring up a little more sodium.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.130
So hey, that's pretty good.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.030
It's not that bad.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.480
This recipe actually works.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.050
Isn't that cool?

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.900
A little more black
pepper and a touch

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.830
of salt. Don't be
afraid of salt.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.447
Just do not be afraid
of salt. It makes it

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.030
so that you can
actually taste things.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.571
I mean, it's just
one of these things

00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:22.620
that if something's missing,
you're like, what's missing?

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.680
Chances are it's the
salt. And what I want you

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.047
to do--it's
mesmerizing isn't it?

00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:29.880
What I want you to get
in the habit of doing

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.636
is when you're making soups,
say this gazpacho or something,

00:20:32.636 --> 00:20:34.950
and you're not
quite sure what it

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.130
is that's missing,
what I want you to do

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.580
is take a little spoon
like I did earlier,

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.200
take the little spoon, and just
put a little bit of gazpacho

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800
on it, and then add just
like a couple dots of salt.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.830
Once you add the salt to this
giant thing, you're done.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.200
Maybe it needed acid.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.130
So my girlfriend Sarah and
I have a little tiny bowls

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.370
on the side, so we're
constantly feeding it

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.070
from this big amount
to a little bowl.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.528
And then will be like, oh, it
was the blank that we needed,

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:04.120
and then we'll add that,
finish the whole dish.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.450
So that's it.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.780
Even these Google
plates are beautiful.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.450
If you put it in the
fridge, any sort of bubbles

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.500
will settle out.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.870
But this seems to be good to go.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.420
And then to let
people know what's

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.220
in it, just a little
bit of cilantro

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.850
that you won't have to
share with Mike or Victoria

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.520
because they don't like it.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.930
A little bit of black pepper.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.800
And then this little flair
is what gets everybody.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.850
This is what you can
charge the extra $1.10

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.885
at your restaurants, is just
that little bit right there.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.800
So there you are.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.270
So you can feed lots
and lots of people

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.350
with a watermelon and a
couple vegetables that

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.800
are in season and super
full of flavor already.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.560
So that is the first
recipe, everybody.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.970
So there you have it.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.530
Have at it.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.990
Thanks, Chef.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.350
You got it?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.622
You guys are so quiet.

00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:09.030
Oh, yes.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.930
Where can you buy
a-- no, I'm kidding.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.694
Yes, question.

00:22:11.694 --> 00:22:13.110
AUDIENCE: Can I
have your blender?

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.207
No, just kidding.

00:22:15.207 --> 00:22:17.790
NATHAN LYON: Well, do you have
one of the little swipey things

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.790
you can get in places?

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.107
Because I don't.

00:22:20.107 --> 00:22:22.190
The question, I think, is
can I have your blunder.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.409
Is that right?

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:24.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
the real question

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.690
is, I like to get
balsamic vinegar,

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.137
but it always seems
to go more sour.

00:22:32.137 --> 00:22:33.720
I don't know if
that's my imagination,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.430
or maybe I got
the wrong vinegar.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.194
How do I keep it
staying fresh and tasty?

00:22:39.194 --> 00:22:41.360
NATHAN LYON: Balsamic vinegar
is one of those things

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.710
that they're already aged.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:47.000
So if it's a good
balsamic-- I actually

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.512
like all the Lucchini products.

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:50.470
I don't get paid by them,
I'm not pimping them,

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.470
but I just happen to like it.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.204
I've tasted a lot of
stuff that I like.

00:22:53.204 --> 00:22:55.370
I like the red wine, white
wine, and their balsamic,

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.070
because it's aged, and then
it's aged in oak barrels.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.677
So age actually gives it more
character, which is lovely.

00:23:02.677 --> 00:23:05.260
If you're spending-- not here,
because I didn't spend anything

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.093
on the cappuccino I
just got-- but if you're

00:23:07.093 --> 00:23:08.540
outside of Google land, right?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.950
And you have to pay for
your coffee, and it's $3.50,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.620
but you're only spending
$2.16 on a bottle this big

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.840
of balsamic vinegar,
that tells you something.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.710
Everything that that balsamic
touches should make it vibrant

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.340
and beautiful and delicious.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.030
It shouldn't make
your face implode

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.270
and be like, whoah, that
is just crazy off balance.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.900
It should be balanced.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.480
So is that balsamic
worth the money?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.730
I mean, I think the Lucchini
balsamic is like 15 bucks,

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.610
but it's going to last you
months and months and months.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.040
Whereas I don't know what
$15 is for cappuccinos,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.540
but it's like, what, four
mornings of cappuccinos?

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.270
So you sort of have to
say, it was two years aged,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:54.270
and it came from Modena, Italy
all the way across to New York,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.970
all the way across
to California,

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.770
and I'm only paying $15 for it.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.360
And it will make
everything blossom

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.690
into something delicious.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.740
So I guess that's sort of, in
a very long way, an answer.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.050
So sometimes you have to
spend a little bit more

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.289
than nothing for the
balsamic vinegar.

00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:13.080
AUDIENCE: And I do I
keep it in the fridge,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.867
or just like the oil?

00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:16.200
NATHAN LYON: Just don't heat it.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.910
You don't want to heat it up.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.070
We have vinegars and olive
oils, and our stove is here,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.960
but it's sort of
off to the side,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.280
because sometimes the
heat can radiate and cook

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.390
things, mostly things that are
a bit more delicate like that.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.540
So I have nine minutes
and 43 seconds.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.640
We're going to bang out
this second recipe, right?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.624
It involves heat, and
one of these cool things

00:24:39.624 --> 00:24:41.540
that I heard, all of us
get one of these stove

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.330
tops at home, which
is really exciting.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.240
I'm going to press this,
and I'm going to press this.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.608
I think I'm doing this right.

00:24:51.608 --> 00:24:52.108
Hey, Chef?

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.410
And then you see this-- if you
take the square root of that--

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.785
JENNA TAYLOR: I have one person
who touches these stoves.

00:25:01.785 --> 00:25:04.690
NATHAN LYON: --and I multiply
that by-- that's right.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.900
This one.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.670
Geez, these are so cool.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.110
I don't know if you guys
rent one bedrooms here,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.750
but this is awesome.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.250
Like this kitchen
is pretty awesome.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.330
You've seen my kitchen.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.720
You know what it looks like.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.220
OK.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:25.137
So Chef, can we got some samples
of the watermelon gazpacho?

00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:26.220
Could you bring those out?

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.350
Those are coming out now.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.790
Second thing.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.040
This is fall coming in.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:41.070
So cauliflower is
one of those things

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:45.030
that it's not a
super wow them thing.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.840
You can roast them.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.900
You need a high heat
for cauliflower,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.120
because it's like 92% water.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.170
So you need a lot of high
heat to bring some flavor out.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.980
So I'm putting this on seven,
which isn't incinerate,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.420
but it's pretty darn hot.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.010
And we're just going
to let that heat up.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.940
Does anybody have one of
these food processors?

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.270
Ah.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.790
We need to get a Google
food processor for you

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.541
so you can just have them.

00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:14.290
Food processors--
actually, you know what?

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.440
The immersion wand, or immersion
blender, which is like $38,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.760
it comes with a mini
version of one of these.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.080
So it'll take you three times.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.250
Just cut it in thirds and
you can totally do that.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.620
But they really come in handy.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.104
Really, really do.

00:26:31.104 --> 00:26:32.520
Just going to peel
these guys off.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.103
They come in lots
of different colors,

00:26:34.103 --> 00:26:38.930
so you can make this in green,
purple, all the different

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:39.600
colors here.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.975
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:43.900
to cut this out,
cut out the stem,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.560
save it, because it's
really delicious.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.440
You just peel it with
your vegetable peeler,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.920
with your ambidextrous vegetable
peelers that you have at home.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.920
And what I want to do
is just break it off

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.875
into sort of like
regular bite-size pieces.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.591
And put it in the
food processor.

00:27:03.591 --> 00:27:05.340
Or you can just work
on your knife skills,

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.880
and just chop it like
it owes you money.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.125
Just chop it.

00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:10.000
You can do that, too.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.190
Or you just borrow
his food processor.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.904
So that goes on.

00:27:16.904 --> 00:27:18.070
And we're going to pulse it.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.410
So it's like the size
of a grain of rice.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.040
There we go.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.540
So I know some of
these, we're going

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.830
to have to pull out
and have a snack.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.330
I just don't want
to go, but I can't

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:48.150
risk having it go liquid on me.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.734
So-- these are just so crazy.

00:27:50.734 --> 00:27:51.900
How do you get this one off?

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Left.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.390
NATHAN LYON: Easy.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.460
Thank you very much.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:28:00.050
So the pan should be hot enough
to where it at least bubbles

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.860
and or barely starts to smoke.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.950
The reason for that is,
if the pan's too cool

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.270
and you were to add the
olive oil and then this,

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.647
it would just steam.

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:11.980
And then it would just be mushy.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.688
And then you could be
like, oh, actually,

00:28:13.688 --> 00:28:15.650
instead of having this
cauliflower couscous,

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:19.430
we're going to have cauliflower
with cauliflower puree, which

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.660
wouldn't be such a bad thing.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.784
So I have that go in.

00:28:23.784 --> 00:28:25.450
And we're already
getting a few bubbles,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.408
which is really nice,
which we're going to see.

00:28:30.182 --> 00:28:31.140
Get that bad boy going.

00:28:35.112 --> 00:28:35.820
Put that in here.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.812
Any questions about
your samples, guys?

00:28:40.554 --> 00:28:41.470
You guys are so funny.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.600
Can't wait to exchange
Google numbers with you guys

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.320
or whatever I have to
do to be in the fold.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.940
Do you get free TCHO
Chocolate over there?

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.300
So cool.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.720
My goodness, it's just the best.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.860
Man.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.030
And I met up with the
chefs earlier for lunch.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.300
You guys have some
really talented chefs.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.250
I mean, if you see a chef,
or someone even playing

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.100
a chef on campus, I guess
you would call it, just say,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.460
hey, great job.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.610
It is literally the hardest
job I have ever had,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.460
is being a chef in a restaurant.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.890
So cauliflower goes
in, salt. So I'm

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.560
going to season it
with salt from up here.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.840
I'm not going to just
go, bew, right there.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.619
So when you season
it, you can see

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:39.910
it's sort of falling like
it-- actually, it's the wind,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.390
so it's sort of falling on me.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.900
But you can as
it's falling, it's

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.920
falling evenly, like a pyramid.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.220
So if you were to
just hit that, whoever

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.930
gets that bite might
be a little bit,

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:58.790
like, just cut back on the
salt just a smidge, OK?

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:03.920
So all I want to do is--
either it's about to explode

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.775
and we all should just run
for it-- while that's cooking,

00:30:08.775 --> 00:30:10.650
and I think it's still--
yeah, it's still on.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:11.900
It's on eight.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.590
While it's cooking, we're
going to add a few more things.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.800
Not to that, but to this bowl.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.740
Shallot.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.985
You guys cook with
shallots at all?

00:30:23.985 --> 00:30:26.360
Shallots are-- I want to make
sure you can see-- shallots

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.859
one of those things
you can actually

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:30.206
eat raw, which is why
chefs use shallots.

00:30:30.206 --> 00:30:31.580
You can use them
in vinaigrettes.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.970
You wouldn't necessarily eat the
red onion raw, but the shallot

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.170
you totally could.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.180
So we're going to
make a vinaigrette.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.892
And when this comes out, we're
going to-- thank you very much.

00:30:45.892 --> 00:30:47.600
We're going to just
make the vinaigrette,

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.683
everything goes in here,
put that on top, stir it,

00:30:49.683 --> 00:30:51.530
and we're going to
serve it, right?

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.502
Three minutes and 23
seconds of fame, here we go.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.460
So I fully expect that we have
this email chain later on today

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.860
that I see that everyone
has a chef's knife

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.910
that they really
like working with.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.160
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.176
NATHAN LYON: Yes, sir.

00:31:12.176 --> 00:31:14.301
AUDIENCE: So determining
the sharpness of the knife

00:31:14.301 --> 00:31:17.390
and what you can
actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.589
NATHAN LYON: Yes.

00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:20.880
AUDIENCE: So how do you do
it and what are [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.255
JENNA TAYLOR: So
the question is,

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.750
how do you determine the
appropriate sharpness

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.820
for your knife?

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.110
How do you keep it
at that sharpness?

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.950
I wonder about that myself.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.230
NATHAN LYON: You know, when
I went to culinary school,

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.040
I got really nerdville
on knives, like,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.600
just getting them so sharp that
if I look at them I get cut.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.910
Like really sharp.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:47.777
Now, quite honestly, you
have these sharpeners

00:31:47.777 --> 00:31:50.110
that you can get over the
counter at Bed Bath and Beyond

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.610
or whatever.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:56.580
It's called Chefs-- Sarah, what
is that, the sharpener we have,

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.320
babe?

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.430
Chefs-- what is it?

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.930
It's like a little sharpener
that-- pull it off to the side.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.221
It's like a little sharpener
that you can push and pull

00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:06.910
through.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.070
Those things, quite
honestly, are totally fine.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.295
If you want to geek
over it, farmers markets

00:32:12.295 --> 00:32:13.670
will have people
that sharpen it.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.590
Or your local butcher
will have a sharpener

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.640
that you can
sharpen your knives.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.240
The only thing that you
really need, quite honestly,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.810
is a honing steel.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:29.590
What you don't need is you don't
need the 21-block knife set.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.360
I have so many knives.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.380
I use this knife
95% of the time.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.394
So I really only
need a sharp knife.

00:32:35.394 --> 00:32:37.060
So if I say, what's
your favorite knife?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.120
You're like, oh, the
one that's sharp,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.245
the one that actually cuts.

00:32:39.245 --> 00:32:41.260
That's my favorite one.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.390
So a honing steel will take a
sharp knife and keep it sharp.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.130
If you have a dull knife,
it needs to be sharpened.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.690
A honing steel will do
nothing for a dull knife.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.170
So every once in
a while, after I'm

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.519
done cooking for like 15
minutes, and I'll just hone it,

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.185
which straightens the
blade a little bit

00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.740
and aligns the blade.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.030
And then I just keep going.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.640
And to answer your question, I
want them as sharp as possible.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.510
I want them crazy sharp, because
that makes my job as a chef

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.342
easier.

00:33:11.342 --> 00:33:13.050
I don't have to work
through the product.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.180
I want to make friends
with the product.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.920
So what I'm adding here is
a lot of cilantro-- sorry,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.290
Victoria-- a lot of
cilantro, and also a lot

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.275
of parsley, flat
leaf Italian parsley.

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:27.900
AUDIENCE: One more
question over there.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.730
NATHAN LYON: Yes.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.280
Yes.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:29.980
AUDIENCE: Similar
to the question

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.148
about knives, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:31.148 --> 00:33:33.950
Talk to us about
your favorite pan.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.550
NATHAN LYON: My favorite pan?

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.330
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.920
My favorite pan,
another great question.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.610
Pots and pans are
one of those things

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:43.530
that are also very personal.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:48.580
I find that if the pot or pan
is too heavy-- like All-Clad

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.200
is sort of the
industry standard,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.740
but it has a straight handle,
so it puts a lot of stress

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.780
on your styloid process.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.420
So it's actually a little
bit uncomfortable for me.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.220
Let's see.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.428
What are the ones-- we have
a lot-- what are the ones

00:34:02.428 --> 00:34:04.860
that we use?

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.670
Yeah, Calphalon.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.610
Calphalon Contemporary Series
stainless steel is great.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.159
It's just inexpensive,
and it works really well,

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.210
and it has a handle.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.879
It's curved, which I like.

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:18.420
And it's stainless
steel, which means

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.400
it's going to get a good sear
on the fish or the steak.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.050
And you can make fond out
of it rather than nonstick.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.300
It's a great question, though.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.110
I mean, that's one of those,
like an eight-set piece.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.260
I have four burners.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.159
Why do I need a 12-
or 15-piece set?

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:37.659
Like I can only literally
cook four at a time.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.400
Parmesan.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.270
Parmigiano reggiano, which
we talked about before.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.909
When you get a block of
Parmesan, that's better.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.270
And then rewrap it really well.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.030
It'll live indefinitely
in your fridge, OK?

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.030
So this is already caramelized.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.110
It's a little bit
brown, which is nice.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:57.630
A lot of water vapor
has gone away from it.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.730
Get a little bit
of flavor in there.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.291
Kosher salt, seasoning
from up high,

00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:04.540
as we talked about earlier,
a little bit in my pocket.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.600
There we go.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.710
That's good.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.300
Freshly ground black pepper.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.006
Lemon juice and olive oil.

00:35:13.006 --> 00:35:14.880
I already did, I think,
a half a lemon juice.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.420
Let's get it going in here.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.520
Catch the seeds.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.380
They go here, and
then olive oil.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.790
And I'm doing it around the side
so it doesn't soak up directly

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.204
into it.

00:35:28.204 --> 00:35:30.870
And then what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to fold it, just

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.220
fold it together.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.850
And then up here on
my left-hand side,

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:39.610
I do have the pine nuts
that we had toasted earlier.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.080
And then how I toast my pine
nuts, and all nuts, in fact,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.850
is in your cookbook that you
have in front of you right now.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:46.660
Pine nuts.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.411
They come from pine trees,
from freaking pine cones.

00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.660
They are expensive, and
that's why they are expensive.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.270
So let's not burn them.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.240
And when they're good,
they're just like so good.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.595
So I'm going to get some of
these and pop those on top.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.810
Other than one
allergy to pine nuts,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.150
does anyone not like pine nuts?

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.461
Great.

00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:09.610
They're all going in there.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:10.942
That's fantastic.

00:36:10.942 --> 00:36:12.650
And then what we'll
do is we'll taste it.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.170
So we have an acid,
which is the lemon juice.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.830
We also have salt, which
is in the form of salt.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.201
And then we also have the
cheese, which has salt in it

00:36:21.201 --> 00:36:21.700
also.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.866
So it's a little bit different
because it's buttery.

00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:26.277
So we'll give it a flavor,
a little flavor test here.

00:36:26.277 --> 00:36:27.610
And then we'll see what happens.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.240
It's like I made it before.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.030
This is really-- it's
great, because it

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.830
has a lot of fresh herbs in it.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.972
Never be afraid of herbs.

00:36:40.972 --> 00:36:43.180
People are like, what do
you do with all those herbs?

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.290
You use them.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.400
I mean, you just use them.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.160
And the more herbs, the better.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.206
It's like when you
have Thai food,

00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:52.830
they just throw so
many herbs on there.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:53.770
There's never been
a moment I was

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.850
like, that's a lot of herbs.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.308
Can you just cut
back on the herbs?

00:36:56.308 --> 00:37:01.600
I've always been very happy with
the volume of herbs in my food.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.560
And again, you eat
with your eyes.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.230
Make it really pretty.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:10.450
I'm not a-- I'm not
one of those dudes that

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.791
has the tweezer things.

00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:15.790
There's nowhere in my
cookbook this says, go out

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.720
and get a thing of surgical
tweezers to compose your food.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.650
I'm not saying you
can't, because I've

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:25.420
seen some beautifully
composed dishes.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.600
But because I feel that
we're all family now,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.220
this is all family style.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.260
And we can all pass
this around here

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.915
at Team Google-- I'm just
coming up with these things

00:37:35.915 --> 00:37:36.540
left and right.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.770
And I used all the cheese.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.770
But if you had a little
fresh cheese, the block,

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.395
you would just shave
some over the top,

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:47.130
because that's really sexy, and
it's just beautiful big pieces

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.210
of Parmesan.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.970
And that's the second dish.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:53.929
Super fast, all within zero
seconds, which I'm sure

00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:55.720
has been there for at
least a little while.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.880
Could be, could be.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.100
That's it, guys.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.600
I'm sure you would tell me if
I had stuff in my teeth, which

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.270
I'm sure I do.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.740
But thanks for your time.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.320
Any questions, I'm
ready to take them

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.507
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:11.507 --> 00:38:13.590
JENNA TAYLOR: I have a
question about cauliflower.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.150
NATHAN LYON: Question.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.191
JENNA TAYLOR: It's one of
my favorite vegetables.

00:38:16.191 --> 00:38:16.710
I love it.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.120
But I notice that
sometimes I buy a head,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.630
and it sits in my fridge, and
it has a terrible strong smell.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.700
And sometimes it's
completely neutral.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.070
It doesn't smell like anything,
completely unoffensive.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.220
What causes that?

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.500
How do I differentiate?

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.090
Does it matter?

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.460
NATHAN LYON: I mean, it's
breaking down, for one.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.240
It's the same-- I believe
it's the same family as kale.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.950
Like kale will give
you that same smell.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.990
If it's constricted
at all-- you want

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.820
to make sure the airflow
happens around it.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.250
I'm using the
analogy of the kale.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.470
When you get kale home and
it has that little twisty tie

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.620
and or fresh herbs, you need to
get it out of that twisty tie.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.200
It doesn't like
to be constrained,

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.700
because when they're
smooshed together like that,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.940
the leaves or the
herbs, what happens

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.639
is any of that moisture
will actually begin to rot.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:05.930
And that's when it breaks down.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:06.770
Think of spinach.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.782
When you get a bag
of spinach, and it's

00:39:08.782 --> 00:39:10.990
been sitting in your fridge
or in your crisper drawer

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.590
that you call like
the death drawer

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.240
or whatever you call,
because right now

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.960
there's a bunch of flaccid
vegetables in your death

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.220
drawer.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.205
I know it for a fact.

00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:20.664
We could go take a
Google van, I know it.

00:39:20.664 --> 00:39:23.080
It's just because, when you
look at the bottom of the bag,

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.320
you're like, ooh, that's
weird dark spinach juice.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.780
That's disgusting.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.420
It's because it can't breathe.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.350
So if I ever get fresh-- if
I'm traveling doing something,

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.607
and I want a salad, I'll
get the package of salad,

00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:38.190
and I'll poke a bunch of holes
in it and put it in the fridge.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.372
The holes will
allow it to exhale,

00:39:40.372 --> 00:39:42.330
but it won't dehydrate
hydrate because it's not

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.910
completely exposed.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.670
So that's why the
crisper drawer is there,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.090
so it won't dehydrate
it like it would if it's

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.650
on top of just a drawer.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:52.779
So it stays cool enough.

00:39:52.779 --> 00:39:54.320
But you need to let
it breathe, also.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.910
But that's a great question.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.290
Great question.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.790
OK.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.690
The question is, what are my
favorite spices to cook with?

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.202
I think that sort of
depends on the cuisine.

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:05.910
It's interesting.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.326
So when you look at spices and
you're thinking, all right,

00:40:08.326 --> 00:40:13.680
well, here's a chili and cumin
and fennel, or definitely

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.100
cumin.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.580
One of our friends who's on
Food Network, Aarti Sequeira,

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.180
she's like, oh, that's
my people's food.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.030
That's Indian food.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.500
And actually, the
dude from El Salvador

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.530
is like, actually,
that's our people's food.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.485
So depending upon
what date the spice

00:40:28.485 --> 00:40:30.776
trades came through your
country, I guess that depends.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.620
I really love cumin.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.870
I just love cumin.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.380
I love fresh fennel.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.260
But I also like
growing things at home.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.067
So we have a curry tree at home.

00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:47.150
It's like four years old,
but it's only this tall.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.270
It's unbelievably slow grower.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:56.310
But with those three things,
you can just make so much food.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.240
But black pepper is one of those
things that I have to have.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.220
And we bang through--
our black pepper grinder

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.230
is about this big, and we rip
through this olive oil, and one

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.640
this big, every month.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.420
Like we just kill it.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.470
We just rip through it.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.610
If you're not just
destroying your olive oil,

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.629
put it on your cereal.

00:41:13.629 --> 00:41:14.670
I don't care what you do.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.282
But it's just so good for
you, and it tastes so good.

00:41:17.282 --> 00:41:18.240
Great question, though.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:18.790
Thank you.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.660
Any more questions, guys?

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:19.980
Yes, sir.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.550
AUDIENCE: Besides olive oil,
other cooking oils and choosing

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.160
one versus another?

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.410
NATHAN LYON: So the question
is, other than olive oil,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.810
what are other oils
that I would use?

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.810
So I mainly use olive oil.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.810
And I use grape seed oil.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:39.590
So one is for most utilitarian
things, like the olive oil.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.420
But higher temperatures, I
would use grape seed oil,

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.600
also keeping in mind that Sarah,
my girlfriend and executive

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.200
sous chef, we do a lot of
drought-friendly recipes.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.350
And grapes, wine grapes don't
take a lot of water to grow,

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.122
and the seeds are already there.

00:41:53.122 --> 00:41:54.080
So you just press them.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.230
So you have this double whammy.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.100
It's a neutral oil and it
has a very high smoke point,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.420
and it's heart healthy.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.000
So those two.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.186
So if I'm making a
vinaigrette or a mayonnaise

00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:04.560
that I want to
flavor and I don't

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.685
want it to taste like olive
oil, I would definitely

00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:07.810
use grape seed oil.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.506
And it's just a lovely
oil to work with.

00:42:10.506 --> 00:42:11.130
Great question.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.960
Thank you.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.240
Any more questions?

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.540
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.140
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any common go to recipes

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.600
when you're at home and just
want to make something quick?

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.190
NATHAN LYON: Because I worked
at farmers markets for 10 years,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.610
it depends what we
brought back in the truck.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.120
We always have lemons.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.050
Like right now, we have
a lot of stone fruit.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.430
The thing is, I've gotten
to the point where I just

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.480
love fresh produce so much.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.550
I just love it so much that
I let it sort of guide me.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.410
So the other day we
had so many peaches,

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.910
these lovely yellow
peaches, O'Henry peaches.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.080
But we had lemons, too.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.950
And I was like, oh,
well, let's just

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:53.100
take those O'Henry peaches.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.160
We'll peel them.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.250
We'll throw in a little
bit of diced fresh mint

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.600
and I'll make a simple
syrup with organic sugar.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.060
And then I'll have lemon
zest with the lemon juice.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.639
And that right there
that's peach sorbet.

00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:06.430
And all I had to do
was put it in a blender

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.513
and throw it in the
processor, or in your freezer,

00:43:08.513 --> 00:43:11.520
and just put it in the processor
after it's already frozen.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.730
With the rest the peaches,
we'll make into a chutney,

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.710
like a peach spicy-- fresh
ginger peach chutney.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.690
So and I learned a
lot of these things

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:21.560
from chefs that
I've worked under.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.940
But I've also learned
a lot just from being

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.700
at farmers markets,
because chances are,

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.250
your local chefs are
standing right next to you

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.170
getting stuff from
them, and just listening

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.327
what people do with that.

00:43:32.327 --> 00:43:34.660
Because I'll do that all the
time, and I sell the stuff.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.118
But I go, oh, what would you
do-- how do you pick that out?

00:43:37.118 --> 00:43:39.700
And they go, oh, I do this and
this is what I do with that.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.366
And then I step on it and run it
over the car, whatever they do.

00:43:42.366 --> 00:43:43.650
Which is very interesting.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.774
And you learn a lot from that.

00:43:45.774 --> 00:43:47.440
But right now, because
it's summer time,

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.790
and it is hot in our
house, hot, so we

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.520
don't really want
to turn on the oven.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.860
So heirloom tomatoes, burrata
cheese, lots of fresh herbs.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.997
I'll turn on the grill
outside and grill up

00:43:59.997 --> 00:44:01.830
crostini with olive oil
and salt and pepper,

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.891
and we'll just monch
it, just go crazy.

00:44:04.891 --> 00:44:05.390
Yeah.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:07.360
But whatever we do,
there's just the two of us.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.060
And we eat.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.400
We eat.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.010
Capital eat.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.020
We just Google it down.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.140
We kill it.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.980
Good question.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.919
But thank you.

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.710
I mean, whatever's in
the season of summer,

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.369
really, we'll just destroy it.

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:21.160
Any more questions?

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.371
You had another question?

00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:23.620
AUDIENCE: So how does that go?

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.520
JENNA TAYLOR: So what's your
process for creating recipes?

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.470
Do you each your mistakes?

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.090
How do you filter them out?

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.420
NATHAN LYON: Everyone
eats their mistakes.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.978
Never make this mistake again.

00:44:34.978 --> 00:44:37.100
JENNA TAYLOR: Those
tears, one at a time.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.808
NATHAN LYON: My
girlfriend's very strong.

00:44:38.808 --> 00:44:41.690
Eat, eat that mistake.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.890
It's not quite that bad.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:50.260
But the process is,
because I teach on TV,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.450
it has to be accessible
to the home cook

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.330
regardless where
you get your food,

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.560
be it in the farmers
market in Palo Alto,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.950
or at-- the majority
of Americans

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.870
get their stuff from Wal Mart.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.040
And then we'll sometimes also
go to different grocery stores

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.400
to get a particular
product, and then

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.129
design the recipe making
sure that it works with all

00:45:09.129 --> 00:45:11.670
of those different products from
all those different sources,

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:14.420
because it's just simply not
fair being in California,

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.570
being like, you
know, in December,

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.160
when we eat Driscoll
strawberries

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.510
from the organic garden
and the virgin cherubs come

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.230
and they pick them for us--
like that's just not fair

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.180
when you're freezing your
changs off in Maine, right?

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.760
So-- what's the question?

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.540
I just got a little
bit distracted.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.620
JENNA TAYLOR: How do
you create recipes?

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.720
NATHAN LYON: So creating--
thank you so much.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.990
Glad people are
paying attention.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:39.560
Creating recipes
is sort of like,

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.940
what do we have a lot
of in the kitchen?

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.720
What do we not
necessarily-- what direction

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.884
have we not gone into?

00:45:46.884 --> 00:45:48.800
That's why when we eat
out, we'll eat out food

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.870
that we're not
necessarily familiar with,

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:54.560
but you want to educate
America and make

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.320
it accessible for them.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.880
So my dad hated eggplant.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.687
He hated eggplant,
or brussels sprouts.

00:46:01.687 --> 00:46:03.270
My mom would just
cook it until it was

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.280
like mushy brussels sprout ass.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.800
It was horrible, and your
kitchen smelled horrible.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.300
But then I came to
California, and I

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.830
was like, oh, roasted
brussels sprouts

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.070
with balsamic and shallots.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.625
So delicious.

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:15.360
It' crispy, it's sweet.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.560
It is a vastly different animal.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.950
So we also try to think
out of the box and say,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.420
most people eat it this way.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.110
How do we prepare
it a different way?

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.930
So they're not just bored
with the same old routine of,

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.390
these are my five
dishes I always turn to.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.420
My family likes two
of them, but I'm

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.410
going to make them
because I'm tired.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:35.119
So how can we reinvent
the cauliflower

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:36.910
to where you don't just
have to either make

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.310
a puree out of it--
which is delicious--

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.960
throw it in a food processor,
steam it with butter, salt

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.460
and pepper, done.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:47.370
Or you can cut into slabs and
throw it in your broiler at 450

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.620
with a lot of spices, and make
these big slabs, or steaks.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.540
Done.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.470
So we're trying to say, how do
you utilize the same ingredient

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.210
in a new and exciting way
that perhaps hasn't been done

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:00.770
before, or sort of
splinter off in a way

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.910
that all Americans will be
like, I can totally do that.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.010
I have-- except for the young
lady on my left-- I totally

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:08.717
have this.

00:47:08.717 --> 00:47:10.300
So that's why I
designed the gazpacho.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.674
Instead of making
people be like,

00:47:11.674 --> 00:47:14.080
oh, you're going to do
this brunoisette of this,

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.538
and people aren't
going to do that.

00:47:15.538 --> 00:47:17.557
But they can go
bzzz, dinner's ready.

00:47:17.557 --> 00:47:19.140
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.380
It's sort of like, what
do we cook for ourselves?

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.800
What do we cook for
drought-friendly recipes

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.630
for this demographic?

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.180
The show that I got
the Emmy nomination for

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.050
is a slightly
different demographic

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.140
than Food Network or PBS.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.190
So we have to kind of figure
out what goes in what slot.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.350
But that's a fantastic question.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Sounds like
just playing in your kitchen

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.207
with whatever's current,
fresh, vibrant produce.

00:47:43.207 --> 00:47:44.665
NATHAN LYON: With
the rest of that,

00:47:44.665 --> 00:47:46.530
the rest of the
watermelon, we would just

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:47.772
go hog wild on that bad boy.

00:47:47.772 --> 00:47:49.230
JENNA TAYLOR: Google
it right down.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.938
NATHAN LYON: I'm going
to Google it down.

00:47:50.938 --> 00:47:53.330
Put it up on my Google
wall of whatever you--

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.610
I don't know what you guys do.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:55.550
JENNA TAYLOR: Googly.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.920
Googly is the word you
can start applying now.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.560
NATHAN LYON: Googly?

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:57.920
JENNA TAYLOR: Googly.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.810
It's a thing.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.540
NATHAN LYON: Feel
like being tickled.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.577
So Googly.

00:48:02.577 --> 00:48:04.160
JENNA TAYLOR: Well,
thank you so much.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:04.797
Anything else?

00:48:04.797 --> 00:48:05.880
NATHAN LYON: I don't know.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Thank you so much.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.683
NATHAN LYON: Thanks, guys.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.330
Thank you.
