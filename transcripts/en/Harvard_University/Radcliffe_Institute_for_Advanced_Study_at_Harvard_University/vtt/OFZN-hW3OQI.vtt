00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.380
- Thank you so much, Judy, for
such a detailed introduction.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.570
You actually added a lot to my
presentation, a lot of details

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.660
that I want talk, so that's
really great, memorable.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.310
That's usual.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.030
I don't know how you
can do this every time.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.250
Thanks Dean Cohen, Judy, Sharon,
Rebecca, Jess, Marguerita,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.490
Andrew, Cameron, and
my fellow fellows

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.760
for making my experience
at Radcliffe so enjoyable.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.920
A special thanks
to Yukio Lippit,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.440
Meg Rotzel, Joe Zane for taking
care of the art fellows, Kathy

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.350
King and Geoff Booras
from the ceramics

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.160
program for the assistance
with my technically challenging

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.730
project, and my lovely
assistant, Morgan Spalling.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.010
Thank you everyone
who came out today.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.850
The selection of works
I'm presenting today

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.000
are not in chronological
order and span

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.730
a period of almost 10 years.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.590
I'm more interested in
reflecting on my work

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.450
as a constellation
of overlapping

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.720
relationships and
circular readings rather

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.850
than a linear trajectory.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.880
There is always more to
say than I have time for,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.800
and I hope that
there always will be.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.340
I will cover a lot
in this lecture,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.770
and we'll move fast
through different works,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.700
linking them by theme,
process, and other interests.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.520
I thought that this format would
give you a generous overview

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.880
of my practice.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.830
I hope it works.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.880
You tell me at the end.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.640
My work is concerned
with circulation

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960
at the level of the body, at
the level of global industry,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.140
and all levels in between.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.230
It tracks materials,
ideologies, and bodies

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.420
that travel by foot,
by car, by plane,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.300
and by my own semantic
displacements.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.790
Circulation and displacement
are at the core of my work

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.080
and the core of the work
that you were looking at.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.710
"Point Zero" is a wall coated
in iron-rich soil relocated

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.800
from Brasilia, Brazil's capital.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.860
Later, a sample of
the same soil was

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.220
turned into a custom
made silkscreen ink

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.670
and used to print
a chart of my steps

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.730
as I follow after
so many others.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.070
"Brasilia By Foot" maps a
series of shortcuts generated

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.650
by pedestrian's
movements overlaid

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.420
on the modernist outline of
Brasilia's monumental axis.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.200
While the satellite image shows
the accumulation of thread

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.370
lines through the grass,
the five soil ink prints

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.250
charge the number
of steps required

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.250
to traverse those
paths, establishing

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.600
a direct relationship between
the scale of the human body

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.160
and the scale of the city
designed for the car.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.980
My work is informed
by a lifetime

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.880
of cultural dislocation
and voluntary migrations,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.300
starting with my birth
in southern Brazil

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.660
within a community of
Italian immigrants descents,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.910
following by growing
up in Brasilia,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.270
Brazil's modernist-planned
capital, whose population

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.590
reflects Brazil's cultural and
ethnic diversity, attending

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.830
college in Sao Paolo, graduate
school in Los Angeles,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.380
with many other
stops in between.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.140
Some moves were initiated by my
parents, others by my own will,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.470
and lately, the current
privileged mobility I

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.810
came to acquire as an artist.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.410
I mention this almost
constant mobility

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.700
because negotiating difference,
diversity, multiplicity,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.370
hybridisation,
and otherness have

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.670
become the places from which
I engage with art making.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.250
I'm interested in movement as
displacement and its resulting

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.870
transformations.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.710
This early work,
"Unmapping the World,"

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.390
tells of this
desire to emancipate

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.080
fixed ideas about places.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.170
It is a series of
road map drawings made

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.649
by balling up blank
sheets of tracing paper

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.200
and drawing the globe
on the resulting three

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.400
dimensional surface to
then flatten them back

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.840
into their original
two-dimensional form.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.680
This simple gesture fragments
the globe contours and presents

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.970
an ever-changing world
map configuration.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.670
One of the first works I
made in graduate school

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.930
has also proved appreciant
of my continuing interests.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.560
For [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE],,
or "Portuguese Balls,"

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.490
I used to sugar, a Brazilian
export and a symbol of its

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.400
colonial past and
post-colonial present,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.060
to create casts of the
[INAUDIBLE] space in my mouth

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.910
as I formed each of
the Portuguese vowels--

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.490
ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.300
On the one hand, my language is
my identity, but on the other,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.930
I am a foreigner
in my own tongue.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.230
Language is a foreign
agent in my mouth,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.510
a colonial imposition, and to
speak is to voice my otherness.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.570
The piece was a meditation
on my personal experience

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.970
of dislocation and
an acknowledgment

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.090
of the colonial histories
that formed Brazil.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.100
Most of the works
I've made since

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.120
continue to circle
around those topics.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.380
Far from isolating myself in
a conventional studio routine,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.340
my work stems from dialogue
with other disciplines

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.290
such as history, architecture,
archeology, anthropology,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.230
even literature and
science fiction.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.610
I research academic sources
with a non-academic approach.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.450
I usually look for details
regarded as insignificant

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.020
in a larger context.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.840
I am drawn to material
evidence of histories

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.940
that define a place.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.200
I pull information from
all sorts of sources

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.330
and give equal
importance to all of it.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.040
My goal is never
to prove a thesis,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.520
because I never have a
thesis to start with.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.060
My work are entry points
in intricate subjects

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.020
and never tell the whole story.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.270
They are just a translation of
my intense mental and emotional

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.860
activity into materiality,
and yet, this coming together

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.430
tends to happen spontaneously
and organically.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.610
So for example,
this installation,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.150
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE],,
which is currently

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.030
on view at the
Blanton Museum of Art,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.080
investigates the impact of
industrialization in the Amazon

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.040
region and the material culture
of the indigenous groups

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.160
in the area.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.950
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE],,
or "Meeting of Waters,"

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.950
takes its name from the
confluence of the Negro

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.370
and upper Amazon rivers at
the port of the Brazilian city

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.990
of Manaus.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.350
For nearly four miles
after they meet,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.830
the black and beige waters
run parallel to each other

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.870
but did not intermix.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.690
The Port of Manaus
serves as another type

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.780
of confluence point,
that of foreign capital

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.390
and local traditions.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.060
Beginning in the
late 19th century,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.910
British investment
transformed Manaus

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.800
into the center
of the rubber boom

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.250
and the most industrialized
city in Brazil.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.090
After 1912, when the British
turned to alternative rubber

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.120
sources within their colonies,
the city became impoverished.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.940
Today, the port again
facilitates the movement

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.140
of capital.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.660
Following a decade
of deregulation

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.250
that began in 1957, the city
became a free trade zone

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.640
and now holds the manufacturing
plants of such companies

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.350
as Apple, Sony, LG, Coca-Cola,
Dow, Harley Davidson,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.550
and Honda motorcycles.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.240
The commodities made
at these factories

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.630
enter the global
market on cargo ships

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.120
that exit the Port of Manaus.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.450
Foreign industry has
revitalized the region,

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.929
but only after bankrupting
it in the past.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.169
Industry brings money, but it
also pollutes the landscape

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.860
and disregards local culture,
turning Manaus into one

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.190
off thousands of
production hubs worldwide

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.020
that feed a growing
appetite for more.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.230
At the center of
the installation

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.200
is a large-scale
tapestry that depicts

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.690
the stretch of the
Amazon River that

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.570
lies between the river's
mouth in the Atlantic

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.380
Ocean and Manaus,
the exact stretch

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.640
that cargo ships traverse to
access the free trade zone.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.580
Taking two identical
prints of the river

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.150
from a Google Earth
satellite image composite,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.430
I cut and woven them together,
positioning the photographs

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.326
in opposite directions to mimic
the route of goods, materials,

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:27.825
and people.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.430
Additionally, I've been
shredding Amazon.com boxes,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.300
commodity culture refuse,
and using the strips

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.500
to make baskets based on
[FOREIGN] weaving techniques.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.300
By the way, thanks
to everyone who

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.910
collaborated and
contributed with Amazon

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.440
boxes to this project.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.860
The ubiquitous
Amazon.com box symbolized

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.090
automate mobility and has
come to represent the illusion

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.610
that goods come from nowhere.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.110
In theory, commodity goods
produced in the Amazon forest

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.450
could travel through
the Amazon River

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:21.500
in order to be delivered to
our doorsteps by Amazon.com.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.940
In [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE],,
these Amazon.com woven baskets

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.830
service as containers to display
terracotta replicas of iPhones,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.290
computer parts, electronics,
Coca-Cola bottles, Epson ink

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.950
cartridge, motorcycle
tires, and other goods

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.140
manufactured in Manaus.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.380
Terracotta is the material
traditionally used

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.380
by Amazonian native cultures
in ceramic production.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.290
These replicas were
rendered hollow

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.410
by the laborious
terracotta sleep casting

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.840
and, obviously,
lack functionality.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.600
Cracks and other imperfections
enhance their ambiguity.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.840
They are part trash,
part archaeological finds

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.610
of our present time.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.060
This casts actually built
on an early work of mine

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:26.270
"Spent," in which I fossilized
items of my domestic waste

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.550
into porcelain pieces.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.300
The objects were all
pieces of garbage

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.990
which I dipped in porcelain
slip and subsequently fired

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.130
in a kiln.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.090
Paper, cotton, rags,
seeds, coffee cups,

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.790
and other materials
all turned to ashes

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.520
due to the high
temperature, rendering

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.700
the original waste as
sterilized, hollow,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.780
porcelain shells.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.400
As this work suggests, I
favor sculptural procedures

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.960
that emphasize tactility such
as mold making, imprints,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.370
and casting.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.310
All of these processes
map the texture

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
and kept the surface and
real scale of things.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.210
Obviously, the objects projected
look much larger than they

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.940
would be if exhibited here.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.920
My sculptures embody materiality
at the level of the skin

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.220
to draw out the relationships
between material

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.700
cultural production,
effect, industry, consumer

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.770
society, and our bodies.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.760
For example, these
are plaster casts

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.910
of the interior
of used sneakers.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.850
These sculptures
merge the actual shape

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.050
of the foot with these
multinational brand signifiers

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:57.030
such as Adidas three stripes,
Nike's swoosh, New Balance's N,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.640
Puma's jumping puma, et cetera.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.710
In Brazil, young
people are killed

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.050
over their branded sneakers.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.990
Those killings have
become a recurring topic

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.350
in the sensationalist
press, and led

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.310
to the creation of the
term [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE],,

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.090
or sneaker thief, which is
also the title of the work.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.330
This work once
traveled to Colombia,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.570
and when it
re-entered the US, TSA

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.880
cut up a couple of the
casts in search of cocaine.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.070
This sculptures
now bear the marks

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.540
left by the structures and
regulations of global travel.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.500
Out of this incident,
I made a new piece,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.940
"Work Damaged by
Customs During Search

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.070
for Cocaine Upon Re-Entry to the
United States from Colombia."

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:54.990
The damaged sneaker casts
rest on top of shipping crates

00:13:54.990 --> 00:14:00.674
that I rebuilt from the wood
used in the original shipment.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:04.740
Still considering similar
sculptural procedures

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.370
while we are engaging with
commodities' histories,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.970
we can look at this other work,
"Transplanted, VW Brasilia"--

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:18.060
a skin-like, deflated,
natural latex imprint

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.300
of a Volkswagen Brasilia.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.520
The VW Brasilia was
the first VW model

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.620
entirely designed and
manufactured by Volkswagen

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.260
in Brazil.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.930
It was named after
the city of Brasilia

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.160
because Brasilia's urban plan
emphasizes the role of the car,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.010
and in Brazil, the
VW Brasilia soon

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.910
became a national design icon.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:47.940
The use of latex is
significant because of the way

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.050
latex industry is bound
up in Brazil's history

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.920
and economy, the car
industry, and therefore

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.020
the city of Brasilia.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.670
Latex is harvested
from the rubber

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:08.410
tree, hevea brasiliensis,
which is native to the Amazon.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.310
In the mid-19th century,
huge amounts of latex

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.530
were being exported from Brazil.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:19.000
Then in 1876, the British
explorer Henry Wickham

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.420
smuggled seeds from the rubber
treating center in Brazil

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.640
and took them back
to the Kew Gardens

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.820
in London, where they were
soon sent to Malaysia,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.900
a British territory.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.740
Rubber plantations in Malaysia
doomed the Amazonian rubber

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.320
boom and enabled the
British to have a world

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.960
monopoly on rubber production.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.530
I then display them along
with this young rubber tree

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.135
on loan from Pasadena's
Huntington Botanical Gardens

00:15:45.135 --> 00:15:45.635
herb garden.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.370
The car used for
the latex imprint

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.370
in "Transplanted
Brasilia" is the same car

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.850
I used as a central piece in
the installation, "Brasilia

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:04.880
Carpools and Other Modernities"
in which I brought this 1973

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.450
Volkswagen hatchback
from the city of Brasilia

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.100
to Santa Monica, California,
fully loaded with full cleaning

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.920
equipment in order to assist
with the 1964 modernist streak

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.180
house swimming pool
maintenance routine.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.180
Brasilia's architect,
Oscar Niemeyer Meyer,

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.700
designed this house
in Santa Monica

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.460
at the same time he
was designing Brasilia,

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.110
but he never visited the beauty.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.930
His communist
affiliations prevented him

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.140
from entering the US.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.960
The installation connected
the two locations

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.060
of Niemeyer work, which are also
the two cities that most shaped

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.910
my life.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.670
The photos that you are seeing
are from the meeting in LA

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.180
at the Hammer Museum in
2014, and I won't have time

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.470
to show the video--

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.980
there is a video component
to the installation--

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.339
and the interesting aspect of
it is that the camera is always

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.910
attached to the
car, so the image

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.430
has a lot of
vibration and noise.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.260
It's not the
depiction of the city

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:20.980
that you are used to with
the well-composed modernist

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.930
photographs or
images of the city.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.869
It's very noisy, and your eyes
on line is always a little

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:31.270
tilted, and it's
intercepted with images

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.465
of the house in Los Angeles.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.010
I grew up in Brasilia,
and I keep circling back

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.010
to create works about the city.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.850
As a child, I was simultaneously
fascinated and shocked

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.760
by Oscar Niemeyer's buildings
because they seemed more

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.780
like monumental abstract
sculptures than buildings.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.870
And as Judy mentioned,
I have an extensive body

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.810
of work on Brasilia,
but unfortunately, I

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.070
won't be able to show much of
that today, or I chose not to.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.580
I'm showing more in the works
related to the Amazon region.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.060
That's what I'm doing now.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.540
As a teenager, I recall
walking at night on vast areas

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.470
off undeveloped land to get
to the next super square,

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.080
residential areas within
Brasilia's pilot plan.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.130
The city, still under
construction in some areas,

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.760
had a feeling of unrestrained
freedom and vacancy.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.180
Later, I intellectualized
the place Brasilia

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.060
holds symbolically
and historically

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.850
in the country's dominant
narrative with all

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.220
its complexities
and contradictions.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.130
My experience of
Brasilia also informed

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.300
the way I approach architecture
as a device for thinking.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.660
Niemeyer's design for
Brasilia is one example.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.520
Another is two small
rubber plantation villages

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.060
in the Amazon jungle,
viewed by Ford Motor

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.660
Company in the late 1920s and
1930s, Fordlandia and Belterra.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.020
The model for this
worker's house,

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.820
oddly, was New England
style Cape Cod cottages,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.570
even though the workers would be
living in the tropical forest.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.010
At about the same time, Ford
built the town of Alberta

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.380
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.550
At the time, wood is still used
in the making of automobiles,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.910
and Alberta was conceived
as a model sawmill

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.470
town for lumber production.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.330
The work I created about
this equivalent architecture

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.040
was titled "Streamlined--

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.160
Belterra, Amazonia,
Alberta, Michigan"--

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.930
and unfolded as a two channel
video and eight channel sound

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.670
installation in which I created
a mirror-like situation between

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.810
Belterra, Ford's second rubber
plantation village along

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.450
the Tapajos River in
the Amazon forest,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.700
and Alberta in Michigan.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.130
Each channel of the
video is projected

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.060
onto one side of a freestanding
wall, Belterra on one side,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.800
Alberta on the other, but the
framing, camera movements,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.830
pace, and additives
are synchronized.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.070
One replicates the other, but
cannot be seen simultaneously,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.200
which causes a sensation of an
episode of deja vu when passing

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.608
from one side of the
freestanding wall to the other.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:44.100
Oh, just-- Just
play a few minutes.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.050
Obviously, the video is
never shown like this.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.920
This is just for
lecture purpose.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.055
You wouldn't be seeing the
images next to each other.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.960
The video begins with close-ups
of shared architecture features

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.050
suggesting that the subjects
of the two videos are the same,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.250
and then the shots get
broader, slowly revealing

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.110
that the surrounding
environments are

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.865
very different from each other.

00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:30.710
Although the towns are
formally equivalent,

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.870
difference is
established through views

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.250
of the landscape, architectural
adaptations, and snapshots

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.060
of each town's daily rhythm.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.480
[WHISTLE]

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.472
- The sound is a factory
whistle that is [INAUDIBLE] in--

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:46.918
[TRAFFIC NOISE]

00:21:46.918 --> 00:21:51.930
- In Belterra, the town
in the Amazon, but now

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.330
it's aligned with school time.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.500
They think that that's part
of the identity of the place.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.980
The installation presents
an uncanny situation

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.590
that makes the familiar
foreign, and vise versa.

00:22:25.286 --> 00:22:41.222
[ROOSTER CROWING]

00:22:41.222 --> 00:22:43.610
- OK, I will jump a little.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.560
Kind of destroying
my own work, but--

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.450
So you have images of--

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.270
as I said, it's
like the narrative

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.240
is one day in the
life of these towns,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.420
and there is still some rubber
tappers that work independently

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.290
in Alberta and in Michigan.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.280
The town is part of the
Michigan Tech University,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.260
so you have students
doing field work

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.030
and living there for a semester.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:26.380
So, and then it ends
with people exercising,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.840
and what I want to show this.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.750
So one thing-- these benches
here, I made replicas of them,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.460
and those are the benches
that are in the installation,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.930
and this is the obviously
spontaneous addition

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.950
to the planned city.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.530
It's not part of the original
plan, but for some reason,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.020
most of the houses have these
benches facing to each other,

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.220
and that's the place
where people socialize

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.490
at the end of the day.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.720
In addition to the
videos, I did this series

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.320
of 14 photographs that are
called "When Two Places Look

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.490
Alike," and they are part of
the same body of the work.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.140
So I created a typological
study of the workers houses

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.170
by juxtaposing fragments
of them with cut

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.800
out cards that travel with
me across the hemisphere

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.450
to each location.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.360
By using my hand
to hold the cards,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.820
I insert myself as a
connector of these two

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.650
locations, these two places--

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.530
sorry-- these two physically
distant places that share

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.010
a historical background.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.320
The current
inhabitants of Alberta

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.210
are totally unaware
that there is

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.760
this other town in South
America that looks just

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.605
like their town and vise versa.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.720
While Western industry exported
traditional New England

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.570
architecture style
to the Amazon region,

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.080
quintessential American
architect Frank Lloyd Wright

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.580
incorporated Mayan features such
as the textile concrete block

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.420
system in some of his
residential buildings

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.120
built in Los Angeles
in the early 1900s.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.980
The video, "Ch'u Mayaa," was
filmed at one of these houses,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.390
the Hollyhock House, which was
designed for the feminist oil

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:42.480
heiress, Aline Barnsdall, who
was also a patron of the arts

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.540
and later donated the
house to the city.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.750
This was the piece that
I received the commission

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.540
for from the city of LA for
a Geddes Foundation Pacific

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.030
Standard Time LA LA.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:02.160
To my response to the overlooked
influence of Mayan architecture

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.130
on Wright's work by
reappropriating the building

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.920
as a temple and
imbuing it with a dance

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.220
performance based on
gestures and postures

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.790
found in ancient Mayan
pottery and murals.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.480
Through the movement
of a female performer,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.640
the house is
resignified, or claimed,

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.190
as belonging to the
pre-Columbian Mesoamerican

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.090
architecture lineage.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.600
The title, translated
"Maya Blue"

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.640
from K'iche', one of the Mayan
languages spoken in LA today,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.590
refers to the ancient azure
pigment found in Mayan pottery

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.760
and murals, well known for being
remarkably weather resistant

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.779
and enduring the
passage of time.

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:46.570
So these are just--

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.430
I don't expect you
to read all of this,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.050
but it's just to show a
little bit of the reference

00:26:53.050 --> 00:27:01.980
of my research for creating
a catalog of movements,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.980
and I will play a
little bit of the video.

Unfortunately, I can play
the whole thing, so--

00:28:43.185 --> 00:28:46.470
I'm going to go a few sections.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.719
- OK, following my research on
the Hollyhock House-- oh no--

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.320
I see this piece very much in
dialogue with my sculptures,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.760
which frequently suggest
the presence of a body

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.270
and trace history
through gesture

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.820
Like the video about
Belterra and Alberta,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.659
this piece is an
attempt to excavate

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.045
the unacknowledged
narratives contained

00:34:56.045 --> 00:34:58.220
in modernist buildings.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.280
Following my research
on the Hollyhock House,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.040
I became more and more
interested in the 1920s

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.830
architectural trend of
Mayan revival buildings

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.980
in the US, which
co-opted the architecture

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.150
and iconography of pre-Columbian
Mesoamerican cultures.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.910
The style was popular
in Los Angeles,

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.660
so I decided to focus on the
Mayan Theater, a Landmark Grand

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.230
Cinema palace built during the
golden age of the movie-going.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:29.300
The interior design was done
by Mexican sculptor Francisco

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.920
Cornejo, whose work specialized
in Maya and Aztec themes.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.320
I researched his sources--

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.130
Quirigua and Piedras Negras
in Guatemala and Yaxchilan

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.670
in the Yucatan in Mexico--

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.150
and became fascinated
by the sophistication

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.640
of ancient Mayan
architecture in regards

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.630
to its performative quality
and relationship to the body.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.300
So I decided to make
a series of sculptures

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.250
that would make
the beauty embody

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.870
those qualities sculpturally.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.730
I made imprints of the reliefs
that decorate the Mayan Theater

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:09.460
doors and walls with thick
swatches of silicone.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.900
The skin-like fragments
of architecture

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.810
became elements of
assemblage of sculptures

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.600
and were joined with
terracotta plaster casts

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.350
of hands and feet locked
in gestures sourced

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.900
from the original
archaeological sites,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.800
as well as bits of faux
Jaguar fur, quetzal feather,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.570
and serpent skin.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.280
I also tried to
bring a little bit

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.470
of the information about
the source material

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.020
through the titles.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:40.790
So, for instance,
in this work, which

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:46.010
was "Yaxchilan Lintel
25 Feather Serpent,"

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:50.600
I made an imprint of one
panel of an exit door that

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.890
had an engraved based
on that specific lintel,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.010
more precisely the section
with the feather serpent,

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.880
a Mayan supernatural entity,
and then the sculpture

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.440
unfolded with relationships
with the body and the space.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.270
Another one, "Ha' Ki'n Xook--

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.760
From Piedras Negras
to Hill Street,"

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.965
tells you the name
of Piedras Negras

00:37:15.965 --> 00:37:20.510
ruler six, who was recreated
in the entrance hall

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.910
doorway of the theater on
Hill Street in downtown LA.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.850
A two-headed serpent in the
arms of human beings, or ticket

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:43.520
window, is also very descriptive
of the imagery appropriated

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.732
and used around
the ticket window.

00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:46.940
And here you have just some--

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.860
I don't expect you
to read that, again.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.860
It's just some indication
of my research.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.580
"The Heel Up in the Leg Cast
to Make the Building Dance"--

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.750
this one is indicative
that a figure would

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.620
be dancing in Mayan paintings
applied to vessels and murals,

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.250
so the whole body
could be still.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:15.970
If a figure has
the heel up, that

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.220
would mean that that
figure would be dancing,

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.450
and the maize god, which
is painted on this plate,

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.500
is usually portrayed
dancing with the heel up.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.930
"A Cycle of Time We
Don't Understand--

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.910
Reverse, Invented,
and Rearranged"

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.350
has a more elusive title that
relates to the glyphs created

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.650
for the theater's entrance
floor that are mostly

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.590
inspired by Calendrical glyphs.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:53.700
Mayan hieroglyphs would
never be placed on the floor,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.420
so I placed the swatches
of silicone on the wall,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.930
as it could have appeared
in a Mayan interior, usually

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.030
around the borders of a
metalogical or historical

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.530
scene.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.020
Another detail
important to point out

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.190
is the repetition of the word
faux in the material list--

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.690
faux terracotta dyed
plaster, jaguar faux fur,

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.650
quetzal faux feather, died
rooster feather, faux serpent

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.640
skin, and lastly,
synthetic hair.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.580
The insistence in
faux and synthetic

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.820
was a way to suggest that
all the imagery contained

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.160
on the silicone
imprints is also false.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.910
My intention was to restore
to the Mayan theater

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.580
the immanence of
its source material

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.650
while simultaneously
accentuating its design

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.510
as a product of mimesis.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:54.300
OK, I will end just
saying a few words of what

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.140
I am looking at right now.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.490
So, what I'm working
on at the moment

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:06.300
is the very early stages
of a new installation that

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.280
will further consider ecology
and Amazonian native people's

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.540
static reduction
in the relationship

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.740
to contemporary
commodity culture.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:21.390
The project will speculate on
a post-apocalyptic materiality

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:24.620
that follows the Earth's
ecological collapse.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.290
What will remain when the Earth
as we know it is destroyed?

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.910
In developing the
work, I've been

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:34.170
inspired by Octavia E. Butler's
science fiction trilogy

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.990
Lilith's Blood from 1989.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.760
For those of you who
don't know this book,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.710
I would explain very briefly--

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.530
in Lilith's Blood,
the human race

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.200
saves itself from
extinction by partnering

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.070
with an alien
species, the Oankali.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.140
The Oankali's world is
made of living things,

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.480
and that's what I'm interested--

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.170
living things.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.000
There space ship is
structured like a rainforest

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.520
and is fueled by food scraps.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.250
Their vehicles are
Oankali-made animals

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.320
that respond telepathically.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.510
Their walls open
and close according

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.460
to Oankali biochemistry.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.490
Eventually, the Amazon
Forest becomes the side

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.990
of origin for a new civilization
of Oankali-human human hybrids.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.330
In Butler's
configuration, the Amazon

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:25.790
is a site of second possibility,
and yet finite resources.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.590
I intended this new
body of work to inhabit

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.400
an imaginary space of
post-Oankali-human occupation

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.600
of Earth.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.370
My hope is to
create objects that

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.790
teeter between the
prehistoric and futuristic--

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:43.390
objects that seem ruins
of a world yet to come.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.090
I've been conducting research
at the Peabody Museum's

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.570
Amazonian [INAUDIBLE]
ceramics collection,

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.160
and you see two examples here.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.096
Especially there
are clay Monachinis

00:41:53.096 --> 00:41:58.350
that were at the
work-in-process exhibition

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:02.130
that we had in January
here at the Radcliffe,

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:04.100
and the funerary urns.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.410
I'm also expanding on my
understanding of Amazonian

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.870
[FOREIGN],, basket
weave and practices,

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.750
and indigenous Amazon
cosmology in general.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.960
I'm very interested in the
religious significance of trees

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.780
and sacred animals, and
how those images are still

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:24.160
used in Amazonian native
static traditions today.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.410
So I will leave it here.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.220
Thank you.
