00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.450
Wouldn’t it be weird if one day in the future
you were buying a home and the listing said,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.799
“batteries not included?”

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.969
Yeah well, that could totally happen.

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.929
Hey there people, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.039
Electricity is pretty great.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.870
It powers my toaster, my fridge, my hairdryer,
my clothes dryer, my air conditioner, my humidifier,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.150
my dehumidifier, and my pc I use to watch
science youtube videos.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.840
I think I’m gonna keep using it.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.950
The problem is, everyone in all the other
houses feels the same way, usually at about

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.870
the same times of day, and they’re driving
the cost of those tasty kilowatts up in the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.870
evening.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.030
Of course during the day if you don’t want
to use power from the grid, you could get

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.260
some solar panels and harvest sunlight, but
that’s not helpful when the sun’s down,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.329
also known as nighttime, also known as the
time I need to have electricity to turn lights

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750
on to not bang my shins on all the furniture.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.710
Enter the battery powered home.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
The idea is a rechargeable battery stores
energy from solar panels during the day or

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.961
from off-peak hours when grid energy is cheapest,
and uses that energy during the rest of the

00:00:58.961 --> 00:00:59.961
day.

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:04.489
The problem is if you’ve ever bought batteries
you know they cost approximately one arm and/or

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.489
one leg.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.639
Elon Musk thought that was a silly hangup
for what is otherwise a great idea and decided

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:10.840
to do something about it.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.479
Elon Musk, for y’all that don’t know,
is basically what would happen if Tony Stark

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.479
lost the goatee.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.530
His interests range from online money movement
to commercial space flight to, most importantly

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.829
for this topic, electric cars.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.880
His company Tesla Motors has been refining
electric car batteries for years, engineering

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.380
them to be lighter, longer lasting, and more
efficient.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.130
Why don’t we take all those batteries, and
put them on a wall?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.130
So they did that.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060
The Tesla Power wall Is basically a bunch
of lithium ion cells in a sleek case.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
They’re compartmentalized and liquid cooled
to solve the knotty problem of overheating

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.649
and burning your house down, something that
is generally undesirable.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
If you wanted it as your main power supply
there’s a model that can store and discharge

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.170
up to 7 kWh daily and costs $3000.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.289
Best of all it should last 10 years, which
is approximately 8 years longer than my laptop

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.859
battery made it before it wouldn’t hold
a charge anymore.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.640
The trick to this longevity is how much power
it outputs.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.140
It’s only pumping out 2 kW continuously
and peak output is 3.3 kW.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.980
The problem that then arises is some appliances
will use more than that output.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.060
An electric clothes dryer could draw that
much power on its own.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.480
So if you want dry clothes, I hope you weren’t
planning on using a microwave too.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.400
If you wanted to be not reliant on the grid
at all, you’d probably need a few powerwalls

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.240
to go with your solar roof panels.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.299
Depending on where you live, your power consumption
can vary widely, but the average US home in

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.510
2011 used 940 kWh per month.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.910
A solar setup of that size would cost over
$11,000, not including installation or taking

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.569
tax credits into account.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.300
Then you’d need 5 Powerwalls to store all
of that sunshine juice, so that’s another

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300
15 grand.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.420
It’s an expensive prospect right now, but
as the cost of batteries and solar panels

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.810
continue to drop, individual homes that are
independently powered could become a great

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.629
way to kick our fossil fuel habit.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.420
Inexpensive home batteries are looking like
a promising innovation.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.370
They’re not the only company innovating.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.409
Intel creates the breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.709
Having Intel inside makes for better experiences
outside.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.860
Intel drives innovation with products like
processors, wearables and IOT devices, and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.300
within data centers.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.099
In the PC and beyond.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.170
Going green sounds like a lot of effort.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.250
Is it really worth it?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:33.560
Trace explains why yes, totally, it is, right
here.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.010
Would you use the powerwall?

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.060
Would it be a supplement for your energy use
or would you go all out and be energy independent?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.939
