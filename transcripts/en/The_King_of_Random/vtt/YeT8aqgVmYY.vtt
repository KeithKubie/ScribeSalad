00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.459
I've never seen dry ice deep fried so today. We're going to find out what happens if we do our setup is pretty basic

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.879
We've got a bunch of cooking oil on a hot plate. We've got some dry ice

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.160
And we're gonna try and combine them

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619
But we do have a couple of things we want to try first before we go throwing our dry ice right into our super hot

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.979
Oil, I have a cup of this same cooking oil, but it's at room temperature

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
So I'm gonna try breaking off a piece of our dry ice dropping down into our cool oil

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.709
And we'll see what happens there after that we'll move up to using our hot oil there. Goes dry ice into regular temperature cooking oil

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.249
Well it's bubbling it's not doing nothing, but it's also

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.209
Not super exciting you can kind of see inside to cut that there is a little bit of a layer

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.020
That's formed the co2 gas coming off of dry ice has formed a sort of bubble around the chunk of dry ice

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.650
Inside the oil I also think that as the oil is

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.219
cooling down from the dry ice it's starting to get a little bit thicker a

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.650
Little higher viscosity, and it's definitely cool to the touch already like I can tell by holding this tough that the contents are quite cold

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.919
The oil just kind of runs right off of the oh look at this down inside though

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.500
You can see the yield oil. It's cooling down enough from the dry ice

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.589
We've got frozen new cooking oil there

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.349
And it's a Latin. It's not quite as thick as say butter or Crisco

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.259
It's clearly thick enough to hold yourself together so now moving on to the hot oil like I said

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.699
I don't know what's going to happen, and I know that oil can of course react violently with some things

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.860
I have here a little bit of water if I put in just a drop of that to the oil watch what happens

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.820
All of the water gets heated up and turns into steam

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.080
Which expands rapidly inside the hot oil so you get a lot of bubbling and splattering action from just one drop of water

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.009
Dry ice and water don't expand identically when they get heated up

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.149
So I'm not sure if the expansion of volume from the dry ice solid turning into a gas is going to have a similar effect

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.639
Or if it's just gonna be a little bit more calm and slow the way it was when we put it into the room temperature

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.699
Oil, that's why this is an experiment and we're about to find out oh

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.910
And I dropped it

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.499
Well it is bubbling quite a bit no explosions

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.880
Nothing violent splattering apparently these tongs aren't very good at holding onto chunks of dry ice

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.079
Fortunately I did have the tongs fairly close to the surface of the oil when it slipped out

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.279
Otherwise I would have had a much bigger splash even as it is some of the spilled on the plate

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.039
kind of want to try wiping that off because we're getting a lot of

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.739
very powerful fumes at this point

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.189
Doesn't help that our whole hot plate. Is that a little bit of an angle?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.290
So the dry ice keeps making its way over to one side of the pot

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.750
And then it's also more full on that side of the pot so the bubbling makes it all splash over

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.489
That was a much larger chunk when we started this

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.729
I think that gave us some pretty good results of what happens if you drop dry ice into frying pot cooking oil

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.109
But there is another thing

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.069
I wanted to try some things when you deep-fry them aren't placed directly into the hot oil

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.880
Themself they're actually given something of a batter around them when you deep fry

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.039
So now we're gonna see what happens if we wrap a bit of dry ice in one of these biscuits

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.379
And then fry that in our cooking oil

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760
We've got a little bit of biscuit

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.889
Break off piece of our dry ice a little bit big

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.859
Things we've got it pretty much in there and of course as soon as I get a good seal on the dough

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.100
it starts expanding inside the dough and just

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.850
Balloons up a little bit until a new spot opens up

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.659
so I don't think we're gonna be able to get a perfect seal on this because it just

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.170
Makes a new hole every time you've got it all perfectly sealed, but we'll try it. It's fairly well sealed up

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.760
Close it really well, and then slowly lower it in the oil you will see what happens when we deep-fry our dough covered

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.310
dry ice

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.530
Four more seconds looking at like a stone

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.239
No, I don't think there's a name for

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.749
Biscuit dough wrapped around dry ice and then deep-fried so we're gonna have to come up with a good name for this type of food

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.530
It's expanded quite a bit

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.909
I don't know if that's more from the heat of cooking or from the dry ice expanding thin so about this nice little

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.650
geyser

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.999
Coming out I'm also curious if it's cooked at all on the inside that cooked very quickly and of course

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.720
we know it was very cold on the inside as it was cooking so I'm

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.159
Thinking it might. Just have raw dough inside. You break this open into it with God oh?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.039
Yeah, that is very raw on the inside

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.760
Super gross. I don't really want to eat

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.810
The raw dough here's a spot that looks like it's mostly cooked

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.270
Feel a little more lost effort there. We go this piece is all the way cooked all the way through so I'll try this

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.800
It tastes like fried dough big surprise you're gonna try turning down the heat just a little bit more and

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.909
Then I want to try this again to see if we can actually get a piece. That's cooked all the way through

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.939
It's also possible that it's just gonna stay so cold on the inside because of the dry ice it will never cook all the way

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.640
through

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.330
All right our oil. I think has cooled down a fair amount

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.840
It's still hot enough to fry

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.369
But it's not so hot that it's just gonna bubble and explode everywhere and cook the outside

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.690
Of our dough in five seconds like it did the first time it will still go fairly quickly

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.260
I think but I'm ready to try wrapping another piece of dry ice in here and

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.319
Hopefully we'll get a slightly more of thorough cooking

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.650
But it is as I said still possible that it's gonna be so cold on the inside

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.639
That the oil won't be able to get in there and really heat it up. Let's find out

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.809
It's definitely going slower than before which is a good thing because that way the heat will have more time to get

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.139
Inside the biscuit before it burns the outside

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.320
Last time our fry oil was so hot that by the time the outside was cooked it only been about five

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.979
Seconds per side so really didn't have any time to cook the inside dough

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.200
Looks pretty well cooked on the outside

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.540
Is that out see how it's done on the inside with our dry eyes

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:02.250
Mm-hmm you know it's still a little soft, and I wouldn't say it's finished, but it's a lot more cooked than

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.669
our first test or if not these scrap pieces

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.670
But it's a lot more cook than

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.900
This completely raw dough would like you it still would want a little more time

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.689
And I think the dry ice is preventing it from getting there

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.449
Maybe that's employer will you get on that side?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.660
But it's definitely an improvement

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.580
Thanks for the heck of it. I'm gonna drop this back into the oil I'm gonna cook on the other side

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.159
Got one more piece I'm testing with a slightly smaller bit of dry ice

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.680
It's gonna. Let it sit in there

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.790
Maybe a little bit longer even until the outside is starting to look perhaps a little bit burned

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.020
Just because I want to see if we can actually get that inside to cook all the way through

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280
Watch so very elated

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.539
It's good, but I think you probably squeeze oil out of it

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.319
Don't wear the glove you get just from picking it up at that time

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800
hmm, okay

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.279
20 of co2 pumping its way out

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.389
Tried to let it get quite toasty on one side at least

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.259
they just open and see if you've got any extra poetry I

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.489
Don't know that's still pretty strange places

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.730
See how stretchy and youie that still is yeah, that's that's not cooked

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:41.120
There you have it a couple varieties of deep frying dry ice in hot oil when you put the dry ice directly into the oil

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.169
It does bubble and splash a little bit, but nothing very extreme

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.479
Not a lot more than you can put in a piece of bread dough or anything else that you would fry into more it is

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.769
maybe a little bit different than some things you would fry because it sinks all the way to the bottom of the oil so the

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.059
Bubbles have to travel all the way through the oil to the top what that happens with some foods as well

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.749
Overall I would say that it's a little bit neat to watch

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.560
But it's nothing very spectacular

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.429
Taking the dry ice and wrapping me up in some dough before we fry

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.810
It does of course give us a different result it seems to cook the outside of the dope well

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.440
But the cold food dry ice on the inside

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.640
Does seem to prevent the dough from cooking all the way through high heat?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.770
It would just burn on the outside and stay raw on the inside

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.240
slightly lower and slower heat

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.610
It would cook a little bit more of the way through but the part of the dough that was really in

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.350
Contact with the dry ice never seemed to change texture, and it doesn't seem like they would be safety

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.420
remember if you have any cool ideas for an experiment you want to see us try and let us know down in the comments and

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.259
If we use your idea, we'll send me 25 bucks this has been a fun experiment for us
