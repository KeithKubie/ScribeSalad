PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Good morning.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.100
I just love that code.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.890
Every successful user
is not just a number.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.360
It's a whole life,
a whole new story.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.660
Thank you Florian,
[? Pranshu, ?]

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.840
Brett, and Oded for sharing
those remarkable stories

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.920
with us.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.100
And thank you to each one of
you for building those apps

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.220
and games that
impact so many lives

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.280
and write so many
beautiful stories.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.166
Welcome to Playtime 2017.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.950
Be it an app that helps
you communicate better,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.490
get healthier, learn a
language, or a game that

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.430
provides pure
entertainment or an avenue

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.240
for self-expression or
learning a new skill, your apps

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.810
and games impact people who are
on two billion Android devices.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.120
Just think about
that for a moment.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.200
Amazing, isn't it?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.600
And if you see the stories
that we just showed you,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.870
you realize that the connection
between the app and the user

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.390
goes way beyond the technical
features that it provides.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.270
We, on Android and
Play, are humbled

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.450
to provide a small
part of the technology

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.770
to make those
connections possible.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.400
In addition to
building great apps,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.640
you have told us that you
want to support causes

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.150
that matter to you.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.500
Today, I'm super
excited to announce

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.740
the first of those initiatives
of supporting these causes.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
We have partnered
with these developers

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.480
to support World Food
Day, a program that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.870
creates activism
and brings attention

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.470
to people who are suffering
from hunger around the world.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.280
Throughout this
week, we will promote

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.060
these 11 apps and games.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.040
And 100% of the proceeds of
all key item in those apps

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.820
and games will be donated
to the World Food Program.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.460
Give these developers
a big hand.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.080
I would also ask each one of
you, take out your phones,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.440
download these apps
and games, play them.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.420
Thank you for your generosity.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.460
In the coming months,
we look forward

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.330
to working with more of you to
find causes that matter to you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.470
and support more things
with bigger social impact.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.710
So here we are, Playtime 2017.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.960
We were just talking about it.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.050
Four years ago, this was
a tiny little program

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.240
in a small little room
on the Google campus.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.450
And today, you join
a global series

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.510
of events with hundreds
of top developers

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.910
across Berlin, Sao Paolo,
Shenzhen, Singapore,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.830
Seoul, and Tokyo.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.650
I can't even keep track of the
places that this is happening

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.530
and where we bring top
developers together

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.610
to learn what's latest at Google
as well as from each other.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.310
So what's the day
going to look like?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.230
We're going to
kick off by talking

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.490
to you about what's latest
from Google in the morning.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.610
We also have IDEO coming
up here and talking

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.240
to us about building
apps and games using

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.160
immersive technologies.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.490
In the afternoon, you
will hear from each other

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.910
about best practices,
about building great games,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.140
driving engagement, launching
successfully, and keeping

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.010
your user happy.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.470
Throughout this day, we're
going to have one team that will

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.320
come up over and over again.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.480
And that is about
sustainable engagement.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.130
As you listen to
the tools that we

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.250
are going to provide you
to engage your users,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.490
I ask you to think
about this theme

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.250
and ponder on a few questions.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.480
What does sustainable
engagement mean for you

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.550
in your app or game?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.470
Are you seeing your
users hitting capacity?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.040
What metrics are you using to
know what engagement is good

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.890
and maybe what isn't?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.180
How will we collectively
build a happy user

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.480
base for a long time?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.740
These are important questions
for all of us in the industry,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.960
because they have significant
impact on our businesses,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.040
but also for our responsibility
towards our users.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.800
And these are
difficult questions.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.690
We hope to continue the
dialogue we start here today

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.440
to find answers for
these questions.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.320
I speak for everyone
on Google Play when

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.490
I say I'm super excited that
we have you all here today

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.960
together.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.990
At the end of this day,
I hope you will tell us

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.810
that you heard something
that excited you

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.270
and, more importantly, that you
met somebody who inspired you.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.180
And with that, let's
kick off Playtime.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.000
I'm going to call on stage,
Vineet to talk about Google

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.140
Play product vision.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.550
VINEET BUCH: Thanks, Purnima.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.900
Hi, I'm Vineet Buch.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.750
I am responsible for
the product team that

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.540
does the Play Store,
the Play Console,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.510
as well as Instant Apps.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.290
So Google has been
building mobile platforms

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.810
for a while, obviously,
began with Android.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.040
We've expanded that now to cover
everything from watches to TVs

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.140
to cars.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.720
Play is the glue that binds
these platforms together.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.940
It's what brings these
platforms to life

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.430
by delivering apps and games
that our users want to actually

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.370
really get benefit
of these platforms

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.350
and, at the same time,
of course, helping

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.820
you, our developer partners,
build meaningful, sustainable

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.360
businesses on these platforms.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.990
So I'm going to walk
you through some

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.620
of the big things we're thinking
about for the next year plus

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.850
and then the lead from
different parts of Play

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.196
are going to dive into
details through the course

00:06:46.196 --> 00:06:46.820
of the morning.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.960
We're very proud of
the success that we've

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.540
had in growing the store,
in growing the developer

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.010
ecosystem.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.430
But with this
growth, we definitely

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.500
have faced some challenges.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.190
For the user, the challenge is
that now there's two million

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.790
plus apps and games,
which one should they use?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.550
Which one should they
install, download, play with?

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.920
And for you, for
our developers, how

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.810
do you get to the
users who actually

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.360
will care about your app?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.090
How do you actually get
them to engage more deeply

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.950
and to reengage with an app
they may have on their phone,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.880
but may not even remember
they have on their phone?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.410
And if you've invested in
building an app or game that

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.400
really deeply pulls
in the user, how

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.500
do you get the benefit
of that in terms

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.630
of attracting new users?

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.400
Well, we've been thinking a
lot about all of these issues.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.400
And we've seen that, for
the store, browse traffic--

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.010
that's people who come to the
store and come to the home page

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.030
and say, I'm bored,
show me something--

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.710
that's really grown.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.920
And so how do we help solve
some of these problems?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.600
Well, one thing is that,
in terms of our ranking,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.130
in terms of our
personalization, we

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.830
should really reward
developers who've

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.220
built apps and games
that are deeply engaging.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.870
In the past-- we're Google.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.940
We use this kind of data.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.430
We've used things like
click data and install data,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.410
but we haven't, until
recently, started

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.730
using engagement data in our
ranking, and now we are--

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.160
normalized across
categories, of course.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.640
We are leveraging
things like, this app

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.725
seems to engage
users a lot more.

00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:35.380
We should probably
rank it higher.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.330
Because users seemed
to like this more than

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.159
the norm for this category.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.560
So we're using
that kind of data.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.770
We invested a lot in
building our personalization

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.450
in the store.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.550
Really our mission
is, for the user,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.770
to find a store that
they feel is really

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.070
tailored to themselves,
that sort of speaks to them.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.770
We've made big strides.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.030
Not quite all the way there yet,
but when we look at our metrics

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.920
around this, it's
quite impressive

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.830
how much we've been
able to improve

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.770
the user believing that
this store is really

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.500
tailored to them.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.770
We're also trying to
do a number of things

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.980
around reengaging users with
the apps and games they already

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.910
have.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.810
Kara will talk some more about
this subsequently to this.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:30.070
But in a nutshell, we've made
new destinations for games.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.800
We've brought in
things like live event

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.230
feeds into the store.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.110
And in general, as we measure
ourselves with new launches,

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.590
we're thinking not just of
new high quality installs,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.410
but also helping users
rediscover something

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.250
they already may
have on their phone.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.960
We had a big announcement
around the general availability

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.410
to developers of Android
Instant Apps IO this past May.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.230
I'm very happy to say
that the store is now

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.200
getting behind driving
traffic to Instant

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.400
Apps in a very big way.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.870
The first step-- this is an
experiment where we've launched

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.250
recently--

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.190
in addition to just being
able to install an app,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.660
users will be able to try it
with a simple one button press,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.790
as though they
already had the app.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.360
In fact, the
example you see here

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.102
is the ShareTheMeal app
that Purnima talked about.

00:10:33.102 --> 00:10:34.800
You want to spread some joy.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.185
You want to share some benefit.

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:38.880
You just click one button.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.960
Boom, it's right there.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.930
It's no secret that a lot of
the growth for the Android

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.790
ecosystem is
happening in markets

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.280
like India, Indonesia, Brazil--

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.890
lots of users,
lots of new users.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.220
And also not surprising
that many of these new users

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.510
encounter the very first
smartphone, which may actually

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.150
be constrained in terms
of memory, storage,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.720
and maybe on a somewhat
bandwidth-constrained network.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.310
We are launching Android Go, a
streamlined version of Android,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.040
to be optimized for these
kind of devices and networks.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.850
It's rolling out in the
next couple of months.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:25.190
We also are going to make
the store in these markets

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.470
leaner, slimmer, et cetera.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.500
And we're hoping
to really present

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.140
apps and games in
these markets that are

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.510
optimized for these conditions.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.380
We, for a while, had the
next guidelines for building

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.830
for these kinds of
devices and users.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.620
A number of developers
are already adopted these.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.660
We encourage you to
take a look at these,

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.760
if you have yet,
and see how you can

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.160
benefit from this user growth.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.150
In the store, we will,
for users on these devices

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.690
in these markets,
be prioritizing apps

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.700
that are optimized for them.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.650
So if, for example
you've got a lite app,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.560
or if you slim down your
app, we will be making sure

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.370
the user gets to see
that as a high priority.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.660
So in closing, I
just want to say

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:21.200
that through the course
of today, this afternoon,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.170
we'll have product managers
and developer relations teams

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.920
from across different
parts of Google

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.650
available for one-on-one
sessions with you.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.290
Please, take advantage of this.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.130
The agenda will explain
who is available when.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.490
But definitely make sure that
you come with your questions,

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.160
with your thoughts,
with your comments.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.210
And if you want to run ideas
by us, we're here for you.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.970
Please, take advantage of this.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.160
With that, I'll
ask Matt Henderson,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.262
who's our lead for
the Play Console

00:12:51.262 --> 00:12:52.970
to give you some more
details about that.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.550
MATT HENDERSON: Lots of great
stuff to share with you today.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.690
So two billion devices
publishing software

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.580
to two billion devices.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.300
It's a tremendous opportunity,
but it's also challenging.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.060
And so it's important
that we build tools

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.030
to help support your success.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.110
Play can help you
iterate on your app

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:23.700
to get it to high quality prior
to release and post-release.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.860
During the release
process, we can help you

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.720
to mitigate risks that come up.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.220
Our tools can also help
you to understand business

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.890
opportunities and take
advantage of those business

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.790
opportunities.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.720
On the quality side,
earlier this year at IO,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.870
we announced Android
Vitals in the Play Console.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.810
Android Vitals is a
program to help you build

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.180
apps and games of high quality.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.070
How important is quality?

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:58.980
50% of one star rated reviews
on Play mention app stability

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.120
and bugs.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.150
So if you want to avoid
one star rating reviews,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.690
this is a great thing
to invest time in.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.410
We're really excited that
just since IO, Android Vitals

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.580
has really been embraced.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.510
So already 65% of
top developers are

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.300
using Android Vitals
to help learn how they

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.740
can improve their app quality.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.600
Vitals helps you
understand three areas

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.650
of bad user experience
across stability, battery,

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.180
and rendering.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.230
From today, five new metrics
are launching in Vitals

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.640
to help you understand
problems more deeply.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.110
For app stability,
Vitals now reports

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.480
when the same user
session is affected

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.700
by multiple ANRs and crashes.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.900
These repeated problems
caused use of frustration,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.410
leading to risk of uninstall.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.210
For battery, Vitals
now highlights

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:02.140
when excessive activity takes
place in the background,

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.780
leading to unnecessary
battery drain.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.070
For example, we now report
excessive Wi-Fi scans

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.430
and excessive network usage
in the background, as well

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.720
as stuck wakelocks.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.950
Until now, Android Vitals
has generated metrics

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.370
from users on the Nexus
and pixel devices.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.730
Today, our coverage
expands dramatically.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.640
It's up 25-fold from
just earlier in the year.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.910
It's a huge increase
and includes

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:39.730
a spectrum of flagship devices
and mid-range devices as well.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.370
We've also revamped
the Android Vitals

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.490
section in the Play Console
with a richer user experience.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.330
There's an overview
for metric at a glance.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.760
There's time series charts.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.600
There's also benchmarks, so you
can compare your own metrics

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.000
against the metrics of
other developers as a whole.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.850
As you improve your
app quality, we

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:09.220
want to make sure that end users
find those great experiences.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.690
That's why Android Vitals and
now our key signal for Google

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.710
Play and a number of user-facing
areas, our search and discovery

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.300
algorithms take Vitals into
account when they favor apps

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.710
with better vitals.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.990
And vitals are an
important signal

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.550
when your app is
being considered

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.270
for promotional opportunities,
like the new and updated

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.790
collection, editor's choice
collection, the Google Play

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.210
Awards, and the
recently launched,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.120
Android Excellence Program.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.420
The pre-launch report is
a way to improve quality

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.730
before the app's published.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.180
It automatically crawls
and tests your APKs

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.670
on a variety of
different devices,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:56.200
looking for crashes and security
vulnerable vulnerabilities.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.890
And what we've observed
is 90% of the time

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.820
that the pre-launch report
testing robot discovers crashes

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.869
in an app, the developer chooses
not to take that app forward

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.829
into production.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.569
It's modified before
going into production.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.810
So this is really working
well at identifying

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:19.630
problems that are then fixed
before going out to real users.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.930
From today, every
APL that's submitted

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.660
to alpha and beta track is going
to get a pre-launch report.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.450
So this is dramatically
expanding the availability

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.000
of the program.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.900
We're also launching
a new robot tester

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.050
that reaches deeper into
the app and discovers

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.390
more crashes, more problems.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.460
We're adding new
performance metrics as well

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.270
to the pre-launch report,
covering CPU, memory, network,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.255
and rendering.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.860
App security is another key part
of the quality user experience.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.760
And Play's security team
sends security recommendations

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.800
to thousands of developers
to help fix vulnerabilities.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.410
Today, we're further investing
in security with the Google

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.660
Play Security Reward Program.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.790
Here's how it works.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.230
To start with, we'll be inviting
developers of popular apps

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.120
to opt into the program.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.740
Participating
security researchers

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.900
will try to find vulnerabilities
in those eligible apps.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.900
They submit the
vulnerabilities in a report

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.900
via your bug reporting process.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.010
And our partner, HackerOne, can
set up a free reporting process

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.600
if you don't already have one.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.460
Once the vulnerability
is fixed, the researcher

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.010
reports it to the Play Store.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.660
And the security
reward program will

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.520
generate a reward, a payout
from Google to that researcher.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.460
Google's security team
will then scan all apps

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.970
for that vulnerability and
send security recommendations

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.940
to any other
affected developers.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.110
Some of Google's security team
and some of the HackerOne team

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.300
are here today.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.040
So if you want to learn
more, chat further with them.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.110
I encourage you to do so.

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:17.940
Tools in the Play
Console can also

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.330
help you mitigate risks when
you're targeting and releasing

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.580
your app to your audience.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.860
Alpha and beta testing has been
one of the features at Play

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.970
that developers
really love most.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.620
More than 300,000 developers
use alpha and beta tracks.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.750
We've got some new
capability that we're

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.590
adding to that-- country
targeting at the track level.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.990
So until today,
country targeting

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.900
was fixed across
all track states.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.650
But now, you can beta test
in specific countries.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.710
So you can beta
test in country A

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.830
before launching in
that country publicly,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.720
even though your app may be
fully launched in country B.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.690
In the coming weeks, we're going
to be also launching country

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.850
targeting in stage rollouts.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.330
So for a new release
of an existing app,

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.800
you may use stage rollouts
to increase that release

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.944
to specific percentages
of production users.

00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:18.360
And with country
targeting, you'll

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.670
be able to control which
countries that process is

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.950
happening to over time.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.750
The device catalog
was also a new feature

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.120
we announced to IO
this year, and it's

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.220
been tremendously popular.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.940
So this is a tool where
you can search devices

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.380
by attributes, like RAM, system
on chip, screen size, and more.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.720
It shows you your
app's performance

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.530
for specific devices.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.740
And you can set
targeting rules if you

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.500
want to exclude some
devices if they're not

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.630
suitable for your app.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.460
We're now launching
a new feature

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.890
that allows you to save
device search queries.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.550
So if you have a combination
of filter settings

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:04.710
that, perhaps, gets you large
screen devices that are running

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:09.850
Android O and meet a
certain bar for RAM size,

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.720
then you can save
that as a custom query

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.540
and use it again in the
future and more quickly

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.550
navigate to it in the future.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.150
Another cool feature
we're adding here

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.120
is based off questions that we
receive from developers often,

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.690
which is, why isn't this
specific device supported

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.950
by my app?

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.670
So in the device catalog,
we're launching today

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.250
a feature where we answer
that exact question.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.830
You can pick a specific
device in the device catalog.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.070
And it will tell you
reasons why your app doesn't

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.080
support that device.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.670
For example, on the screen
here, the production APK

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.300
requires accelerometer feature.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:55.500
And the beta APK requires the
camera autofocus feature, which

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.990
this device doesn't support.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.820
So you can go into
the vast catalog

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.980
and find those sorts
of reasons to help

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.600
you understand what's going on.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.660
We continue to add features
to the Play Console

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.250
to help you grow your business.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.100
And subscriptions are the
fastest growing developer

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.630
business model.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.340
We have new features
to help with that.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.850
So easier set up means you
can launch your subscription

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.140
app faster.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.810
We recently announced
the official release

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.850
of the Play billing library.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.090
And this simplifies
the development process

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.370
for Google Play
billing by making sure

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.580
that you're always using the
latest in-app billing features.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.540
Were making it easier for you
to test your payment flows

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.010
by providing a good form of
payment and bad form of payment

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.080
for each license test account.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.060
So you can test without having
to use a real payment method.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.850
We're also updating the
subscription settings

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.020
in the Play Console.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.500
So you can configure
your subscription SKUs

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.430
at an app level.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.580
Now your business can't
survive if you don't get users.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.990
Our research has shown
that 78% of subscribers

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.400
start with a free experience.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.270
So we're introducing
improvements to our free trial

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.690
logic to make it smarter.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.760
In order to reduce
free trial abuse,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.360
we're now enforcing the users
one free trial at the app

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.140
level.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.740
And you can manage that
sitting in the new subscription

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.960
settings page on
the Play Console.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.010
This setting is available
today, and enforcement

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.510
is going to start in
December of this year.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.510
We've heard feedback from
developers that some of you

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.420
would like to have shorter
free trial lengths.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.010
So now, the minimum free trial
length will be three days.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.290
For those of you
with content costs,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.157
this lowers the marginal
cost of acquisition.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.660
While acquiring
users is important,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.710
you can't stay in business
long if you don't keep them.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.910
At IO, we talked
about a new feature

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.429
called the account hold.

00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:06.970
And I'm pleased to
announce that it's

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.670
now open for
general availability

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.400
and can be implemented by
checking the account hold

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.360
box in the subscription
setting in Play Console.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.420
We're also launching a
new win back features.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.410
So starting today, we're going
to notify you immediately

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.460
when a subscriber's state
change, including cancellation.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.240
So no more waiting until the end
of the month to check the API

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.390
and find out that a subscriber
cancelled two weeks ago.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.330
Instead, you can
understand immediately

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.850
and trigger communication
to the user,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.590
especially if there's something
new that may entice them

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.840
to retain the subscription.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.180
Maybe they didn't know
about a new feature.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.370
Maybe they didn't
know about a new show

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.840
that you had just launched.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.640
And so these win back
features, we think,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.700
can help you to
increase user retention.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.640
Also starting today,
we're giving users

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.350
the ability to restore
a subscription that

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.220
hasn't completely expired.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.210
So they had a subscription,
they unsubscribed,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.430
but they have the
ability to restore that

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.520
without going through the
whole subscription creation

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.110
funnel again.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.030
And we think that's
going to remove

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.690
some of the friction for them
to get started and remain

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.330
in the relationship, in the app.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.480
You can opt into that
subscription restoration

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.490
setting through the
new subscription

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:39.150
settings in the Play Console
as well, so lots of stuff.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.040
We hope the new
features help, as you

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.690
continue to build
amazing apps and games.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.080
And Kara is now going to share
some news about the Play Store.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.720
Thanks.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.890
KARA BAILEY: Before I get
started, I, first of all,

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.000
wanted to say a big
thank you to all of you

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.870
for the very, very hard
work you do day in,

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.130
day out in creating really
great user experiences.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.470
It makes my job easier.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.290
But most importantly,
it really enables

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:14.180
us to really deliver great
content that creates user

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.614
experiences across our users.

00:26:18.614 --> 00:26:20.780
So today, I'm going to talk
about some changes we've

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.820
made on the Play
Store to really make

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.677
it easier for users to
discover and to engage

00:26:26.677 --> 00:26:27.635
with our great content.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.050
So as Vineet mentioned,
Play's mission

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.510
is to bring devices to
life on mobile and beyond.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.270
Whether for you phone,
watch, or even your car,

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:47.180
Play is a thread that connects
two billion devices to content

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.220
that makes them truly magical.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.110
Now personalization here
is the building block.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.900
That's made even more
powerful by having

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.620
great content to recommend
and great services

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.330
for those recommendations.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.490
I want to share with you some
of the way that we have improved

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.000
our personalization
over the last year,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.460
as well as walk through
some of the ways

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.150
that we're creating new
experiences to give users

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.990
a much better way to engage with
the content in the Play Store.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.330
So a lot of the magic of
Play's recommendations

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.500
happens behind the scenes.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.920
So I want to pull back
the curtain a little

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:38.320
and give you some insight into
how we match the right content

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.280
to the right user.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.880
To help users explore,
we've built a taxonomy

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.320
that really creates thousands
and thousands of topics that

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.370
enables a user to go
much deeper into content

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.460
and also gives the
user more control.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.400
We've used this,
as you'll see here,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.940
in the recently launched
search refinements, where

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.150
a user can make
choices in delving down

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.370
into the content that's
of interest to them.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:13.080
We've also used this to power
really great recommendations

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.190
across our homepages.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:20.300
We've also improved our ranking
to make it more contextually

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.420
relevant and also much fresher.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.980
So for example, for a football
fan here on the right,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.220
we know that person is
interested in football.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.280
And so we surface this
content much more prominently

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.360
in the store, given that users
interests, as well as the fact

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.610
that it's a trending topic.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.440
Across all our efforts, as
you heard from both Purnima

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.920
and Vineet, we
really are thinking

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.400
about ongoing engagement
and reengagement

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.840
And so you'll see here
our don't forget to try,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.550
which surfaces apps that a
user has recently installed.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.320
So within our
recommendations, we

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.620
want to also help users
to decide what to install.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.070
There's so many things.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.040
But what should
they really install?

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.300
So we want to highlight
the best of the catalog.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.630
We've always had editorial
curation at Play,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.290
but it's not always
been clear to a user

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.650
what's editorial versus
other recommendations

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.990
and why we're
highlighting it to them.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.170
So a major focus
of this year has

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.880
been on creating new editorial
experiences, including

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.880
rich, long form content,
as you'll see here,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.770
which shows to users the
reasons why we love this.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.900
Three great reasons
why we think this

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.910
is a great app or game a
user should engage with.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.560
This editor's choice is
now live in 17 countries

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.490
around the world.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.780
And in future, we'll be
integrating this not just

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.330
in its own section, but
it will be integrated

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.930
in other parts of the Play
Store to really help users

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.890
throughout their
discovery experience.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.540
So a large part of editorial
is Play having an opinion

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.030
about what's best for users.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.120
And so we'll be using
these richer content

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.160
experiences to highlight
the best content

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.880
that we have in our events,
such as Best of Play.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.030
We really want to be able
to recognize and reward you,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.270
as developers, who create
this great content.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.540
And there is a spot
here coming up later

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.460
this year where you'll
see our Best of Play 2017.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.040
So we also want
to recognize those

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.850
that take full advantage
of the Android platform

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.770
through programs like
Android Excellence, which

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.170
you'll see here on the right.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.150
This will be refreshed
each quarter.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.880
And you can reach
out to your BD team

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.800
for any further information.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.460
We know how important
games are to our users.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.320
And I want to share
several changes

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.740
we're making on the Play
Store to really create

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.470
a much more engaging
browse experience.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:22.260
One that really does bring users
back continually to the store

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.200
to engage and reengage
with our great content.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.890
So let's start with navigation.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.070
Now I know it's very
obvious, but games

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.980
are different from
apps, and so we're

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:41.350
reflecting that in elevating
games to its own destination.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.370
Now we do hope and
expect that will

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:50.680
help drive more users into games
to discover that great content.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.790
But it also provides
an excellent foundation

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.230
for creating experiences that
are really unique to games,

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.650
such as immersive
recommendations that

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:08.910
highlight videos, screenshots
of actual game play.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.320
We also want to give users
more control over how they

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.690
browse that games experience.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:20.330
So an example here is we've
created a premium section

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:25.370
within games that
highlights paid games.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.180
And this launched last month.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.580
This is also great
for showcasing games

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.470
on sale using the new
strikethrough price

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.710
feature that really
enables a user

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.490
to see the value that
you're delivering.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.630
To date, given this
was launched a month,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.660
we're seeing really
great engagement,

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.240
where users are going
much further and deeper

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.660
into the content and really
engaging with many more

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.695
of our premium games.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.030
Newness is really
important to our gamers.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.420
And so this is a topic
that we're approaching

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.040
in a few different ways.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.360
Similarly to
premium games, we're

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.380
experimenting with a new
section on new games.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.340
So this highlights some
of our best new games

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.530
across our popular franchises,
as well as our amazing indies.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.200
We're also exposing
preregistration

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.220
in many more places through
the store as well as much more

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.480
prominently.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.510
So we do hope that
this will give users

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.240
a sense of what's coming
up soon and enable

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.470
you, as developers, to build
momentum behind a new game

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.310
launch.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.400
You'll see here also
that another example

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.010
of an experiment
that what we're doing

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.040
is experimenting with
preregistration rewards.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.550
And this is shown on
the store listing page

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.570
with the example of
our Angry Birds Match.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.495
Again, we look out for
more of these things that

00:34:05.495 --> 00:34:09.940
are coming up in the next
few months and into 2018.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:15.860
And finally, we are also making
our top charts more responsive.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.510
So we'll be updating them
multiple times each day

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.449
to ensure that we really
are bringing freshness

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:23.710
and newness to the store.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.989
But as Purnima and
Vineet both touched on,

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:34.300
the store really does need to do
much more than just help users

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.449
find a new game
or app to install.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.060
We really want to
create and are working

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.850
to create a
destination for users

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.580
to find out what's
happening in the games

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.810
that they already play.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.250
So here, you'll
see we've started

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:55.320
highlighting major in-game
events through store featuring.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.720
And these have had
a great reaction

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.620
from users who are really
engaging and reengaging,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.380
as well as producing great
results for developers.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.250
So you'll start to
see many more live ops

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.750
through the store in different
parts of the store coming up

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.240
and into 2018.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.230
You'll see an example of this
is the live ops card on Games

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.680
home, which highlights exciting
events happening in the games

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.190
that a user is playing
or has installed.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.420
And this encourages that
user to really get back

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:36.700
into the content and really make
sure that they don't miss out.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.310
And lastly, we also
want to make sure,

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.860
through don't forget
to play, that we're

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.340
creating every opportunity
to recommend and ensure

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.040
users are engaging
with the content

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.180
that they're interested in.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.150
So that was a lot on
games, but what about apps?

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.990
We're also looking to drive
ongoing engagement with apps

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.380
by really ensuring that
users can get the most out

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.350
of the apps that
they already have.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.290
Starting with
entertainment, we're

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.330
taking a much more
content-forward approach,

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.980
which you can expect to see
more of across other categories

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.100
in future.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:22.840
So here's an example of
what we mean in practice.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.200
So we're able to
use the information

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.370
about the content in each
app to power a better search

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.910
experience.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.590
So in this case, a user
is interested in "Game

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.000
of Thrones."

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.280
Now while that user
might be looking

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.150
for an app or a game related
to "Game of Thrones,"

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.600
we know that they're probably
looking to watch the show.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:54.480
So in this case, we can surface
the HBO GO app and the HBO Now

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.190
app and make it clear to
users that they can stream

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.550
and watch "Game of Thrones"
through both of those apps.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.720
We've also started to
highlight major in-app content

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.990
moments through store
featuring, and we're

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:15.320
experimenting with
other dedicated services

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.250
through the store to surface
these content moments.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:23.690
So this is an example here,
working in partnership with HBO

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:30.680
Now to surface many of the
different shows, where we make

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:38.090
it clear to users that you can
either subscribe to the app

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.180
or you can purchase
the episodes, so again,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.357
giving users multiple
ways to engage

00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:45.190
with the content that
they're interested in.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.640
So as Vineet said, continuing
with the theme about the Store

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.280
being about more
than just installs,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.270
we're really excited to
announce the first integration

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:03.660
with Android Instant Apps
within the Play Store.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.330
You can see here
the Try Now button,

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:12.040
which really encourages users
to jump right into the content.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.790
This addresses
users immediately,

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.250
right in the moment.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.620
We will be experimenting
with different ways

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.900
to surface this to
users, so expect

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.030
to see more on this next year.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:33.940
So that was quite a lot.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.330
But I'm really excited about
the new experiences that we're

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:42.210
creating and the new content
types that we're developing.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:47.930
This gives users new ways
to explore the catalog

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.160
and gives them lots more reasons
to come back to the store

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.690
and continue to explore
the store along the theme

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.470
of continued engagement,
ongoing engagement,

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.870
and, obviously, reengagement.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:07.040
Expect to see a lot
more on that in 2018.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.105
So now over to Shahid, who's
going to talk about Chrome.

00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:14.395
SHAHID HUSSAIN: Hi, everyone.

00:39:14.395 --> 00:39:15.560
My name's Shahid.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.050
I'm a product manager
on the Chrome OS team.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.640
Before I jump into
what we're going

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.015
to talk a little
bit about today,

00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:25.270
can I just ask how many of you
are familiar with Chrome OS?

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.110
Maybe you've used it.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.650
How many of you
have a Chromebook?

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.790
OK, awesome.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.870
Thank you for using
it, trying it.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.930
We're very excited to
be here at Playtime.

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.540
And what we wanted
to do is share

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.470
with you a little bit of an
introduction to Chrome OS

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.275
and how apps can work
on that platform.

00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:50.650
So for those of you who are
maybe a little less familiar,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.030
let me maybe start with
some of the basics.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:57.010
So Chrome OS, since we
started building a product,

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.200
has been about
these three things--

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.880
speed, simplicity, and security.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.970
We want Chrome OS to be
a fast operating system.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.670
Fast to start, fast to use.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.980
We want it to be
simple, easy to use.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.730
We think of Chrome OS like
a tool that just disappears

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.480
and lets you, as a user, get
on with whatever you were there

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.510
to do.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.820
And we want it to be secure.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.252
That's been core to the way
we've built Chrome OS ever

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.210
since we first started.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.880
So that set of ideas, which
has been very constant,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.190
has led us to some success.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.910
Chromebook shipments overtook
Macs in the United States

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.390
last year.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.915
And for those of you who
are familiar with Chrome OS,

00:40:39.915 --> 00:40:42.390
we're very strong in
the education space.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.580
Chromebooks actually
outsell every other device

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.090
combined in education.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:49.170
But it's not only
in education space

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.090
where we're growing
and getting stronger.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.170
We've seen nearly 20%
year-on-year growth in retail.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.730
And we'll be
continuing to invest

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.540
in the success of Chromebooks
across the company

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.622
the end of this year and
over the next few years.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.150
The Chrome OS team is
new here at Playtime,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.970
because the Play Store is
fairly new to Chrome OS.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.890
So last year at IO, we announced
the availability of Google Play

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:17.620
on Chrome OS.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:22.950
And we've been working hard to
improve how Play and Android

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.410
apps work on Chrome OS.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.120
Just a couple of weeks ago,
we worked with our colleagues

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.700
in the Google hardware team on
the launch of the new Google

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.840
Pixelbook.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.350
And the Pixelbook is
really a next step

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.602
in the evolution of the
Play Store on Chrome OS.

00:41:42.602 --> 00:41:44.310
And we feel the quality
of the experience

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.410
and the quality of the
apps running on it is good.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:53.230
But it's not just Chrome OS
when we think about Android

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.010
apps running on the desktop.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.380
Chrome OS is what we do.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.260
But also, we work very
closely with teams

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.645
like the Samsung team, who have
decks built into their product.

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:04.270
So we're expecting
to see more and more

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.420
of that desktop projection
activity running on mobile.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.810
And that is very, very similar.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.820
Essentially,
Android apps running

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.074
inside a desktop environment.

00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:16.990
So that's one of the
reasons why we think this

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.090
is important for developers.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.220
The types of apps,
though, can be different.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.540
So for me personally, when I
use apps on my mobile phone,

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.620
I tend to use it
in short bursts.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.560
And when I pay for
apps on mobile,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.890
I tend to spend
just a few dollars.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.780
But on desktop, the kinds
of apps that I'll use,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.990
I will use hours at a time
or for many hours at a time.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.510
And I'm happy to spend up
to a few hundred dollars

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.000
because often the usage
is professional in nature.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
So these really simple
changes in the form factor--

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.240
going to a bigger screen,
getting faster inputs

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.060
with mouse and keyboard--

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.311
drive a different kind of usage.

00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:00.060
And that's been reflected
in our analytics

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.610
when we look at how
people are using apps

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.740
on these two platforms.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.660
So immersive apps, like
Skype, Sin City, AutoCAD 360,

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.030
our analytics tell us
that users spend more time

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.060
in that app on a Chromebook
than they do on a smartphone

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:19.650
because the type of
usage can be different.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.150
So now that we've talked a
little bit about the why, what

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.900
I'd like to do is share
with you, briefly,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.620
some thoughts on how you
can help optimize your app,

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.820
so it runs really well inside
a desktop operating system,

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:33.737
like Chrome OS.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.690
So first of all, Chromebooks
work like any other Android

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.390
device.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.660
If you have an app on
the Google Play Store,

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.730
it probably already
works on Chrome OS.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.724
And for those of you who
have Chrome OS devices,

00:43:47.724 --> 00:43:49.890
I hope you've had a chance
to go into the Play Store

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.990
on those devices and check
out your apps running

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.020
there are already.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.740
Many developers understandably
focus their testing

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.580
on mobile devices.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:03.950
So once you see it running on
a big screen in laptop form

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.310
factor, often, the
need for optimization

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.540
becomes immediately apparent.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.540
So the best piece of advice
I could share there is just

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.470
try it.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.410
That said, we've
worked with many

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.200
of you and many other developers
to do those optimizations.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.860
So we found that
some of the questions

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.980
come down to these
four differences

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.200
between mobile and desktop.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.570
First one of those
is wider screens.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:34.480
And it's probably the
most common issue.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.920
Some apps don't use
real estate like they

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.600
should on a wider screen.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.270
So this is stuff that
we need to do too.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.300
This is an older
version of Google Maps.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.030
The new version
fixes this problem.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.350
So as you can see,
the content is

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:53.440
locked in this column in
the middle of the screen.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.235
And there's all of this space
on the sides of the screen that

00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:57.254
isn't really being used.

00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:01.200
And here's another example.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.060
This is a conversation
from Google Hangouts.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.170
So in this example,
if it's on mobile,

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.670
everything flows neatly down
the middle of the screen.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:11.340
And if you read down
the conversation,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.680
you can go from
bubble to bubble.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.960
But in the case
of a wider screen,

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.640
the two sides of
the conversation

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.770
are hard panned left
and right, so the eye

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.350
has to scan from one side
to the other to the other

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.340
to the other.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.430
And it makes it a
little bit awkward.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.450
And this is exactly
the kind of thing

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.221
that just becomes immediately
apparent once you see

00:45:30.221 --> 00:45:31.470
it running on a larger screen.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:37.440
The second note is that
phones are default portrait,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.350
while laptops are
default landscape.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:42.780
So this is an example.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.680
This is a game called "Store
4, Rise of [INAUDIBLE]."."

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.570
And it's built for portrait.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.500
Chrome OS respects that setting,
so you're not at your laptop

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.080
and looking at it like this.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.100
So we do orient in
the correct direction.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.982
But this is a case where
it's a graphics-rich game.

00:45:59.982 --> 00:46:01.440
You have all this
beautiful content

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.960
in the middle of the
screen, but these black bars

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.740
on the side of it.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.090
Now we know that fixing this
kind of thing is non-trivial.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.890
But we wanted to
share another example.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.640
We've worked with this team.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.540
This is the Bubble
Witch Saga 3 game.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.560
So this is a game
where the action is

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.120
happening in a vertical space.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.080
For those of you who've
played this game,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.500
you shoot these balls
up to catch balls

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.785
at the top of the same color.

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:30.910
And the action is happening
in that vertical strip,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.430
so what would you
put on the sides?

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.490
So this is an example of
how this team has worked

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:40.300
with our team to find a good
solution for making sure

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.565
that graphical
richness is spread

00:46:42.565 --> 00:46:44.440
a little bit towards
the sides of the screen.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.940
The third thing that's
different is windowing.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.600
Chrome OS, like most
desktop operating systems,

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.780
has a windowing system,
because multitasking is part

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.880
of the benefit of doing that.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.730
Now many apps assume that the
window size equals the display

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.200
size, which makes complete sense
on a regular mobile Android

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.560
device, but that's not always
the case, even sometimes

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.340
on Android, where you can do
split screen controls on newer

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.950
Android releases.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.140
Part of the value of
desktop is multitasking.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.800
And in this case, the
window size probably

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:30.610
doesn't equal the
display size, so apps

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.550
need to understand that.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.450
When an input is
coming into the app,

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.650
if the input is being read with
respect to the display size,

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.070
and the output is
being pushed out

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:44.430
with respect to the app's
position, that can create input

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.760
offset errors.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.880
So that's just an
example of some

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.870
of the kinds of things
to watch out for because

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:51.870
of the windowing system.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:56.340
So just being careful
to read and ensure

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.860
that input and output
are being coordinated

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:04.250
with respect to
the same artifacts,

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.616
that will help eliminate
those kinds of errors.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.650
Finally, keyboard
pointer and stylus input,

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.580
which on desktop
machines, enables a user

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.950
to be able to input
information much, much faster.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:21.390
There's lots of
common states here

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.400
that are kind of
uncommon on mobile,

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.250
so for example, hover states.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:30.720
I see an icon with an app, and
I want to know what that does.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.537
I can hover over it
and get a tool tip

00:48:32.537 --> 00:48:34.620
on desktop, which helps
me understand what it does

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.510
before I have to click on it.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.360
So obviously that's an
uncommon interaction.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.160
Another example is
swiping to dismiss.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.450
That's really common on
mobile and very natural.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.780
You're on an email app or a
reminder's app, for example.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.650
And I swipe away to dismiss.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.240
On desktop, that's
kind of weird.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.490
Because you have to
select it and drag it

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.830
to the side with a
mouse or a touchpad.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:00.400
So understanding how the
usage patterns change

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.740
as you go from one
form factor to another

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:10.180
will help you build an app that
works in both of these cases.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.900
And those updates
can be really simple.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.609
This is Slack.

00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:15.150
We worked closely
with the Slack team

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.840
on ensuring that app works
really well on Chrome OS.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.740
If you're in Slack and you
want to send a message,

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.560
before we went down the
path of working with them,

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.470
you would enter a message inside
the app running on Chrome OS

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:30.460
and hit Enter here.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.790
And it would give you
a carriage return.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:37.510
So simple change-- hitting Enter
here now sends the message.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.600
It just helps that app
behave a little bit more

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.720
like what you would expect
a desktop app to do.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.630
And lots of simple changes can
add up to a much better user

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:46.582
experience.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.750
So as I mentioned, and you've
seen a couple of examples,

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.810
we've been working with many app
developers to implement these.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:58.750
A couple of I
wanted to highlight.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.320
On the left here is Squid.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.400
This is a note-taking
app and a drawing app.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.210
They are taking advantage
of an additional new API

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.580
that we've built
into Chrome OS--

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:17.185
super low latency, down
to just 10 milliseconds

00:50:17.185 --> 00:50:20.119
is where you can get
down to, and that

00:50:20.119 --> 00:50:22.160
makes writing and drawing
feel much more natural.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.580
So many, many apps
in the Play Store

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.750
who can take advantage
of this and stylus inputs

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.170
are working with us on ensuring
that they can take advantage

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.790
of this super low latency.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:35.920
But also adding
keyboard controls

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.120
to games like, in this case,
Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes,

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.900
so that users can feel a little
more immersed in the action

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.360
when they're running
this on desktop.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.770
This is just a couple.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.444
There are many, many more teams
that we've been working with.

00:50:51.444 --> 00:50:53.860
For those of you who are here
from those teams, thank you.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.570
We hope to work with you more.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.080
And for those of you who
we haven't talked to yet,

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.780
we'll look forward to talking
with you a little bit more.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.820
So ongoing, we wanted
to see whatever

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.380
we can to highlight great apps
to work that work on Chrome OS.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.600
We did this at the
launch of the Pixelbook,

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.770
where we highlighted a
number of apps and demos

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.490
to press, et cetera.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.620
But there's lots more
that we want to do.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.245
We want to show people
the best of the apps that

00:51:22.245 --> 00:51:24.300
are available on
Play and Chrome OS--

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:28.530
features on Play,
in-store demos, websites,

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:32.320
press review kits, pre-loads,
and much, much more.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.760
So we would love you to
come and chat with us

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.224
in the classroom at 2:00 PM.

00:51:38.224 --> 00:51:39.640
We'd love to work
with many of you

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.260
that we are working with more.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.139
We'd love to work with many
of you that we aren't yet.

00:51:44.139 --> 00:51:45.930
So please, come to chat
with us at 2:00 PM.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:48.220
And we'd love to discuss
with you some more.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.610
So with that, I'd like to
have you over to Nathan, PM

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.280
on our developer
platform for Daydream.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.099
Thank you.

00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:56.140
NATHAN MARTZ: I'm Nathan.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.510
It's awesome to be here.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:02.920
And I think it's safe to say
that, over the last decade,

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.160
phones have become
dramatically more powerful.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.400
The phones that we have today
have bigger, higher resolution

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.900
screens, faster CPUs and
GPUs, more memory and storage

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.400
than they had a decade ago.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.570
But one thing that hasn't
changed very much at all

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:23.590
is the sensors on the
devices themselves.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.980
We have GPS, cameras,
accelerometers today.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.230
And we had those a decade ago.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.510
And if you think about
it, these sensors

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:35.440
are fundamentally how the
phone understands its place

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.220
in the world.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.200
And because they
haven't changed a lot,

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.960
I'm excited to talk
about how they're

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.262
about to change in what we're
calling augmented reality.

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:46.720
And if you're not
familiar with it,

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.510
augmented reality is
basically a synthesis

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:54.310
of advancements in computer
vision with these incredibly

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:56.380
powerful computing
platforms we all

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.600
carry around in our pockets.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.580
And what augmented
reality does is

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:04.120
it allows the phone to
synthesize information out

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.720
about the world and actually
compute the precise position

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.710
and orientation of that device,
understand the world around it,

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.890
and allow you, the developer,
to actually integrate

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.920
digital information in
the context of real world

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.170
objects, which is
exactly where it's

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:23.369
the most accessible and useful.

00:53:23.369 --> 00:53:24.910
And augmented reality
is going to let

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:28.240
us do incredible new
things on our phones.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.790
For example, you can
shop for furniture

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.470
without ever leaving your home.

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:36.820
You can browse the world's
largest warehouse of couches.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.940
You can pick one that you
want, place it in your room

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.900
and see it in exactly
the right scale,

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.880
in exactly the right proportions
lit by the real light

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.700
from the real window
in the real world.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.300
Because augmented reality
also understands the objects

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.640
in the world, we can
actually learn about them

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.310
and interact with them
through augmented reality.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:59.830
So you can finally actually
make a good cup of coffee

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:02.650
on that office Espresso machine
that you've always wondered

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.310
about.

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:07.090
Of course augmented
reality is going

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:09.970
to be great for gaming
and communication.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:13.750
Augmented reality will allow
us to play, have fun, express

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:17.410
our personalities
in totally new ways

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.650
and blur the difference
between our digital selves

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:22.630
and our real selves.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:26.260
And of course, because augmented
reality allows the phone

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.380
to understand the world in
so much greater precision,

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.470
it's going to allow us to
navigate the world indoors

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:37.015
and out in ways that have
never been possible before.

00:54:37.015 --> 00:54:39.265
This is something we have
actually a lot of experience

00:54:39.265 --> 00:54:40.080
with at Google.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.630
We've been doing AR
since 2014 through what

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:45.262
was called Project Tango.

00:54:45.262 --> 00:54:46.720
And if you're not
familiar with it,

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.500
Tango was a hardware program
that enhanced certain phones

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.170
with new AR specific sensors.

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.260
And through Tango, we
learned an incredible amount

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.820
about what it takes to run and
create compelling smartphone AR

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.040
experiences on Android.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.980
The challenge for us, of course,
is that, as you can imagine,

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.830
this requirement of
a custom sensor suite

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:10.690
limited the rate
that we could scale

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:13.180
the Tango's specific ecosystem.

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.790
And one of these that were
most proud about at Google

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:19.270
is that, today, Android is
the world's most popular

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:22.540
mobile computing platform,
with over 2 billion users.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.700
And so what I want to
talk to you about today

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.710
is how we're bringing
augmented reality

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.260
to the world at Android scale.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.290
It's a brand new technology
just released a couple of months

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.630
ago called ARCore.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:36.670
And essentially,
what ARCore is, it's

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:39.790
an adaptation of the core
innovations and algorithms

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:43.430
from Tango, but all
implemented in software,

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.270
so they can run on
commodity Android phones

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.270
without any
modification whatsoever.

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:51.430
And as a developer,
ARCore is going

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:55.130
to give you three powerful
foundational technologies.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.394
The first of which is
called motion tracking.

00:55:57.394 --> 00:55:58.810
And this is what
actually computes

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:01.210
the position and
orientation of the phone

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.500
and updates it over time.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.200
So you can place a virtual
object, look at it,

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.230
walk around it, get
closer, move back

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.150
and have the object
feel like it's actually

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.040
stationed in the
real world, just

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.530
like the Scarecrow
on the screen.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:17.350
But of course, in order to
place that virtual object,

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:20.540
you need to understand
the geometry of the world.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.120
So we have a second
technology called

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.922
environmental understanding.

00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:25.630
And what environmental
understanding does

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.270
is it looks at the 3-D
structure of the world

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:31.240
and synthesizes that
for you in identifying

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:36.279
major features, like the plane
of the ground or the stage.

00:56:36.279 --> 00:56:37.820
Lastly, though, we
want to understand

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.580
not just the atoms of the
world, but the photons

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.680
of the world as well.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.330
We want to understand the
illumination of our scenes

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:48.200
so that you can actually capture
the ambient lighting, apply it

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.260
to digital objects so they
feel married into the scene,

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.110
and can even react to changes
in illumination, like our friend

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.270
the Cowardly Lion
here on the video.

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.660
ARCore works on
qualified devices

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.720
running Android N and above.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.360
Today, we're in what's
called a developer preview.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.060
So we've limited ARCore
to specific phones.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:14.710
That's the Pixel, Pixel
2, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL,

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.410
and the Samsung Galaxy S8.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:20.320
But we're going to be exiting
the developer preview very

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.020
soon.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.930
And when we do,
later this winter,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:27.010
ARCore is going to run on
100 million Android devices.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:30.040
And we're partnering with
the entire Android ecosystem

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.620
to scale that number
aggressively next year

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.860
and beyond, which is an
incredible amount of scale

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.860
for a brand new technology.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.000
So if you're a
developer, of course,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.670
you want to use this stuff
and actually get started.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:49.410
So we have great SDKs for
Android Studio, Unity, Unreal.

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:53.470
These are native easy-to-use
high performance APIs.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.136
So whether you're a game
developer or a native app

00:57:56.136 --> 00:57:57.760
developer, you can
actually get started

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.430
building for ARCore today.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.580
Of course at Google, we
care a lot about the web.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.921
It's deep in our DNA.

00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:07.420
We believe that,
ultimately, the web

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.000
is going to be part of
bringing AR to everyone.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.260
And so we're investing
actually in web AR standards

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.120
and prototype
browsers that allow

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.010
web developers to
eventually have

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.850
the same capabilities
as all of you

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.400
native app developers
have today.

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.860
One thing I want to bring
up that's really important.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.900
All of you are
here because you've

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.384
built amazing apps and great
businesses on top of them.

00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:34.550
And I'm sure you as you
hear about a new technology,

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:36.841
especially something that
involves 3-D, like AR, you're

00:58:36.841 --> 00:58:39.500
thinking, do I have
to start from scratch?

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.970
Do I have to build a brand new
app to take advantage of AR?

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.960
And I'm very happy
to say that no,

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.090
you actually don't
have to do that.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:50.170
One of the things that's
amazing and great about AR

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.607
and has been a design
criteria for our AR SDKs

00:58:53.607 --> 00:58:55.690
is that we want to make
sure that you can actually

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.830
add AR as an enhancement to the
apps that you've already built

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.850
and have users engaging with.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.180
So for some of
you, you may see AR

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.000
as an opportunity to start a
brand new business, a brand

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.210
new kind of app.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.560
But for the rest of you, you
can treat AR like a new feature,

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.500
like a new capability
added to your app.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.260
And if you're a Unity
developer, use our Unity SDK.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.370
Native in Android Studio?

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:21.370
We've got you covered,
and Unreal as well.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:23.620
So for all of you, you
can add augmented reality

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.710
to your existing app exactly
where it matters most.

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:28.840
And then when you're ready
to do something else,

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.210
move on to a different
capability or part of your user

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:32.680
flow.

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.600
I'm personally
incredibly excited

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.360
about this new
technology, how it's

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.830
going to allow our phones
to understand the world,

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.440
the way it's going to let
us, as developers, integrate

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.130
and enhance our
understanding of the user,

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:46.459
of the world with
our display of it.

00:59:46.459 --> 00:59:48.250
But if you're still a
little bit skeptical,

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.854
we've got a fun video that
hopefully convinces you

00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:52.020
that this is pretty awesome.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.420
So let's roll the video.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.410
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.885
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.610
[END PLAYBACK]

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.110
Thanks.

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:14.160
If you're interested in
building for ARCore, please,

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.070
check out
developers.google.com/ar.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:20.000
It's got links to documentation,
getting started, downloads

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.380
for our SDKs, a ton more.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.880
Or, of course, you're here.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.440
Come check out our classroom on
VR and AR later this afternoon

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.730
just across the hall.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.860
Thank you all so
much for your time.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.440
We're going to take a
quick 10 minute break,

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.340
and we'll see you
back here afterwards.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.180
Thank you so much.
