00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
I have never really worked on a project
where it's engaged my interest

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.140
so heavily as the Nanodegree program has. I
think the project that was the most

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.620
impactful was the deep learning project
to classify traffic signs. Before going

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
into that, I really knew nothing about convolutional neural nets. Being able to apply it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.480
within the domain of driverless vehicles - it was extremely exciting.
