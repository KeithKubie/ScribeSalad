00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.120
[cattle moo]

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000
- I got some leather here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.380
- What?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.330
- I’ll hold the tail
for you, Dusty.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.170
What that was,
about an eight-footer?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.790
- That’s a man-eater
right there, huh?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.710
- Look at that big old snake!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.250
That’s a beautiful skin.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.790
- Make you a jacket, Mr. Troy?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.210
- Oh, look. You ever had
python gumbo, bro?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.920
- Hey, the python’s good.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.880
Might have to work
something out, huh, Troy?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.380
Maybe we can trade, you know.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.460
I’d like to get
some of them gator skins.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.960
- We can get you some
gator skins, that’s for sure.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.330
Turn around a minute. Look.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.670
See what I’m saying?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.790
Put that down the back
of a jacket, whoo!

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.000
[all laugh]

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.460
Every pattern is different?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.290
- Yeah. Yeah, it’s crazy.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.330
It’s like a fingerprint.
Every pattern’s different.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.080
- Does she lay eggs in a nest?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380
She makes her nest with eggs?
- Yeah.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.710
- Didn’t you say
the other day

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.380
that one of these,
the big one had 83--

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.040
- Yeah, 83 eggs.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.790
- [whistles]

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.500
- Do you think these snakes
will migrate?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.920
- Oh, yeah. They’re moving
every direction.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.000
- Really?
- North, south, east and west.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.170
They’re moving down into
the Keys in the saltwater.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.040
They go through the saltwater,
it don’t affect them.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.620
We got endangered wood rats
down there.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.500
We got Key deer
that are endangered.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
And they get in
them islands, man,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.540
it’s gonna be hard
to get ’em out of there.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.830
- I know we drove around
over there at night

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.380
till 2:00, 3:00
in the morning.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.580
You don’t see an animal.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.710
- In Orlando somewhere,
they had a pet snake.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.540
It got out of the room,
went into the baby’s room,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.290
into the crib,
and ate the damn baby.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.920
- Got the 911 call.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.250
- They ain’t no way, bro,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.420
I’d have that in my house
with a child.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.040
I wouldn’t have it
in my house no way.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.710
- Look, what do I got to do
to work out a trade, you know?

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.460
I wanna take some of these
gators home with me

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.460
and skin ’em out and tan ’em.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.210
- How many you want?
One? Two?

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.960
- Hey, as many as I can get.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.540
- We got almost 1,000.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.210
- If I fill up
the back of my truck,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.330
I’ll be good.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.380
- Yep. We can make a deal,
buddy.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.210
I’d love to have
one of them nice skins.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.620
Hell, yeah, baby,
let’s make a deal!
