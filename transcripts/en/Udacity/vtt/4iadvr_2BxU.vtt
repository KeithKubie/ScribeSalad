00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.355
Naturally, we don't like feeling uncomfortable. Therefore we're motivated to

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:08.675
try to decrease that overall level of discomfort. Remember in the lesson on

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.514
consciousness, I talked about drugs? And specifically I talked about all the

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:17.033
negative effects of smoking tobacco. In that lesson I asked students who were

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:21.030
smokers to consider that negative information. And I did so in a hopes to try

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.876
to motivate some people to quit smoking. Now what happens when you realize

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:30.264
there are negative consequences for smoking? Well, we want to decrease those

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:34.446
negative feelings that we experience. So how do we do this? Well, there are

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:36.924
three options that we can use to help to decrease the discomfort that we

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:41.036
experience. And the first is that we can change our behavior to make it more

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:45.731
consistent with our dissonant cognition. So here for example the person may try

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.956
to quit smoking using a nicotine patch or perhaps a self help group. The second

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:54.678
way we can do so is to try to justify our behavior. And to justify our

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.242
behavior, we try to make our cognitions more consistent with the behavior that

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:03.258
we're engaging in. So the person may say to themselves that smoking's not that

00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:08.480
bad for me and all that research is mostly correlational. And the third way we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.000
can attempt to decrease said discomfort is by adding new cognitions that are

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.990
consistent and support our behavior. Here the person may say, I just enjoy

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.910
smoking and I think it's worth it, therefore I'm not concerned about the risks.
