00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.169
[music playing]

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:10.468
NARRATOR: Lund University,
Sweden, August 27, 2013.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.680
Researchers confirm the
existence of a new element

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.975
on the periodic table, created
through nuclear fusion.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:26.192
They name it Ununpentium,
or element 115.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.862
Although most scientists
still don't know much about

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.531
this unique
radioactive component,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.743
it shares commonalities
with plutonium, used

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.202
in experimental rocket fuels.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.337
Element 115 has its own
lore in the UFO history.

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:49.132
So this was said to be
an element described

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.593
by a gentleman
named Bob Lazar, who

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.554
claimed to have worked
just south of Area 51

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.891
on an ET flying saucer.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:03.438
The government is holding
nine alien spacecraft

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.734
that propelled by a
modified gravity generator.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:12.906
It's being-- the work is
being conducted 50 miles south

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.617
of Groom Lake, at
that isolated area

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:19.370
only designated as S4, that
at least one of those crafts

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.539
operate.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.000
According to what Lazar
said, these alien craft

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.961
ran on element 115.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.588
And there's no
evidence that we have

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.466
that it's even occurring
naturally anywhere on Earth.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.927
Well, it turns out
that scientists

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.179
now claim to have
created element

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.893
115 by atomic collisions.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.438
I think this recent
discovery of Ununpentium

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.983
really does help us
understand the significance

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.236
of Bob Lazar's testimony.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:55.990
This was a man who was exposed
to a very rare element that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.743
was allegedly part of
the propulsion system

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.286
of an extraterrestrial vehicle.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.674
NARRATOR: On December 23,
2015, scientists working

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:16.052
at the University of California
announce the creation

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:19.347
of a new metal that is
strong and lightweight,

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:24.269
but also flexible and resistant
to extremely high temperatures.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.146
What's really exciting about
this material is you don't lose

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.190
a lot of its
flexibility, what we call

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.277
it's plastic-like properties.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.987
A lot of metals, when
you make them strong,

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.072
become very brittle.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.658
So this material has a large
number of applications,

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.786
whether it be a car, an
airplane, or a spaceship.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.918
NARRATOR: While this miracle
metal is unlike any alloy

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:53.131
developed before, some believe
its description is actually

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:58.428
familiar and that it may be a
match to the strange material

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.638
allegedly retrieved
by Major Jesse

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.516
Marcel from the
infamous Roswell crash.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.689
Most of the stuff from
Roswell was extraordinarily

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.067
lightweight, very thin,
foil-like material,

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.113
very, very strong, but
weighing next to nothing.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.406
That's from people
who handled it.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.202
The UCLA guys are
doing research,

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:28.458
open research more or less,
with the stuff from Roswell.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.337
This material is the beginning
of an entirely new revolution

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.923
in materials
science, where we are

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.759
now going to be able
to engineer materials

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.677
at the molecular level.

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:42.221
And this does appear
to be the fruits

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.725
of a long-term, reverse
engineering program, where

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.644
those technologies
are being brought

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.395
into the corporate sector.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.773
And now, it's become something
that we all take for granted.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:52.774
