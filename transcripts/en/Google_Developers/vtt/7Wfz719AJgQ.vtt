TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.233
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.350
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.820
In Chrome 61 for
Android, we've launched

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.100
the navigator.share
method, which

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.980
allows web sites to invoke the
native sharing capabilities

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.510
of the host platform.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.580
It's part of the
simple Web Share API

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.890
that allows you to easily
trigger the native Android

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.390
share dialog, passing either
a URL or text to share.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.540
Code and screenshots are on the
post, linked in the description

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.080
below.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.260
We recently introduced
the Mobile Web Specialist

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
Certification to
highlight developers

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.570
who have in-demand skills
as mobile web devs.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
Follow the link and get
your digital badge today.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
Based in Berlin, Zalando is
Europe's leading online fashion

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.490
platform.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.000
With more than 70% of its
traffic now coming from mobile,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.190
the company has invested
a lot in improving

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.880
the quality of its app to
provide a good user experience.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
Using features like A/B
testing, the pre-launch report,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.090
and the new release dashboard
from the Google Play Console,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
Zalando saw a 6% increase in
installs and a 15% increase

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.600
in users' lifetime value.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.860
Click through to the post for
the video with more details.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.360
The holiday season is
right around the corner.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.030
So we're rolling
out new reporting

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
to show how often your
shopping ad is in the top spot,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.550
including product
status reporting

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.370
and absolute top
impressions shared.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.690
Get started with the post.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.930
TensorBoard is a suite
of visualizations

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.510
for inspecting and understanding
your TensorFlow models

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.560
and runs.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.500
To allow the creation of new
and useful visualizations,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.630
we recently made
available a consistent set

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.570
of APIs that allows you to
add custom visualization

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.940
plugins to TensorBoard.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.950
Our hope is that
you use this API

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.230
to extend TensorBoard
and ensure that it covers

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.660
a wider variety of use cases.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.120
Details, links, and
screenshots are on the post.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.810
We recently announced a
Dedicated Interconnect,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.580
which lets you establish
a private network

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.320
connection directly
to Google Cloud

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.990
Platform through one of
our Dedicated Interconnect

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.370
locations.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.430
Dedicated Interconnect also
offers increased throughput

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.770
and even a potential
reduction in network costs.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.960
For more details
and to get started,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.150
head on over to the post.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.010
A key feature of
Google Compute Engine

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.230
is managed instance
groups, which

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.840
allows you to manage collections
of identical instances

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.540
as a unit to quickly
deploy new VMs

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.120
and ensure they're
consistently configured.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.360
We recently announced a new
managed instance group updater

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.490
to help you update your
Compute Engine via SMS

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.340
programmatically, and at scale.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.940
Details and screenshots
are on the post, linked

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.720
in the description below.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.460

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.404

I'll see you next week.
