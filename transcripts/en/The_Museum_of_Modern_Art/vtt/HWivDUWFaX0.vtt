00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:03.351
(individual keyboard notes played calmly)

00:00:03.351 --> 00:00:07.859
- I'm in MoMA's storage
with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.483
The Street Berlin painted in 1913.

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:16.037
Kirchner had moved to Berlin
a couple of years earlier

00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:20.031
with other members of the
expressionist painter group,

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:24.675
Die BrÃ¼cke, but by 1913
many of them had left

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:28.738
and he was there in the city on his own.

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:32.523
This is one of a number of
street scenes he painted

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:37.422
all characterized as this
work is by this vivid

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.162
anti-naturalistic color.

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.782
These spilling perspectives

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:46.890
and this very very visible brush stroke.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.978
All hallmarks of expressionist painting.

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:55.478
You instantly recognize
that Kirchner's subject

00:00:55.478 --> 00:01:00.478
is not the city per se,
instead his true subject

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.998
is the psychological
experience of an individual

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:09.998
in this very large,
overcrowded urban metropolis.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.637
At this point, Berlin was
the third largest city

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:16.955
in the world, and Kirchner
clearly is responding to that

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:19.765
in the way that he
structures this composition.

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:24.765
The figures in the very
center are two prostitutes

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.610
who for him embodied not
only glamour and alienation,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.288
but the sad reality of a
culture in which everything

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:35.633
was for sale.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:40.207
You see them surrounded by this relatively

00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:44.991
faceless anonymous mask
right of these black garbed

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:46.408
suited men.

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:49.031
None of whom engage them directly.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:53.986
These are symbolic
representations of a form

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:58.259
of urban angst that is
made all the more dramatic

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.649
by the way that he tilts
and spills this composition

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.647
out toward us.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.930
The effect is claustrophobic, I think,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.664
for us as a viewer and is reminiscent

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.659
of what it must have
been like for Kirchner

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.984
to experience the streets
of Berlin in 1913.

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:20.101
