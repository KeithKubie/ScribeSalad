00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.420
We're on problem 55.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.790
At a certain picnic each of the
guests was served either a

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.330
single scoop or a double
scoop of ice cream.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.890
How many of the guests
were served a double

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.720
scoop of ice cream?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.980
So let's say that d is the
number of guests that were

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.410
served double scoop and
that's what we're

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.830
trying to figure out.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.760
So what are their statements?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.120
Statement number one says at the
picnic 60% of the guests

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.000
were served a double
scoop of ice cream.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.470
So 60% percent of the total were
served a double scoop.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.810
Let's see if we can write
that algebraically.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.090
So 60% of the guests.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.330
So the total number of guests
are the number of guests that

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.110
were served double scoops plus
the number of guests that were

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.760
served single scoops.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.620
Then we have all of
the guests, right?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.840
This is this is equal to the
total number of guests.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.600
And then they tell us that
60% of them were

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060
served double scoop.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.069
So the number that were
served double scoop

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.880
is 60% of the total.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.560
So that statement number one is
just an algebraic equation.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.290
And this alone though doesn't
help me solve this equation.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.260
Maybe in the next statement
they'll tell us how many total

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.200
guests there are.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.270
What this is.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.820
And that'll help me
but I don't know.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.520
Let's see, statement number two,
they say a total of 120

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.630
scoops of ice cream were
served to all the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.560
guess at the picnic.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710
So once again, they're telling
us that there are 120 scoops

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.837
of ice cream, they're
not telling us that

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:33.515
there are 120 guests.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.460
So let's see, what are the
total number of scoops.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.970
So there's the number of singles
groups and each of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.010
those are-- the number of guests
that got singles scoops

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.340
are s and then the number of
scoops is just 1 times that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.830
because they each
got one scoop.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.470
And then you have the
number of guests

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.970
that got double scoops.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.830
But then the number of scoops
they got is going to be 2

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.600
times that.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.410
So this is the total numbers
scoops, right?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.040
The number of people that got
single scoops times 1 plus the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.370
number that got double scoops
times 2 and that is going to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.040
be equal to the total
number of scoops.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.470
And this alone isn't going to
help us solve how many double

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.240
scoops were served, it depends
on the singles

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.570
scooped and all of that.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.800
But if you look at both of these
statements we have two

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.550
linear equations and
two unknowns.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.080
So at this point you should
immediately say, unless

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.690
somehow these are the same
equation or somehow these are

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.110
two parallel lines, these should
intersect and allow you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.070
to solve this equation.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.880
So immediately-- especially if
you don't want to waste time--

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.220
you should say that both
statements together are

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.080
sufficient.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
And if you want me to prove this
to you, let me see if I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540
can solve this.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.520
So I'll do it in a
different color.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.980
So let me do some
substitution.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.720
So here we get s is equal
to 120 minus 2d.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.250
And we can substitute
this back here.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:01.250
So you get 0.6 times d plus s,
which is 120 minus 2d, is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.070
equal to d.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.340
And so you get 0.6 times 120
minus d is equal to d.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.580
And what's 0.6 times 120?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.010
That's 72, right?

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.710
6 times 12 is 72.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.140
72 minus 0.6d is equal to d.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:38.410
So you get 72 is equal to 1.6d
and then 72 divided by 1.6 is

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.220
equal to 45.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.710
So there, we solved the problem.
d is equal to 45.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.530
45 double scoops were served.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.475
And then we could substitute
back into the equation to

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.460
figure how many single scoops or
how many total guests there

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.980
were, but this is all that
we had to figure out.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.200
And we were able to using both
statements combined.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.740
To the next problem.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.100
56.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.420
What is the value of xy?

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.110
OK.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.400
Statement number one: they
tell us that y is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.960
equal to x plus 1.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.760
And that's not going to tell me
what xy is, I mean there's

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.600
a bunch of x's and a bunch of
different y's depending on

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680
what I choose.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.890
Two: they tell us y is equal
to x squared plus 1.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.860
Once again, this by itself-- it
completely depends on which

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.390
xy's I pick, right?

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.120
I can pick any combination
and get different values.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.770
You could try that
out yourself.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.030
But I have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.460
It's a little tricky because one
of them's non-linear, but

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.130
let's see if we can figure
it out with substitution.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.530
If y equals this and y equals
that, we could set these two

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.040
equal to each other and see
if we can solve for x.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.520
So we get x plus 1, that's the
first one, should equal this

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.670
one, because they're
both equal to y.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.720
x squared plus 1.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.540
Let's see, we can subtract 1
from both sides and you get x

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.080
is equal to x squared.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.680
And let's see, you could say--
well, you could divide-- if we

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.230
assume that if x does not
equal 0-- so there's two

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.970
solutions here, right?

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.500
x could be equal to 0.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.480
That's completely legitimate.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.080
They never told us that
x isn't equal to 0.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.820
That would satisfy
that equation.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.140
And then what other
x would satisfy?

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.310
x could be equal to 0 or
x could be equal to 1.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.570
Either of those are completely
legitimate

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.380
answers here, right?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.890
Fair enough.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.680
If x is 0 this is true,
0 equals 0.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.130
If x is 1, 1 is equal
to 1 squared. x

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.370
can't be negative 1.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.890
Negative 1 is not equal
to negative 1 squared.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.625
So these are the two
solutions for x.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.750
So right now it seems like
it's a little shady, but

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.290
remember, we're not trying to
solve for x or solve for y,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.330
we're trying to solve for xy.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.710
So maybe when we solve for y
something, I don't know,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.920
interesting could happen.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.970
Let's solve for y.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.060
If you assume x is equal
to 0 what's y?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.590
y is equal to 0 plus 1. y is
equal to 1 in this case.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.790
That's one solution.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.570
And if you put x is equal
to 0 here you also

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.885
get y is equal 1.

00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:16.770
So this is one set
of solutions.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.060
And in this reality xy is going
to be equal to what?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.510
xy is going to be equal
to 0, right?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.520
0 times 1 is 0.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.690
Now if x is equal
to 1, what is y?

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.350
Well, if x is equal to 1,
y is equal to 1 plus 1,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.380
y is equal to 2.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.330
Well, then xy is equal to 2.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.700
So using both of the statements,
I still don't know

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.030
whether xy is equal to 0 or 2.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.290
Someone would have to tell me
that x is not equal to 0, x is

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.350
equal to 0, and only then can I
really solve this equation.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.080
So the answer to this, even
though we have two equations

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.660
and two unknowns, because one
of them was a quadratic and

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.860
had two solutions, we actually
don't know what xy is.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.800
So the answer is that the
statements together are not

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.300
sufficient or E.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.300
That's interesting because they
actually make you do a

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.170
little bit more work than just
eyeballing it and saying, oh,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.370
I have two equations
to unknowns.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.720
You've got to be a little
careful when the equations are

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.280
non-linear.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.660
At least I think that's right.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.050
Alright, question 57.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:32.650
They want to know what
1/x plus 1/y-- some

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.470
police sirens outside.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.480
I live in Palo Alto, there's
not normally a high crime

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.720
scene here but you never know.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.060
Anyway, so 1/x plus 1/y.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:51.670
So statement number one is
x plus y is equal to 14.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.480
Actually let me try to simplify
this a little bit.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.390
If I were to try to add these
two, what could I do?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.980
Well, when you add two fractions
you have to find a

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.740
common denominator.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.860
An easy common denominator
for x and y is just xy.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.050
So 1/x is what over xy?

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.190
Well, it's y/xy plus-- right,
this is the same thing as

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.740
1/x-- plus, and if I had
xy here, what's 1/y?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.740
Well, that's x/xy.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.280
So that can be rewritten
as y plus x over xy.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.070
And now when you rewrite this
statement like this, then

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.380
statement one looks a
little interesting.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.685
They gave us the numerator at
least. They haven't told us

00:08:33.685 --> 00:08:38.070
what xy is but they told us that
y plus x, or x plus y is

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.860
equal to 14.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.789
So statement one, it's kind of
part of the puzzle but it's

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.930
not completely helping us.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.610
Let's see what statement
two tells us.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.630
I suspect, if this is solveable,
they'll have to

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.200
tell us what xy-- yep, they
tell us what xy is.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.530
They tell us that xy
is equal to 24.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.620
So then we're done, right?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.730
This simplifies to this
and they're telling

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.180
us what this is.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.120
x plus y is 14.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.570
So it equals 14/24-- not that
we have to really solve for

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.940
it-- but that is
equal to 7/12.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.610
But as soon as we got--
you say, oh, that's

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.400
that, that's that.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.780
You're done.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.320
You say, both statements
together are sufficient.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.320
So C.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.980
58.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.440
If d denotes a decimal is d
greater than or equal to 0.5?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.920
They put a 0 here so you make
sure you notice the decimal.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.200
d, greater than or
equal to 0.5.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.210
Statement number one tells us
that when d is rounded to the

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.735
nearest 10th the
result is 0.5.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:57.650
So let's see, it could be 0.52
and when you round it to the

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.660
nearest 10th it becomes 0.5.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.410
But on the other hand, it could
be 0.46 and when you're

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.130
round it to the nearest
10th you also get 0.5.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.650
So since statement one says it
could be either one of these,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.340
it really doesn't help us to
know whether we're greater

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.230
than or equal to 0.5.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.660
This one is greater;
this one isn't.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.360
So statement one by itself
doesn't help.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.070
Statement two: when d is rounded
to the nearest integer

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.050
the result is 1.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.860
Now this is interesting.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.870
If something is rounded to the
nearest integer it has to be

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.420
greater than 0.5, right?

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.590
The smallest number that when
you round it to the nearest

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.830
integer equal to 1
is 0.5, right?

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:46.850
So it has to be 0.5 or it has to
be 0.51, because 0.499999,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.350
when you're round it to the
nearest integer, is going to

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.830
be equal 0.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.750
That's the only way it can
get rounded to 1, if

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.420
you're 0.5 or above.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.030
So actually statement two alone
is all you need to know

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.700
that d is greater than
or equal to 0.5.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.990
So that is choice B.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.065
Statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:10.170
Alright, I've realized
I've run out of time.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.930
See you in the next video.
