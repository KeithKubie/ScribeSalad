00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.529
For over two decades now, if the New York
news (or any other present) needs a soundbite

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.501
or quote from an “everyman” or “man
on the street” to round off a story, there

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:25.789
has been one man they’ve been able to rely
on with an almost staggering level of consistency-

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:26.860
Gregory Packer.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.730
Since the mid-1990s, Packer has been quoted
hundreds of times by newspapers across America

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
and has aired his opinions on everything from
the Iraq War to the Star Wars movies.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.410
A divisive figure among media members, Packer
has been both praised and mocked for his stalwart

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.290
dedication to being the first to show up to
newsworthy events, whether the media likes

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.329
it or not.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.330
Born in 1963 in Huntington, New York, profiles
of Packer in the very newspapers he’s been

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.829
so frequently quoted note that he harbored
a fascination with celebrity from a very young

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.030
age, starting at age 8 when Packer’s mother
gave him a signed photo of Natalie Wood, reportedly

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.060
after she met the actress by chance on a plane.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.590
Four years later, Packer’s father stoked
the fires of his son’s obsession by gifting

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.900
him an autograph from boxing legend Joe Louis.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.590
As he entered his formative years, Packer
took to seeking out celebrities on his own,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.840
tracking down his favourite hockey players
for autographs after games or public appearances.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.549
Little is known about Packer’s life directly
after he graduated high school in 1983, save

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.899
for the fact that he got a job working as
a highway maintenance worker sometime in the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.899
late 1980s- a job that he somehow retired
from in the early 2000s while only in his

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:38.899
late 30s.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.599
Since then, Packer has stepped up his life’s
mission to be quoted by as many news sources

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.380
as possible by making it a full-time gig…

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.140
Why?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.319
It all started in 1995, when he was quoted
by the Tampa Tribune as saying: “The Jewish

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.359
people are fans of Pope John Paul II.”

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.099
Packer notes that seeing his name in print
made him feel like he’d “accomplished

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.099
something”.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.609
He further states, “Sometimes I need to
stick my face in a camera.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.619
I just need to show people I’m alive….

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.709
I really am totally obsessed with having my
name out there, but it’s a healthy obsession.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.319
It’s not like I’m hurting anyone.”

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.940
In an attempt to recapture that high he found
when his words appeared in the Tampa Tribune,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.660
he states he began attending roughly two major
events every week, using his weekends, vacation,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750
and personal days to accomplish this.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.550
When the latter ran out, Packer would sometimes
just call in sick, missing pay for that day,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.380
but at least potentially getting his name
in the news.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.310
When asked in 2002 if he was worried that
calling in sick to wait in line to buy tickets

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.610
to a Britney Spears concert might get him
fired, Packer responded frankly: “Even if

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.000
when I went back to work I got fired, I know
I would have the full support of the public.”

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.180
Since his early retirement, he has, however,
not had any such work issue and has been able

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.120
to be the first in line for almost every major
event in New York State, and occasionally

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.650
branching out to places across the country
when possible, attending book signings, political

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.460
rallies, concerts, parades, sporting events,
mall openings, product releases, and even

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.400
funerals, such as attempting to go to Whitney
Houston’s funeral.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.820
(Only those invited actually got to see the
funeral, but the fact that he essentially

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.670
camped out as close to the action as was allowed,
he still got his quote in the news, stating

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.910
“It’s important to be out here with the
fans…

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.100
They should have allowed everyone to see it.”)

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.370
The result of all of this is that Packer has
been quoted by nearly every major newspaper

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.260
and news organisation in the United States.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.319
He’s also briefly met at least three different
U.S. presidents (Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter,

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.980
George W. Bush- who he had a nice conversation
about baseball with; he claims he’s actually

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.150
met four presidents, but doesn’t appear
to mention anywhere who the fourth one was).

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.000
On top of that, he’s watched Michael Jackson
do the moonwalk up close and personal, met

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.569
Dennis Rodman, Britney Spears, Courtney Love,
Mariah Carey, Garth Brooks, Ringo Starr, sat

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.250
in the front row at the Super Bowl twice,
was one of the first people in America to

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.430
buy an iPhone (waiting in line 110 straight
hours to do it), and had none other than Hillary

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.130
Clinton seemingly recognize him on-sight,
surprising Packer at a book signing by saying,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.480
“Hello, Mr. Packer”.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.160
He accomplished all of this thanks, in part,
to his apparent superpower- the ability to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.319
ignore fatigue and boredom for countless hours
on end while appearing extremely jovial the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.850
entire time.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.840
You see, as you might have guessed based on
what you’ve read so far, Packer quickly

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.509
discovered that the best way to be quoted
by the press, meet some celebrity, or appear

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.629
on TV was simply to be the first person in
line for a major event; once that’s accomplished,

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.250
to increase odds even further, he states you
must be continually boisterously happy and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.860
friendly while sitting there and waiting-
sometimes for days.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.180
In all cases, Packer waits with the simple
hope that he’ll be approached by a reporter

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.419
or otherwise just appear on TV in some way,
with the latter often happening in wide pan

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.669
shots of the line and event, or sometimes
with Packer appearing in the background, such

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.240
as times when a famous person is addressing
the media or giving a speech where a crowd

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.490
is allowed around.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.050
As such, it should come as no surprise that
Packer has been described by some as a “professional

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.639
line sitter”, impressively usually seen
pictured waiting in line with little more

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.289
than a newspaper and wearing simple, everyman
outfits that fit the event, including things

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.949
like Yankees shirts or NYPD hoodies.

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.099
Packer rarely brings either food or water
to events unless absolutely necessary, such

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.319
as when camping out for days, once being quoted
as saying, “I don’t bring extra supplies

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.310
because you’ve got to worry about supplies
being left behind.”

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.130
Naturally, his frequency of being at all these
events and so often getting quoted was bound

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.139
to eventually become noticed within the world
of journalism, and there has been some backlash

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.699
to his striving to achieve his simple dream.

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.669
On that note, Packer has had an uneasy relationship
with the public at large, with some applauding

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.699
his commitment and tenacity, while others
openly deride his apparent obsession with

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.419
his own notoriety.

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.559
In regards to the latter, a writer for Business
Insider covering the story of Packer being

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.820
the first in line to buy an iPad even went
so far as calling him:

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.919
The same stupid guy who’s first in line
for everything.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.729
A sentiment echoed by many in the media, in
particular the Associated Press, who, in 2003,

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.539
strongly discouraged reporters from speaking
to him after higher ups noticed he’d been

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.550
quoted in at least 100 publications up to
that point.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.360
As such, they issued a memo stating,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.029
The world is full of all kinds of interesting
people.

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.159
One of them is Greg Packer of Huntington,
NY, who apparently lives to get his name on

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.809
the AP wire and in other media….

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.280
Mr Packer is clearly eager to be quoted.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.469
Let’s be eager, too- to find other people
to quote.

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.809
As to this, Packer stated he thinks this memo
just might end up being the biggest highlight

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:46.279
of his career.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:49.710
That said, in a mini-documentary about his
life as a “man on the street”, Packer

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.529
expressed that he feels bad knowing reporters
can get in trouble for quoting him, but argues

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.610
that there’s nothing inherently wrong with
him simply being in the “right place at

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.409
the right time” to offer a timely, often
innocuous quote or soundbite.

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.550
The fact that he goes out of his way to ensure
that this is the case and has admitted to

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.409
“making stuff up to get in the paper”
in the past doesn’t appear to bother Packer

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:16.830
all that much; he feels that he is doing reporters
a favor by helping them get their job done

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.710
quicker, and tailoring his quotes in such
a way to make their life easier.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.960
In fact, to our knowledge, the only time Packer
has refused to give a quote was during an

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.569
interview with the New York Times in 2003.

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:31.650
When asked by reporter Alan Feuer for his
opinion on recent scandals in the world of

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.051
journalism, Packer, who has a deep respect
for journalists, simply responded “I have

00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:38.449
no comment”.

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:43.189
In the end, while some have taken a somewhat
negative attitude when it comes to Packer’s

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:47.520
obsession with appearing in the media, there
is something to be admired in a person who

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.879
derives such pleasure from something so simple.

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:56.629
While most dream pie in the sky things- becoming
a famous and wildly successful actor, musician,

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:02.279
artist, businessman, etc., Packer has chosen
another path, having only a small dream, which

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:07.190
he pursues with vigor, unlike most who dream
bigger but do nothing about it.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.879
He just wants to get his name in print or
face on TV, and admirably pursues this in

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:17.360
completely benign ways, hurting no one in
the process, nor instigating any negative

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360
drama.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.379
As a professor of pop culture at Syracuse
University, Robert Thompson, stated,

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.400
This guy has clearly found something he loves
to do, and few people have done that.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.039
You have to admire that.

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:31.669
How many people have found something that
they love to wake up at 2:30 in the morning

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:32.669
to do?

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.669
Not very many.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.990
Or to quote the man himself in an interview
from 2002: “This is what I like doing.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:56.660
You only live once, you might as well make
the most of it.”
