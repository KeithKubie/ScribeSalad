00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
So what are the students going to be doing when they meet up once a week?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.450
They're going to be presenting their lessons learned,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.130
and they're going to be presenting in front of their entire peers.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.650
Now, you'll be sitting in the back of the room, both the facilitators and the mentors,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.600
and critiquing what they've learned.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.280
And as they present, remember, you've been reading their LaunchPad Central blog posts,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.630
so you kind of know who they've been talking to.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.670
So this is almost a summary,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
but you will be giving them comments.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.120
In the meantime, the students, instead of just sitting there and doing their email,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.340
who are not presenting, actually have a shared Google Doc

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.240
and they're doing peer grading of their peers, of their presentations,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.660
and giving them feedback as well.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.870
And what the students are doing outside the classroom are 10 to 15 hours

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.780
of customer discovery, and they're spending at least an hour a week

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.100
blogging what they've learned, and they're using the LaunchPad Central tool to do that.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.180
And they're watching the lectures online on the Udacity site.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.990
What you're doing as facilitators and coaches is you're answering questions

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.890
about the lectures, and you're critiquing team presentations.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.400
And what the teaching team is using is, you're using a shared Google Doc,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.670
sitting in the back of the room, grading, while the students

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.940
are using their peer grading doc, which is very separate from yours.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.120
So they don't get to see your grades, and you get to see theirs later.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.600
But now the teaching team is actually writing down

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
what you think of each one of the teams.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.930
And again, in between the weeks your job is to review and comment

00:01:34.930 --> 99:59:59.000
on the team's customer discovery narrative using the LaunchPad Central tool.
