my name is Saul Perlmutter and I'm a
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.210
my name is Saul Perlmutter and I'm a
professor of physics at the University

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220
professor of physics at the University
 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.249
professor of physics at the University
of California Berkeley and that just

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
of California Berkeley and that just
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.620
of California Berkeley and that just
gave a session where I described the the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630
gave a session where I described the the
 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.709
gave a session where I described the the
work that we've been doing to the

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719
work that we've been doing to the
 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.020
work that we've been doing to the
participants here when I was interested

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
participants here when I was interested
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.250
participants here when I was interested
particularly in the fact that we're at a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
particularly in the fact that we're at a
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070
particularly in the fact that we're at a
unusual moment in history where we're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
unusual moment in history where we're
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.450
unusual moment in history where we're
getting at some very deep fundamental

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
getting at some very deep fundamental
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.939
getting at some very deep fundamental
questions about how the world is put

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
questions about how the world is put
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.130
questions about how the world is put
together how the universe works and but

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
together how the universe works and but
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410
together how the universe works and but
um it's a what is also rare times when

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
um it's a what is also rare times when
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269
um it's a what is also rare times when
you can actually understand how the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
you can actually understand how the
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.859
you can actually understand how the
measurements led us to this conclusion

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
measurements led us to this conclusion
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080
measurements led us to this conclusion
how we measure the history of the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
how we measure the history of the
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660
how we measure the history of the
expansion of the universe and discovery

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
expansion of the universe and discovery
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.950
expansion of the universe and discovery
that actually universe is doing some

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
that actually universe is doing some
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.530
that actually universe is doing some
very strange it's a it's speeding up in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
very strange it's a it's speeding up in
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.150
very strange it's a it's speeding up in
Saskatchewan when we would have thought

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
Saskatchewan when we would have thought
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.729
Saskatchewan when we would have thought
gravity when its tone it down sort of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
gravity when its tone it down sort of
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.760
gravity when its tone it down sort of
dominance so what I was trying to get

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
dominance so what I was trying to get
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470
dominance so what I was trying to get
across a little bit was a sense in which

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
across a little bit was a sense in which
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.389
across a little bit was a sense in which
there are some very cheap things that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
there are some very cheap things that
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.479
there are some very cheap things that
are easily understood and explain but I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
are easily understood and explain but I
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950
are easily understood and explain but I
also want to convey a little bit about

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
also want to convey a little bit about
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770
also want to convey a little bit about
this sense that we are still at a time

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
this sense that we are still at a time
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410
this sense that we are still at a time
in history where we hone in very basic

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
in history where we hone in very basic
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.139
in history where we hone in very basic
things but how the world works and I at

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
things but how the world works and I at
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.429
things but how the world works and I at
the end was asked that question about

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
the end was asked that question about
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.230
the end was asked that question about
the houses made to the things we're

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
the houses made to the things we're
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840
the houses made to the things we're
doing around us around here today and I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
doing around us around here today and I
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.770
doing around us around here today and I
said what's been surprising is how when

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
said what's been surprising is how when
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690
said what's been surprising is how when
you learn something very deep about how

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
you learn something very deep about how
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330
you learn something very deep about how
the world works it tends to make you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
the world works it tends to make you
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.609
the world works it tends to make you
more capable and powerful in the world

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
more capable and powerful in the world
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830
more capable and powerful in the world
and more able to address problems in the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
and more able to address problems in the
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050
and more able to address problems in the
world and we have no idea why that works

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
world and we have no idea why that works
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.140
world and we have no idea why that works
we've no idea why for example Einstein's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
we've no idea why for example Einstein's
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030
we've no idea why for example Einstein's
theory of general relativity which one

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
theory of general relativity which one
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.810
theory of general relativity which one
the most abstract a fundamental theories

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
the most abstract a fundamental theories
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.830
the most abstract a fundamental theories
that you can imagine this instead

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
that you can imagine this instead
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.179
that you can imagine this instead
nothing to do with the world around us

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
nothing to do with the world around us
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.999
nothing to do with the world around us
and yet we would not be able to use GPS

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
and yet we would not be able to use GPS
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.319
and yet we would not be able to use GPS
you wouldn't be able to land airplanes

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
you wouldn't be able to land airplanes
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.260
you wouldn't be able to land airplanes
with the christening satellites yeah

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
with the christening satellites yeah
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730
with the christening satellites yeah
without knowing my stance they were

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
without knowing my stance they were
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.960
without knowing my stance they were
trivial cheaply and so I was a better

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
trivial cheaply and so I was a better
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940
trivial cheaply and so I was a better
one of the things that were very excited

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
one of the things that were very excited
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730
one of the things that were very excited
about yes question that we have a chance

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
about yes question that we have a chance
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590
about yes question that we have a chance
to keep moving ahead as a civilization

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
to keep moving ahead as a civilization
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810
to keep moving ahead as a civilization
and learning about the world of the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
and learning about the world of the
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.030
and learning about the world of the
living and it makes you optimistic about

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
living and it makes you optimistic about
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.319
living and it makes you optimistic about
the Kingsley right bill to do in the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
the Kingsley right bill to do in the
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.660
the Kingsley right bill to do in the
world at the same time I also pointed

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
world at the same time I also pointed
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700
world at the same time I also pointed
out that this project was one that we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
out that this project was one that we
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319
out that this project was one that we
thought were they take us I was really

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
thought were they take us I was really
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940
thought were they take us I was really
very difficult we take us three years to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
very difficult we take us three years to
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.639
very difficult we take us three years to
do in the end it took us 10 years to do

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
do in the end it took us 10 years to do
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.130
do in the end it took us 10 years to do
and yet none of us participants about to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
and yet none of us participants about to
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.620
and yet none of us participants about to
restrain

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
restrain
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.990
restrain
it was a very good use of time but what

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
it was a very good use of time but what
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.020
it was a very good use of time but what
it doesn't remind us is that some of the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
it doesn't remind us is that some of the
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.340
it doesn't remind us is that some of the
questions in the world those are some

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350
questions in the world those are some
 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.770
questions in the world those are some
causes in the world are difficult enough

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
causes in the world are difficult enough
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.840
causes in the world are difficult enough
problems that you could attend a number

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850
problems that you could attend a number
 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.920
problems that you could attend a number
of years working on them you won't get

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
of years working on them you won't get
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.510
of years working on them you won't get
it right the first try or the second

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
it right the first try or the second
 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.520
it right the first try or the second
charger third try and that when we

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
charger third try and that when we
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.780
charger third try and that when we
address the problems that girl

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
address the problems that girl
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.700
address the problems that girl
discussing here at Davos you really have

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
discussing here at Davos you really have
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.410
discussing here at Davos you really have
to come at them with slightly longer

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420
to come at them with slightly longer
 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.630
to come at them with slightly longer
range picture but we're going to keep

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
range picture but we're going to keep
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.190
range picture but we're going to keep
working on them until we get them right

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
working on them until we get them right
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.440
working on them until we get them right
and then that you're they're great

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
and then that you're they're great
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.030
and then that you're they're great
problems in basically you can't be

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
problems in basically you can't be
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.560
problems in basically you can't be
frustrated if after a year or so you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570
frustrated if after a year or so you
 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.120
frustrated if after a year or so you
haven't solved those problems so that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
haven't solved those problems so that
 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.980
haven't solved those problems so that
was a part of what was that going on

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990
was a part of what was that going on
 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.620
was a part of what was that going on
today at the session
