00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:04.230
- Amir ate 2/3 of a piece of red licorice.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.248
So, let's draw a piece
of red licorice over here

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:11.567
and let's draw it into thirds,
so, or split it into thirds.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.144
Three equal sections, as
best as I can draw that,

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.934
and he ate 2/3 of it, so
that's 1/3 right over here

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.875
and then, this is a second third,

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.629
So, that's 2/3, what I shaded in.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.542
This is how much of that red
licorice he would have eaten.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.944
Then, they tell us Nikko
ate 2/3 of a longer,

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:30.727
but equally thick, piece of red licorice.

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:33.459
So, it's gonna be equally
thick, but it's longer.

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:35.507
So, I'm just gonna draw
something that is longer.

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:38.912
So, that's longer, but equally
thick and he also ate 2/3

00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:41.867
of this, but this is a longer
piece and it's equally thick,

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.627
so it's actually gonna
be just a larger piece.

00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:45.061
It's gonna have more licorice in it.

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.997
So, 2/3 of that, let me see if
I can split this into thirds

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:52.664
and this is 1/3, this is a second third.

00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:56.820
Well, 2/3 of a larger piece
is going to be more than 2/3

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.376
of a smaller piece.

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:00.710
This right over here,
this amount that he ate,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.136
it has the same width, but it's longer

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.154
than this right over here.

00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:09.148
So, Nikko, because this is a
longer, but equally thick piece

00:01:09.148 --> 00:01:12.607
of red licorice, Nikko
ate more red licorice.

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:15.307
Nikko for sure.

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.338
Let's do another one.

00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:20.657
My unicorn, that's
interesting to have a unicorn.

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.570
My unicorn, ate 2/6 of a
pizza from Store A, alright.

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:30.974
I ate 2/6 of a different
pizza from Store B.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:32.974
Who ate more pizza?

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:35.133
Well, it would depends.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.614
You know Store A's pizza
might look like this.

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.609
Store B's pizza might look like this.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.152
So, if this was the case,
so if this is Store A

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.864
and this is Store B, you eat
2/6 of this, let me divide

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:50.864
this into sixths, so that's
halves, and that would be,

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:53.376
and then sixths.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:56.360
Woops, I don't wanna do
eighths, I wanna do sixths.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.360
So, I wanna do something,
so ah that's close enough.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:02.596
You get the idea.

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:06.520
So 2/6 would be like this,
one sixth, two sixths

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.989
and 2/6 of this would
be, would be like this.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.926
Let me do my best shot at drawing this.

00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:17.024
I'm trying to do six equal
pieces, it's hard to hand draw,

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:18.707
but this gets us close.

00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.290
2/6 here would be that and that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040
and if so, Store B's pizza is
bigger than Store A's pizza,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.015
then I would have eaten
more pizza than my unicorn.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.431
But, it might have been
the other way around.

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.700
Maybe Store B's pizza's like this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.718
and Store A's pizza's like
this and if this was the case,

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:39.399
my unicorn ate this 2/6
and the unicorn ate more.

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.279
Or, maybe the pizzas were both this size,

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.276
in which case, we would've
eaten the same amount.

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:45.261
So, just based on what
they told us, we don't know

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.314
how Store B's pizza
compares to Store A's pizza.

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:53.097
We don't know, We don't know whether I

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:57.630
or my unicorn got more, got more pizza.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.319
Let's do one more of these, these are fun.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.311
It took Hiro 1/3 of an hour to
run from his house to school.

00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:09.803
It took Fred 1/3 of an hour to
run from his house to school.

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:12.262
Who took more time running to school?

00:03:12.262 --> 00:03:14.192
Now, this is a good
one, this is a good one,

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:15.748
'cause at first you
might say, OK, ya know,

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:18.964
Hiro might live here, that's Hiro's house.

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:20.949
I'll put H for Hiro here.

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.602
Maybe this is the school,
I'll just try to draw larger,

00:03:24.602 --> 00:03:28.824
a larger building right
here, this is the school.

00:03:28.824 --> 00:03:31.252
And, you might say, OK
well maybe Fred's house,

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.563
who knows where Fred's house is.

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:34.362
Fred's house could be here.

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:38.792
It could be there, it could
be over here some place.

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:41.067
It could be over here some place.

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:43.633
We don't know where Fred's
house is, we don't know

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.496
if it's closer or further
away than Hiro's house.

00:03:46.496 --> 00:03:49.004
So, you might be saying oh, we don't know.

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:51.917
Well, remember, they're not
saying who's house is closer

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:55.238
or further away, or even who ran faster.

00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:58.813
They're telling us who took
more time running to school

00:03:58.813 --> 00:04:01.901
and they directly tell us
the amount of time they took.

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:06.739
Hiro took 1/3 of an hour to run to school,

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.074
from his house to school

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:11.115
and Fred took exactly 1/3 of an hour.

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:12.799
I don't know who ran faster or slower,

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.922
or who went further distance
or shorter distance,

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.894
but I know that they both
took the same amount of time.

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:23.235
They both took 1/3 of an
hour, so this is the same.

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:26.997
They both took the same, same time.

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:29.945
This questions a little bit
like the famous brain teaser

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:32.144
that some people might ask you,

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:35.239
what weighs more, a pound of gold or a

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:37.538
or, what would you rather
have, or actually no.

00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:39.546
What would, I know which
one you'd rather have.

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:44.201
Which one weighs more, a pound
of gold or a pound of cotton?

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.153
And people are like oh,
gold is heavier than cotton,

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:49.334
maybe gold would make, but
we're saying a pound of gold

00:04:49.334 --> 00:04:51.144
versus a pound of cotton.

00:04:51.144 --> 00:04:53.128
Well they're both a pound,
they would weigh the same.

00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:54.647
That's kind of what we're
doing in this question

00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:56.781
right over here.
