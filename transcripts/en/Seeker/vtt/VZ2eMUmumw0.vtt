00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.210
"Hey baby what's your sign?"

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.080
SCIENCE.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.120
GET OUT OF MY VIDEO TRACE.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.879
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.660
Astrology is based on the premise that celestial
bodies (like the sun, the moon, planets, and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.591
constellations) have an effect on what happens
on earth, who you are as a person, and how

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:26.869
people behave -- based on when they were born.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.079
Not to be confused with ASTRONOMY, which is
the study of those celestial bodies themselves

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.350
-- their properties and placement and such.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.010
Now I have a lot of friends, and my adorable
little sister particularly, who are REALLY

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.450
INTO ASTROLOGY.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.000
It's how they start their day and the foundation
for their relationships with other people,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.910
the foundation for understanding themselves.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.350
As much as I love them, the scientist within
me is cringing.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350
Nah man, naaahhhhhh.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.100
Why does astrology make scientists cringe?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.310
I mean, it seems scientific enough what with
all the tracking of planetary movements, star

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.190
charts, and complicated formulas.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.760
But astrology isn't an actual science because...wellll
(1) It's not based on evidence, (2) it's conclusions

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.380
aren't testable, (3) it isn't open to review
by other scientists and...my favorite, number

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.870
(4): it's un...fals..ifiable...

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.749
Astrology can't be proven wrong...and that's
the heart of what science is.

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.060
The assertions of astrology are so general
and open to interpretation that we can always

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.860
find a way to see it in a factual light.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.969
We saw this effect in James Randi's famous
"Astrology Test".

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.539
Participants were given specific horoscopes
based on when and where they were born.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.760
After reading, they ALL rated their horoscope
as "very" or "extremely" accurate.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.350
Then, they were passed their neighbor's horoscope--and
learned that they all had the same exact one.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.509
Other scientists have also looked at astrology's
claims about careers.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.020
The idea is that being born under Mars, a
supposedly warlike planet, produces more soldiers

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.289
and athletes, whereas Venus produces more
artistic types.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.630
In a study of 25,000 Frenchmen in the 60's,
psychologist Michel Gauquelin found no correlations.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.119
He also did a study where he mixed up the
birth charts of 10 murderers with 10 citizens

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.030
and invited astrologers to identify which
was which based on the charts.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.209
They failed miserably.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.759
A similar but larger study was published in
2007 and they found that the astrologers were

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.610
EVEN MORE WRONG THAN RANDOM CHANCE.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.610
Youch.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.360
Yet another study at the University of Manchester
in 2001 looked at love compatibility by astrological

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.239
sign to see if there were any trends.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.819
They had the data of 10 million couples from
Census of Britain and Wales and found not

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.150
a single sign pairing that showed a greater
or lesser chance of romantic success.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.280
There's also the fact that the sun is no longer
in a given zodiac constellation during it's

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.069
designated time anymore.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.650
Although the sun is supposed to be in Aries
right now, that's based on an outdated model

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.180
-- it's actually in Pisces until April 18th.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.260
This is because of precession, a phenomenon
where the earth wobbles on its axis every

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.959
25,800-year-cycle.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.799
Most peoples' signs that they believe they
have...are actually wrong.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.350
Mine, for instance, isn't actually Libra,
it's Virgo.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.480
And the description still manages to fit!

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.540
Does this all mean astrology is good for nothing?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.280
Well, no, of course not...it's good for entertainment!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
It's all good fun.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.129
My concern is that a recent report by the
NSF that found almost half of Americans think

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.250
Astrology is a real science.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.230
AMERICA...DUZ U KNOW HOW TO SCIENCE?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.230
We still don't.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.230
The struggle continues.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.069
Thanks for joining me for DNews my fellow
science geeks.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.769
We'll see you next time with more science
updates.
