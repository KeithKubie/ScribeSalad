00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.120
Hey,
what's going on?
This fucking damn thing.
I,
you know,

2
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:11.230
I ordered this stupid part.
I swear to God.
I'm picking it up today.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.570
God dammit.
Let me hold it onto it like a terrorist for the last time.
Hey,

4
00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:20.560
what's going on?
It's spelled bird.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

5
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:25.270
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.780
just checking in on you.

7
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.610
How the fuck was your Goddamn Christmas?
Why is this?

8
00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:37.540
Why are all fucked up?
God fucking dammit.

9
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.370
I swear to Christ.
I said this was the last fucking time I was doing this.

10
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.780
Did Not,
isn't was what I said.
You know,

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.110
it's really fucking amazing.

12
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.111
Is the abilities for wires to just get off fucking how do you look at it?

13
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.920
It's like,
how did that happen?

14
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.040
How the fuck did this whole fucking thing go down like this?
The headphones.

15
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.560
The fucking headphones?

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
<v 0>Yes.</v>

17
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.160
<v 1>All right.
Hang in there for fuck sakes.
Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.840
You feel better because I'm losing my shit.

19
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.640
Does that make you feel better about your fucking cubicle dwell and fucking lie?

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.690
While.
I hope it does.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.070
I hope it does because I'm all about the positive vibes in the two to the one

22
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.210
Nisi
20,
19.
Um,

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.410
how are you?
Did you have a

24
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.990
<v 2>hey,</v>

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.450
<v 1>merry little Christmas.</v>

26
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.980
Did you get through it without arguing?
I forgot to give you guys that pep top.

27
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.490
Don't take the fucking bait.
All right?

28
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.980
If one of your siblings is a Trump supporter or they're a fucking liberal Larry

29
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:52.280
or there centrist,
centrist Susan,

30
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.013
you know,

31
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.810
<v 3>never picked the side.</v>

32
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.760
<v 1>Jesus Christ,
only fucking person.</v>

34
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.090
<v 3>And I know could meet a serial killer and be like,
wow,</v>

35
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.640
I guess I can understand why you need to feed.

36
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.130
<v 1>Oh yeah.
I rarely talk to me when you end up in a trunk,
Susan.
Um,</v>

37
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.570
there's no reason to do that.
There's no reason to do it because you're,

38
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.150
you're not going to get what you want,

39
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:21.910
which is the satisfaction of the other person going,

40
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.460
oh my God,

41
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.220
I never realized how right you are.

42
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.370
It wasn't until you called me a closed minded fuck head that I just stopped and

43
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.110
paused and was like,
wait a minute,

44
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.860
<v 3>am I close my [inaudible] am I [inaudible]</v>

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.890
you have fucking believe what cat catered cognac.
Cosmetic FAC hair.

46
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.860
Yeah.
I'm Chris Smith.
It's like hell.
Hello.

47
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.080
<v 1>Calling your stocking much.
You know what?
I fucking can't stand.</v>

49
00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:59.020
I can't stand when new speak comes out.

50
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.850
I get it.
Back in the day,
you know when we were cavemen walking around like,
Oh

51
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.340
<v 4>uh Huh.</v>

52
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.120
<v 1>Doing that shit.
You know you had to come up with some fucking words</v>

53
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.030
so you wouldn't like be asking for,
you know,
some water,

54
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.330
but yet sounded like you were joking.

55
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.240
<v 4>Ah,
ah,
ah,
ah.</v>

56
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.060
<v 1>Aw Man.
It's the noises I make.
Um,
it's why I do it in my garage.
No one and</v>

57
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.360
don't want to bother anybody.
No.
And I also understand it.

58
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.170
If something new comes along,
you know,

59
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.600
like can I iPod?
What were you supposed to call it?

60
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.440
A little stereo.
I don't fucking know.
Right.
I understand those words.

61
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.150
I just hate when new fucking words come around and then everybody just starts

62
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:53.010
fucking saying them.
It drives me up the fucking wall.

63
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:58.011
Especially like on Twitter when there's the new [inaudible] Instagram.

64
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

65
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.080
<v 1>And they just come when they go.
Remember the for awhile,</v>

66
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.510
like when you posted something,
someone will just go this,

67
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.240
you know?
And then what?
What's some other that's stupid shit out there.

68
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:16.990
I can't fucking stand.
Just drives me.
It's so fucking unoriginal.
I just,

69
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:21.220
I had somebody give me shit saying something I tweeted wasn't funny and they

70
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.860
used the Gif.
It's,
and I brought the guy back.

71
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.860
At least I'm fucking write my own jokes.
You fucking hack.

72
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.220
Someone had to like fucking think of a funny response to my unfunny joke for you

73
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.280
with a little video on it and now you feel like you're clever.

74
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.120
I,
I just drives me at the fuck.
You know,

75
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.080
I just got back into working out right.
Fucking if I hit one more fucking,

76
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:52.050
you know,
cause I've got those,
those TRX bands.
All right.

77
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:55.710
If I hear one more Douche,
tell me that I'm engaging my core.

78
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.510
You mean work in my abs.
You fake Tan cunt.

79
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.610
And what's great about these is you're always the one love balance.

80
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:08.990
You're always engaging your core,
you know,
board a plane anymore.

81
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:13.130
You expedite the boarding process.
Step back from what you gonna do.
Great.

82
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.760
You fucking waitress.
Um,

83
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.830
do you guys get that?
Put your jacket to the LV had me too.

84
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.300
We can expedite the boarding.
Bragg says,

85
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.880
do you want to sound like you have a fucking law degree?

86
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.153
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.360
<v 1>Um,
you're on here for one fucking reason only and that's cheap airfare.</v>

88
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.150
<v 1>Stop acting like it was a dream.
I like to travel.</v>

90
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.240
I like to wear a uniform.

91
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.410
<v 1>I like to expedite the boarding process while engaging my core.</v>

93
00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:51.980
This hashtag shaking my head.

94
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.760
<v 1>Let me ask you fucking Twitter concept question.</v>

96
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.780
How Times have you hashtag shaking my head and you actually were shaking your

97
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.640
head.
Okay.
I'm trying to think.

98
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.120
Last time I fucking shook my head.
I actually probably do it a lot.

99
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.660
It's funny when I try to keep my,
my fucking cool while I'm driving.

100
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.850
It's fucking guy.
Oh my God.
These fucking assholes out here on,
on the highways,

101
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.810
the way they pass you on the right hand side,
it's unbelievable.

102
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.660
You can get into the left lane doing like 40 miles an hour.

103
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.220
You don't want to get off the highway.

104
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.920
You got to be doing like 120 and you watch them pass,

105
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.390
you're doing 80 and you look in their lane and there's a guy a quarter mile away

106
00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:36.250
and they're gonna have to stop on the fucking brakes.

107
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.020
I think it's just psychologically psychological out here that,
that,

108
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.540
that there's so much traffic that you just think to yourself like,
you know,

109
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:47.350
anytime there's an open space,
you're like,
ah,
you just fucking florid.

110
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.050
Well,
maybe I'm just that do shoe has like the baby on board sign in his head.

111
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.320
I have no idea.
Um,
but speaking of cars,

112
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.970
my latest obsession,
if I was going to buy a car right now,

113
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.530
all right,
if I was a single man,
if I didn't have a child,

114
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.810
I had a full head of hair to flow in the breeze,

115
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.090
I would get the Porsche Targa the fast one.
All right.

116
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.840
In lava,
orange.
Just like my pubes.
Um,

117
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.930
cause I am a child of the 70s,

118
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.860
and she remember that Shit in Boogie nights when Phillip Seymour Hoffman rest

119
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:32.570
his soul is talking to mark Wahlberg's character.
Any,
any,

120
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.310
it says how the the corvette is in a competition.
Orange.

121
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.250
That was my favorite fucking detail.
Uh,

122
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.030
seventies detail competition.
Orange.
Oh,

123
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.320
either way he didn't have one.
He had,
he had a uh,
oh no.

124
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.790
Mark Wahlberg's character got the corvette and competition orange and then

125
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.020
Phillip Seymour Hoffman showed up with like a Datsun two 40 [inaudible] or

126
00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:03.310
something.
It's still a decent car.
Right.
Um,

127
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.700
but it states no corvette.
Um,
anyways,

128
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.740
I got to see what that looks like cause I hope it's not a red orange.

129
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.990
I'd want an orange,
orange.
You know,

130
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.650
there's a lot of things right now it's just like,
I don't know,

131
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:19.720
everybody's got to start fucking with the colors.

132
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.530
But that thing and it's got the automatic fucking a rooftop and it was actually

133
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.240
Porsche enthusiastic who are engaging their core when they press the fucking

134
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.220
send button on the youtube comment.
We're complaining actually complaining.

135
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.330
The old one you had to,

136
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.930
you had to do it by hand and then fold up the cloth top and then put it in the

137
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:48.280
bonnet is they say overseas,
put it under the fucking hood.

138
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.430
Now this one you just push a button.

139
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.120
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

140
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.120
<v 1>the backend lifts up a little bit and then the top fucking goes down like the ED</v>

141
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.230
.
It's,
it's,
it's a fucking work of art and there's all these cuts,
right?

142
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.710
And like leave it to the Germans to take something really simple and make it a

143
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.890
fucking,
and what?
Make it fucking perfect.
So what was I goal?

144
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.070
I would be concerned if I were somebody could,
but behind me,
man,

145
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.290
that comes a good two feet up on the car.
Well they fucking pull up.
I'll put,

146
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.830
make,
make the tires,
do one rotation and then push your button.

147
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.740
I'm amazed that when they designed this,
are you amazed

148
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.170
the fuck are you ever designed?
Oh,
why am I in such a mood?

149
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.910
You know what,
I just,
I had a bad night's sleep.
I had this dream that I was,

150
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.410
I was playing the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

151
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.780
Massachusetts.
One of my favorite promoters out there,
Bill Bloomin',

152
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.700
Reich W he was in my dream and he was talking the way,

153
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.120
<v 6>talk to him,
right bro?
I saw that article I wrote about your word.</v>

154
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.580
You really said some mean things about Merck.

155
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.960
<v 1>I was like,
are we talking about,
I would never say mean things about you.</v>

156
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:01.560
I love you.

157
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.410
<v 6>No,
just clown car came off a little moon.</v>

158
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.160
<v 1>So I felt like an asshole.
Like however I was joking about him,</v>

159
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:12.410
somebody had came off his fucking main site,

160
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.040
apologized to him and then I'd go out on stage.

161
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.350
This was a stress dream cause I hadn't been on stage in like five fucking days

162
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.750
and I got this European tour coming up.

163
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.570
So I just booked myself with the comedy store starting last night,

164
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.200
right through Sunday.
Just going to do as much stage time as I can.

165
00:10:32.201 --> 00:10:36.250
And I had a great set last night.
I Dunno.
It's just,
I think,
uh,

166
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.680
you know,
I just know I got to fucking,

167
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:41.890
I needed to do all these nights and then I'll then I'll be fine when I go to

168
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:42.730
Europe,
but whatever.

169
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.663
<v 5>MMM.</v>

170
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.930
<v 1>So I go out on stage in my dream on the Wilbur theater and if for some reason</v>

171
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.610
it's like six stories in the air,

172
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.670
six stories up and there's people way down below who clearly can't see me and I

173
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:01.740
feel like I have to walk to the edge of the stage,

174
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:05.880
but I don't want to fall down and I'm making fun of it and nobody's laughing.

175
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:10.440
I'm just bombing.
And for some reason I'm on eye level,
um,

176
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.570
with the six story balcony level and they're just staring at me and I'm not

177
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.404
doing well.

178
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.700
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:23.020
<v 1>And then halfway through my set and there's all these obstructions to like,</v>

180
00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:26.620
I'm walking and all of a sudden I'm like behind some giant pole and nobody's

181
00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:29.080
laughing.
And I'm like,
oh my God,
what the fuck am I doing?

182
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.820
At one point I was laying down on the stage crawling towards the edge cause it

183
00:11:33.821 --> 00:11:36.820
was also really dark and I couldn't see how deep it went down.

184
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.640
I dropped the Mike down there,

185
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.040
somebody turned on a record player and I shut it off.
And it was just like,
hey,

186
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.800
slowed down.
Wasn't that song?
I don't know why I just picked that.

187
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.980
Maybe cause I'm a dancing monkey on stage.
I have no fucking idea.

188
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.170
And then halfway through it,

189
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.390
one of the few comics that I don't like in this business came fucking walking

190
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:06.391
out like the selfish cunt that he or she is and picked up like a little square

191
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.910
fridge that you'd have.
They've when you lived in like a studio apartment.

192
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.490
And I was like,
really?
And the person was like,
yeah,
really?

193
00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:18.060
And they just fucking took and started walking out and I said the person's name,

194
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.210
I said from the bottom of my heart,
I fucking hate you.

195
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.560
And then I quickly shut up cause I knew everybody in the crowd was going to film

196
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:28.530
it.
Um,
and what's funny is as,

197
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:32.280
I don't really hate this person in real life,
I just fucking avoid them.

198
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.920
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

199
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.330
<v 1>You know,
that's what a great thing about getting older.</v>

200
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.110
As you stop hating people,
you just sort of like,
you avoid them.

201
00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:44.490
Even if you're sitting next to you just mentally avoid them.
You just like,
okay,

202
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.630
I know who you are,

203
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:50.631
I know how you act and this is what I expect so I'm not going to get upset.

204
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.750
I'm just fucking not going to engage in it,
you know?
And uh,

205
00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.470
and then somewhere along the line they turned the lights on and I realized that

206
00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:02.030
I wasn't six stories in the air.

207
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.320
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

208
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.020
<v 1>That the stage was still the same height it usually was.</v>

209
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.310
And then all of a sudden the microphone worked and I could start,
you know,

210
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:15.330
doing my job and I started killing again.
So maybe the dream was built.

211
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.680
You have an irrational fear about taking four or five days off from standup.

212
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.660
I will tell you last night I fucking,
uh,

213
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.360
I went on stage and I got this new Bush,
Michelle Obama bit that was bombing,

214
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.050
you know,
cause she's so fucking precious.
You know what I mean?
I don't,

215
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:36.030
I don't know why,
out of all the first ladies,

216
00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:40.800
every first lady has always been made fun of her for some fucking reason is like

217
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:45.480
off limits.
So,
you know,
as a comedian,
something is off limits.
I mean,

218
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.750
you know,
you kind of have to steer the ship towards it at one point,
just,

219
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.260
just for the fun of it.
Right.
So last night was the first night.
Okay.

220
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.043
<v 5>Uh,</v>

221
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.570
<v 1>I started to get it,
I started to get it to work and um,</v>

222
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.880
<v 5>yeah,</v>

223
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.530
<v 1>I tried a another bit,
you know,
about this.</v>

224
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.870
Does Gay kid,
you know,
parents didn't know she was gay and that parents work,

225
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.900
Willis bucket,
people that think you can pray away being gay.
Um,

226
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.060
what can you pray away?
Oh,
I went to church,
by the way.
I got there late,

227
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.740
you know,
I felt bad.
I got there,

228
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.060
register fucking guy was starting his homily and I was like,
oh fuck.

229
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:30.670
And then part of me was site because I didn't have to sit through the first two

230
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:31.504
readings.

231
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.423
<v 5>MMM.</v>

232
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.700
<v 1>And uh,
they really switched up the words a lot.
The shit that you say,</v>

233
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:43.210
they switched it up a lot.
I was like,
is this like some west coast thing?

234
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.390
My mother in law's like,
Nah,
they kind of changed it up,

235
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.643
<v 5>you know,</v>

236
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.701
<v 1>he's be peace,</v>

237
00:14:49.701 --> 00:14:54.170
be with you and also with they like added a bunch of words like peace be with

238
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:55.700
you and I uh,

239
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.410
I concur that also and would wish that upon you to sir.

240
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:01.244
Slash ma'am,

241
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.940
you're going to say all out before you should fucking shake hands with somebody.

242
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.620
Um,
I dunno,
I hadn't been in church in a while.

243
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:12.260
I literally thought my suit was going to catch on fire when I walked in there.

244
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.333
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

245
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.220
<v 1>Do we need to know?
You're a piece of shit.
You know,</v>

246
00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:21.150
you haven't been there in awhile.

247
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.870
You just walk in and you just thinking of all this shit God would be saying to

248
00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:28.140
you if you really exist and you just walk in and going,
I know,
I know.

249
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.130
You know?
And then after,
while he gets stubborn and be like,
well,
you know,
Dude,

250
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.180
you know,
technically you made me so whatever my fucking flaws are,

251
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.900
I know you have this convenient excuse of the devil.
You know what I mean?

252
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.850
I mean,
what the fuck?

253
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:46.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.770
<v 1>Hey,
you know I made you perfect,
but you listen to the devil.</v>

255
00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:53.750
Well didn't you make the devil toe
isn't all of this,

256
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.550
you're fucking grand scheme.

257
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.210
<v 0>Right?
Okay.</v>

258
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.030
<v 1>I actually,
when I look at God that way,
right?
If he existed,
you know,</v>

259
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:05.150
and it is a he.
Okay.
Because at the end of the day,
you know,

260
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:06.710
when you really look at the world,

261
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.370
most of the great things that were created were done by men.

262
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.120
I mean,
I don't know why I have to shy away from that and this progressive,

263
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.120
you know,
ladies,
why don't you put your fucking brains?

264
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.150
Will your mouth though and fucking start invents some shit.

265
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.920
And I know you're going to come at me with this fucking list that,

266
00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:27.570
that is impressive to you.

267
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:32.571
But what I also want you to Google my feminist little friends is what have men

268
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:37.980
invented.
And you watch that fucking there.
It's fucking Dan Marino,

269
00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:41.250
1984 48 touchdown,

270
00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:45.900
5,800 fucking yards when you could still beat the shit out of a wide receiver

271
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.220
and a quarterback.
Um,
having said that,
I,
uh,
I respect,

272
00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:55.140
love it and I feel you're very brave at a time you put out your lab coat ad set

273
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:56.820
out to make a new widget.

274
00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:58.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

275
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.820
<v 1>And it's so much harder for a woman to put on a lab coat.</v>

276
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.810
I'm just trying to make it sure.
I have it all down.
Um,

277
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.110
to someday I would like to host an awards show and I have to make sure that I'm

278
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:15.360
the fucking Zombie that they're looking for.
Um,

279
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:17.611
I'll do,

280
00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:20.700
I'll come out and do a monologue just talking about how dumb men are and how we

281
00:17:20.701 --> 00:17:24.030
can't even figure out how to dress ourselves without women.
You know,

282
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.440
all of that shit.
And they'll just fucking eat it up.
Uh,

283
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.870
that's another thing I fucking hate.
You know what I hate?
I hate when a co,

284
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.590
a running back gets like fucking 40 carries and he has like 47 yards and then he

285
00:17:34.591 --> 00:17:38.280
finally breaks one for about 15,
and then he gets up and he does that.

286
00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:41.370
I'm eating a bowl of oatmeal thing.
It's like,
buddy,

287
00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:43.950
we've been feeding you the fucking ball,
all God damn game.

288
00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:45.930
Once you go look at your fucking yardage average,

289
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.190
you're 2.7 yards per carry count.
Um,

290
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.150
<v 5>yeah.</v>

291
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.580
<v 1>Hey Bill,
how about something positive?
All right,</v>

292
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:57.040
I got something positive for you.
I watched this fucking Celtics first,

293
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.280
the Philadelphia 76 six,

294
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.600
you know,
fucking blew me away in that game.
Is that Joelle,
Joelle and beep.

295
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.360
So you say his name.
I'm not looking it up because I can't spell it.
Um,

296
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.020
evidently that guy played a soccer or football as they call it over the,

297
00:18:14.021 --> 00:18:16.720
over the fucking sees there.
Um,

298
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.980
until late in his life.
I gotta tell you something.

299
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:24.510
That guy is like a ridiculous factor when he's on the court.

300
00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:27.600
And I know he's one of the guys in the league,
but I don't,
I don't think,
uh,

301
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.050
I don't think he's getting the respect he deserves.

302
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:35.880
That fucking guy is a problem on both ends of the court.

303
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.750
Blocking shots,
getting rebound scoring points.

304
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.800
Fucking asis moves great for a big man.

305
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.250
Um,
I am praying to the basketball gods.
Look at me.
I'm going to church.
I'm,

306
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.710
I'm fucking all about every God out there now.

307
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.450
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

308
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.930
<v 1>Um,
I can't,
you feel the,
the joy that's coming back into my life,
my life.</v>

309
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.470
It's like the end of the Grinch,
isn't it?
Um,

310
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.240
I am praying to the basketball gods that the,
the,
uh,

311
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.790
that the Celtics in [inaudible] 76 or so are going to fucking play again.
Um,

312
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.560
I don't even care if we lose.
That's how much I enjoy that playoff series.

313
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.920
And back in the day when I used to watch Andrew,
Tony and Dr Jay,

314
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.480
Bobby Jones,
Billy Cunningham,
all those motherfuckers coming to town,

315
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.050
Daryl Dawkins the first time through,
and then it was Moses.

316
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.123
<v 5>MMM.</v>

317
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.400
<v 1>Anyways,
the fuck was I just going to talk about,
oh,
I remember.
Oh,</v>

318
00:19:38.401 --> 00:19:43.290
so I'm reading this book on Bob Cousy and,
uh,
Bill Russell called the last pass.

319
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.440
Does that really count as reading by the way to read about sports?

320
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:50.670
I don't think it does.
It's like a long sports page as far as I'm concerned.
Um,

321
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.440
I don't know if I brought this up already.
I forget.

322
00:19:54.441 --> 00:19:58.900
But like for the longest time I thought that the first

323
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.120
NBA basketball player with the sneaker deal was Michael Jordan.

324
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.360
Now he might've had wait his name on the sneaker,

325
00:20:10.361 --> 00:20:14.110
but then I found out that those,
uh,
red and white converse,

326
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.690
we're called the doctor J's,
but the,

327
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:21.490
I don't remember them having his name on it initially.
So then,

328
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.110
um,
I'm reading this book

329
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.120
and I find out that Bob Cousy and likes 1962 or 63 had his own sneaker.

330
00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:36.010
He signed a deal with pf flyers and it looks like a bootleg chuck Taylor.

331
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.860
And I found a pair on,

332
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.940
on fucking Ebay for 155 bucks.
I didn't buy them,

333
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.680
but because I'm not a sneaker head,
yo,
uh,
Yo,

334
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:52.330
you see the do Jordan 48.
Um,
what are they up to,
by the way?

335
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.790
What are they up to?
It is amazing that 30 years has gone by.

336
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.540
He must have a new sneaker every year.
I would say they're on the Jordan 32.

337
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.680
So let's look this,
well,
let's finish this story.
So Bob Cousy,

338
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.370
that's the one I want,
you know,
I'm kind of fascinated by that whole

339
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.063
<v 5>mmm.</v>

340
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.340
<v 1>A sneaker culture as far as like,
you know,
all the different,</v>

341
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:21.880
like do you get the Sundale three fours or whatever,
you know,

342
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:29.090
Jordan's 2019.
Let's see what they got coming up.
What do they got in the,

343
00:21:29.091 --> 00:21:33.950
in the,
in the fuck it's sneaker barrel.
Air Jordan,

344
00:21:33.951 --> 00:21:35.960
one retro sample.

345
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.960
Oh,
it was a sample sets.
Not exactly what they came out with.

346
00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:46.850
And they want $4,000 for those.
Are you fucking kidding me?
What do you do?

347
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.850
How do,
what do you stick your head?
You,

348
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.230
you put them on the wall so you feel like you're always in a foot locker.

349
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:55.040
All right.
Air Jordan.
Release 2018.
All right,
let's see.

350
00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:59.700
What are they up to here?
Air Jordan 12.

351
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.340
How the fuck are they?
Only on the 12th.
All right.
Air Jordan nine

352
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.300
dude [inaudible] sent me a text the other day was fucking hilarious.
He's like,

353
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:14.860
dude,
Jordan,
three MOCHA fucking over.

354
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.500
And it was the Jordan threes with this mocha color cement thing.

355
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.833
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

356
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.050
<v 1>And I,
I fucking died laughing.
I mean he's,
he's like,
Jeez,</v>

357
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:30.051
like that fucking chick there with the thin head Sarah Jessica Parker on sex in

358
00:22:30.121 --> 00:22:30.954
the city.

359
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.990
So rather than talking about fucking high heels,
he's talking about sneakers.

360
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.143
<v 5>Um,</v>

361
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:45.000
<v 1>anyways,
so Bob Cousy had a pair of pf flyers and you know,
with this,</v>

362
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.860
with the little circle is on the chuck Taylor was his face and it said Bob Cousy

363
00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:52.790
on it and they were black and they had a little green trim on them.

364
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.100
So that's as far back for all you fucking sneaker heads there.

365
00:22:57.101 --> 00:23:00.430
I know Kareem Abdul Jabbar,
he had his own,
did he have his own sticker?

366
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:03.420
Ucla low top Adita I dunno,

367
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.060
but who was like the first guy actually had like his name on it though.

368
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.580
Cause I think maybe the technically,

369
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:10.950
<v 7>yeah,</v>

370
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.860
<v 1>the doctor Jay Converse just said,</v>

371
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.693
<v 7>yeah.</v>

372
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.350
<v 1>Um,
we're just nicknamed the doctor J's,
but they said Congress,
let me see,</v>

373
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.840
let me look that up,
doctor Jay.
Conversely,

374
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.850
this is why I like talking shit about things cause then I ended up getting into

375
00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:30.480
it like fucking the pro,
the premier league.

376
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.143
<v 5>MMM.</v>

377
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.340
<v 1>All right.
Let's see here.
Yeah,
those are the classic</v>

378
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.450
classic converse all stars.
I don't see his name on it.
Oh.

379
00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:45.710
And then eventually they did.
But the original one,

380
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.280
one of the clean his fucking shoes ever.
That for some reason

381
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.220
I think the newer ones.
So when I was a kid they didn't say dr j on him.

382
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.220
And now I'm looking at a really old pair and those ones say dr j.

383
00:23:57.221 --> 00:24:00.220
So I think after a while they said doctor Jay and those things look like they

384
00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:01.450
came up before the year Jordan.

385
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.480
But as far as I can tell the Bob fucking cozy the Koozie one stowed.

386
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.490
It was somebody's fucking way back to Guy Kool g ones with a pork pie hat

387
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.980
fucking over Shea.
Um,
all right,
let me look at some stuff here.

388
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.150
Uh,
I missed the last two Liverpool Games.

389
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:26.870
I get all wrapped up in the holidays and I cannot fucking believe this.

390
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:30.110
I don't know anything about the Wolverhampton Wanderers.

391
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.750
But somehow we lost to them.

392
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:34.140
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

393
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.140
<v 1>we beat new castle United four to nothing but the fucking wolves.</v>

394
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.710
These guys don't even look like they,
they're there.

395
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.490
There's nothing premiere about their,
their uniform,
their fucking name

396
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.230
or anything.
What happened?

397
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.640
Mohammed Silo and Virgil van Dutch struck to claim,
oh no,
they won.

398
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.390
Wait a minute.
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

399
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.510
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

400
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.080
Cause we beat Manchester United three to one and it says three to one and then

401
00:25:15.691 --> 00:25:18.000
it says fucking zero two.

402
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.380
So I guess they do that all cause that was an away game.

403
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.770
Ah,
you cheeky cons.
All right,
I learned something else.
That's how they do it.

404
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.110
Okay.
So they got arson,

405
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.760
a one nil arsenal coming up.
The only one,
the only premier league game,

406
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.620
uh,
I've ever been to.
I told you they played Everton was fucking hilarious.

407
00:25:40.621 --> 00:25:43.470
And they went up one to nothing and they started singing one nil arsenal in

408
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:45.840
halfway through the fucking Song Everton scored.

409
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.120
And this little blue puff of smoke came up,

410
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.100
the 40 Everton fans.
We're going fucking nuts.

411
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.350
And all the arsenal people that just shut the fuck up.
Uh,

412
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.600
I love when that happens.

413
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.040
I was watching a ranger game earlier this year and fucking as always,

414
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:08.600
Henrik Lundqvist was playing unbelievable and the whole garden is going and Rick

415
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:11.450
luck with Henrik Lundqvist or whatever,

416
00:26:11.451 --> 00:26:14.090
and as they're chanting at the other team,
fucking scored.

417
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.410
<v 0>Ah,
that's</v>

418
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.910
<v 1>switch you get.
All right.
Let's look at some Google news here.
We'll start with,</v>

419
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.680
uh,
the greatest country in America,
the United States of America.
All right?

420
00:26:28.681 --> 00:26:33.180
After Trump visits,
Iraq,
lawmakers demand US withdrawal.

421
00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:37.650
Finally,
let's get the fuck out their way.

422
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.020
We're going bankrupt.

423
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.240
Iraqi lawmakers demand withdraw.
Baghdad,

424
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.810
Iraqi law makers.

425
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.480
This is the greatest thing that could fucking happen to us if we combine it with

426
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:55.600
solar power in electric cars.

427
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.660
All right?
You gotta hit him where it hurts.
Just like the feminists do.

428
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.260
The feminist go after the money.
They go after the advertisers.

429
00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:09.920
This is what the fuck you gotta do in the Middle East.
All right?

430
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.230
Truly,
the great thing though is if we pull out,
I believe they'll just go back,

431
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.590
unfortunately,
because I don't have a problem with Middle Eastern people.

432
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.250
I just have a problem with cunts.
Okay.
And cuts,
they're everywhere.
Right?

433
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.140
As long as you're not a,
I don't have a problem with you.

434
00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:31.050
So I think that they'll go back to trying to fucking,
you know,

435
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.040
deal with each other.
Hopefully not in a violent way,
but you know,

436
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.874
it's going to be.

437
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.810
But I always looked at it like the way when Russia withdrew from fucking Europe,

438
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:41.730
everybody was like,
okay,
where were we?

439
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:47.000
And they just picked up with their fights again.
It's really,
I,

440
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.300
for the life of me,
I'll never understand how war is legal.

441
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.473
<v 0>MMM.</v>

442
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.653
<v 1>You know,</v>

443
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.070
we sitting here like working on gender neutral bathrooms while war is still

444
00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:05.680
legal.
I mean,
it's just fucking nuts.
You don't use,
I think it's because they,

445
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.110
they keep updating the war,
the,
uh,
the weapons.

446
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.130
So it seems modern,
you know,

447
00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:16.610
but if you still went out there like the Braveheart days,
and there was,
you know,

448
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:20.000
two people standing on opposing hills and then they just ran down the hill

449
00:28:20.001 --> 00:28:20.834
yelling,

450
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:22.600
<v 8>ah,</v>

451
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.370
<v 1>just fucking met in the valley.
And they had those sticks with the fucking,</v>

452
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:31.660
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the fucking cannon ball with the spikes coming out of it.

453
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.970
You know,
basically you're dressing a raider fan,

454
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.960
except you can actually hurt somebody.
You don't have the rubber points.

455
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.870
You wouldn't want to put somebody's eye out when you're intimidating somebody.

456
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.410
Raider fans.
Um,
all right.
So politicians

457
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.460
from both blocks of Iraq's divided parliament called for a vote to expel US

458
00:28:54.591 --> 00:28:58.610
troops and promise to schedule an extraordinary session to the debate,

459
00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:02.390
the matter.
Parliament.
I like that they'd taken control of their country.
Again,

460
00:29:02.391 --> 00:29:06.830
parliament must clearly in urgently expresses view about the ongoing American

461
00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:10.730
violations of Iraq's sovereignty.
Said Salaam,

462
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.450
I'll Shamira a lawmaker loyal to the populace cleric mock

463
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.460
Tada Al Satter through the fucking balls you have over there to be any sort of a

464
00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:25.310
leader,
man.
I mean you're really,
I mean,

465
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:29.630
I hope what they're doing over there works because what we're doing is not

466
00:29:29.631 --> 00:29:32.420
stopping terrorism.
Maybe it's stopping it from coming over here.

467
00:29:32.421 --> 00:29:35.870
I don't fucking know,
but all I know is when I look at the ledger,

468
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.400
uh,
you know,
we're,
we're fucking bankrupt.

469
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.340
We just keep raising our amount of debt.
Why don't we fucking good back here?

470
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.920
Get back here.
Bring the fucking kids home.
All right.

471
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.410
Fucking get on.
Get into this electrical shit.

472
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.180
I don't give a shit if it hurts the environment more just so we can,

473
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.230
we can pay this shit off.
All right.

474
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:02.230
With the money we make from exporting all the weed that we're growing,

475
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.333
<v 0>Huh?</v>

476
00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.670
<v 1>The God damn it.
If I can figure out how to solve the world's problems,</v>

477
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.450
kid somebody in a suit and tie door.
Uh,
all right,

478
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.840
let's see what's going on in Germany.
That's my first stop.

479
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:20.120
Germany army could recruit EU citizens.
Oh,
for fuck sakes.
It just,

480
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:21.800
Jeremy,
they really doing this again.

481
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.340
All right.
Slowly loading,
slowly,
slowly loading.

482
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:35.340
It is really bizarre how Europe,
if they're not unified
digit date,

483
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:40.210
just fucking,
they will start a world war,
you know?
And then,
then what do we get?

484
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.920
We get shit for border.
What's the worst thing we did?
We get fat.

485
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.040
Is that all we're doing a Nobel,

486
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:49.500
I think you're doing a little more than that in the world ad right?
Alright.

487
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.580
German army could recruit EU citizens seven years after Germany scrapped

488
00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:59.570
conscription,
whatever the fuck that at its defense chief has said,

489
00:30:59.571 --> 00:31:04.571
employing EU citizens is an option to fill expert posts.

490
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.980
Army General Inspector
Eberhardt Zorn

491
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.900
said the forces had to lock heads.
Sorry.

492
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:21.140
Lock look in all direction in times of lack of qualified personnel such as

493
00:31:21.541 --> 00:31:23.970
doctors and it specialists.
Oh Wow.

494
00:31:23.971 --> 00:31:28.050
Have they outsourced all this shit in their country to the armed forces have

495
00:31:28.051 --> 00:31:30.720
been beset by years of underinvestment.

496
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.990
Germany aims to increase its military by 21,000 personnel by 2025 well,

497
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:41.420
what the fuck are they getting ready for?
Ah,

498
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.330
Jesus Christ.
Ah Man.
You know,

499
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:47.920
this is why you don't read World News.

500
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.700
This is why you just sit around and you try and find a new sport that you can

501
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:55.630
get involved in.
All right,
let me,
let me do the one read here for this week.

502
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.880
<v 3>All right.
And by the way,
my little thing for my headphones came.</v>

503
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.160
I just have to go pick it up.
Um,
all right,
let's get over here.

504
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.770
Um,
by the way,
made it through Christmas.
What's up without Busan?

505
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.510
33 fucking days in 33 days in.
I'm going to go to

506
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.460
the Rose Bowl Ba and then I'm going to go on my tour and I am going to be

507
00:32:19.461 --> 00:32:24.290
fucking ready.
Bay B a butcher box.

508
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.173

514
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.663
<v 9>MMM.</v>

515
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.710
<v 3>The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to</v>

516
00:32:45.711 --> 00:32:50.150
raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones.

517
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.220
They rub their bellies before they murder them.

518
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.320
Cook with the peace of mind knowing you're eating holiday,
high quality meat,

519
00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:59.780
grass fed and grass finished products.

520
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.650
These aren't pigs eat another fucking pigs like the goddamn animals in this

521
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:07.490
country.
They see it's choice you can make for your family.

522
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.600
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat meat,

523
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.470
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

524
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.550
You can choose from five different box types.
All beef,

527
00:33:26.781 --> 00:33:31.220
Every once in awhile we'll bang somebody outside their race.

2010 the final Monday of 2010 Huh?
What are you going to do with it?

543
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.070
Huh?
Are you going to make this the greatest Monday you'd like?

544
00:36:41.071 --> 00:36:44.790
Don't you hate when he goes fucking motivational speakers?
You sitting there,

545
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.710
you're trying to get motivated to not be a negative comment like myself.

546
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.660
Right?
And then this guy comes out,
you get,
you're getting all excited.

547
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.970
So fucking have something positive be said to you or what does the guy do?

548
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:01.210
He makes,

he gets you all nervous with this fucking ridiculous heightened sense of urgency

550
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:12.250

This is Monday.

551
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.600
Think about that everybody.
This is Monday,

552
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.510
December 27th,
2010

553
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.270
does anybody know what that means?
Well,
I mean there is no history.
Don't you hit?

554
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.350
That's the worst part too.
When they start acting like somebody else talk to you.

555
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:31.940
Damn.
Well John,

Is this just a regular shirt and my just a regular person.

559
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.800
Is that how I'm going to live my life right there.

560
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.820
Blow his fucking brains out,

Dare say it wasn't a regular Monday.

561
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.200
You fucking Douche.

562
00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.420
It was a Monday you died because no one wants to hear your current speech.

563
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.110
All right.
I think I've said cunt 58 times already.
Um,

two days after Christmas [inaudible] 72 mother fucking days into me not drinking

566
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.870
.
I can eat five more days,

567
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.210
four more days and I break my record for uh,
you know,

568
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:23.070
being sober.
I'm calling for a hundred days and uh,
it's good.
It's going good.

569
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.140
Oh yeah,
I'm having a great fucking time.
Oh Jesus.
Um,

570
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.890
anyways,
did you guys have yourself a merry little Christmas?

571
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:35.650
Do you have a good Christmas?
Did you get the things that you wanted?
Um,

572
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.680
I had a fucking awesome Christmas once I was able to finally relax cause uh,

573
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.290
people out there who do the road truckers,
other comedians,
lounge singers.

574
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:51.910
Actually lance singers don't travel that just stuck at that same fucking place.

575
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.240
You know,
like Jack Nicholson in the movie,

576
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.760
the shining just slowly going fucking crazy.

577
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.980
Playing hand ball off the wall of their red roof inn.
Fucking sweet.

578
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.480
Um,
yeah,
when you travel as much as I do,

579
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.000
uh,
your brain,
I dunno,

580
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.040
it can't slow down at the needs like four or five days to slow down and uh,

581
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.970
you can't sit down on a couch in a lay down on a bed for like,

582
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.030
at least I can feel like more than 10 minutes.

583
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.070
Your brain is just fucking go and go and go and go and go and,
and uh,

584
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.120
took me like four or five days and then I was finally able to relax and enjoy

585
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:40.750
the holiday.
I actually a,
I was so wound up from doing the road.

586
00:39:40.751 --> 00:39:44.200
I actually wanted to be a,
wanted to be alone.

587
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.900
I don't even know.
I didn't want to be alone.
It's Christmas.

588
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:54.050
I don't want to be alone,
but I did.
I just didn't want to deal with any sort of,

589
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:59.050
uh,
people.
And I've discovered when you become an adult,

590
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:05.260
truly become an adult is a,

591
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.640
Christmas is not about you anymore.

592
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.790
It's about making sure everyone around you had a great Christmas.

593
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:14.620
And then after all the frenzy is sitting back and your enjoyment is that

594
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:16.360
everyone around you had a great Christmas.

595
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:19.780
And I finally figured that out this year.
And,
uh,

596
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:23.740
I became a jolly son of a bitch.
I really enjoyed my Christmas,

597
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.320
you know,
and I gotta admit on December 26 yesterday,

598
00:40:29.321 --> 00:40:34.110
I went out and bought something that I wanted.
Um,
um,

599
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.180
gradually putting together a John Bonam fucking,

600
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.730
uh,
I don't know if I'm going
out as,

601
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:47.050
as him on Halloween or a fun fucking,
uh,

602
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.370
going to make a stupid youtube video.
I don't know what,

603
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.540
but I'm gradually putting together shit that looks like stuff that he wore and a

604
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.630
,
I can grow a beard,
I'll die at Brown.
We'll see what happens.

605
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.830
You know what I bought?
I bought his Adidas sneakers that he wore at the,
uh,

606
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:07.090
the Seattle concert

607
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.111
and you know,

608
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:14.020
you're a fucking John Bonam freak for those of you weren't in the music.

609
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.700
John Bonam is the greatest fucking drummer I overheard,
you know,
um,

610
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.370
just as far as the shit that I like,

611
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:24.160
I know you can say all the Max Roach and all those fucking guys.
Who Buddy rich.

612
00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:27.250
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
All right.
But like stuff for the cons.

613
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:32.040
Who think Neil Peart is better than John Barnum?
All right.
And,

614
00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.010
and if you think that you

615
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.630
<v 10>are a monotone jackass,
um,
all alright.</v>

616
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.830
But anyways,
yeah,
if you go on youtube and you look up a,

617
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:46.670
it's actually Moby Dick rare clip and it's him in Seattle.

618
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:49.100
And at that point they weren't calling it Moby Dick Anymore.

619
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:50.290
They were calling it,
uh,

620
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.860
I something I guess over the top because Robert Plant goes,

621
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.210
John Henry Barnum over the top and then they got like this,
this,

622
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.690
this 1970s,
uh,

623
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.990
what is it fucking technology where it goes over the top tap,
tap,
tap,
wait.

624
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.150
You know,
it's supposed to be like blowing people's minds.

625
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.420
And if you look at the arrogant way,
Robert Plant walks away from the mic.

626
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.140
You really want to throw something at the back of his bushy head.
But,
uh,

627
00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:22.490
if you watch John Bonam play,
he's got a pair of,
I believe,
uh,
the Adidas dragons.

628
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.190
Huh?
Anybody old out there?
Remember that deed is dragons,
Adidas country,
uh,

629
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.230
the Adidas dragons.

630
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.140
So I have those and all I need is a pair of white fucking pants and they sell a

631
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:36.170
replica.
That tee shirt that he wore on the song remains the same.

632
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:38.060
So right there I got the fucking outfit.

633
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.560
Then I got to do is just get a wig and I'm good to go.
Uh,

634
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.150
maybe I'll do that for you guys next year.
I'll make a fucking off.
You know,

635
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.200
there'll be a riot.

636
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.700
I should do that and not say it's me and I'll,

637
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.530
I'll just put a youtube video up and it'd be John Bonam cover and I'll butcher

638
00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.390
at one of his songs.
And you guys can all laugh at how bad people trash

639
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.230
for actually buying the entire outfit.
I'm not above it,
dude.

640
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:09.920
I am a total fucking music geek like that.
I will actually buy some.

641
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:12.710
Speaking of that,
I want to recommend a book here before I am.

642
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.560
I don't know if I've even said anything funny other than revealing how fucking

643
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:20.210
pathetic my personal life is.
Um,
what do I got here?

644
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.453
Um,

645
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.000
out of all the led Zeppelin books out there and there's a zillion of them and

646
00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:28.550
they're all fucking ridiculous for the most part.

647
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:33.551
They always have them selling their soul to the devil and Jimmy Page muttering

648
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:38.960
some sort of a cult bullshit walking away.
Um,
you know,

649
00:43:38.961 --> 00:43:42.350
and then fuck is sticking a flounder in some girls Twat,

650
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.790
which probably happened in Seattle.
I have no fucking idea.
But,
uh,

651
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.720
the best book that I have found on it is a,

652
00:43:50.721 --> 00:43:51.860
it's called John Bonam,

653
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:55.910
the powerhouse behind led Zepplin and it's written by his brother,

654
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.983
Mick bottom.

655
00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:02.090
And it says right on the back or is it on the inside cover?

656
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.350
Why he wrote the book?
He basically says,
if I can just paraphrase here,

657
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.090
why don't I just,
I'll,
I'll read you a little excerpt about 10 years ago.

658
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.450
This is from his brother,
um,
after,
oh,
actually,

659
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.680
Linda Barnum wrote this about 10 years ago after reading yet another load of

660
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:23.360
rubbish about his brother John.
My husband mic turned to me and said,

661
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.610
I should write a book about our kid,

662
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.290
if only to tell Zoe John's daughter what a great bloke or dad was.

663
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.380
And that the seeds of this book began to grow.
And it's,
fuck,

664
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:38.640
it's just a killer book.
It's very,
very little of it is actually about,

665
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.010
you know,
all the bullshit that those other books are about,
which is,
you know,

666
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.720
and then they went to this town and they drank this much and they did this and

667
00:44:48.721 --> 00:44:51.510
they did that.
It's,
it's really,
uh,

668
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.500
him growing up with John and John being home in between the tours and,

669
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.850
uh,
it's fucking awesome.
I read it in like a day and a half,
two days.

670
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.020
But when do you expect that,

671
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.640
considering I basically expose myself to be like that chick who whacks Selena.

672
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.410
You know,
you know that fucking psycho.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

673
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.290
If John Bonham was alive,
would I be stalking him?
This is really getting creepy.

674
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.320
All right,
let's,
let's fucking plow ahead yet,
but I want to recommend that book.

675
00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.420
All right.
And there's big words and lots of pages.
By big words,
I mean big font,

676
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.710
lots of pictures and um,

677
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.720
yeah,
definitely check it out.
Definitely check it out.

678
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.120
And a classic Englishman,

679
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.190
I can tell you that about John Bonam in that like most Englishman,

680
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.780
he looks like he never lifted a weight in his life.

681
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.090
Got that awful fish and chip torso yet continued to wear tight shirts right

682
00:45:48.091 --> 00:45:52.110
through this career.
Never understand that.
You only see that you don't,

683
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:55.740
you do not see that here in America,
except with gay guys.

684
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.130
Gay guys will wear tight shirts no matter what shape they're ready.

685
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.890
That's not true.
They will actually,

686
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.990
if as long as they got a little peck action going on,

687
00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:05.700
they don't give a fuck about their stomach.

688
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.300
You know that as long as that chest is out a little bit further than the
stomach,

689
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:13.680
they wear tight shirts too.
But I've been over to Europe and I'm telling you,

690
00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:18.681
I've never seen it like you can never did a pushup and their fucking lives.

691
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.540
Those types of bodies.
You got that seventh grade chest and arms,

692
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.850
and then this fucking,
I just drank a keg of beer,
stomach it,
uh,
this,

693
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:34.040
you know,
this is like,
you know what it is?
This is like they,

694
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:38.970
they made it big before Elvis fucking died in Elvis is the first behind the

695
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:43.910
music as far as the rock star and all that to,
I know every guy,

696
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.640
he stole all the music from the Blues and Gospel Black Dudes.
You know what?

697
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:51.840
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'm so sick of that stupid ass fucking argument.

698
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.980
He didn't,
he was influenced by him,
but because he's a different race,

699
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:59.670
they said he stole it.
It's such bullshit.
You know,

700
00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:02.430
if you're black and you listen to a blues guy and you play blues,

701
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.610
you're carrying on a tradition.
But if you're white,
you do it.
You're stealing.

702
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:11.100
All right?
And if black dudes fucking still white music,
they're sampling.

703
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.430
It's bullshit.
It's all bullshit.
Nobody steal from anybody.

704
00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:18.480
You're a year and being influenced so enough already with the fucking whining.

705
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:23.481
I'm so sick of fucking people bitching that this unfair business is unfair.

706
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.990
Yes.
Show businesses unfair life is unfair.
Oh really?
Did you write it?

707
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:31.330
And then you didn't get credit?
Well,
fucking welcome to the club.

708
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.050
I never wrote anything that you get credit for,
but I can tell you right now,

709
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:39.670
I have been a victim of some very creative math.
Yeah.

710
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:43.330
You know what bill,
here's your royalty checks.
Uh,

711
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:45.640
that's $4 and 98 cents.
Yeah.

712
00:47:45.641 --> 00:47:48.790
We had a hundred grand worth of whiteout that we,

713
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:53.290
and we had to buy a new typewriter that costs us 30 grand,
you know,

714
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:56.200
and all that comes out of your fucking pocket.
Yeah.
It's been going on forever.

715
00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:57.600
But the reason why I say,
uh,

716
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.640
Elvis is the original behind the music is because he's the first guy who got as

717
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:07.390
far as I can tell,
got lofted all the way up into the stratosphere.

718
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.490
And uh,
like everything he did now is just so fucking cliche,

719
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:16.660
but he was the first guy doing it so nobody could really see it,
you know?

720
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:22.780
And by the time he died as a drug dealer,
drug addicted fat,

721
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:28.150
fucking a toilet that was 77,
you know,
at which point,
you know,

722
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.850
sapling was approaching 30 years of age.
They were,
it was already too late.
Right.

723
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.150
Does that make any fucking sense?
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to justify,

724
00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.950
and this is also before,

725
00:48:38.951 --> 00:48:42.460
like John Bonam never would've got that if he was living today.
I,
I can,

726
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.230
I can't guarantee that it wouldn't be dead,

727
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:49.231
but he definitely would have like a 95% chance of not being dead because someone

728
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:52.630
would be like,
you know,
say you had a problem.
That'd be an intervention.

729
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.110
And then also when he got out of shape and he started getting the man tits there

730
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:56.980
,
they,
they,
they fucking,

731
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:00.340
he would've got the shit teased out of him on youtube and just start a sheer

732
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:04.690
fucking humiliation.
Uh,
I think you would've done some setups,

733
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.101
but you never know.

734
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:10.540
He is European and they just really don't seem to be into physical fitness over

735
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:11.374
there.

736
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:18.100
This is coming from an American,
they're not obese,

737
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:22.900
but they are just some fleshy mushy sons of bitches over there.
Not all of them.

738
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:24.790
Not all of them.
You get your occasional one,

739
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.180
but they'll the occasional one seems like the ones that are born that way.

740
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:32.650
You know,
like their dad was like a fucking shipbuilder and his dad was,
you know,

741
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:37.180
fucking worked with Thor or some shit.
You know what I mean?
On a fucking,

742
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:39.310
now what?
What am I talking about here?
Really?
People.
Huh?

743
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:44.440
13 minutes of absolute shit.
All right,
let's,

744
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.610
what are we going to talk about this week here?
Um,
oh,

745
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:52.170
you guys want to hear a story?
Because when,
here's story here.
Do you get,

746
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.150
you have to take,
do you actually have to work right now?
Does anybody know?

747
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.770
Does anybody working right now?

748
00:49:56.771 --> 00:50:01.630
Does anybody have such a fucking Dick for a boss that he basically gave you new

749
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:05.470
year's Eve off and then Christmas Day off and now it's Monday.

750
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.240
Now you're back to work.
You know,
this is a really,
I don't know about you guys,

751
00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:14.620
but this is one of the most depressing weeks of the year,
you know,
is

752
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.770
the week between Christmas and New Year's.
Once Christmas is over,
you know,

753
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:24.370
it's like you see the buildup of the tree.
First of all,

754
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.410
you get your Christmas tree and if you're like me,

755
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:30.650
everybody trashes the tree except for this guy here who writes me this letter.

756
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:33.710
Hey Bill,
fuck the haters.
Fuck the haters.
Your tree is awesome.

757
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.470
Your tree is a noble fir,

758
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.790
which is a far superior tree compared to those faggoty Douglas firs.

759
00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.100
I love this guy.
Immediately.
Just those trees are gay.
Um,

760
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.760
anyways,
where the hell am I?
Yes,
they look a little sparse,

761
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:52.070
but there is actually room to hang the ornaments.

762
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.270
I like to joke that most people decorate their Christmas bushes by just throwing

763
00:50:56.271 --> 00:50:58.580
shit at them and hoping for the best ever.

764
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.000
Notice all the ends of the branches of Douglas Firs are freshly cut.

765
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.350
A Douglas firs do not grow in a conical shape.

766
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.610
That means Christmas tree shape.

767
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:11.240
I guess they have to be trimmed in order to look like a tree because they

768
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:15.560
normally look like a bush.
Exactly.
That's why I never liked those fucking trees.

769
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.120
It looks like a shrub.

770
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.070
I've never seen a fucking tree look like a Christmas tree.
That's why,

771
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.580
and that's why I liked the tree that I bought because it looked like a fucking

772
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:30.140
tree.
Thank you sir.
Um,
he said,

773
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:33.320
have you ever seen how they prune these trees on the farm before they ship to

774
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:35.030
your local grocery store parking lot?

775
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:38.870
A dude would dude with a hedge clipper tied to his back at an angle,

776
00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:42.470
goes up and down the rows of bushes and walks around each one,

777
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:44.570
cutting it into a Christmas tree shape.

778
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.580
Nobles aren't artificially shaped at all and grow to be symmetrical and

779
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:54.260
perfectly proportioned.
There you go.
So go fuck yourself.

780
00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:58.340
They also had somebody else write me a letter saying I fuck all those people.
My,

781
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.230
uh,
my sister or somebody is a,
Ah,
fuck,
I wish I saved.
This is in,

782
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.280
in some sort of artistic design or something to like my Theresa.
You know what?

783
00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:10.910
I'm a little ahead of the curve people you way,
you know what's going to happen.

784
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.210
One of these fucking emaciated celebrities is going to get one and then it's

785
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:15.560
going to become all the rage thing.

786
00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:19.280
We wearing uggs with the fucking Santa Claus Thong,
right?

787
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.300
With a midriff showing be like Anna God.
Like oh my God,
this tree is like,

788
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:27.410
oh my God.
And they're going to be in US magazine and that's going to be it.

789
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:32.330
Matthew mcconaughey will be naked playing bongos and it'll all work out.

790
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.140
But your rule,
remember that you heard it here first.
You heard it here first.

791
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.300
I actually bought a fucking tree.
You guys bought shrubs.
All right,

792
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:46.190
so fuck you and your holiday.
Um,
but anyways,
yeah,
it's a really depressing week.

793
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.850
So many ways you go out and you buy the Goddamn tree so that you have the tree

794
00:52:49.851 --> 00:52:53.090
and as the excitement of the smell of the tree,
it smells like Christmas.

795
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.570
All my God,
it's got to happen,
right?
It's that time of year.

796
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.430
We're going to actually get off the wheel for a second.
Joy,
the people around us,

797
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:05.150
hopefully,
you know.
And then what happened?
Then you decorate the tree.

798
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.310
He put a little skirt around it.
You dress up that little whore,
right?

799
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.530
You get even more excited that one app,

800
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.000
but you come on for work and one of your family members or the person you live

801
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:21.260
with has wrapped a couple of gifts putting in underneath.
This is the buildup,

802
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.890
right?
This is Elvis,
1954 right before he fucking,

803
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.210
you know,
and then what happens?
Couple more gifts.

804
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:35.340
So he puts on a fucking Christmas record,
your balls filled up,

805
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.900
just waiting to fucking for Christmas Day.
And then Christmas comes,

806
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.070
all right,
Elvis on the fucking Ed Sullivan show.

807
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.770
Everybody's going fucking crazy people opening gifts is fucking bitches

808
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:51.390
screaming outside your window.

809
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.880
You throw down a scarf at him.
Everything is fucking great.

810
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.320
And then just like that,
it's over.
It's fucking over.

811
00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:06.840
You know,
you get drafted,
send you over to Jeremy.
I can't do this Elvis thing.

812
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:09.270
I don't fucking know him saying here.
You don't want,
I mean that is fucking over.

813
00:54:09.271 --> 00:54:12.420
And then you look in at your tree,
you know,
still get the lights.

814
00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.860
It still has to skirt,
but what happened?
All the gifts.
They're all God.
You know,

815
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.410
it's a couple of pieces of paper.
It's like they peaked.

816
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:20.790
It's like your favorite band.

817
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.350
They had those three awesome albums in a row and now they're about ready to

818
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:30.351
fucking spend their rest of their career trying to recapture those,

819
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.480
the,
the,
the whatever the fuck they did in those three albums.
Right?

820
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.800
No,
that's it.
So over to say goodbye to everybody.

821
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.490
You start looking at your family members.
You see him there are a year older.

822
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.060
She makes you feel older.
Yeah.
No,

823
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.720
nothing's on TV.
All the TV people are on vacation.

824
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.670
This show in something on a loop.
Mtvs finally show fucking videos.

825
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.190
It gets quiet.
You sit back,
you reflect on what a nice Christmas it is,

826
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.230
but she just can't get over this feeling of this wave of depression that's

827
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:08.370
coming because you know it's about radius start all over again.

828
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.480
Another fucking year with this fucking job,

829
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.530
with that fucking Douche telling me what to do.

830
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.790
My fucking by fanny,
a fucking girlfriend or your wife or husband.

831
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:24.810
It's going to be another fucking year.
You know

832
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.020
the answer your fucking tree,

833
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.860
just reminding you of your God damn mortality because you're not,
you're not,

834
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.920
you're not fucking water in it the way you wanted it before Christmas.

835
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.130
You skip a few days,
branches start to droop.

836
00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:42.090
Couples start to turn brown like the gray in your hair.

837
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.060
Look at this artistic little jaunt.
I'm on here,

838
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.241
you know,

839
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:51.630
and by the ta and then what's the worst is then you start walking down the

840
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:56.220
street,
going out to your car and what happens to body start piling up out there.

841
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.920
You see your first fucking Christmas tree,

842
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.810
that Bah humbug Douche bag across the street and throws the fucking thing out at

843
00:56:03.811 --> 00:56:08.430
like one o'clock in the morning.
December 26th it's sitting out there,

844
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.264
right?

845
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:15.260
Lay It on its side like a fucking victim at the beginning of the first 48 you

846
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:16.970
know,

847
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:21.870
it's got one little piece at tinsel blowing in the wind cause the rest of it's

848
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:24.310
shit got snatched from around his fucking neck.

849
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:27.460
Just laying there dead is a fucking door nail.

850
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.600
Next day you come out,
there's two more.

851
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:34.900
Start driving down the work and you just see them all over the place.

852
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:37.810
Just being the positive,
you know,

853
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.740
like fucking former stars and boy bands just littering the fucking highway and

854
00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.770
it's fucking over
fucking over.

855
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.790
So what do you do then?
You got what?

856
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:58.630
You got New Year's eve coming up the worst fucking holiday of the year.

857
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:03.580
You know,
New Year's Eve is for young people.
It's not for old people.

858
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:06.430
You know,
that's when you know,

859
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:09.790
you've hit a level of maturity is when you can go to bed at like 10 o'clock,

860
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.050
10:00 PM on New Year's eve and you didn't go out.
You didn't get drunk.

861
00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.380
You stayed away from those fucking morons.
You know,

862
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:21.670
I'll tell you what's a great weekend to go out as the weekend after New Year's

863
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.040
eve and all those guys who,

864
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.860
people are still fucking hung over and they're still fucking sick,

865
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:32.380
you know,
from their overindulging cause they don't know how to drink.

866
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.580
Then you then you head out.
Like I'll tell you what's it,
you know,

867
00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:38.260
it's gonna be a great night.
Uh,
what's,
what's new?
Is He Friday night?

868
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:40.780
You want to be a great night to go out drinking Monday night,

869
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.620
that my friends will be a great God damn night.

870
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:49.390
If you're an antisocial fucking prick like I am,
that's,

871
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.190
that's where you want to go.
Um,

872
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:58.210
oh hey.
Speaking of which,
listen to this shit.
Me and Paul Versey,

873
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:03.370
we're coming down to the wire here.
We're actually tied.
All right.

874
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.870
As of right before this weekend,
we are tied.

875
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:11.200
All right.
And I gotta tell you something.

876
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:15.490
This week I had a breakthrough in my gambling.
We pick four games a week.

877
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.220
Whoever wins it in the end,
it's only a hundred bucks,

878
00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:22.060
but it's more just about the shit talk and during the year,
um,

879
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:26.500
so this year nobody has gone undefeated yet.
All right,

880
00:58:26.501 --> 00:58:31.090
so you're talking 16 weeks of gambling,
32 weeks between the two of us.

881
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.840
Nobody has gone for no,
we've had a,
you know,

882
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:38.650
a number of three in ones,
but nobody has gone for it.
Oh.

883
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:40.840
And uh,

884
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.840
Paul Versey actually did the impossible.

885
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.950
What are we called,
the unthinkable and the unimaginable.

886
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:55.300
The unimaginable is going for no,
he did the unthinkable.
He went,

887
00:58:55.301 --> 00:59:00.301
oh and for so this week I don't know what I was talking to one a knee,

888
00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:04.870
his uncles and uh,

889
00:59:04.871 --> 00:59:08.020
he was talking about going against public opinion and there was this whole new

890
00:59:08.021 --> 00:59:12.160
website and shit about going against public opinion with your gambling.

891
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.870
And I decided to take a little bit of that.
All right,

892
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.500
cause this is,
this is what I realized,

893
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:24.280
the reason why I could never break through three in one and get to foreign

894
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.430
[inaudible] is because I kept picking people that I thought were going to win

895
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.570
every fucking game.
And I know that sounds crazy,
but to gamblers,

896
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:37.400
that makes sense.
You know,
when you don't have money on the game,

897
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.090
you can actually sit there and fucking,
you know,

898
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:43.303
just say,
you know what?

899
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.440
Not only do I think this team's going to cover the spread.

900
00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:46.760
I think they're gonna win the fucking game.

901
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.290
But all of a sudden when you put money on it,

902
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:52.490
you alligator Armad and you just start,
you know,

903
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.450
you get too scared to take a fucking chance.
At least I did.

904
00:59:56.451 --> 01:00:00.770
So this week I was like,
fuck it.
I'm taking a couple of chances here.

905
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.470
All right.
I went safe at first.

906
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:08.471
I picked Tampa over Seattle and their doctor's wearing fucking coaching staff

907
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.310
with Pete Carroll.
I said,
fuck it.
I'm going with Tampa now.

908
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:16.730
That was one that I was,
that was my plane.
It's safe.
Bet.

909
01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:21.020
And I don't know.
I was looking at Washington and Jacksonville and I was like,

910
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:24.690
you know,
it's in Jacksonville.

911
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.770
Jacksonville is gonna win.
You know,
they're gonna win this game.

912
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:30.080
They're going to get the running game gum.
They're going to fucking run over.

913
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:33.650
They got fucking rex Grossman playing quarterback for Washington.

914
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:38.360
It's fucking over.
But I don't know why I got a it.

915
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.130
I get a feel and fucking Washington's going to win this game just because nobody

916
01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:48.110
thinks they're going to.
So I said,
fuck it.
I bet on Washington,
you know.

917
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.120
And then continuing that line of thought

918
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.160
San Diego was going into Cincinnati.
Cincinnati is shit,

919
01:00:55.161 --> 01:00:59.840
the bed the entire fucking year.
San Diego always plays well in December.

920
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.190
They're a heckle,
a heckle,
and Jeckle a fucking,
uh,
what do you call it?

921
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.840
Jekyll and Hyde.
Fucking a team.
And I said to hell with that.
I don't give a shit.

922
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.650
I'm going with Cincinnati.
And Lo and behold,

923
01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.840
yours truly with three and o yesterday,

924
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.550
three and own Paul Versey went one and two.
We had the Sunday night game,

925
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:24.170
but it got fucking snowed out.
I am one game up on him.
I'm sorry we're not tied.

926
01:01:24.171 --> 01:01:26.690
I am one game up on him.
All right.
So I went through,

927
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:29.210
you know yesterday he went one and two.

928
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.580
So no matter what happens tonight,
you know,

929
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.680
if I lose my game,
he,
he wins his game.

930
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:40.640
I'm going to be up by two games with one week to go.
All right?

931
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:45.260
But if I win tonight and go foreign and over four,
no,

932
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.870
I will have done the unimaginable.

933
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:54.380
I've done it.
And who do you think I took tonight?
Who would you take?

934
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.730
The spread is two and a half falcons at home playing the saints.
Who Do you like?

935
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.200
Who Do you like?
12 and two is that what a,

936
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:07.940
is that what the Falcons are Matty ice at home?
Just given two and a half.

937
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.750
It's their fucking year.
I said fuck it.

938
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:14.870
I'm taking the saints.

939
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.560
It took the saints and the points would drew Brees sticking with that line of

940
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:23.010
thought of going against the playing it safe?

941
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.980
I think a,
I don't think the falcons had been tested yet this year.
Add a,

942
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:30.210
I just think that,
you know,

943
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.630
this is just going to be one of those things that happens to a team like this.

944
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.230
I still think they might be a year away from doing something huge and this is

945
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:39.900
one of these games where I just think they're going to get a wake up call.

946
01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:42.000
Like okay,
we're good,
but we s we,

947
01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:44.970
but like we're not like the saints that actually have gone through the whole

948
01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:46.980
thing on one won the super bowl.
That's why I took the saints.

949
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:51.330
I'm looking to go for and own.
Paul Versey has got the now Tuesday night game.

950
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:55.350
He took the Minnesota Vikings getting 14 points and a,

951
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:59.400
I'm telling you if I go for no and he goes one and three,

952
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.830
I'll pick up three games.

953
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:05.790
I'll be up for games with one week to go and we pick four games.

954
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.690
All have to do is fucking win one game to Goddamn extra point.

955
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:14.310
It's a chip shot and I will get bragging rights for the entire fucking year and

956
01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:17.420
I will really be excited about that.
And with that seal,

957
01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:18.780
there you go for all these though,

958
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:23.640
all of you who are into the gambling aspects of my life and I wish that somebody

959
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:28.320
actually came up with this awesome theory,
um,
about sports.

960
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.080
Uh,
this guy says,
Bill,
I have,

961
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.010
I have a theory about sports that tends to piss people off,
especially women,

962
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.410
which makes me think I'm onto something

963
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.940
and it's got nothing to do with the unpredictability of sports.

964
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:45.810
I think he's this,
this is,
this theory is basically why people like sports.

965
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:50.370
He said it mainly applies,
um,
to team sports,

966
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:53.160
some individual sports too.
Okay.
So here it is.

967
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:57.930
It begins back in the day when armies were in the field waiting to go into

968
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:02.931
battle and armies objective was essentially to conquer foreign lands and rape

969
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:07.680
women in order to celebrate the glory of their race slash,
culture.

970
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.830
And they would train for battles by making up games.

971
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:15.030
These games were based around themes of land grabbing and raping.

972
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.700
In this theory,
the ball,
football,
basketball,

973
01:04:20.701 --> 01:04:23.940
whatever represents the seed,
the goals,

974
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:29.090
either posts or a hoop or a net represents the opposing team's women symbolizing

975
01:04:30.661 --> 01:04:35.520
either their legs up in the air or they're vag or their womb,
whatever.

976
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.370
The opposing team represents the enemy army.

977
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.070
And the objective of the game is to get your seed,

978
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.920
pass the opposition and impregnate their women.

979
01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:49.370
That's essentially the theory and it's a abridged version and it's why some

980
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:54.570
sports are like cracked and some are just who gives a shit when a sport is put

981
01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:58.620
together.
Right.
It's a primal source of highly addictive goodness.

982
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:05.150
Did you ever think somebody who would like basically compare sports to rape with

983
01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:08.790
then,
you know,
if you were going to do that,

984
01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:11.400
you wouldn't think that they would basically then just say yeah.
And it's,

985
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:15.060
you think that they would be trashing it?
Not saying that it's a,

986
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:19.390
that it's a form of highly addictive goodness.
So there you go.

987
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:23.770
I actually liked that theory.
I believe in that.
All that subliminal Shit,

988
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.390
you know,
and uh,
yeah,
I'll go with deck.
What do you guys think about that dairy.

989
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.460
Am I the worst?
MERV Griffin ever.
I have no studio audience.

990
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:37.330
What do you guys think into the abyss?
Um,

991
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.520
am I really going to do another fuck?
I got it.
I got to be a,

992
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.230
I gotta be balanced here.

993
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:47.440
Fair and balanced when it comes to the sports shit cause it's becoming too much

994
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:50.710
sports.
I got to,
Oh,
here's one for you,
but I tell you,
I was,

995
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:53.850
I said I forgot I was going to tell you a story here.
Uh,

996
01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.900
I took cleo out and we went outside for walks if she could do her business and

997
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:04.771
I'm walking up the street and I went around the corner and Cleo is a,

998
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:08.830
you know,
she's going number one,
she's taking a piss.

999
01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:10.510
So I'm standing there right?

1000
01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:15.511
And I looked and I see this guy as cleos beginning to do her thing is walking to

1001
01:06:16.211 --> 01:06:20.770
his SUV,
like one of those little mini ones,
like the Lexus sort of one.

1002
01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.200
And I see him looking at me.

1003
01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.450
I just sort of look back and didn't think anything of it and cleos go in the

1004
01:06:25.451 --> 01:06:29.880
bathroom and I'm going,
that's a go girl.
Who's your good girl?
Go girl.

1005
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:33.040
You go to bat boy as you go girl.
I'm doing that shit right.

1006
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:39.580
Slapping her on her fucking muscular thighs and you know,

1007
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:43.530
she finishes does a Little Harlem shake,
you know,
and then she fought.

1008
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.680
We start fucking uh,
walking up the street and then I said,

1009
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.450
the guy down at the SUV,
he all of a sudden I just say this,
pick it up,

1010
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:55.870
dude.
I'm like,
what?

1011
01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:02.230
Cause Dude pick it up.
I go and I realized he touched,
she took a shit,

1012
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:06.970
which she didn't.
I go,
she went number one,
I can't believe I said that,

1013
01:07:06.971 --> 01:07:08.560
but I wanted to win the argument.
I would be like,

1014
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:11.410
she took a piss and when she went number one

1015
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.180
and then the guy just gets in his fucking car such as getting this,

1016
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:21.100
it is a little SUV thing.
I go,
what?
No,
sorry,
you go.
So I said sorry.

1017
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.340
Yeah,
not as loud as you said that other shit.

1018
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:27.280
Then he got in his car and he fucking drove away.

1019
01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.750
That's one thing I fucking hate about the west coast is the way they,

1020
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.090
they confront you.
The confrontation out here.

1021
01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:41.770
I don't know why they do it like back east.
They would have been like,
hey dude,

1022
01:07:41.771 --> 01:07:44.920
fucking Nino.
Pick up your shit.

1023
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:48.730
You know,
out here until he's like,

1024
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.130
I don't know what it is they was calling you bro.
Hey Bro,

1025
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:59.590
what's up dude?
Pick it up dude.
That is fucking annoys the shit out of me.

1026
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.200
It just fucking annoying.
I don't know.

1027
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.380
That's the only time it really bugs me being out here is that,

1028
01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:10.120
that that surfer fucking way that they talk when they think they confront you

1029
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:16.400
bro.
What a Douche and you know,
what kills is that that affected,

1030
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:20.180
<v 3>that affected me the way I interacted with people,</v>

1031
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.260
you know,
for like the next four hours.

1032
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:27.920
I just had that playing in a loop in my head.
Pick it up.

1033
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.650
G was in my fucking head.
Everywhere I went,

1034
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:37.010
you want paper or plastic,
you know,
just it's,
you know,
follow me or pick it up.

1035
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.430
Deed.
I'm just fucking here in that in my head.
And uh,

1036
01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:43.910
what did you know what I mean?

1037
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.680
The proper way to do that is just to be like,
excuse me.
Did,

1038
01:08:49.690 --> 01:08:54.110
did your dog just a go number two and like,
no,
no.
She went number one.

1039
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.930
It'd be like,
okay,
I'm sorry.
It's just lightly people and leaving.
Okay.

1040
01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.880
That's the way you do it.
You know,
just go pick it up dude.
Fuck it.

1041
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:04.603
Ah,

1042
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.940
I wish I could train cleo know for those of you new to my podcast,

1043
01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:15.380
she is a pit bull to just do a mock charge.
You know they do that in the wild.

1044
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.810
I just wish that just teeth are just fucking run.

1045
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:26.230
Just have that guy p his slacks a little bit and then right to the point where

1046
01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:28.820
he thought he was going to get his fucking balls ripped off.

1047
01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:32.210
She just stops on a dime.
It turns around in,

1048
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.630
this fucking runs up the beautiful way that she runs.

1049
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.960
I should take a video of my dog run full speed.

1050
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.870
It's one of the most beautiful things you ever going to see.
It's literally,

1051
01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:46.760
you could make like one of those secretary movies,
this fucking dog,

1052
01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:51.720
she is shredded
I and like she should,

1053
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.850
she's awesome and way she runs the level of power,

1054
01:09:55.851 --> 01:10:00.500
first of all when she runs she gets like excited right before she does and she

1055
01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:04.910
does this move was she sort of throws her head back a little bit and just throws

1056
01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:08.870
her cell phone.
It's like,
it's like a fucking muscle car.
It's unbelievable.

1057
01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.210
Absolutely love watching her run.

1058
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.960
And if I could just somehow train her to run and scare the shit out of people

1059
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:18.950
who say pick it up,
deed with that would really make me happy.

1060
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:22.040
So uh,
that's what happened this week.

1061
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.400
And then I went inside and that ended up getting into an argument with Nia cause

1062
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:28.370
I was just in a bad fucking mood.
Um,

1063
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.860
no did I know she got mad at me about something else.

1064
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.000
She was really pissed at me this week.
I don't,
what the fuck,
you know,

1065
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.863
one of those deals.
I think it was,

1066
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:38.900
cause I was coming down off being off the on the road and she thought that I was

1067
01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.360
going to be a dick.
And uh,

1068
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.630
no matter how many times I tell her that I have to,
you know,

1069
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.450
I need a few days to unwind.

1070
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.590
Like I literally have the urge when I'm in the house to get up and just get in

1071
01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:59.591
the car and just start driving around because I'm so in travel mode and go and

1072
01:11:00.111 --> 01:11:03.620
go and go and go and go with that.
It,
uh,
it takes a fucking minute.
So,

1073
01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.810
uh,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know if I've got to do yoga or whatever,

1074
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.460
the fucking idea.
It's definitely seems to be causing a rift.
Um,

1075
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.800
<v 10>but anyways,
I just remembered I was going to tell you,
oh,</v>

1076
01:11:16.801 --> 01:11:21.801
I know last night I went and I saw the fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and a

1077
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.480
Christian Bale and I can't recommend that movie highly enough.

1078
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:31.290
That movie was fucking awesome.
It was a movie I wasn't going to see.
I'm like,

1079
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:35.970
Oh God,
here we go.
Rocky all over again.
But what saved it was,
it was Micky ward.

1080
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:40.110
And,
uh,
I remember his fights and I'm,

1081
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.490
I'm embarrassed to say I didn't see that Arturo Gotti fight until years

1082
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:44.491
afterwards.

1083
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:48.120
I actually watched it on Youtube and I remember Colin Quinn coming into the

1084
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.230
cellar raving about that fight.
Um,

1085
01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.530
in fact,
there's two fights that I remember that I was just like,

1086
01:11:55.531 --> 01:11:57.630
I have to see this fight.
It was the Micky ward,

1087
01:11:57.631 --> 01:12:02.631
Arturo Gotti fight after hearing Collin Quinn rave about it down at the comedy

1088
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:05.880
cellar and,
uh,

1089
01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:12.930
the Diego Cra,
a corral is fight.
Uh,

1090
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.800
was it corrals Casteel fight?
Is that so it was,
yes.
Diego,

1091
01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.270
I can't fucking remember.
She can tell.
I,
I dip in and out of boxing,

1092
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:24.030
but uh,
that's a crap corrals.

1093
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:27.720
Casteel their first fucking fight is unbelievable.

1094
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.590
And Charlie Murphy flipped out about that when he told me he almost broke his

1095
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:35.790
foot
at the end of that fight.
Well,
one of them is just,
you know,

1096
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:40.650
knocked out,
gets up in this training goes,
you better fucking get inside now.

1097
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.360
Cause evident.
I think I told this story before you,

1098
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.480
cause you better fucking get inside now.
And he put his mouthpiece in him and uh,

1099
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.120
he turned around,
they continue the round,
he fucking knocks.

1100
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:53.670
The other guy technically knocks out the other fucking guy.

1101
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.850
And I guess that got Charlie so fucking amped up.
He,

1102
01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.600
he stomped his foot down on the floor and woke up his whole family.

1103
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:03.810
So those are the two fights.
But anyways,
this,
so this fight,
uh,
this,

1104
01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:08.760
this movie is about a Micky Ward's,
uh,

1105
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.770
you know,
ascension up to trying to win a championship.
And,

1106
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.220
uh,
I have to tell you,
man,
it is absolutely phenomenal.

1107
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.890
I was rooting for like the Mark Walberg character while he was fighting.

1108
01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:27.030
It was fucking awesome.
Maybe want to get in great shape.
And I gotta tell you,

1109
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.360
I don't think I've ever seen a movie where they did the Boston accent better.

1110
01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.600
Even just for that reason.
Even if you're not a sports fan,

1111
01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:38.280
you gotta go see there and see the five women that play,
his sister's stiff.

1112
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.960
They're fucking unbelievable.

1113
01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:43.590
And it reminded me of this period in my life when I was underage and I used to

1114
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:48.591
go out to these dive bars in like Chelsea and all those awful m towns north of

1115
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:53.650
Boston,
Malden,
Medford,
rev.

1116
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:58.380
I used to go out to all of those places because they didn't give a fuck cause

1117
01:13:58.381 --> 01:14:02.850
most of them were actually,
you know,
you know,
people were doing coke,

1118
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:05.130
it was the 80s now some people was selling coke.

1119
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:07.620
So like alcohol just seemed like it was a joke.

1120
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.620
It's like somebody went up there and asked for some juice so I could actually

1121
01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:15.070
get with my fucking 12 year old boy ish face.
And um,

1122
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.760
those five women that you see,
uh,
in,

1123
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:24.730
in the,
in that movie that those are the kinds of girls that you ran into.

1124
01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.030
They will like 21 years old and they look like they were 40.

1125
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.350
They already had a kid and they were jaded.
I can't explain it.

1126
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:35.050
And so fucked up was,
it was a,
it was like a 20,

1127
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:39.880
25 minute ride from where I lived,
which was a world away with no traffic.

1128
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:44.080
Of course with traffic,
it took like a fucking hour to get there.
But uh,

1129
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.980
yeah,
I just remember shooting the shit with them and they'd be,
oh,

1130
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:52.570
you like smack.
But anyways,

1131
01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:54.760
those are my two recommendations for this week.
Get,
uh,

1132
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.860
get the book John Bond on the powerhouse behind led Zeppelin by Mick Barnum and,

1133
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:03.900
uh,
go see the fighter.
I'm going to see true grit this week and it's,

1134
01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:06.940
someone's trying to talk me into going to see Toronto,
but I,
I just,

1135
01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:11.020
I could give a shit about science fiction.
I've never been into it.

1136
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.030
I never liked star trek.
I,

1137
01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:18.230
I liked star wars for maybe six months in my youth just because everybody else

1138
01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:22.870
liked it and I wanted to fit in.
So I kinda got into by just,
I don't give a shit.

1139
01:15:22.871 --> 01:15:27.250
I think those movies are gay.
They're gay.
All right there.

1140
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:30.820
I said it all right.
You know,

1141
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.510
you've put on the after burners.
I'm doing the best.

1142
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:39.511
I can't hit warp speed and their stupid fucking handshakes and,

1143
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:42.181
and the,

1144
01:15:42.181 --> 01:15:47.130
the aliens that they're friends with and the gay names of the fucking space

1145
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.330
ships that they ride around in and it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's for nerds.

1146
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:56.830
It's for people who don't know how to get laid.
I don't know.
That's not true,

1147
01:15:56.831 --> 01:16:01.660
but it just,
the stereotype is true.
And speaking of which,
I wanted to read this,

1148
01:16:01.661 --> 01:16:05.410
this overrated for this week when,
um,
this just reminded me of this.

1149
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:09.520
Somebody wrote overrated Las Vegas.
Somebody wrote a,

1150
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.950
I'm tired of everybody going to Las Vegas all the time.

1151
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.090
They throw that shit around.

1152
01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:17.860
Like they're going like they're getting a free trip to a space station.
Like,
Yo,

1153
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:22.840
anybody want to go to Vegas this weekend?
Like it's just the wildest,

1154
01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:27.460
craziest place.
It's not Vegas fucking stinks.

1155
01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:31.480
It's really not that big a deal there.
It's too hot.
The drive sucks.

1156
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.150
How do they not widen out that 14?

1157
01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:38.200
It's actually the 15th or whatever to be more than two lanes.
Yeah,

1158
01:16:38.201 --> 01:16:41.590
that's the highway.
When you come back on Sunday,
it's a fucking nightmare.

1159
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.940
Always flying to Vegas.

1160
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.050
Never drive unless you plan on leaving at two in the fucking morning.
He said,
uh,

1161
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:50.800
the other big thing I'm tired of with Vegas is the media perception.

1162
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:55.150
That is the craziest place on earth that you never know what kind of nutty shit

1163
01:16:55.151 --> 01:16:58.660
is going on.
And it's like that every day of the year.

1164
01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:02.890
You should just go wild there.
Go home with three strippers,

1165
01:17:02.891 --> 01:17:07.780
party like crazy with your boys and wake up with the most insane story ever.

1166
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.040
It's like that movie,
the hangover.

1167
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:14.360
It's like that Song Waking Up in Vegas from Katy Perry.
Woo Hoo.
Yay.

1168
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.160
Let's go crazy.
Um,
well I'm sorry to burst your bubble.

1169
01:17:19.161 --> 01:17:22.150
That doesn't really happen there folks.
The fifties and sixties or over,

1170
01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:26.630
not much that that's hip and happening goes on there.
Uh,

1171
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:32.300
you don't see Sinatra and dean coming out to deal blackjack and drink with the

1172
01:17:32.301 --> 01:17:35.900
common folk unless you're bringing in six,
a six figure salary.

1173
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.850
It's actually pretty mundane.

1174
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.720
It's mostly full of sad old people blowing their social security,

1175
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.900
social security checks on slot machines and shit and lousy food and ugly

1176
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.290
tourists with their stupid kids place.

1177
01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.640
The places like Disneyland with gambling and God help you.

1178
01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:56.690
If you wake up with a hangover,
it's generally 117 fucking degrees out.

1179
01:17:56.691 --> 01:18:00.710
You walk out of your hotel and go,
Ha,
Vegas is not supposed to be.

1180
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:05.270
It's supposed to be this out of control party place.
It's not.
You want a story?

1181
01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:09.470
Give Charles Manson a tab of acid and a meat cleaver and let them loose on the

1182
01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:13.970
strip on a Friday night.
You'll have a crazy Vegas story.
Fuck that place.

1183
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:17.810
All right,
well sir,

1184
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:23.090
I 100% agree and disagree all at the same time.
See,

1185
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:28.091
what you did is you went there and you just looked at what you saw like I did

1186
01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.290
the first time I went there,

1187
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.250
I walked there and I was all dressed up to do my shows like I was going to be in

1188
01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:38.480
the fucking rat pack and I saw all these fucking fat tourists with their flip

1189
01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:41.690
flops and going,
wow,
Vegas is dead.
It isn't.

1190
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:45.440
You just don't know where to look.
First of all,

1191
01:18:45.441 --> 01:18:50.120
you ever see those pretty girls play in slots,
you know and you're like,

1192
01:18:50.121 --> 01:18:54.950
why is that?
Pretty girl all by herself playing slots.

1193
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.150
How come she doesn't have a boyfriend?
That's because she's a hooker,
sir.

1194
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:02.510
You want to have your crazy fucking day.

1195
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:05.930
You go right there that you like me.
First Time we went to Vegas,

1196
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.340
I thought a hooker was,
you know,
standing on a street corner snapping her gum.

1197
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:16.460
Hey,
like that was a hooker.
All right.
But no,
they,
they,

1198
01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:19.700
they're not supposed to be in the casino,
but they look the other way.
All right.

1199
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:24.260
And I was actually at a bar one time and Jimmy Dore told an arm sitting there

1200
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:26.960
hitting on this girl.
And Bill Jimmy finally came up and goes,
Bill,

1201
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:30.680
what the fuck are you doing?
And I was like,
what?
This girl's hot.
He goes,
dude,

1202
01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:35.150
you're hitting on a hooker.
And I was like,
she's a hooker.
And he goes,
yes.

1203
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:39.770
And then all of a sudden it was like the Matrix.
I could see it.
And then I went,

1204
01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:44.090
oh,
she's a hooker.
There's a hooker,
there's a regular girl,

1205
01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:47.060
regular girl hooker.
And you all of a sudden you can fucking see it.

1206
01:19:47.061 --> 01:19:51.470
Your problem is you don't know how to see it yet,
but it this way.

1207
01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:54.650
I just did a road gig with somebody and he told me a story.
He went to Vegas,

1208
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:58.460
he won nine grand,
walked up to one of those girls,
said,
hey,
come here.

1209
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.580
And she stopped playing slots,
walked right over to him.
He goes,

1210
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:06.530
I want another girl like you,
uh,
to suck my dick.

1211
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:08.970
Come up to room a whatever,
10 52.

1212
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:12.750
And they did and they came up there and they were gorgeous and they sucked his

1213
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:17.100
dick and he came on their face any one nine grand that night.
So there you go.

1214
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:21.180
It is a crazy,
awesome fucking place where shit can happen if you indulge.

1215
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.620
All right,
if you stand back like a fucking,
you know,

1216
01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:28.740
just shitting all over the place.
The,
yeah,

1217
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:32.820
you're not going to have a good fucking time.
It is cheesy.
It is awful.
Um,

1218
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:35.130
there are a bunch of,
you know,
they got malls there now.

1219
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.910
They try to appeal the families.
All of that shit definitely goes on that,

1220
01:20:38.911 --> 01:20:42.450
but believe me.
All right.
I mean,

1221
01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:46.170
I don't think you can go to Fox woods and just go,
hey,
you and you,
I mean,

1222
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.350
I'd give them,
probably do it,
but they're going to be old ladies.
Um,

1223
01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:53.370
and even there,
I'm sure they have their hookers.
All right,
but of course they do.

1224
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.840
But I'm telling you,
go there next time you go there.
All right.

1225
01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:01.770
Just look for those pretty girls playing slots

1226
01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.690
and you will have an,
all of a sudden Vegas will become,
they just can't show.

1227
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.540
They can't show that in the commercial.

1228
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:16.230
You know what was that Fox?

1229
01:21:16.231 --> 01:21:21.231
The Fox was on that too bad baby does suck my fucking Dick.

1230
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:24.150
You remember that corner?
I forget how it goes.

1231
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:27.840
That whole thing about being at Foxwoods,
like it's this crazy thing.

1232
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:31.590
You can't show somebody when nine,
you can show that then winning nine grand,

1233
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.840
but you can't show that other part where he goes,
hey,

1234
01:21:33.841 --> 01:21:37.560
you find another one just like you who's dad didn't stick around.

1235
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:39.870
So now you suck Dick for living.
Get another one of those.

1236
01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:44.370
Come back to my room and then end the commercial.
Bang.
Boom,
Sao was,

1237
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:47.700
he fucking comes on their faces.
Okay.
You're supposed to read between the lines.

1238
01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:48.721
All right.

1239
01:21:48.721 --> 01:21:52.620
So when I would do is I would stop going to Vegas with the fucking nerds that

1240
01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.160
you go into Vegas with.
You know,
I mean you're,
you're going to Vegas,
dude.

1241
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.710
You're trying to solve the transportation problem.

1242
01:21:58.711 --> 01:22:02.550
You're talking about the highways.
You're not looking at the right shit,

1243
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:08.490
you know?
Yes.
Frank and dean are not going to be dealing poke.
Yeah,

1244
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:12.390
they're dead.
They're dead.
Okay.
Yes.
Move on.

1245
01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.170
Ashton Kutcher's going to be their dress like James Bond taking.

1246
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.700
I fucking hate those commercials.
I envy that guy's career.
You know,

1247
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.580
I really envy that guy's career.
He's smart,
son of a bitch.

1248
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:26.700
Most people do a hit fucking sitcoms and then that's it.

1249
01:22:26.701 --> 01:22:28.620
He got into producing very smart guy.

1250
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.220
But I hate those fucking commercials with him sitting there with the stupid

1251
01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:37.050
cameras and everybody's just enameled with him.
Look at the guy with the camera.

1252
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.700
Wait,
we all have cameras and one in our phone.
This really isn't that exciting.

1253
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:47.190
Um,
so there you go.
Serve.
I know I trashed you,
but go to Vegas again.
Okay.

1254
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.710
Fucking pony up the fucking 70 bucks and fly out there on southwest.

1255
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:57.990
Go down to the strip.
Okay,
gamble.

1256
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.120
Hopefully you win.
If you don't,
you know,

1257
01:23:00.121 --> 01:23:04.530
even if you don't just save a little money and have a cup of girls blow you cum

1258
01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:06.370
on their face,
I'm guaranteeing you,

1259
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:10.000
you're going to go home with a smile even if you have to sit in that traffic on

1260
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.190
the 15.
Hey listen,

1261
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.400
I know there's a lot of people listen to this podcast and went to Vegas.

1262
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:17.860
I want to hear some stories and don't make them up.
All right?

1263
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:21.420
I want to hear some actual goddamn stories.
Okay?

1264
01:23:21.421 --> 01:23:24.300
And I'll see through the bullshit ones.
Unless you're a really good storyteller.

1265
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:28.220
Okay?
Because the truth is in the details.
Uh,

1266
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:31.360
look at me talking shit like fucking Rex Ryan.
Oh wait a minute.

1267
01:23:31.361 --> 01:23:36.170
Did the jets lose again this week?
Oh isn't that funny?
Isn't that funny?

1268
01:23:36.171 --> 01:23:39.510
It's almost like exactly what I said was gonna happen.
Fucking happened.

1269
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:42.330
You know.
And I know a lot of you guys,

1270
01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:44.250
you probably can't remember cause you know,
you know,

1271
01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:45.900
nobody can remember shit in this country.

1272
01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:49.880
Like I used to do a bit about that Geico Lizard.
Oh,

1273
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.110
you know everybody loves that fucking thing.

1274
01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:55.380
And I just look at that thing like that thing has no credibility whatsoever.

1275
01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.400
When those commercials started out,
he's like,
no,
I'm a Gecko.

1276
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:03.970
All right,
get away from me.
Fuck you and your insurance company.

1277
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:06.280
Then all of a sudden he like fucking sold out.

1278
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:08.650
Now he sells the insurance and no one calls him on the bullshit.

1279
01:24:09.150 --> 01:24:14.060
Well this is my fucking a Geico Gecko lizard moment.
Here's Rex Ryan.

1280
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:18.760
I play two clips.
This is rex Ryan on hard knocks back in August.

1281
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:21.190
Let's hear what he has to say about his football team,

1282
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:24.600
which started my hatred of the fucking jets.
Here we go,
everybody.

1283
01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:26.610
Let's turn up the volume.
Here we go.

1284
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.070
<v 11>If we play</v>

1285
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:34.600
this fucking league playing at their best.

1286
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:38.980
So who's it on?
Whose shoulders as involved?

1287
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:41.040
<v 10>There you go.
Could you hear that?
Sorry.</v>

1288
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:44.780
How did I just fucked with the volume here?
Ready to crank that up.
All right.

1289
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:47.900
That's what he said.
We were beat every team.
We play it up.
Beds.

1290
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:50.600
We could beat every fucking team and his fucking league.

1291
01:24:50.601 --> 01:24:54.200
You know the usual bullshit.
Okay.
For those of you who forgot,
all right,

1292
01:24:54.201 --> 01:24:58.480
now here's him yesterday when they backed into the fucking playoffs like they

1293
01:24:58.481 --> 01:25:00.040
did last year.
Here we go.

1294
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:17.230
You fucking,
yeah.
What happened?
Rex fucking dope.

1295
01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.030
I swear to God was was I was.

1296
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:25.450
There's no reason for me to even bring it up,
but I have to bring it up.
Okay.

1297
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:29.080
That's the second major thing that I was right about in football this year.

1298
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:31.420
And as much as you fucking hate to admit it,
you know I'm right.

1299
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:33.520
I told you Peyton manning was fucking overrated.

1300
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.370
I told you he was a regular season statistical juggernaut.

1301
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:40.870
He threw a pick six to lose the fucking super bowl and he has yet to get shit

1302
01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:43.990
for it yet to get shit for it.

1303
01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:48.480
It's fucking volume is way too high.
I'm sorry,
let me bring this down here.

1304
01:25:48.481 --> 01:25:53.350
He is yet to get shit for it.
All right,
and I told you I don't,

1305
01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:55.360
I didn't understand what the jets were talking about.

1306
01:25:55.390 --> 01:26:00.070
I didn't understand why they felt like they were the shit.
You know,

1307
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:04.790
was it last year that they made the playoffs because the sat half their fucking

1308
01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:08.300
team wasn't it wasn't it?
That wasn't last year,

1309
01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:09.830
isn't that how they got into the fucking playoffs?

1310
01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:12.620
Then this year they come and just talk and all this shit and I look,

1311
01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:16.220
I'm not saying that they couldn't go on any team in the NFL at this point.

1312
01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:17.780
If you get hot in the end of December,

1313
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:20.720
you can actually go on a run and when the fucking super bowl like the giant

1314
01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:25.160
stick.
All right,
that's another fucking hilarious thing.

1315
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:29.060
The giants losing again this week and now they're questioning whether Tom

1316
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.920
Kauflin is worthy to coach that team.

1317
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:35.300
That team that Amir two fucking years ago or three years ago beat an undefeated

1318
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:39.230
team.
14 point underdogs.
What did it,

1319
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.490
did the game suddenly pass Tom Kauflin by at two and a half fucking years.

1320
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.720
New York.
This is a difference between New York and Boston.

1321
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.750
Boston Jay is completely 100% negative and they'll give you a little bit of

1322
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:57.200
positive in the second they see negative,
they'd like the curses back.

1323
01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.480
They're awful that way.
But New York,

1324
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.800
they kind of do the ESPN thing where they hype shit through the roof

1325
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.940
and say this is going to be the greatest fucking thing ever.

1326
01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:11.880
And then when it doesn't happen,
then they go the exact opposite way.
And then,

1327
01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.930
then,
and then just somebody is the worst fucking thing that ever happened to the

1328
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.730
Goddamn sport.
And that's why mediocre guys like Mark Sanchez,

1329
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.060
who never really did anything in fucking college foot.
What did he do?

1330
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:26.180
He won the fucking Rosebowl with that team that had won the national

1331
01:27:26.181 --> 01:27:29.090
championship.
I know there's a turnover of players,
but give me a break.

1332
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.740
Matt Lionheart did more than that fucking guy and he's not even in football

1333
01:27:33.741 --> 01:27:37.850
anymore.
I think he's playing in like the fucking CFF CFL.
Right.

1334
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:42.980
So there you go.
People,
but I will tell you this,
I uh,

1335
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:45.650
I do back Rex Ryan on his foot fetish video.

1336
01:27:45.651 --> 01:27:48.530
I don't think there's anything fucking wrong with that.
He's got a foot fetish.

1337
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.510
He made a video.
I totally agree with him.
It is a private matter and uh,
you know,

1338
01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:55.670
the guy loves his wife.
That's what I got out of it.

1339
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.870
I didn't think he was a Weirdo.

1340
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:01.010
I think that was just one of those classic fucking examples of every yet buddy

1341
01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:05.570
out there throwing sticks and stones and all this fucking shit when we all have

1342
01:28:05.571 --> 01:28:07.970
these skeletons in our,
in our closet.
Huh?

1343
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.640
Does anybody else want to turn over their fucking hard drive,

1344
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:14.870
their computer hard drive and let the FBI go through it and look at all the

1345
01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:17.810
fucked up shit that you've looked at on the internet?
Give me a fucking break.

1346
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.160
I'm a freak just like him.
I'm not into feet.
You know,

1347
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:25.160
some of the horrific shit that I've looked at on the Internet,

1348
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.940
I'm going to fucking judge this guy.
Then the end they,
he kissed,
kept going.

1349
01:28:28.941 --> 01:28:30.800
It's a personal matter.
I'm not going to talk about it.

1350
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.440
You're gonna ask me 16 ways to Sunday.
It's a personal matter.
And I was like,

1351
01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.460
yeah,
that's exactly right,
rex.
It's exactly fucking right.

1352
01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.880
It's your own fucking life.
It's a personal matter.
I'm not talking about it.

1353
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.730
Go fuck yourselves.
I don't give a shit that it's on the Internet.

1354
01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:46.070
It's none of your goddamn business.
Watch the video if you want.

1355
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:49.880
I don't give a fuck.
Then they go,
can you please talk about your wife?

1356
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:53.420
And he goes,
yeah,
what can I say?
I've been with him for 23 years.
I love her.

1357
01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:56.420
She's awesome.
I was like,
you know what?
This guy's a great dude.

1358
01:28:56.421 --> 01:28:59.240
And I realized that I was wrong saying that he was going to make an attempt on

1359
01:28:59.241 --> 01:29:01.380
his life one day because he has,

1360
01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:03.270
because he has a great woman in his life and that's,

1361
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:07.020
that's what's holding that man together.
And uh,
told you,

1362
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:12.420
told you once,
psycho can spot another psycho from across the room.

1363
01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.960
So God bless Rex Ryan and his fucking foot fetish.

1364
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:21.150
23 years.
He still fucking got the hots for his wife.

1365
01:29:21.450 --> 01:29:25.860
Make it freaky videos about that.
That was the shit gave me hope.

1366
01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.770
That's what it did.
It gave me hope.
I don't think that guy's a freak at all.

1367
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:33.060
And that's like that tiger woods shit.
And everybody sat there judging him.

1368
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.670
P people are full of shit.
You know,

1369
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:38.640
just listen to that quiet voice in the back of your head that's calling you a

1370
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:43.350
hypocrite.
When?
When you're at the dinner party trash and tiger woods,
you know,

1371
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.060
when you think of some of the shit that you've,

1372
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:49.230
you know that you rubbed one out to your wife's sister.
Huh?

1373
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:52.530
What if that ever got,
I wonder if there was fucking video of that.

1374
01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:56.910
You fucking cheap fucking rubber went out to your wife's fucking sister and we

1375
01:29:56.911 --> 01:30:00.570
could see the fucking video that's playing in your goddamn head.
Really.

1376
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:02.460
You're going to judge this guy cause he's into feet.

1377
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:04.650
I don't judge him for that Shit.

1378
01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:08.770
I do judge them for being a shit talking jackass who sounds like one of my more

1379
01:30:08.771 --> 01:30:11.940
on buddies that have fucking sports bar.
I will trash him for that.

1380
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.570
So with that,
who do you guys think is going to win the Superbowl?

1381
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:20.070
Because I for one have no fucking idea.
I have no faith in my team.

1382
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:24.150
I don't even know who they are already more.
They'll let my patriots,

1383
01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.090
they're like a drug addict,
you know,

1384
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:31.020
are they clean?
Are they cleaned this week?
And they're going to play,

1385
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:35.430
they're going to play fucking defense.
Are they?
They just gonna uh,
I dunno.

1386
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.290
I Dunno.
And I don't like that,

1387
01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.620
that we basically should have lost to the fucking packers.
Uh,

1388
01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.910
but Aaron Rodgers was out and even then,
we still should have fucking lost,

1389
01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:49.050
but they didn't manage the clock.
Right.
And,
uh,
you know,

1390
01:30:49.051 --> 01:30:51.960
we lost to the jets once.
Jets could come in and beat us.

1391
01:30:51.961 --> 01:30:54.540
They could still come in and beat us in our own fucking place.
I mean,

1392
01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:56.610
that's still kind of way football is right now.
So,

1393
01:30:56.850 --> 01:31:00.840
which is why I don't understand the whole rex Ryan shit-talking that's what it

1394
01:31:00.841 --> 01:31:05.130
was about.
So there you go.
Let's see.
Let's move on to something else here.

1395
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.050
Let's go with advice.
Uh,
Bill.
Hey,

1396
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:10.680
I just want to write you and say I got let it go for Christmas.

1397
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.350
Um,
I really needed it to,
my girlfriend dumped me on Christmas Eve.

1398
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.160
Uh,
so you know,
my Christmas suck,

1399
01:31:20.161 --> 01:31:22.560
but your DVD really helped me out a lot last night.

1400
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:27.390
I know what you say about breakups,
six weeks of pain and then it gets easier.

1401
01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:31.350
I said we were together for nine months and out of the blue on Christmas Eve,

1402
01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:34.260
she called me up and said she needed time for herself and her daughter.

1403
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.370
That makes it tough too.
I got really close to her kid.
Here's my question.

1404
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:42.630
What's the worst breakup you've ever had?
And have you ever,

1405
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.150
have you ever been dumped over the holidays?
All right.

1406
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:49.050
There's a number of things going on here,
sir.
First of all,
uh,

1407
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:53.130
that's a real honest move on her part.
You know,

1408
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.180
that whole fucking thing where you just go through a Christmas cause you don't

1409
01:31:57.181 --> 01:32:00.430
want to hurt somebody's feelings.
You know,
it's,

1410
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.900
there's no good time for a break if she just could not go through the phoniness

1411
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.990
of celebrating Christmas with you when she knew she was going to fucking drop,

1412
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:10.900
the other shoe of that fucking expression goes.

1413
01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:14.800
So I gotta give her props for being fucking honest.
But,
uh,

1414
01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.480
and then also do you know you can do better than hooking up with some chick who

1415
01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:20.620
already has a kid?
And I hate to be mean.

1416
01:32:20.621 --> 01:32:23.680
I'm not trying to trash women out there who have fucking kids and they're single

1417
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.350
and that type of shit,
but I'm trying to give this guy something positive,

1418
01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:31.030
all right?
You know,
it's like,
yeah,

1419
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.640
you got it.
You got it down to just six weeks.
It's going to suck.

1420
01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.920
This is what you want to do.
Just go to the gym,

1421
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:39.760
go to the fucking shit.
This is what women do.

1422
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:41.650
Women fucking cry it out with their friends.

1423
01:32:41.651 --> 01:32:45.160
They get out of this system and then they go to the fucking gym and the next

1424
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:47.440
time you run into them,
they want you to have that moment.

1425
01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:50.290
Why the fuck did I dump you when guys,
we never do that.
What do we do?

1426
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:51.880
We get fucking drunk,

1427
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:57.120
get a big fat fucking John Travolta head and then go out and try to bang some

1428
01:32:57.251 --> 01:33:00.880
skank at three in the morning.
Don't do that to yourself,
all right?

1429
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:04.240
Just know it's going to hurt and fucking,
you know,

1430
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:10.110
go spoon with your pillow and cry it out and then go to the fucking gym.

1431
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:14.770
Put on some music that's gonna motivate you.
Go see that movie the fighter.

1432
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.050
All right,
go get fucking motivated.
W do that shit.
And then,
uh,

1433
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:23.770
then just go out and just start hitting on chicks that are completely way out of

1434
01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:28.570
your fucking leak.
And uh,
you know,
just go talk some shit.

1435
01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.501
And then he got the out.

1436
01:33:29.501 --> 01:33:33.520
I'm not ready to be in a relationship I got broken up with on Christmas fucking

1437
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:36.970
eve.
I'm not even trying to talk to women.
You do that.

1438
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:40.630
You fucking do the reverse sell you packing up,

1439
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:43.780
they're walking towards your deck.
That's how you do it.
You know,

1440
01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:47.350
you'll get a sympathy blow job or something.
Just open your fucking mouth.

1441
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:52.180
Don't be negative.
Keep them fucking laugh and spin a couple of plates.

1442
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:54.480
Something will happen for your next thing.
You know,
it'd be like,
Wow,
dad,

1443
01:33:54.481 --> 01:33:57.880
that I almost get involved with the fuck [inaudible] was thinking about getting

1444
01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.580
married to some woman already had a fucking kid.
You know,

1445
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.860
who's never really going to consider you her dad.

1446
01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.640
It's gonna have a bunch of issues and a dad's not going to be around when,

1447
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:11.230
when her daughter goes through her her slot years cause she's trying to find

1448
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:14.110
another father figure.
You don't want to be around for that shit.
You did.

1449
01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:16.540
All right.
So anyways,
he said,
here's my question.

1450
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:21.700
What's the worst breakup you've ever had and have you ever been dumped over the

1451
01:34:21.701 --> 01:34:26.470
holidays?
Uh,
worst breakup I ever had was I

1452
01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.300
broke up with this girl who then ended up stalking me.

1453
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:36.880
She told me she was pregnant.
Uh,

1454
01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.900
I believed her.

1455
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.250
I got back into her life and then obviously I've realized,
you know,

1456
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.960
when she was never showing that she wasn't pregnant.
Yeah,

1457
01:34:46.961 --> 01:34:47.711
I had one of those,

1458
01:34:47.711 --> 01:34:52.711
just a complete fucking psycho stocked me at my day job and all that.

1459
01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:55.270
She was a fucking nightmare.
Um,

1460
01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.120
had one those and have ever been dumped over the holidays.
No,
I haven't.

1461
01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:03.350
I've mainly been the person,
uh,

1462
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:08.330
that's dumped people.
But I did get dumped,
uh,
the fuck did I get dumped?

1463
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:13.130
It was in a September.
Yeah,
it was September.

1464
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:19.010
September.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1465
01:35:19.011 --> 01:35:21.830
And it was,
it sucked.
It was fucking brutal.
And I did the dumb shit.

1466
01:35:21.831 --> 01:35:26.810
I went out and I drank and um,
I didn't that that's,

1467
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:30.320
you know,
something that's the basis of my advice that I give you guys when you,

1468
01:35:30.321 --> 01:35:34.190
men or women when you go through a breakup is just

1469
01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:40.610
allow yourself to know that it's gonna suck.
Yes.
It's going to suck.
Yes.

1470
01:35:40.611 --> 01:35:43.900
You're going to come home with the phone isn't going to ring and you're going to

1471
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:46.250
be sitting there trying to put the pieces back together going,

1472
01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:50.360
what the fuck did I used to do with all this extra time and

1473
01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:57.410
just go through that is the best thing that I can tell you in fucking embrace it

1474
01:35:57.411 --> 01:36:00.560
and just know it's going to hurt.
And uh,

1475
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.730
that's the best advice I can give you because I did not do that.

1476
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:06.950
The worst thing you want to do was go out,
start booze,

1477
01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:10.040
and try to bank somebody else and then go into a fucking rebound relationship.

1478
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.680
I did that a couple of times.
It's fucking brutal.

1479
01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:17.570
It's not what the fuck you want to do.
So,
uh,
I know we had a couple of questions.

1480
01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:19.620
Somebody I keep getting questions about on the open.

1481
01:36:19.621 --> 01:36:24.010
Anthony show a Patrice O'Neal and uh,
Kevin Hart talked about this,

1482
01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:28.820
this trashing that I took and uh,
it was a long fucking time ago.

1483
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:33.320
I haven't listened to the audio yet.
Uh,
just look it up on Youtube.

1484
01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:36.950
I'm sure they have the audio up,
uh,

1485
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:41.900
without even listening to the audio.
Whatever they said is more than truth.

1486
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:46.280
It was an epic 50 fucking minutes trashing that I took.

1487
01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.010
Um,
what the fuck was the story SD at the comedy cellar.

1488
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:54.790
All right,
how do I call it?
What do I start this?

1489
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.800
The Yankees were playing the Braves in the fucking world series and I guess it

1490
01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:03.740
was these groups of people from Atlanta wanted to,
uh,

1491
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:05.810
we're going to take this right.

1492
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:10.811
They've taken two buses to Yankee stadium to go to the game and they wanted a

1493
01:37:11.181 --> 01:37:16.181
comedian to perform on the bus on the way to the stadium.

1494
01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:20.210
All right.
Which obviously is the most nightmare gig ever.

1495
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.840
They were going to pay like 500 bucks and give you a world series ticket.

1496
01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.733
All right,

1497
01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:29.250
so the Gig was offered to me like she was like,

1498
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:31.010
who's the two biggest sports fans?
I know we're down here.

1499
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.330
So she offered in and actually don't have enough money in the bank where will

1500
01:37:35.331 --> 01:37:36.740
actually consider doing this.

1501
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:40.760
So she approached me and Jim Norton about the Gig.

1502
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:43.610
So me and Norton are just talking about it going through,

1503
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:45.200
this is going to be the worst fucking Gig ever,

1504
01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:47.630
but you get to go to the world series and we were both thinking about it.

1505
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:52.310
So the next day over 24 hours,
Norton find just goes,
fuck that.
I'm not doing it.

1506
01:37:52.311 --> 01:37:56.640
So I was going to do it.
I was like,
fuck it.

1507
01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.580
It's not going to be that bad a gig.
That's the thing about it.

1508
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:01.200
It wouldn't have been that bad a gig.

1509
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:06.740
I basically was going to get paid to go to a world series game and to get paid

1510
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.540
to do what the fuck I was going to do anyways,

1511
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:13.080
which is trashed the Yankees all the way up to Yankee stadium.

1512
01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:17.520
That's the only part about the story that's bullshit is them talking about what

1513
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:18.990
a horrific gig it would've been.

1514
01:38:18.991 --> 01:38:23.280
It would've been a fucking cake walk compared to those college gigs I did where

1515
01:38:23.281 --> 01:38:26.250
they didn't have a fucking microphone and they stand you in a hallway.

1516
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.590
It would be a bunch of drunk fans,

1517
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:31.680
excited to see their team that didn't have a shot in fucking hell.

1518
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.513
A beat in the Yankees.

1519
01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:37.380
And all I was going to do is tell them what a fag Jeter was for fucking 30

1520
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:41.040
minutes,
a half hour fucking set would have been a joke.

1521
01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.160
All I would have to do is trust the Yankees the whole fucking way up.

1522
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.280
I get 500 bucks and I get a world series ticket and the second I get off,

1523
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:49.320
I can screw.
I can leave those guys.

1524
01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:53.400
I get to go to a world series game and fucking Yankee Stadium.
So I'm like,

1525
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:54.480
I'm going to fucking do it.
Right.

1526
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.810
So I didn't know that Jim had said that he wasn't going to do it.

1527
01:38:58.710 --> 01:39:02.310
So we're sitting down there at the table down at the cellar and it starting up,

1528
01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:06.210
everybody's giving each other shit.
So I start giving Norton Shit about whatever,

1529
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:10.980
about his chinless face,
uh,
his little ears or whatever,

1530
01:39:10.981 --> 01:39:13.470
fucking awful hooded sweatshirt that he was wearing.

1531
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:18.030
And then I got him with a couple of jabs and he felt the overhand right come in

1532
01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:19.800
and he needed to stop it and he just goes,

1533
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:24.360
whatever busboy and it was like ef Hutton,

1534
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:27.900
everybody fucking stopped and went,
what,

1535
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:32.400
why did you just call him busboy?
And I immediately was like,

1536
01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:33.660
he's going to do it too.

1537
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:38.090
And Somehow Jim got out of it and just,

1538
01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:41.100
he literally threw me under the bus and then they found out I was doing the Gig.

1539
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:45.870
And it just so happened that night that all the fucking,
the,

1540
01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:50.190
the big boys where there was Patrice Norton was there,

1541
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:53.910
Kevin Hart,
Rich Vos,
Keith Robinson,

1542
01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:59.910
right fucking there,
the Tyson Holyfield,
George Foreman,

1543
01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:04.860
all of that.
And I'm standing there like fucking a tex Cobb.

1544
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.750
And I took a 50 minute,
I took a headlining set,
killing,

1545
01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:14.400
standing ovation set of shit for doing that Gig.

1546
01:40:14.401 --> 01:40:15.510
And I was still going to do it.

1547
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.870
I was still gonna do it even after the fucking trash.

1548
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:20.610
And cause I'm thinking I'm going to the fucking world series.

1549
01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:22.680
I don't give a shit,
you know.

1550
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:26.760
And Patrice was trashing me and I didn't give a fuck what he said.

1551
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:32.030
His advice I never would've listened to because Patrice was one of the biggest

1552
01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:36.900
pussies when it came to performing hell gigs.

1553
01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:39.510
Like when we used to do colleges,
uh,

1554
01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:43.200
this guy used to book us on colleges and would be me,
him and Robert Kelly,

1555
01:40:43.201 --> 01:40:47.430
or meet him in Norton or whatever.
And this dude never wanted to go on first,

1556
01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:50.430
cause first sucks because you've got a warm up the crowd and he never wanted to

1557
01:40:50.431 --> 01:40:54.010
go on last because you had to follow the other two x.
He

1558
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.690
<v 3>always wanted to go on second,</v>

1559
01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:00.220
any a and then he'd go on second and he would go over his fucking time,

1560
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:04.300
like the selfish country.
And,
uh,
so I was just saying,
yeah,
you know this guy,

1561
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:05.440
this guy fucking a,

1562
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.780
this guy retires from comedy every two weeks when he sees a hack kill on stage.

1563
01:41:10.781 --> 01:41:12.370
I don't give a fuck what he thinks.
But it was,

1564
01:41:12.371 --> 01:41:16.960
it wasn't until the end when he actually looked at me when the trashing was over

1565
01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:21.280
and he said,
Bill,
he goes,
I will stand in front of that bus.

1566
01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:25.240
Don't do that Gig.
I'll buy you a ticket to the world series.
Don't do that.

1567
01:41:25.241 --> 01:41:28.960
And then I was sitting there going like,
wow,
this is actually like,

1568
01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:31.090
he's not even joking right now.

1569
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:36.091
He's trying to tell me for the love of God have a little bit of self fucking

1570
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:39.820
worth.
And he,
he shit.
That was the thing.

1571
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:44.850
After a 50 minute trashing isn't as embarrassing as that was,

1572
01:41:44.951 --> 01:41:47.110
nothing was worse than the shame of him

1573
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:51.670
telling me that I could actually afford a world series ticket.
At that point,

1574
01:41:51.671 --> 01:41:52.910
I wasn't really even thinking that.

1575
01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.550
So I decided I,
in that moment I decided not to do the Gig,

1576
01:42:00.551 --> 01:42:02.290
which I don't think came out on the opiate Anthony show.

1577
01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:04.480
They think I did the Gig.
I never did the Gig.

1578
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:10.020
And I actually passed it off to another comedian who was further down the ladder

1579
01:42:11.051 --> 01:42:14.890
than I was.
And uh,
he didn't even ask me,

1580
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:19.480
but I always made a promise that I would never say who did the Gig.
And uh,

1581
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:21.520
I don't know.
Next time I go on Opie and Anthony,

1582
01:42:21.521 --> 01:42:24.700
I'll talk to the dude who actually did the Gig and see if he wants to call in

1583
01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:28.390
and talk about the Gig.
But that's the only,
I haven't listened to the audio yet,

1584
01:42:28.391 --> 01:42:32.350
but whatever jokes that they said,
there was some classic ones.

1585
01:42:32.351 --> 01:42:35.470
I remember Patrice say,
well,
hey bill,
when they bring you up,

1586
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:39.820
are you going to come out of the bathroom or are you going to walk up up those

1587
01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:43.780
little stairs?
That,

1588
01:42:43.781 --> 01:42:46.630
and then also me finishing my second.
Oh.
And Hey,
thanks a lot.

1589
01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:51.040
And then I sit down in the bus seat and then look over my shoulder and shake

1590
01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:54.700
everybody's hands as they go to get off the bus.
Was I going to fucking hold the,

1591
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:59.080
uh,
you know,
the bus intercom thing?
What I do it over that Yada,
Yada,

1592
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:03.040
all that and fit and this will kill me.
They had jokes for 50 fucking minutes.

1593
01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:05.080
All that was true,
but I never did the Gig.

1594
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.160
I never did the Gig and uh,
and I still maintain,

1595
01:43:09.161 --> 01:43:12.070
it wouldn't have been that bad of a fucking Gig.
It wouldn't have been.

1596
01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.290
What have been a joke bill?

1597
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.050
Get on a bus for a half an hour and trashed the Yankees.

1598
01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:20.350
Do you think he can do that?
We'll give you 500 bucks in a world series ticket.

1599
01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:24.940
Absolutely.
I would've been drinking with them at any time.

1600
01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.480
I ran out of shit to talk about the Yankees.
He just look out the bus,
hey,

1601
01:43:28.481 --> 01:43:31.660
look at the tits on that fucking whore and they'd all go nuts.

1602
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:35.800
All I had to do is support the south in the civil war.

1603
01:43:35.801 --> 01:43:37.740
There was so many different ways that I could've done that.

1604
01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:41.290
It would've been a fucking cake walk,
a fucking cake walk,

1605
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.200
and I didn't end up doing it.
I didn't end up doing it,

1606
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:48.460
which actually was better because the first time I went to a world series ended

1607
01:43:48.461 --> 01:43:52.430
up being,
uh,
I went to game two with a 2004,

1608
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:56.690
<v 10>that boring ass world series.
But it exciting cause we finally won it.</v>

1609
01:43:56.691 --> 01:44:00.020
So there you go.
So that,
that is the story.
Yes,
they trashed the shit out of me,

1610
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:01.670
but I never did the Gig.

1611
01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.760
I was shamed out of doing it and I gave it to another convenient who will remain

1612
01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:08.870
nameless.
Actually,
you know what,
here,
let me,

1613
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:11.360
let me do a little cross promotion here.
Uh,

1614
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:15.410
I will reveal the name the next time I do the opiate Anthony show.

1615
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:18.290
If they still give a fuck,
if they still give a shit,

1616
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:22.460
if the story has legs as they say in the business.
So a,
so there you go.

1617
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:24.850
There's that fucking story.
Alright.

1618
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.810
And I'll try to remember the name of this podcast in case he gets somebody.

1619
01:44:28.150 --> 01:44:31.700
A couple more questions about it and I'll just say refer to the podcast on

1620
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:35.240
December 27th.
Um,
all right,
you two videos of the week.

1621
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:40.250
Um,
these are all going to be on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1622
01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.920
You can watch all of these.
The so called white man,

1623
01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:45.350
somebody sent a great video of somebody.

1624
01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:48.110
The dude didn't have a microphone but he was,

1625
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:51.680
he was talking about all how the white man,
you know,

1626
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:55.940
is fucking with everybody the way he twisted up religion and all that shit,

1627
01:44:55.941 --> 01:45:00.020
which is totally true.
But in the end he goes,
cause God is actually a black man.

1628
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.920
So basically it's like everything that white people just did.

1629
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:06.410
I am now going to do from my perspective,

1630
01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:10.670
which is the one thing that I've learned when I being on the road that everybody

1631
01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:13.190
is the same and it includes the bad shit.

1632
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.280
You know,
that liberal thought that,
you know,
everybody has to say,

1633
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:24.170
but it's only good shit.
Everybody has the ability to be a scientist,

1634
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:29.210
to be a doctor.
You know,
a fucking teacher.
Everybody has.
Yes,

1635
01:45:29.211 --> 01:45:30.044
yes they do.

1636
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:35.140
And they also have the ability to be a fucking CEO at Enron to be a rapist and

1637
01:45:37.281 --> 01:45:39.710
to be a fucking serial killer and all the bad shit.

1638
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:44.780
Everything to be a war criminal,
a fucking dictator,
everybody that is not,

1639
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:50.050
that is not an exclusively white thing because white people get blamed for evil.

1640
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.730
Like where the only evil ones in the planet,
we are not,

1641
01:45:52.731 --> 01:45:56.930
we are just the best at it.
We are the Michael Jordans of evil.
Everybody,

1642
01:45:59.090 --> 01:46:03.380
I challenge your race to top my race with the evilness,
but you've got it in you.

1643
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:06.260
You got to know that.
All right?

1644
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.910
You got to know that you have it in you the same way you have it in you to be a

1645
01:46:10.911 --> 01:46:15.680
doctor or a lawyer or a teacher.
You also have it in you to be a,

1646
01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:20.060
a complete fucking sociopath.
Uh,
so there's,
there's,
there's my fucking 2 cents.

1647
01:46:20.061 --> 01:46:24.950
All right.
Clumsy report or knocks down,
uh,
I don't know how to say Jenga Tower.

1648
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.880
And he wanted this leaning tower of Piza.
Um,

1649
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:35.060
Fva tow rope fail to somebody towing their friend's car down the street with a

1650
01:46:35.061 --> 01:46:38.000
rope and it doesn't go that well.
Merry Christmas bitch.

1651
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.300
Need I say more Harvard sailing team.

1652
01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:46.660
Boys will be girls and on from funny or die drunk history.

1653
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:52.620
And I think that's it.
I think that's it for the podcast.

1654
01:46:52.621 --> 01:46:55.990
This has been a very long one.
I Gift Card really quick.
Let me read this.
Uh,

1655
01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.340
Gift Card Dude.
What is your deal with gift certificates?

1656
01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:02.100
This guy right here is the exact reason why I don't like gift certificates.

1657
01:47:02.101 --> 01:47:05.820
Would you rather get some shitty sweater or boxer briefs from your aunt or

1658
01:47:05.821 --> 01:47:09.870
brother in law or a gift certificate from Amazon or best buy where you could buy

1659
01:47:09.871 --> 01:47:12.360
something you actually like,
Hey,
fuck head.

1660
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:17.340
Why don't you not go out and buy a shitty sweater?
A boxer briefs.
See you.

1661
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:20.340
Uncreative comment.
Maybe you should give out a gift card.

1662
01:47:20.341 --> 01:47:22.140
That's why I don't like it.
Because you know,

1663
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.890
it's like you're out there and you buy somebody a great fucking gift and then

1664
01:47:25.891 --> 01:47:30.360
they go,
hey,
you go shop for yourself.
Fuck face.
It's lazy.
That's why.

1665
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:32.850
That's why I don't fucking like it.
I don't mind it if I get,

1666
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:34.740
if we both agree to get each other gift certificates,

1667
01:47:34.741 --> 01:47:37.920
I don't mind that when I'm out there actually trying to buy you a fucking cool

1668
01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:41.610
as gift and you come up with that,
you just write me a check.
You know,

1669
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:45.360
like I'm some drunk whore going to say your fucking son raped somebody and

1670
01:47:45.361 --> 01:47:48.090
you're running for Senate and you need the problem to go away.

1671
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.560
That's why I don't like it.
So go fuck yourself.
I'm all right.
Revenge.

1672
01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:56.460
I got to read this quickly here.
Um,
which is gonna cause all kinds of problems.

1673
01:47:58.590 --> 01:48:01.440
Uh,
all right.
I went to a local junior college,
uh,
wait a second,

1674
01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:02.940
I jumped in too far.
Uh,

1675
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:06.390
this may be a more of a story of lashing out then revenge.

1676
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:09.930
I actually think this is a story of revenge and I like this story because this

1677
01:48:09.931 --> 01:48:14.370
is eyeballed eyeball even though it was a little off Samuelson here.
Uh,

1678
01:48:14.371 --> 01:48:18.390
my senior year I dated a beautiful underclassmen.
She was my first love in,

1679
01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.110
firstly,

1680
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:23.520
we dated through the summer after graduation I went on to a local junior

1681
01:48:23.521 --> 01:48:25.980
college.
Uh,
the next year,

1682
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.760
Jesus Christ shop class guy right here.
All right.
Uh,

1683
01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.880
we were still dating when school started up the next year.

1684
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.910
I had a lot of friends that were still in high school and one of my best friends

1685
01:48:35.911 --> 01:48:39.780
told me that he started seeing my girlfriend hanging out at school with another

1686
01:48:39.781 --> 01:48:42.810
good friend of mine.
Uh,

1687
01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:47.070
my girlfriend was acting shady so I knew something was up.
Um,

1688
01:48:47.071 --> 01:48:48.780
for years during the football season,

1689
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:52.590
a big group of guys would get together on Sundays and play a game of tackle

1690
01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:53.750
football.
Uh,

1691
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.240
this guy who was seen with my girlfriend was among the guys that showed up to

1692
01:48:57.241 --> 01:49:01.730
play with me.
Dot.
To play with the,
uh,
everybody,
me and this guy,
this other guy,

1693
01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.990
you name it all names.
I'm trying to skip over the names here.

1694
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:06.780
Me and this other guy would normally play Qb,

1695
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:10.680
so we would be the two to pick teams each week.
Um,

1696
01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:13.560
the quarterback on the other team was also a good friend of mine.

1697
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:17.490
The friend of mine,
Paul,
these fucking names here,

1698
01:49:17.491 --> 01:49:20.280
the friend of mine who was messing with my girl didn't know that.

1699
01:49:20.281 --> 01:49:24.540
I was aware that he and my girl had been flirting at school.
So I asked my buddy,

1700
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:29.220
the QB on the other team to pick this Douche who's messing with my girl and at

1701
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:34.210
some point during the game send them in on a hard five and in I,

1702
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.140
I don't know what that is that like a post pad,

1703
01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:38.400
I guess it's a crossing pattern and lead them high.

1704
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.610
He's basically going over the middle.
He's going to throw them,

1705
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.540
throw the ball high and just out of his reach,

1706
01:49:45.570 --> 01:49:48.550
leaving this guy completely exposed.
So anyways,

1707
01:49:48.551 --> 01:49:52.810
he goes a few plays into the game.
They come out of the huddle and my buddy,

1708
01:49:52.811 --> 01:49:56.920
the QB on the other team gives me a look.
He goes,

1709
01:49:56.921 --> 01:50:00.070
I called a two one two defense.
Jesus Christ,

1710
01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:04.180
this is like the most professional pickup football game ever.

1711
01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:06.130
So I bring in the nickel defense.

1712
01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:08.740
I had to call a time out because we had too many men on the field.

1713
01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.880
I call the two one two defense and took the short rides zone.

1714
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:17.680
The ball was snapped and this douche bag who's flirting with my girl came off

1715
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:22.600
the line,
took a hard left and in slow motion,
ran into my zone.

1716
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:27.820
I delay one or two seconds and begin the path to the collision.

1717
01:50:28.450 --> 01:50:33.190
My buddy let him perfect.
So he had to pick up a little speed to get to the ball,

1718
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:36.250
any extended,
both arms to the sky.

1719
01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:41.830
And of course he's looking back at the quarterback to Jesus Christ.

1720
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:46.360
The second the ball hit his hands,
I bury my shoulder into his stomach.

1721
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:51.660
I grabbed the back of his knees and I pull up and drive them into the ground.
And

1722
01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:56.890
now I can't define the word squelch,

1723
01:50:56.891 --> 01:51:01.750
but he definitely let out a sound that old that I can only describe as
squelched.

1724
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.790
Uh,
yeah,
it really that,

1725
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.270
that word makes it sound like you actually hit a really right melon,

1726
01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:10.990
the entire field or ruptured with a holy shit.

1727
01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:14.920
My little league coach would have given me two stars on my helmet for this

1728
01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:15.754
fucking hit.

1729
01:51:15.850 --> 01:51:20.080
I felt good about it for about three seconds and the room than the remorse set.

1730
01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:23.920
And I feel bad to this day for setting this guy up the way I did.

1731
01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:28.210
It took a few minutes for him to get up.
Uh,
but he was fine.

1732
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:31.900
I don't know about Karma,
but a few weeks later,
uh,

1733
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:36.901
this dude that he drilled into the ground was banging his ex girlfriend and I

1734
01:51:37.421 --> 01:51:40.750
met my rebound that I dated for the next five years.

1735
01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:45.460
She turned out to be the devil herself.
I might not believe in God,

1736
01:51:45.461 --> 01:51:46.294
but I've hooked up.

1737
01:51:46.330 --> 01:51:51.310
I've looked the devil in her evil eye as I shot a load into her evil cunt.

1738
01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:57.220
Jesus Christ.
Um,
I don't think Karma got you.
I think,
uh,

1739
01:51:57.250 --> 01:52:00.790
he was going to bang her no matter what.
And I think he got a nice shot in there.

1740
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:06.490
Um,
it was a little cheesy that you had your friends set them up,
but uh,

1741
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.800
but fuck him.
That's what he gets.
That's your girl.

1742
01:52:08.801 --> 01:52:11.450
He shouldn't have been doing that.
He was wrong.
You were right.
And,
uh,

1743
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:15.850
as far as Karma goes,
I view Karma is like,

1744
01:52:16.570 --> 01:52:19.540
uh,
what's that shit where you look at the stars to see if you're going to get a

1745
01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:23.110
chicken sandwich that day.
What do you call it?
Is it astrology?

1746
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:27.430
Astronomy is the study of stars.
Astrology.
Yeah.

1747
01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:32.320
Like I don't believe in astrology.
You know,
and anybody who does,

1748
01:52:32.350 --> 01:52:36.440
you go,
okay,
you believe in it.
I and you just go,
what's your sign?
And I,

1749
01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:40.090
and they tell you this sign and then read somebody else's horoscope.

1750
01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:43.460
If they're a Gemini,
read a Taurus and Gar.

1751
01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:46.130
And how does that pertain to your life?
The big,
okay.
It means

1752
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.030
<v 3>this,
this and this.
And Go.
Yeah,
see that was Taurus.
So there you go.</v>

1753
01:52:50.031 --> 01:52:53.840
You can fucking,
this is so vague.
You can attribute it to anything.

1754
01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:57.470
Something wonderful is going to happen today.

1755
01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.160
Just be careful you don't close it off or it won't happen.

1756
01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.980
So then if something wonderful doesn't happen,
you're then walk while I,

1757
01:53:04.981 --> 01:53:06.290
I must've been closed off.

1758
01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:09.530
I need to be more open and then they get off Scott free.
Right.

1759
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:14.090
I feel the same way about Karma.
Karma is something that if you,

1760
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:18.020
there's ups and downs in life.
Okay.
And if you just,

1761
01:53:18.021 --> 01:53:19.640
you're waiting for something bad to happen,

1762
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:22.760
something bad is going to fucking happen.
No matter how good you are,

1763
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:26.450
something bad's going to fucking happen.
You know,
buy brand new pair of sneakers,

1764
01:53:26.451 --> 01:53:29.990
someone's gonna step on them.
You know,
you're like,
well,
hey,
start a fucking,

1765
01:53:30.130 --> 01:53:34.700
I starve.
I sponsored a starving child.
I don't fuck around.
I'm a good guy.

1766
01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.870
Why did somebody step on my sneaker?
Because the world is full of cunts.

1767
01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:42.200
It's impossible not to run into him.
You know,

1768
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.980
I think Karma exists if you believe in it.
I think if you don't believe in Karma,

1769
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:50.060
like you never really,
you don't really have any bad shit happen to you.

1770
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:52.400
There you go.
That's what I think about comma.

1771
01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:56.210
I am an hour and 17 fucking minutes into this podcast.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1772
01:53:56.420 --> 01:54:00.500
I think it's time to,
uh,
to end the podcast here.
Uh,
I hope you enjoyed it.

1773
01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:04.730
Hope you guys all had a very merry Christmas,
a happy Kwanzaa,
happy Hanukkah.

1774
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:09.470
Or maybe it just said,
fuck it all and I'm going to take a few days off and,

1775
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:13.820
uh,
that is it.
That's the podcast.
Please,

Oh,

Well,

1776
01:54:13.821 --> 01:54:18.770

so go scalp a ticket.
I,
speaking of Jim Norton,

1777
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:21.110
the man who threw me under the bus,

1778
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:24.860
and it took them 10 years to make up for it,

1779
01:54:24.861 --> 01:54:26.750
actually made up for it when you put me on down and dirty.

1780
01:54:26.751 --> 01:54:31.040
And he hooked me up with OPN.
Anthony.
Um,
but let's say I don't count those,

1781
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:33.850
you know,
cause I'm into astrology.
Uh,

1782
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:38.810
he hooked me up again with this awesome Gig,
uh,

1783
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.950

I'm going to screw this up down in Atlantic city.

1784
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:46.550
And this year he was like,
you know what,
why should I take it all for myself?

1785
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:50.320
Why don't I share it with some friends?
And I'm doing a show at the,

1786

1787
01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.560
Fucking internet doesn't work on my bedroom,
whatever.

1788
01:54:57.561 --> 01:54:59.900
It's fucking sold out anyways,

1791
01:55:06.051 --> 01:55:08.870

1805
01:56:01.730 --> 01:56:06.720
and he starts talking about just all kinds of cool shit.
Favorite ballparks,

1806
01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:10.760
favorite restaurants.
If you're into sports performance enhancing drugs,

1807
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.950
Pete rose,
should he be in the hall of fame or not having entourages

1808
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:20.020
um,
team chemistry,
all the shit you want to tell.
And it's great.

1809
01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.020
It goes on for well over an hour and it's totally fucking entertaining.

1810
01:56:23.021 --> 01:56:26.290
Highly recommend that podcast keeps getting better every time I hear it.

1811
01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.780
And that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1812
01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:32.110
I'm going to be interviewing Nick Swardson,
uh,

1813
01:56:32.111 --> 01:56:35.860
this week for a very special podcast and I am also going to the rose bowl,

1814
01:56:35.861 --> 01:56:40.610
the granddaddy of them all on a new year's Day.

1815
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.740
And I am going to be stoned fucking sober this year.

1816
01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.530
I know you guys are all born right now cause you want to hear the happy drunk

1817
01:56:47.531 --> 01:56:51.760
stories where I'm sick of being a drunk on that day.
I would like to remember,

1818
01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:57.000
like I,
I went to a game and Sanchez played the USC Penn State.

1819
01:56:57.001 --> 01:56:59.520
I went to that game and I had never even heard of Sanchez.

1820
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:01.860
That's how drunk I was.
So the thing that I could have been alive,

1821
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.830
bullying that guy,
I would've made a different seat.

1822
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:09.030
They still fucking killed the,
uh,
they still kill Penn state.
All right,
whatever.

1823
01:57:09.031 --> 01:57:12.090
That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all of you.
Have a great week.

1824
01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:12.924
Don't take any

1825
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:14.010
<v 7>shed.
And I go fuck yourself.</v>

1826
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:41.980
