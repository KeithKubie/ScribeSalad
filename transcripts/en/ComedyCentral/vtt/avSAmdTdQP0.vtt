intervention or call the cops.

I'm sick of the break room
smelling like Arby's and tears.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.182
- Let's heal him through
the power of song, guys.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.350
For example.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.520

- I'm a star.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.830
I'm a big bright shining star.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.332
- Are those my ear muffs?

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.235
- You're just jealous I
got bigger tits than you.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.202
Burn!

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.871
- You just insulted you.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.739
- I'm so excited.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.007
I'm so excited.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.776
I'm so...

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.612
Scared.

- I don't think
I have a problem.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.938
- You're drinking right now.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.640
- You're drinking a diet coke!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Diet coke doesn't get me
kicked out of Planet Hollywood

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.644
for rubbing my face in the
Jack and Jill memorabilia.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.512
- It was a good movie!

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.581
- You gotta start going to AA.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Last time I went,
they made me play cards

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.186
and wear a cape, so.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.921
- Motherfucker, that wasn't AA,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.522
that was Dungeons and Dragons!

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
You blacked out,
barged into a Comic-Con

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
and spent 20 minutes trying
to finger a Somali girl

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.196
dressed as a wizard.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.597
- I'm not a perfect man,

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.099
but neither are you guys.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.402
Elmer's into erotic
space literature,

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.404
Lyle's really unlikable,

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.839
and Anita, you...

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.643
Uh, fat?

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.611
Ah!

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.513
- You fat as fuck.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.483 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm classically handsome
like Jarrod Deprado

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.951
or the Quaker Oats guy.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.919
- I wrote something
for the occasion.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.087
- Here we go.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.822
- Dear Richie,

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wake up in the
morning disappointed
in you, in my leader.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.297
Queen Babala approaches,
engaging me with her three

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.902
magnificent breasts, her
steaming vulva bubbles

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.937
like a bowl of beefaroni.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.173
- Elmer, no erotic space lit.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.075
- I guess I could stop.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.476
Okay.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.245
Okay, I quit.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.446
(clapping)

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.814
Always wanted to open up that

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.049
wild west themed
bed and breakfast.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.185
Maybe I can get it
off the ground now.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.653
Yeah!

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.523 align:start size:88% position:13%
Slow clap to real
clap, fuck you stepdad.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.058 align:start position:0%
- Now that you don't drink
you'll have time for other stuff

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start size:75% position:25%
like that--
- So much time!

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.762
We can hang out more as a gang.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.865 align:start size:94% position:6%
Take one of those bear
building classes together.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.800
Wouldn't that be
a fun, wacky time?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.469
All of us building bears?

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.539
How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound?

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.541
Wednesday at 10 AM?

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.677 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thursday, really any
time now that I'm sober.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
'Cause I'm not just
building bears,

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.115
I'm building friendships.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.285
You guys are dicks.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.724 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I liked your story, Elmer.
- Thanks.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wrote another
one where Chewbacca

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.162
asked Buffy to marry him.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.998 align:start size:84% position:16%
