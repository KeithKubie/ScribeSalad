this aspect of it which is you know the
 

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.240
this aspect of it which is you know the
concept of nudge would some of you like

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.250
concept of nudge would some of you like
 

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.670
concept of nudge would some of you like
to be nudged or have been nudged into

we teach the wrong kind of math to our
 

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.420
we teach the wrong kind of math to our
kids yeah oh you agree with that I mean

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.430
kids yeah oh you agree with that I mean
 

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.790
kids yeah oh you agree with that I mean
for example I mean if you want to nudge

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800
for example I mean if you want to nudge
 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.300
for example I mean if you want to nudge
me or into a certain thing I'd like to

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:08.950
physiology the the other thing that
 

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.970
physiology the the other thing that
became clear was that you could start

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:11.980
became clear was that you could start
 

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.100
became clear was that you could start
with the genes that we found in the

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.110
with the genes that we found in the
 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.450
with the genes that we found in the
fruit fly and lo and behold you have

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:17.460
fruit fly and lo and behold you have
 

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.690
fruit fly and lo and behold you have
relatives in all the other members of

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:21.700
relatives in all the other members of
 

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.270
relatives in all the other members of
the animal kingdom including us so can

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.280
the animal kingdom including us so can
 

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.740
the animal kingdom including us so can
we ask questions that would help

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:25.750
we ask questions that would help
 

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.300
we ask questions that would help
shiftwork because you know people who

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.310
shiftwork because you know people who
 

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.940
shiftwork because you know people who
work in the emergency services deal

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:29.950
work in the emergency services deal
 

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.590

better with the kind of work that they

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600
better with the kind of work that they
 

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.250
better with the kind of work that they
have to do at night can it help us

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.260
have to do at night can it help us
 

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.000
have to do at night can it help us
understand why babies don't sleep during

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.010
understand why babies don't sleep during
 

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.170
understand why babies don't sleep during
the night I mean I always find that

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.180
the night I mean I always find that
 

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.710

looked after a baby because we know they

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:46.570
looked after a baby because we know they
 

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.460
looked after a baby because we know they
don't sleep at night right so I mean you

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.470
don't sleep at night right so I mean you
 

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.620
don't sleep at night right so I mean you
know does your work help us understand

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:52.630
know does your work help us understand
 

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.780
know does your work help us understand
these common experiences well in many

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.080
cases what it reveals is there's much
more complexity to what's wrong or what

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.090
more complexity to what's wrong or what

when we go from New York or Boston to
 

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.419
when we go from New York or Boston to
at the Stockholm what's really going on

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:12.429
at the Stockholm what's really going on
 

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:16.710
at the Stockholm what's really going on
most of us think well in a few days my

one body clock will get to Stockholm and
 

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.290
one body clock will get to Stockholm and
until then I'm going to be in a state of

until then I'm going to be in a state of
malaise in fact what happens is that

00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:25.869
malaise in fact what happens is that
 

00:14:25.869 --> 00:14:28.530
malaise in fact what happens is that
since you have clocks all over your body

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:28.540
since you have clocks all over your body
 

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.869
since you have clocks all over your body
there is disagreement that starts

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:30.879
there is disagreement that starts
 

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:33.960
there is disagreement that starts
occurring between the cells in different

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:33.970
occurring between the cells in different
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.489
occurring between the cells in different
parts of your body about what time of

00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:35.499
parts of your body about what time of
 

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:38.400
parts of your body about what time of
day it is and so in fact at the end of a

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.410
day it is and so in fact at the end of a
 

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.040
day it is and so in fact at the end of a
flight from New York to Stockholm for

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.050
flight from New York to Stockholm for
 

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.139
flight from New York to Stockholm for
the next few days you really occupy it

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:43.149
the next few days you really occupy it
 

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:45.660
the next few days you really occupy it
your body is occupying multiple time

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:45.670
your body is occupying multiple time
 

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.749
your body is occupying multiple time
zones simultaneously depending on which

00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759
zones simultaneously depending on which
 

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:54.150
zones simultaneously depending on which
clock you look at you think that there's

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160
clock you look at you think that there's
 

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.749
clock you look at you think that there's
good and bad times during the day where

00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759
good and bad times during the day where
 

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.020
good and bad times during the day where
are we right now

00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.030
are we right now
 

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.829
are we right now
[Laughter]

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839
[Laughter]
 

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:04.769
[Laughter]
so it depends it depends what that

00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:04.779
so it depends it depends what that
 

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:08.669
so it depends it depends what that
there's there's times in which which are

00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:08.679
there's there's times in which which are
 

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.759
there's there's times in which which are
more favourable for some things than

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:11.769
more favourable for some things than
 

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:13.679
more favourable for some things than
others yeah so I think what you're

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:13.689
others yeah so I think what you're
 

00:15:13.689 --> 00:15:15.449
others yeah so I think what you're
alluding to perhaps is that this is a

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:15.459
alluding to perhaps is that this is a
 

00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:18.329
alluding to perhaps is that this is a
very successful nap time for example for

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:18.339
very successful nap time for example for
 

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:20.429
very successful nap time for example for
example for example especially for a

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:23.799
gentleman or ladies are aged around
 

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.789
gentleman or ladies are aged around
around this table where in fact who were

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:26.799
around this table where in fact who were
 

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:28.789
around this table where in fact who were
up late last night were up very late

00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:28.799
up late last night were up very late
 

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:32.549
up late last night were up very late
that was when you received your period

00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:32.559
that was when you received your period
 

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:34.289
that was when you received your period
all the festivities and so on construe

00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:34.299
all the festivities and so on construe
 

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:37.199

mechanism also dude aren't the cabins my

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:40.569
mechanism also dude aren't the cabins my
 

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.679
mechanism also dude aren't the cabins my
impression was that the the cabins have

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:43.689
impression was that the the cabins have
 

00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:46.350
impression was that the the cabins have

pretty primitive suicide if they didn't
 

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.900
pretty primitive suicide if they didn't
yeah even if they didn't if they were in

yeah even if they didn't if they were in
 

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.759
yeah even if they didn't if they were in
constant darkness they would show these

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:56.769
constant darkness they would show these
 

00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:58.379
constant darkness they would show these
rhythms and and that's and in fact

00:15:58.379 --> 00:15:58.389
rhythms and and that's and in fact
 

00:15:58.389 --> 00:16:00.480

that's how they were originally revealed

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.490
that's how they were originally revealed
 

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.759

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.530
molecules of life take a picture of it
and then you look at the picture with

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:14.540
and then you look at the picture with
 

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.900
and then you look at the picture with
your eyes it's magnified and you can see

this links up to the conversation we

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460
this links up to the conversation we
 

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.310
this links up to the conversation we
were having a bit earlier which is

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320
were having a bit earlier which is

whether choice architecture or nudging

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:33.750
whether choice architecture or nudging
 

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.740
whether choice architecture or nudging
is good or bad it just depends on who's

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:36.750
is good or bad it just depends on who's
 

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.890

using it so all the scientists here have

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900
using it so all the scientists here have
 

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.610
using it so all the scientists here have
created knowledge that can be used for

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620
created knowledge that can be used for
 

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.400

evil the last last night my toast was to
 

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.090
evil the last last night my toast was to
nudge for good and but that's a hope

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100
nudge for good and but that's a hope
 

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.700
nudge for good and but that's a hope
Richard Henderson I mean all of you have

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:04.710
Richard Henderson I mean all of you have
 

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.680
Richard Henderson I mean all of you have
worked you know for many many years on

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:06.690
worked you know for many many years on
 

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.380
worked you know for many many years on
your endeavors and I think it was one

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.390
your endeavors and I think it was one
 

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.940
your endeavors and I think it was one
chemist who said you know miracles

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:10.950
chemist who said you know miracles
 

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.040
chemist who said you know miracles
sometimes occur but you have to work

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.050
sometimes occur but you have to work
 

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.070
sometimes occur but you have to work
terribly hard I mean it's part and

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080
terribly hard I mean it's part and
 

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.320
terribly hard I mean it's part and
parcel of everything you do isn't it

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.330
parcel of everything you do isn't it
 

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.570
parcel of everything you do isn't it
failure is part and parcel of that that

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580
failure is part and parcel of that that
 

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.070
failure is part and parcel of that that
you'll carry out lots and lots of

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
you'll carry out lots and lots of
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.920
you'll carry out lots and lots of
experiments and expect many of them not

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:24.930
experiments and expect many of them not
 

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.710
experiments and expect many of them not
to succeed yeah I think we are aiming to

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720
to succeed yeah I think we are aiming to
 

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.470
to succeed yeah I think we are aiming to
find out completely new things so if

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480
find out completely new things so if
 

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.420
find out completely new things so if
when you're thinking of an experiment in

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:32.430
when you're thinking of an experiment in
 

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.260
when you're thinking of an experiment in
any area if the the choice that you make

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.270
any area if the the choice that you make
 

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.480
any area if the the choice that you make
is close to the knowledge that you have

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:38.490
is close to the knowledge that you have
 

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.130
is close to the knowledge that you have
already then you're likely to have a

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140
already then you're likely to have a
 

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.350
already then you're likely to have a
successful experiment but you won't have

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360
successful experiment but you won't have
 

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.750
successful experiment but you won't have
learned very much so if you make a

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760
learned very much so if you make a
 

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.890
learned very much so if you make a
bigger jump take a

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900
bigger jump take a
 

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.620
bigger jump take a
bigger risk and then most of the time

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:48.630
bigger risk and then most of the time
 

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.880
bigger risk and then most of the time
the experiments would have failed but

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:49.890
the experiments would have failed but
 

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.890
the experiments would have failed but
when it succeeds you make a bigger jump

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900
when it succeeds you make a bigger jump
 

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.160
when it succeeds you make a bigger jump
forward so I learned from Fred Sanger

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:55.170
forward so I learned from Fred Sanger
 

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.240
forward so I learned from Fred Sanger
who had was had two Nobel Prizes for his

00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.250
who had was had two Nobel Prizes for his
 

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.520
who had was had two Nobel Prizes for his
work in sequencing protein and DNA he

used to say that you should aim for a

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780
used to say that you should aim for a
 

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.810
used to say that you should aim for a
very high failure rate my interpretation

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820
very high failure rate my interpretation
 

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.330
very high failure rate my interpretation
was ninety-nine percent failure rate but

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340
was ninety-nine percent failure rate but
 

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.160
was ninety-nine percent failure rate but
the one percent that succeed takes you

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.170
the one percent that succeed takes you
 

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.110
the one percent that succeed takes you
with a very big step forward which is

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120
with a very big step forward which is
 

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.060
with a very big step forward which is
worth all the effort you've spent on the

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.070
worth all the effort you've spent on the
 

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.430
worth all the effort you've spent on the
other night I would say that leaves out

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440
other night I would say that leaves out
 

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.770
other night I would say that leaves out
one one important component especially

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780
one one important component especially
 

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.810
one one important component especially
for young people who who like science

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820
for young people who who like science
 

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.100
