00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
In today's video,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.000
we are seeing what happens
when molten metal meets crayons.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.400
[Music]

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.700
Guys, before we begin,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.300
I really want to address
the elephant in the room.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
What are we melting?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.500
Crayons.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.600
Are you sure
they're not crayons?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.347
I pronounce them crayons.

00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:28.219
It's a two syllable word
starts with cray,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.320
and ends with on.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.100
What elementary
student says crayon?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
It's crayon.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.189
It's a crayon.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.700
We're melting crayons.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.011
Cray--

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:36.611
It's got--

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:39.200
It's got too many letters
to be one syllable.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
It's crayon.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.800
Crayon.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.519
Cray-on.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.319
Crayon.

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:43.100
Crayon.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.360
A few moments later.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.999
Either way.,we're going
to do some fun things

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.300
with molten metal.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.500
Wax melts at
a very low temperature.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.280
Aluminum melts at a much
higher temperature,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700
and we just want to see
what happens when they combine.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.600
One interesting question is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
whether or not the color
from the crayons can actually do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.141
something to alter
the color of the metal.

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.199
What do you think?

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.900
You know, I'm gonna go with no.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.941
You can't actually color metal.

00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.700
In fact,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.830
if you see colored metal,
it's plated, I believe.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.100
Or painted or anodized.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.500
I don't think

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
that there's a way to actually
add color to metal,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.100
but crayons do have a lot
of color in them.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.561
So maybe something will rub off?

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.700
Crayons themselves are made
of paraffin wax and pigment.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.928
Now, paraffin wax,

00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:30.448
believe it or not,
has a flash point.

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:32.608
It actually can be set on fire.

00:01:32.608 --> 00:01:36.333
So, do you think that these
are actually going to melt,

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.400
or they just
gonna light on fire?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.100
I bet both.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.600
I think it's going to melt,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.900
followed very quickly
by lighting on fire.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.597
Both?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.300
Both.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600
Both is good.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.100
Both.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.100
Both.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100
Both is good.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.780
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.800
We're going to melt down
a bunch of aluminum,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.200
and then add some crayons.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.150
What's going to happen?

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.184
Will it melt the crayons?

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:56.300
Will it light them on fire?

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.800
Will the crayons actually
stain the color of the metal?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.300
All right, Nate we
have got our foundry.

00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:02.200
We have got...

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.023
Many crayons.

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:03.823
Many.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.090
We got many crayons.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.800
Let's melt some aluminum.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.500
I like it.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.220
[Music]

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.400
So the aluminum

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.100
that we're melting
isn't actually our normal wire

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.700
that we have.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.300
Nate, what did you put in there?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.120
It's half a roll
of aluminum foil.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.100
It's aluminum foil.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.354
It's a big heavy roll
of aluminum foil.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.500
It's actually a pretty
easy source of aluminum to get.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400
This is, I'm sure, some alloy.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.300
I don't imagine

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.500
this is perfectly
pure elemental aluminum,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
but it's very close.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.100
And so, we're going to use it.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.048
It's cheap, it's easy,

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:39.600
and you can get
at the grocery store.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.200
Crayons are made almost entirely

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.600
of wax with a little bit
of pigment inside,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.849
and then of course,
paper wrapped around them.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.600
What we're testing out is
the viability of using crayons

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200
as candles in perhaps
an emergency situation.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.416
I'm also curious to see

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.048
if the different colors burn
at different rates,

00:02:55.048 --> 00:02:56.000
different speeds.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.560
It already looks
like our black wax candle / crayon

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.740
is burning a little bit more
intensely than the others,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.140
but we're going to see
how long they last as well.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.680
I saw one supposed life hack
online that talked about

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.520
how a crayon will burn for,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.500
and then it had
a specific amount of time.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.360
But it said it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.375
as though it was always going to
be exactly that amount of time,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.060
so I'm curious

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.800
if different candles burn
for different rates.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.420
What we'll see how they all do.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.080
Maybe it's true.
Maybe it's not.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.900
The idea is that the paper

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.060
is going to act as sort of
a wick for the molten wax,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.380
kind of like
an inside-out candle.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.660
The wick is on the outside
rather than on the inside.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.794
Are they all going
to keep going?

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.432
We're going to have
to test and find out.

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.834
We already had two kind of fail,

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:36.485
and I'm not sure
exactly what happened.

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:39.380
I was able to relight them,
but the green and the yellow,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.060
which are the ones

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.760
that went out, are now,
they're going out again.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:04:14.220
[Music]

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.820
We're going to drop one crayon
into our molten aluminum.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.900
See what happens.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.260
Beautiful.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.920
It's on fire.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.800
It's on fire.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.660
Wow!

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.080
I think immediately,
the paper probably lit on fire.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.980
So that is paraffin wax.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.360
So do you think
the wax itself melted,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.460
and is now just sitting
on the surface?

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.260
Because it's not as dense
as the aluminum.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.000
That's true.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.420
But it does catch fire.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.920
We can--

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.460
We can sort of see
part of it now.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.940
I think that's paper.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.260
I think so.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.160
I think the paper survived
for the most part.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.140
Yes!

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.760
Melting, and on fire.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.300
You can see the little
puddle of wax.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.160
Your lighting your
camera on fire..

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.580
Oh, that's really cool.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.880
And now, you can just
see it started dancing

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.320
on the surface of the aluminum.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.420
That's exactly what I said.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.260
I didn't think it was actually
gonna sink in.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.000
&gt;&gt; You are right.
&gt;&gt; I thought it would melt on the top,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.900
and light on fire.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.020
With normal candles,
the heat from the wick

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.880
is actually vaporizing
a little bit of the wax,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.880
&gt;&gt; and then it's that vapor.
&gt;&gt; The wax is the fuel.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.400
Yeah.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.320
It's that vapor
that actually ignites.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.540
The liquid wax and the solid
wax aren't burning,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.720
but the vaporized
wax is burning,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.360
and so it's just
what you were pointing out is

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:25.111
that the stick,

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:25.870
when I pull it out,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.800
it might get melty,
but it's not lighting on fire,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.682
and that's why.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:32.220
It's because it has to actually
vaporize to catch on fire.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:06:03.480
[Music]

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.480
While we're waiting for that
to cool and not be on fire.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.340
Yeah, it's still on fire.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.280
Yep.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.600
What should we do?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.900
I think it's time to scale
it up a little bit.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.100
We've done single crayons.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.440
I want to see a lot of crayons
and more aluminum.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.080
Okay, we've got a bowl
full of crayons and a crucible

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.240
full of molten metal.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.720
Let's combine them.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.300
I do not want to
be standing there.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.620
Nothing.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.840
That took me nothing.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.020
It is actually staying on top.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.900
I am amazed that
that has not just foam right to--

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.600
The fact that there's
aluminum on top

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.040
&gt;&gt; of the crayons is baffling.
&gt;&gt; Okay, but wait, listen.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.340
Can you hear that?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.980
It's boiling.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.620
Oh, yeah.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:57.180
[Music]

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.160
I fill this cup with crayons
with the papers on.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:18.960
[Music]

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.320
Even though the paraffin
does catch fire,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.200
it seems that our crayons

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.300
with the paper are definitely
staying lit a lot longer.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.720
Wow.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.400
Wow, that's...

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.190
That's an impressive
amount of flame,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.720
and it is putting
off a lot of heat.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.080
[Music]

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.300
You can still see the aluminum.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.400
It didn't melt all

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.740
of the crayons all
the way through,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.260
and that is amazing.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.180
Yeah, the fact

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.320
that there's aluminum
draped across crayons,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.080
I never would have thought
that they would hold--

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.280
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Hold aluminum.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.090
I thought of just cut
right through them all.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.300
Yeah, not in any shape or form.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.920
That's awesome.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.340
That's how I take it.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.560
Really hot.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.580
Yeah.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.860
That is cool.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.460
That was neat.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.400
That is pretty...

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.940
Wait. What is that?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.180
&gt;&gt; That's the aluminum.
&gt;&gt; That's the aluminum?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.920
Awesome.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.880
That's the crayon
wax right there.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:31.760
[Music]

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.900
That is a funny
shape right there.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.700
Look at that.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.060
That is well coated with wax.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.080
[Music]

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.940
There it is.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.940
That is a chunk of aluminum
poured into a pile of crayons,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.380
a bowl of crayons.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.120
Crayons.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.820
And then it's become coated
in crayon wax as well.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.120
It's just covering it all.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.540
So we'd have to try and burn all

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.820
that off to see the aluminum
underneath, I think.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.720
[Music]

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.520
It's actually really
really pretty.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.800
And warm.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.220
Oh, it really is.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.860
Also, it smells terrible.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.360
It does.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.680
None of the others
ever smelled this bad.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.000
What are they called?

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.940
Crayons.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.480
They have been,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.260
and they always
shall be crayons.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.520
No kindergartener says crayon.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.500
I say February.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.880
He's the weird one.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.820
So right here,

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.940
where we've got this cool
little fire twirl,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.680
this does kind of look
like the aluminum

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.740
and the crayons have
like blended together.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.780
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's just a puddle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's so pretty.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.160
of wax on top of aluminum,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.500
but like right at the edges,
it almost looks

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.520
like we have wax mixing
with the metal.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.420
Pouring metal onto crayons
looks super cool.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.012
