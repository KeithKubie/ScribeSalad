1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,160
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,900
And I'm just checking in our home.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,320
You

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,970
what's going on?
How are you?

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,690
Yeah,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,800
I'm in Chicago.

8
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:23,801
My kind of town Chicago
with my kind of town.

9
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,040
Chicago is

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,080
eating harder attack foods.

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,940
Your cargo is a great yeah,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,590
place to put on 40 pounds.

13
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,080
It's my kind of town.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,180
Yeah. Oh, they got steaks,
chops, deep dish pizza. You know,

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,640
remember that old SNL sketch and they all
dress like my ticket and they all have

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,480
in fucking heart attacks
and stuff. Yeah. Um,

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,400
this ends my sixth straight weekends
on the road and I gotta tell you

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,860
I was in such great shape at the beginning
of it and now I'm starting to go in

19
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:06,030
the wrong direction. So
it starts tonight. Uh,

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,920
just ordered a little bit of room service,
something healthy,

21
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:13,430
something not so healthy. But uh,
I'm fucking, I got two shows tonight.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm just going to go home and you can
tell them fighting off a fucking cold.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,690
That almost ruined my show last
night at Madison Square Garden.

24
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:24,310
Thank you to everybody who showed up.
I had a great God damn town time.

25
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:28,840
The a sound was incredible.
And um,

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,110
I had a bunch of friends came out, saw
it and they all like, oh my God, we,

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,900
we really enjoyed it, which made me feel
good. Thank you to the people, you know,

28
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:40,390
some people gave me some gifts, you
know, I got some cigars this week.

29
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,640
Thank you to everybody.
Came out to theF is for family.

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,190
I'm thinking of Jig there
that I did at the uh,

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,150
Paley Center with Mike
Price and Peter Billingsley.

32
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,240
We actually aired the first episode
for the people that were there.

33
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,660
We actually got a great review from
Forbes magazine about our third season.

34
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,290
Say it's her best fucking season and,
and,

35
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,890
and we're one of the top half
hours on Netflix. I mean,

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,690
I am having a hell of a week.
I really am.

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,140
I'm enjoying myself,
but I'm eating like a fucking idiot.

38
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,170
So drinking this stupid
ass fucking vitamin C Shit,

39
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,840
you know, they'll just keep
drinking those packets. Psych. Well,

40
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,270
it's a thousand milligrams.
What to drink? Two of them.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,290
That's why I drew went 2000 of anything
in me. That's just seems to like,

42
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,280
uh, like a lot. Can you o d on vitamin C,

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,323
you know

44
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,050
how many times can the cold virus kick
vitamin C's ass before we realized that

45
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,260
it really doesn't do anything.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,420
Vitamin C over dose,

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,420
you know, somebody did
this. Okay. Four adults,

48
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,780
the recommended daily
amount for vitamin C's,

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,760
65 to 90 milligrams.
Now what do I got?

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,570
I got a thousand milligrams.
Uh,

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,440
and the upper limit is
2000 milligrams a day.

52
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,610
Although too much dietary vitamin
C is unlikely to be harmful.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,920
Mega doses of vitamin C supplements
might cause diarrhea or nausea.

54
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,071
Okay?

55
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:24,510
And we can o d on it be fucking hilarious
if he gets so into health that you

56
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,630
fucking overdosed the ugly
truth behind the vitamin,

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,800
vitamin C overdose according
to Spoon University,

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,390
uh, that they'd like to snuggle when
they learn things. Spoon University,

59
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,310
I hate being sick and I'm guessing
you do too, says the article, uh,

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,910
blah, blah, blah, blah. Shamal see,

61
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,050
you've heard someone that you can
never take too much vitamin C.

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,540
Is that really to true or it isn't a myth.

63
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,480
Can we overdose on environment and
say, I don't care. I don't care.

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,930
[inaudible] I'm fucking, if I'm
reading, just say the answer.

65
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,910
Don't want to read an episode of a fuck
a television show that doesn't exist.

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,830
It's an old person reading a book. The
other day at the airport I was just like,

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,270
wow, that's fucking amazing. You know,

68
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,104
they just didn't give,

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,950
it wasn't staring at a fucking smart
phone like everybody else. Clued myself.

70
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,490
You know, I actually use my
smartphone to help me with my stress.

71
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,850
Whenever I'm stressing out,
I just play fucking solitaire.

72
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,283
You know?

73
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,690
It's got a nice fucking mellow
guitar thing. Wait, wait, wait.

74
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,940
Where when a bear all this fucking song,

75
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:35,150
it plays in the background and I just
don't give a shit and try to beat my top

76
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,930
score, you know? And I look
up, I'm stolen at the airport.

77
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,530
I don't give a fuck. I really
dumped. You know what I hate?

78
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:46,580
I hate when these who near the fucking
security line at the airport and some

79
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,540
fucking asshole behind you goes.

80
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,460
Can I just get through them so by my
flight's already boarding. It's just like,

81
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,680
okay,
well you fucking got to miss it then

82
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,130
now because you're late
because you're late,

83
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:02,910
you get rewarded for being late by not
having to wait in the fucking line.

84
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,000
Like the rest of us, fuck you.
Fuck you and fuck your flight.

85
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,250
You know, I'm sorry. Can I just
end this stupid body language?

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,070
They're trying to be all like a

87
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,890
submissive as they walk past you.
I mean,

88
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,280
what's to stop somebody from just saying
my flight leaves and fucking 10 minutes.

89
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,720
I mean that's the move.

90
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,360
If you don't have TSA precheck
or a global or a, you know,

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,750
if you didn't have your tape mapped,

92
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,780
whatever the fuck they're doing
now to get you on the plane sooner.

93
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,180
I mean that's the move I think.

94
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah.

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
If your conspiracy theorist and you
don't want them to have anymore formation

96
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,380
about you, but you don't like waiting
in lines, I would just show up to that.

97
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,930
Sorry. It might make my flight
leaves in 10 minutes. Can I just,

98
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,950
can I just [inaudible] yeah.
Some of these,

99
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,480
give those people the old
right there, Fred. Oh God,

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm fucking miserable.

101
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,700
If I can do these two shows tonight and
not get sick if I can just fight it off.

102
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,783
MMM.

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,460
But anyways, I had the greatest fucking
night ever last night. Just wired a wire.

104
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,080
I just had a fucking awesome set.

105
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,023
MMM.

106
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,570
And then the after party was at Gotham
comedy club with the Mozillians who I've

107
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:19,840
known forever. And uh, they
made this incredible cake.

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,793
MMM.

109
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,150
I believe they got the cake boss to make
it. We took pictures, I uploaded a shit,

110
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,280
but it was uh, it was, the cake
was not only Madison Square Garden,

111
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:35,820
it also looked like a snare drum, cause
you know, obviously I played drums.

112
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,110
There was a helicopter on it.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,110
And then they had this big figurine of
me wearing that fucking shirt I wore in

114
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,430
my last special with the
stars on it. And then, uh,

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,900
they had the John Bonham's green sparkle,
1971 Ludwig kit.

116
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,900
You know what, this little Seplat for
insignia on it. It was incredible.

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,450
Fucking cake was incredible.
And they let us,

118
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,120
well I can't see what they let us do
cause I don't think they get them in

119
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,600
fucking trouble. But you know something
they usually make you do outside.

120
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,580
They allowed us to do insight,
which was fucking tremendous. Um,

121
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,430
then that was it and it fucking went
home. And now I'm, now I'm in Chicago,

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,590
I'm in fucking Chicago.

123
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,190
I got four shows here at

124
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,680
the Chicago theater,

125
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:29,450
which arguably has the greatest
marquis in the country.

126
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:33,140
I feel, um, speaking of the greatest, uh,

127
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,750
Paul Versey special thanks to you guys

128
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,390
is a, it's one of the highest
rates specials, comedy
central sat in a long time.

129
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,610
It's fucking crushing. It has
over like a million views. Um,

130
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,920
so thank you to everybody
who went out and watched it.

131
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,520
It's still streaming on comedy central.
You can check it out.

132
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,910
It's great for Paul is great for
me cause he did it with my company.

133
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:59,360
All things comedy by any and all medicals,
you know, it's fucking tremendous.

134
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,220
That's the first one.
And you know what?

135
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,870
We got three more common you take Paul.
First he was was,

136
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,710
was the high watermark and
we're going to dip. Nope.

137
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,900
Everybody's just going to be
at the same fucking level.

138
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,500
It's all going to be quality. Um,
do I sound like Trump right now?

139
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,910
I actually watched a little bit of that
news conference, by the way. You know,

140
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,500
that childish fucking affair, Jesus
Christ. Everybody's yelling at each other

141
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,870
report a continuing to ask questions.

142
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,940
Is Trump saying I'm done with you?

143
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,640
Then he walked away from the microphone
to that whole fucking thing on both

144
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,660
sides was like embarrassing.
Um, and I'm not a fan of Trump,

145
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,661
but for people to sit there and act like
the media does not fucking absolutely

146
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:49,540
hate that fucking guy.
I've never seen. I mean,

147
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,320
I've never seen a guy get a fucking
attacked the way this fucking dude gets

148
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:56,400
attacked. It's like watching
a comic play a hell room.

149
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,370
It's just up there getting
fucking heckled. And he's like,

150
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,790
I'm not going to do my fucking act
that [inaudible] you fucking suck.

151
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,450
Um, I dunno. It's the worst
job on the fucking plant.

152
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:13,890
You can literally get blamed for
everything. You know? Why aren't they,

153
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,650
why don't they fucking have
a press conference with
some of these fucking piece

154
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:21,090
of shit? Corporations polluting
the water, stealing from people,

155
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,950
blown up the economy,
and then rip the rug out from everyone.

156
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,140
What we'll fuck about them. You
become president. You just, you just,

157
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,430
they're fucking stooge.

158
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,160
And you go out there and you stand there
and you just get yelled at by these

159
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:36,240
fucking nerds who think they're
in the paper. Chase is some shit.

160
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,320
Um,
I have no idea.

161
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,220
Another fucking bad story.
It's just a bad, you know,

162
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,630
I just put it on the TV and I saw that
whole thing about the fucking one of

163
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,730
those mass shootings things.
And uh,

164
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,300
it just makes no sense that
those things happen all the time.

165
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,690
Other than the fact that that's
all they fucking show on TV.

166
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,950
And there has to be some
sort of connection to that
because there's always been

167
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,220
a shitload of guns
in a shitload of people that had them.

168
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,820
And I,
I literally think like,

169
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,490
it's like the ice bucket challenge for
psychosis and they just fucked me over

170
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,560
that everybody's side.
We're doing the ice bucket challenge.

171
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:20,100
So then everybody had to start dumping
fucking water over their heads instead of

172
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:24,930
just giving money. I never understood
that. It's like what is the cause? Okay.

173
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:28,080
That's a good cause. I mean, I don't
have to ruin my shirt for delay.

174
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,440
Would you like some money?
I'm willing to give you some.

175
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,243
So

176
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,560
yeah,

177
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,190
I would love to see if
they could experiment, just
not giving it any coverage

178
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,200
and then it would just fade away
like an old pop star, I think.

179
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,510
You know, I dunno, that's my too,
because other than that that,

180
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,440
that I don't have any
fucking solution for it.

181
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,093
MMM.

182
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,370
Just fucking horrific. Oh, anybody
could fucking do something like that.

183
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,390
Um, but anyways, back to the
comedy. Back to the comedy. Um,

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,370
oh my God. This is one of these fucking
day. Some days doing a podcast is easy.

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,240
You know, it's like falling out of
bed. Well that's not it. Fucking,

186
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,690
it's the one thing is it's like
getting out of bed, rolling out of bed.

187
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,460
It's like taking that nap. Is that
an easy thing? We asked people,

188
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:28,030
a hundred people did a survey said name
the top five things, you know, bad.

189
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,960
I would suck on fucking the family feud.
I can't say the name of the show,

190
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,060
the family feud name,
something that's easy to do.

191
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,640
Uh, Mr. Byrd, uh, fall
out of bed, show me,

192
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:46,470
fall out of bed, back, Sullivan
family with a chance to steal.

193
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,790
I'd be that last family member.
You know what I mean? Fucking dude.

194
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,090
All the way down the end.
Yeah.

195
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:55,970
Yup.

196
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,450
Families only have so many smart people
and it seems when you watch the family

197
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:03,740
feud, it stops around three
is if five people on a show,

198
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,180
it's always the last to, you know, some,
he always just said something that sucks.

199
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,230
Well, you should really do. I
think, well, how would you do that?

200
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,970
It's almost like a batting
lineup with intelligence. Okay.

201
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,660
Did you got to have your lead off hitter?
You know,

202
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,850
you've got to have somebody's back and
clean up and then you get, you know,

203
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,050
you've got your pitcher,
bat and a knife. If we're,

204
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,530
if we're going by national league
rules here, right. What do you do?

205
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:35,460
Do you put the dummy up front when all
the answers are still on the board?

206
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,190
Name a word that begins with a
apple being number one answer,

207
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,950
right?
Or do you just leave that guy down the end

208
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,840
and hope that everybody else,
you know, does a good job?

209
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:56,840
I wonder if there's fights.
You know when somebody finds out.

210
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,090
Yeah. Hey, we're going to have
you all the way down to the end.

211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,020
Basically the right field of intelligence.

212
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:04,820
We're going to be all the
way down the fucking end.

213
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Now is the person too stupid to realize
that that's where the dumbest person is.

214
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,420
You know,
and everybody needs to get a hit.

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Everybody needs to get ahead because this
motherfucker's going to get a strike.

216
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,500
All right?
Just put him all the fuck way down.

217
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,720
He's going to get the least at bets

218
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,073
in theory,

219
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,900
up, up, up, up, up. They should
have a fucking a week of,

220
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,570
of all those fucking people down the ends.
You know,

221
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,200
you just make super families
out of that last person.

222
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,000
Just the dumbest mother fuckers ever.

223
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,170
Oh, what'd you call it? Family feud.

224
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,800
A fucking dope week.

225
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,700
Who else that shows
it's still Steve Harvey.

226
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,300
He would probably run out of
looks to give the crowd. Um,

227
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:01,991
anyways,

228
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,060
so I'm hearing in Chicago this buckets
and I gotta I gotta I gotta get back on

229
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,700
my Goddamn Diet.
You know,

230
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,110
I was good before I did this six week run.

231
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,040
I had my whole fucking future ahead of me.
You don't fucking lyrics.

232
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm going to the heart doctor next
week to get my ticker checked out. Uh,

233
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
the six weeks ago I've yet gay or
in phenomenal shape for your age.

234
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,210
And I was going to be like, hey, you
probably want to lose seven pounds.

235
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,200
I could do it though. I want to. I
want to be that. You don't want to be,

236
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm going to be that fucking
guy that loses weight during
the holidays. You know,

237
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,180
he has only one way to do that. You've
got gotta be homeless. Nobody loves you.

238
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,080
Is that okay? How much of an asshole
you are when it's the holidays,

239
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,680
somebody is going to make cookies,
right?

240
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,090
Those stupid little tins. You walk
over with, you opening it up, you know,

241
00:14:56,091 --> 00:15:00,440
is that voice in the back of your head?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

242
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,530
And then you shouted down with, you know,
I'm going to go to the gym in January.

243
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,060
I'm going to start the
year with a giant fucking

244
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,633
okay

245
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,950
steamship round for a fucking
torso. I can't do it, man.

246
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,963
MMM.

247
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm disgusted with myself.
Look what you did, Bill.

248
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,930
You had a good thing going. You fucking
ruined it. I haven't watched any sports.

249
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,550
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
Right?

250
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,580
Red Sox won the world series and
I just been fucking flying high.

251
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,450
I haven't watched anything. I know
the lake. Uh, what about fucking Duke?

252
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:40,110
Just absolutely kicking the
fucking shit out of Kentucky.

253
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,700
And once again, once again, they,
they got it. They got another guy.

254
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,460
How do they fucking do it?

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,810
Duke Verse Kentucky.

256
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,520
Now,
how does that work?

257
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,280
Do they just have this shit just to like
for the ratings so they can figure out

258
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:02,280
who's, uh, who's the best
team? Is this actually count?

259
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,000
Is it like soccer where they
have a friendly shout up?

260
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,820
You know soccer is like the, you
know, we're playing but it doesn't,

261
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,760
it doesn't mean anything.

262
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,693
MMM.

263
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,910
That's 75 47 with 14 minutes to go.
Are you fucking kidding me?

264
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,600
They scored 75 points and a
half and like you just can't be,

265
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,610
it can't be

266
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,410
one 18 to 84 that's like
a fucking NBA score.

267
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,410
They still let up 84 points though.

268
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,180
I Dunno. I Dunno how to fuck
that works. But it did somehow.

269
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,390
I'll tell you what them Duke Blue Devils,

270
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,230
they put a whip in on that fucking
wild cats from Kentucky. Um, all right,

271
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,000
let me do a couple of reads here.

309
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,370

micro modal modal fabric,

are available from classic colors too.

313
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:48,910
Adventurous prints.
Speaking of prints this holiday season.

314
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,210
Oh the holiday season be on these.

315
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,200
We'll be releasing a new fucking
bread every God damn Tuesday.

316
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,200
That means you have no excuse to celebrate
the holidays right down to your very

317
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:02,440
own car. Uh, but why stop

318

Me undies is launching their
holiday prince in lounge
pants in one sees as well.

319
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,680
Both are made from the same micro
modal modal fabric as their undies.

320
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,500
Seriously,

321

loved one a matching holiday themed one z

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,430
because it's kind of weird to be
an adult wearing a fucking onesy.

324
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,550
You'd be like one of those,
those adult babies, you know,

325
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,240
sit in a fucking crib cause
you can't deal with reality.

326
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,573
Well I guess,
you know,

327
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,120
that's just another segment
of the population they're
trying to make money off

328
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,750
of. So you know, God bless them beyond.

335
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, butcher box. Uh, right butcher box.

336
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,320
That reminds me, I looked
up battleaxe today. This is
the fucking funny thing. Ah,

337
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,170
I try to make tucked in that fucking
battle ax over there. You know,

338
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,270
I always thought that meant an ugly woman.

339
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,050
It just means a woman who doesn't
take any shit and she's difficult.

340
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,290
All right.
You know,

341
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,233
I dunno.

342
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,790
I always thought like a battle ax.
It looked bad.

343
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,310
It was all fucked up looking
cause she went to battle on it.

344
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,020
So you've seen her face look like a
battle ax? I guess it wasn't though.

345
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,130
They determined. Let's look up
the definition of bad election. We

346
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,033
like a

347
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,350
call your wife that and see
what the fuck happens. Eh?

348
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,940
You fucking battle ax.

349
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,343
Yeah.

350
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,213
All right.

351
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,650
Battleaxe meaning is a term
generally considered a pejorative?

352
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,900
Do you how many times
I've looked up pejorative.

353
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,610
That's like when they said the Democrats
won the house. I was like, oh my God,

354
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,940
what does that mean?
Every election I have to look up.

355
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,550
What does the fucking house do
versus what does the Senate do?

356
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,310
Not that they're all, I don't think
all of this at the Capitol is one side.

357
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:22,990
The house,
the other side's the Senate.

358
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,870
I Dunno know you.

359
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,410
I just picture you go in there and all
you hear is the sound of loafers walking

360
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:34,730
on marble. All right. Expressing
contempt or disapproval.

361
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,950
Pejorative. Can you use it and
excel in a sentence please.

362
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,390
Oh, who gives a fuck? I don't
even care anymore. Right?

363
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,920
A battleax you fucking battle ax when?
Raise it.

364
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay, so it's, well, what just
happened? Oh, there it is. All right.

365
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:59,190
A battle ax is a term generally
considered pejorative for an aggressive,

366
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:02,930
domineering, and forceful woman. Oh,

367
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,390
this is the female word for
cock sucker guys at Dick. Uh,

368
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,420
she's a fucking battle ax
and he's a fucking Dick.

369
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,340
Battle ax is just funnier.
The battle.

370
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,210
Axe is one of several stereotypes
found in nursing, a tyrannical,

371
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,690
fierce matron exemplified by nurse ratchet
or Haiti's shock in popular medical

372
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:31,940
dramas and comedies.
Why the fuck is,

373
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,560
why is everybody picking on nurses?

374
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,663
I Dunno.

375
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,390
That's kind of my goal this week.
I'm going to call somebody a battleax.

376
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,960
I would never call my wife that.
She's too fucking cute. Okay.

377
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,230
What's the worst thing
ever called my wife?

378
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,560
I don't call. I don't. I don't
do the name. Call it most of us.

379
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,480
Do we stop being such a fucking asshole?
Leave me alone.

380
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,870
Just leave me alone. All right. All
right. What's your box? Everybody?

381
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

382
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:18,900
organic chicken and awe.
Heritage bread.

383
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:23,850
Pork. Oh, do you owe it to yourself
to eat one of those fucking pigs?

384
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,050
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets start with the commitment to raising

385
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:32,370
animals humanely free of antibiotics
and hormones before they murder them.

386
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,940
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

387
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:41,150
which is enough for 24 individual size
meals or one and a half meals for a binge

388
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:42,744
eater.

389
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,530
When I was little skinny Asian guys that
for some reason when the hot dog eating

390
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:50,010
contest, right, the big fat
dude can't kick get it done.

391
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,420
You can choose from five different
box types, all beef, beef and chicken,

392
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,600
beef and pork.
Mixed box or custom box.

393
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah,

394
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
which lets you choose your own cuts.
All right. Personal experience.

395
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:07,050
I already told you guys told you many
times that heritage bread pork mean it's

396
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,310
pure bred.

397
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,930
It's like it's the original pigs from
Europe for whatever reason they taste

398
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:15,630
better than the ones we got over here.
You know,

399
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,470
probably because our pigs are out
eating fucking Mcdonald's, you know,

400
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,840
grew up on peanut butter and
fluff it out or some shit.

401
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,640
I don't know what the hell these fucking
uppity goddamn heritage bread pork with

402
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:31,830
doing, but whatever they did it, they
taste fucking delicious. Anyways,

That's $20 off your first box in
two pounds of free meat a month.

406
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,520
That's a lot of fucking meat.
Quarterpounder right?

407
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,980
That'd be eight quarter pounders.
How many days there were not month?

408

That's all I got.

431
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,490
this is probably the most common term
used straight into the point yet not as

432
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:38,440
degrading because of its
immense popularity in common
use. Well, it depends on, on,

433
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,940
yeah. Like I think if black women,

434
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:47,650
if you call him a bitch at me and it's
means more white women, for some reason,

435
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,080
white women really don't like cunt.
I think white people say cut a lot.

436
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:56,620
I don't know that black people say cunt,
which should be fucking hilarious.

437
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,020
Um, at least American black people
who I haven't seen it, you know,

438
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,060
not like I'm out here
doing a current survey,

439
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:08,140
but I'm just generally speaking
to people I talked to. Uh,

440
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,210
anyways, I find black
people will add, you know,

441
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,840
add to bitch stank bitch
or something like that.

442
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:18,760
But they never seem to
make the leap to cut.

443
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,183
Okay.

444
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,160
White people like bitches, just
sash. She's a bitch. You know what?

445
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:30,480
She's really being a bitch. She's a
cunt and that's how it works. Everybody.

446
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:34,440
All right, number nine cow.
Speaking of butcher box cow,

447
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,400
the only reason this is so low on the
list is because it never comes as a

448
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,440
surprise of fat.
Chick knows she's a fetch.

449
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:46,380
A Jesus Christ knows she's a fat chick.
In fact, sometimes they even embrace it.

450
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,080
So in rare cases, this can actually
backfire. Now I don't think,

451
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,280
I don't think this works. I don't,
I don't, I don't believe in that.

452
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,760
And who wants to be called a fucking cow?
That is funny though.

453
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,950
If fucking cow, a cow is funny
than pig. What'd you say?

454
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,010
You fat pig. You fat cow. There's
something about cow. Maybe it's the sound.

455
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,210
It says out, you know his hours in
there, it hurts. It's hurtful thing.

456
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,330
Slut number seven, horror.

457
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:23,820
Slash hope number six is slob.

458
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,020
Wait a second.
I didn't mind when you called me a whore,

459
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:34,580
but when you said I was a
Slob, that was it. Skank pig.

460
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,230
Bimbo, slut smut bag. Oh,

461
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:43,650
this is worse than my list.
And then cut. Yup, you do.

462
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,830
COMP was going to be number one. All
right. Now let's now, let's be fair.

463
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:50,360
Let's be fair to the ladies here.

464
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,910
Okay.
All right.

465
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,470
Top 10 worst things you
can call your boyfriend.

466
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,460
This is how you killed time on the
road as a comedian, by the way.

467
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,823
Okay?

468
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,910
Uh, all right. This is hilarious. Women
have 25 things that they call guys.

469
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,610
They really do talk more,
don't they? 25 wars.

470
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:17,611
Pet names for your lover thinks you
don't want to call your lover 50 horrible

471
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:20,830
nicknames for your significant of the 13.
Where's pet names?

472
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,400
What not to say to your
boyfriend? All right, here we go.

473
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,950
I would imagine when he takes his
dick out, they go. Is that it?

474
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,780
It tickles. Um, all right. Number one,

475
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,650
you're so much better than all
the other jerks I've dated. Yeah.

476
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,450
Cause that makes them a meal. Think
well, how much cock has been in you? Um,

477
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,850
can you really afford that?

478
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,190
This is just one of these classic things.
It's like, did they even ask guys,

479
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,630
can you really afford that? Can really
afford that? Uh, yeah, I can. Or No,

480
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:02,480
I can't thank you for stopping
me from making this bad purchase.

481
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,520
That seems like a concern,
girlfriend.

482
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,100
So we're running a little
late. Relax. All right,

483
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:14,010
so we're running a little late.
Comes with the territory.

484
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:17,580
But if there's a preemptive relaxed
before I flipped out, that would bug me.

485
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,300
Although I don't know if this
makes my top 10. He's a great guy.

486
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:25,280
You should be friends with him.
Yeah.

487
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:29,390
That means you guys used to fuck or
you're about ready to number five.

488
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,920
She made me promise not to tell,
but uh, it's not surprising.

489
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,190
None of you can keep your fucking
mouth shut. Clooten guys, number six.

490
00:31:37,191 --> 00:31:39,950
Don't be silly.
I haven't done that in ages.

491
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,133
Uh,

492
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,020
I dunno what that means.
What are we talking about?

493
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:49,460
Okay.

494
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,270
You want some heroin? Don't be silly.
I haven't done that in ages. Okay.

495
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,080
Put it in your ass. Don't be silly. I
haven't done that day. Just like, yeah,

496
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,100
it's kind of a weird answer.
No matter what you were asked.

497
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,260
Would you like some cereal?
Don't be silly. I haven't
done that in ages anyways.

498
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,860
Number 10. Oh 10 sentences.
He be psyched to hear.

499
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,040
Number one, boring. Nothing helps me
wind down after a long day at work.

500
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:19,900
Like giving you a blow job.
Okay. That's never been said.

501
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,640
Number two, what does, what does
she became like Wacky Dick Jokes.

502
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,253
All right.

503
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,930
That was cosmo. Everybody. Um, all right.

504
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:39,290
I need to drink more fucking I guess
vitamin C, it's inevitable getting,

505
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,070
I got to do two shows tonight. All
right. Oh, freckles is going to get sick.

506
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,000
First call of the year. Didn't even
make it to fucking December, you know.

507
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,170
All right,

508
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,710
well thank you once again to everybody
who came out to Madison Square Garden.

509
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,280
Thank you to uh,
Gotham comedy club for the after party.

510
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,670
Thank you for to the west side comedy
club for helped me tune up my shit earlier

511
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:05,780

512
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,650
Take it. Everybody showed up. All
right. Enjoy the music and a, uh,

513

continued special half hour of,
uh,

514
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,730
I guess greatest hits from a Thursday
podcast from earlier this year or 10 years

515
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,050
ago. I have no idea. Oh, by the way,

516
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:25,190
I got some great fucking
video to backstage that we
will be putting up on the

517
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,560
Patrion page, um, from the beginning
of the show at the end of the show.

518
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,920
Very excited about it. Um, that
is all. Have a great weekend.

519
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,890
You bitches. I can't say con
right? I don't want a fed. Yeah.

520
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,010
Alright.
[inaudible]

521
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,640
you doctor, listen to
podcast. The fuck yourselves.

522
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,100
[inaudible] [inaudible] away from me.
You couldn't see how

523
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,290
[inaudible] so close.
So close.

524
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,180
[inaudible] carried you books from school.

525
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,000
[inaudible] I was six when we came to me.

526
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,030
No, when you were Amy and your crew,
your private looked down at you.

527
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,710
You hit that one home. One
day. My son will grow the VMV

528
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,380
move.
Look at you now.

529
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Just got your ass whipped
by a bunch of Goddamn nerds.

530
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,830
Yeah.
Hello.

531
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,550
If I was you,
I'd do something about it.

532
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I would get up and redeem
myself in the eyes of my father,

533
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,680
my maker,
and my coach was just go dark.

534
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,390
Yeah.

535
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,620
Hey, it's bill burger. It's the
Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

536
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,400
November eight, 2010. I hope these
levels aren't too fucking high ahead.

537
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,510
Had to really crank that up so you could
actually hear that speech that I hope

538
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,380
there's actually some New
England patriots listening.

539
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,760
Well that goes out to
the New England patriots.

540
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Everybody after that fucking
show lacking that rape,

541
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,470
but that they took at the hands of
the fucking hapless Cleveland Browns,

542
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,840
the fucking hapless Cleveland bronze.
Why are these levels so fucking high?

543
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,390
Hang on a second. Hang on, hang on. Hang
on. Let's go on on here. Hello. Hello.

544
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,780
Test one, two bill bar. Monday morning
podcasts. There we go. Is that better?

545
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,800
Is that better? Um, Jesus Christ,

546
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,120
we got fucking killed.
Absolutely fucking killed,

547
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,970
uh, by a white running back. Everybody.

548
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,360
You know something?
I'm going to go out on a limb.

549
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:25,740
I think the white running back or
fullback. Let's not get crazy now.

550
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,780
Let's not get crazy.
The fullback,

551
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,260
that fucking white dude
who just doesn't feel pain.

552
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
It put me fucking kill that guy.

553
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,230
That dude is back Mongo.

554
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,500
Remember that fucking white dude who
rode the bull in blazing saddles?

555
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,820
Put a helmet on that guy. That's who the
fucking Pat's went up against yesterday.

556
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,080
Jesus Christ. You should have seen
this fucking guy. He had a face mask.

557
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:56,100
His face mask look like the front
of a dodge ram pickup truck.

558
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,360
Look like the grill of that
dodge ram pickup truck.

559
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:04,050
The second you see his face mask,
you know what he's doing?

560
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,770
He's getting the ball.
He's going right up the fucking middle.

561
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,720
He's out running around the side
like some fairy fucking running back.

562
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,580
He's coming right up to fucking gut.

563
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,490
And that's exactly what that
guy did all God. Damn Day long.

564
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,580
He was stiff arming at defensive ends
like they were cornerbacks just sort of

565
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,630
throwing them aside.
It was,

566
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:29,370
it was one of the most dominating
performances that I've seen in awhile.

567
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,111
And,
uh,

568
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:36,111
so that was a little inspirational fucking
speech for my team because next week

569
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,540
we play in the Pittsburghs

570
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,370
add a, I was already worried
about that game, but uh,

571
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,430
this is the interesting thing about how
football works is if the Patriots went

572
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,790
in and actually beat the browns.
Um,

573
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,700
I was thinking that, okay, if we beat the
browns and then we go up seven in one,

574
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,270
we are going to get at what happened
in Cleveland was going to happen in

575
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,640
Pittsburgh.
But now for some fucking reason,

576
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,010
this is how it seems to work
that we lost in Cleveland.

577
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,950
We'll actually be way more competitive.

578
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:12,060
I still think we're going
to lose in Pittsburgh. Our
defense is fucking horrific.

579
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,190
It's horrific.
You know,

580
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,750
it's fucking frustrating to be going
through. You know, it's actually not bad.

581
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,160
We going through a fucking,
uh, a a a rebuilding year,

582
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,180
you know, and I know a lot of you guys
out there just cause it's the patriots.

583
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,310
You still think it's the
fucking championship team.

584
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:33,210
Go get yourself a little team roster
thing and look who's left. You know,

585
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,030
our whole offense is built around thrown
two rookie fucking tight ends and Brady

586
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:41,740
was off yesterday, kept
throwing everything through
the fucking roof, right.

587
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,100
I'm sitting there talking to these people
in this sports bar actually found a

588
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:49,660
cool one where it was kind of mellow
and there wasn't really a, you know,

589
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,740
there's like this insane one
around the corner where people,

590
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:57,310
it's just like you can't even go in
there with your team colors on because if

591
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,010
your team is losing that day,
you're going to want to fight somebody.

592
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:02,860
It's one of those places and it's
just not an enjoyable experience.

593
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,190
So I found this other one where
they have like nice, like, you know,

594
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,300
it's just nice. The decor is nice. It
doesn't have that fucking date rape vibe,

595
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,870
like a lot of sports bars.
Do you know that fucking awful vibe.

596
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,510
The pent up just fucking the,
the amount of fucking, uh,

597
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,830
just pent up, you know,
and then they got the,

598
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,820
those fucking girls always got to
dress like runaways. The waitresses,

599
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,440
it's just creepy. The whole fucking vibe
is creepy. I don't like it. And it's just,

600
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:35,170
yeah, this is awful. So I found this
other sports bar that was, you know,

601
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,750
actually way more mellow.
And I'm sitting there, right.

602
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,560
And I come walking in and by the time I
get there, it's already tend to nothing.

603
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,020
Cleveland and I sit down as this dude
next to me already drinking beers.

604
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,950
The game comes on at like
fucking 10 in the morning.

605
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,660
He's clearly on like his third beer. I
didn't realize he was shit face. I go,

606
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:56,110
Jesus Christ, they go 10 to nothing.
I go, I go, I go, what happened?

607
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,800
And he looks at me, he's like,
Cleveland is up 10 nothing.

608
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,790
I was just like, alright man.
Thank you. Thank you for fucking a

609
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,110
thank you for clearing
that up. You know, um,

610
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,870
and Jesus Christ and they just start.
It was awful.

611
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,900
We just got the living shit
kicked out of it. And you know,

612
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,370
it was funny was last week, this week I
got, I got a ton of emails from jets fans.

613
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:28,420
It was very surprising because last
week I didn't get any from, you know,

614
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:31,600
last week when they lost to the packers.
Nine to nothing at home.

615
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,500
I got like two emails from jets fans
and then this week it was weird,

616
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:40,360
you know, cause I was like, wow, did
do the jets fans not exist anymore?

617
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,250
Then this week all of a sudden I
get this whole avalanche that look,

618
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:48,370
I know all jet fans and all sports fans
aren't like that because a lot of you

619
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,950
didn't send me emails either fucking way.
But those,

620
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:55,240
those fucking sports pussies who fucking
lay in the weeds until their team wins

621
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,290
and then they get out and start talking
shit. You know, let me ask you guys this,

622
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,330
because I've been sitting here
trash in the jets all year.

623
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:04,180
Just let me ask you this real honestly.
Honestly,

624
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,690
do you really think you're going to win
the Superbowl at that team? You know,

625
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,340
cause I have such blind hatred for the
fucking jets after the shit talk and that

626
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,260
they did at the beginning of the year.
Honestly.

627
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,060
Do you really think that that team has,
what the fuck it takes?

628
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,350
All right,
set aside your hot seriously.

629
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,710
Eking out a victory against the lions.

630
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,940
You eked out a victory against the
dolphins and you eat one out against the

631
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:31,511
Broncos,

632
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:35,870
two out of three of those games where not
for a bone head fucking penalty by the

633
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:39,200
other Goddamn team.
You know,

634
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,240
you could have lost one or maybe both
of us to add to your two fucking losses.

635
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,800
Now, if I'm a jet fan, I gotta be
thinking, no, if I'm a jet fan,

636
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:51,290
I got to be thinking of the one
thing I got going for myself

637
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,140
is that nobody is dominating in the AFC.

638
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,850
Nobody is, you know, that's the
one thing that I would take.

639
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,500
I would take pride in the fact because
the jets have not really dominated

640
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,780
anybody.
Have they?

641
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,600
They kicked the shit out of the Patriots,

642
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,390
but that wasn't until the second
I'll actually was this second half,

643
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,570
second half of the second quarter they
did. But other than that, I don't know.

644
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm not too impressed.

645
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:25,310
I think that they're fucking offensive
line might be the best in the league and

646
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:28,070
Sanchez just sits back there
in a fucking lawn chair.

647
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,680
But I think if they actually
go up against, I dunno

648
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:37,220
the giants, I, yeah, I just,

649
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,300
I don't fucking see it.

650
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,490
You know what I'm basically saying
is that when Joe Nemeth finally dies,

651
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,110
I hate to say it,

652
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:48,470
I think you guys are going to have to
get them stuffed and mounted so you can

653
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:53,471
still wheel them out onto the
field to get you to get that.

654
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:54,410
He's like,

655
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,950
you're newt Rockne and then he can stick
one of those things in the side of his

656
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,120
neck way.
Uh,

657
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,140
well you just pull the
fucking you Paulette and the
string and he starts talking.

658
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,180
I think the jets are going to make
a great play. I want to kiss you.

659
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,260
You just have it sorta half fucking
shit faced. Half inspirational speech.

660
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,020
Oh Jesus. So next week we play the
fucking Steelers in. Uh, I dunno.

661
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,130
I Dunno what's going to happen.

662
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,860
I think we're actually gonna have a
nice competitive fucking game with them

663
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,600
somehow.
It makes no sense,

664
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,760
which is why I have to stop fucking
gambling because I got to admit as much.

665
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,950
Um, I can't even say it really hurt cause
I don't give a fuck about Cleveland. Um,

666
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:37,820
and I also, you know, it's no
surprise that our defense sucks.

667
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,880
Um, the game that pissed me off the most
yesterday was the fucking Kansas City

668
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,330
chiefs game. The, this, these
were my pics yesterday. Okay.

669
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,510
I've got this thing going,
Paul Versey right. Um,

670
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,640
you got to pick four games a fucking week.
The end of the year,

671
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:56,550
the guy takes the pot, right?
So I got the cheat, I got the,

672
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,800
I got the bears against buffalo
bears given three. I tied that game,

673
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,203
right?

674
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,750
Then I picked Tampa and Tampa against
Atlanta getting eight and a half.

675
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:12,620
I fucking won that game.
I had green bay given seven,

676
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:17,330
whatever the fuck against the hapless
fucking cowboys, right to all in one.

677
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,720
Nobody's gone undefeated.
I had the fucking Kansas City chiefs,

678
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,460
those fucking assholes. One that Goddamn
game and just decided to give it away.

679
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,573
Oh,

680
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,470
I really want to blame the fucking but
it at that fucking Matt Cassel, he just,

681
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,580
he just drove me fucking nuts. Those
fucking receivers not catching the ball.

682
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:44,630
Oh, kip. Fuck the Kansas City
chiefs. Fucking Goddamn assholes.

683
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,740
Do you see that fucking call chief's fans?
You see,

684
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:50,820
you see that pass interference call the
end of the fucking game when the Raiders

685
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,450
were down by two. I can see,
this is why I think it's fixed.

686
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,940
And this is why I think I'm, I'm, I'm,

687
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,690
I would never gamble other than just
with a buddy. Like I don't, I honestly,

688
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,380
I don't know how you fucking gamblers
do it because the level of fucking

689
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:08,610
emotions that you go through when you
have money on the game is nothing.

690
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,990
Nothing compared to you just
loving your hometown teen.

691
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,260
All those fucking douchebags
Lou go out to the Raiders gains,

692
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,000
then they fucking dress like
spark or whatever the fuck it is.

693
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,900
Spock with like spikes coming out of
their shoulders as much as they think that

694
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:27,840
they give a fuck.
You know,

695
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,130
you don't give a fuck as much as
some guy who's not even from Oakland,

696
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,140
who's got money on that fucking game.

697
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,700
I'm telling you why the fucking levels.
So God damn low,

698
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,900
take it's time to get a new uh,
recording here.

699
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,160
People have been bitching a little bit.

700
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,870
Seeing the levels are a
little bit quiet here.

701
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,740
Got To make sure I forgot this shit
going here. Hello? Test one. There we go.

702
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,940
All right,
so anyways,

703
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,400
when that fucking ref called that pass
interference and then they show the

704
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:00,180
replay and the announcers are just like,
oh, let's see what's going on here.

705
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:05,760
Doesn't seem to be any CARTEC Lil g,
Mike, I'll tell you I didn't see anything.

706
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,300
And then they just continue on. Nobody
starts going, well why the fuck?

707
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,940
How the fuck do you call something
that didn't even happen, you know?

708
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,380
I mean I can see missing
some shit that happened.

709
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:22,470
It's like fucking 22 goddamn
people out there running around.

710
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,860
How the fuck he supposed to see
everything. But how do you call some shit?

711
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,600
That didn't even fucking happen.

712
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,770
I swear to God,
I think it's fucking fixed on some level.

713
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,430
Something fucked up is going on and
I challenged my listeners. I right,

714
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,930
you fuckers defend that. How is, you know,

715
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,010
I really do sound like something asshole
who lost money on a fucking game.

716
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,850
How do you call some shit that didn't
happen. I get it. 22 fucking people.

717
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,990
I get how you can miss something. It's
like standing in grand central station.

718
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:58,530
Everybody's going every which
way. Somebody, oh my God.

719
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,780
Do you see that then homeless guy
just took a shit on the floor.

720
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:04,020
Did you see that? Actually I didn't.
I was staring at that checks. Tits.

721
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,560
I missed it.
I get that.

722
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,330
But how do you call die?

723
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,620
Dare fucking 15 yards for shitting on
the floor and there's no shit on the on

724
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,990
the floor.
That's such a stupid fucking example.

725
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:21,540
This is how mad I was so fucking mad
when the refs missed that God damn call.

726
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,830
Thank gave it fucking didn't miss the
call. Just invented that fucking call.

727
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,710
Gave the fucking Raiders of
first down. No, I see that.

728
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,860
That fat fuck dude who got caught with
the date rape drug warming up his leg and

729
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,750
I know he can kick it
from fucking Siberia.

730
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,400
So items like this game's fucking over.

731
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,430
It's going to go into OT and I
shut the game off and I just, I,

732
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:46,000
I picked up the remote control and
I just started walking. Just, just,

733
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,680
just slamming it methodically.

734
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,110
Like that fucking Slingblade guy write
it down on Dwight Yoakam's fucking head.

735
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:59,910
Just, just, I actually, I got,

736
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:04,911
I got so fucking mad at [inaudible]
just courtesy to my girl.

737
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,590
I just, I walked, I grabbed my phone,

738
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,260
I have fucking Hoodie and
I just started walking,

739
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,340
started walking up the street like,
fuck, I didn't know where I was going.

740
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,810
Tourette's. Fucking God get fucking piece
of shit. Fucking reps. No fucking way.

741
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,800
Fuck you fucking costs something.
That didn't even fucking happen.

742
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,713
I should be three.

743
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,010
Oh and fucking book people walking by
with their pubs just staring at me.

744
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,270
I'm trying to act like I'm talking on my
cell phone. I'm not talking to myself.

745
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,130
I'm talking to that fucking ref, that
piece of Shit Raf. I swear to God,

746
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:41,740
if I was running the fucking
league and at the end of the game,

747
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,770
some fucking ref made a goddamn call that
that overtly affected the point spread

748
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,770
and he made a call.
It didn't even fucking happen.

749
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,070
That son of a bitch would be in
my office Monday fucking morning.

750
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,630
I'd have his phone built, laying on
the table, his visa, mastercard bills,

751
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,240
his fucking passport,
all of his shit.

752
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:04,000
And I'll be looking at his life and I
would figure out who the fuck this guy

753
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:08,230
owes money to that you can make
a a horseshit call like that.

754
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,200
All right, I'm back. That's what happened
to me. I fucking walked up the hill,

755
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,840
so God damn pissed.
I started walking into the Goddamn hills,

756
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,450
walking up to the street and
look, the sun's going down, right?

757
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,230
I get to the top of the Goddamn hill and
I realize I'm right at the foot of this

758
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:30,910
fucking park that has a bunch
of God damn coyotes, you know,

759
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,330
and I'm, I'm not there. I'm not
there with my fucking pit bull.

760
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,420
I don't have my security with me and
I'm just walking up there and then I was

761
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,730
thinking like, Jesus Christ,
what if I get mauled to death

762
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,210
by a pack of coyotes?

763
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,860
That would be the dumbest
death ever comedian, Malta,

764
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:52,180
death by coyotes because the chiefs
didn't cover against the Raiders.

765
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,400
And right there I was just like,
you know what?

766
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:01,840
This gambling shit is the dumbest
shit you can ever do to yourself.

767
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:06,220
If you've never gambled, don't
do it. Don't put money on a game.

768
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,780
It literally,
it ruins your football Sunday.

769
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,750
It fucking ruins it.
It's losing money on a game.

770
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:18,160
I'm telling you is so much worse
than just watching your team lose.

771
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,370
You know, your team loses, they
fucking lose, but you still,

772
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:25,840
you can still go out and go buy yourself
a slice of pizza. Right. You know,

773
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:30,170
maybe that key you had your eye
on. All right, that's enough.

774
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:34,820
That's enough with the sports
this fucking week I believe. Um,

775
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:38,450
so congratulations to the Co,
uh, the Cleveland browns fans.

776
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,440
I'm actually in some weird way.
It's Kinda hard cause you beat my team.

777
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:45,820
I'm actually excited that
you guys look like a,

778
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,600
maybe you finally pick the right
quarterback after years of, you know,

779
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,280
the Cleveland browns is kind of
like the Chicago bears or the East,

780
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,890
you know, where they just, I don't know,

781
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,930
they always get that Cade mcdowney Tim
couch or whatever the fuck his name or

782
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,280
they always get that guy,

783
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,890
that guy who was the fifth runner
up Heisman trophy guy, you know,

784
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,610
and they did it again this year with
Colt Mccoy and he, he looked great.

785
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:19,010
He fucking looked great. Stepping up
into the pocket, ran one for a touchdown.

786
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:21,440
He was fucking rolling out
throwing the ball on the run.

787
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:25,970
Like fucking Doug Flutie.
I Dunno, whatever.

788
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,660
What the fuck are you going to
do? God dammit, we got raped.

789
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,820
She got raped in Cleveland, uh, right
next to the rock and roll hall of fame.

790
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:36,830
Just to add insult to injury.

791
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,060
And then I got to get all these
emails from these jets fans. You know,

792
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,250
they were all laying in the fucking weeds,
just waiting for the Patriots to lose.

793
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,470
You know,

794
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,830
I was amazed at how quickly I got the
emails from them considering they had to

795
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:55,880
clean four quarters in one OT
of shit out of their pants.

796
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,570
Um, if you are going to,
if you are going to gamble,

797
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:07,190
I got to tell you that I met the, the cat
might be out of the bag, but there's a,

798
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:12,200
I love teams right now like Cleveland,
the lions.

799
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,810
Um, who else? There's was
one other one. The rams.

800
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,000
If those teams are on the road and they're
getting any sort of sizeable points,

801
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,230
uh,

802
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:29,230
I would go with those guys just because
they have competitive fucking teams.

803
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,830
Like uh,
they just lie in his head,

804
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:36,190
a great fucking draft and they keep,

805
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,200
they keep being like fucking five
point underdogs and that type of shit.

806
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,060
I don't know. Then they blow it in the
fucking, and that's the only thing.

807
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,970
Cause if they let up a touch them,
then you loo ads all fucking fixed.

808
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,880
How could it not be fixed? How do
you know, how do they pick the eggs?

809
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,890
The perfect fucking number. Every
God damn week. How do they do that?

810
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:57,920
You know,
if it's so fucking hard for me,

811
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,950
I don't get it.

812
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,240
Like literally be like if
I picked one game a week,

813
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,090
I should have a 50 50
chance of winning it. Right.

814
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:11,750
And after 1617 weeks with the
buy, I should be, you know,

815
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,600
501 game over one game under,
right.

816
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:17,120
I should be nine and eight or eight and
nine and it never works out that way.

817
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,660
Somehow you, you lose like 60% of the
fucking time. I don't get it there.

818
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,070
Any mathematicians out there,
they can fucking help me
out. I'm all goddamn years.

819
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,920
That piece of Shit fucking rough. This
is what happens too. When you gamble,

820
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,760
then you start fucking no in the names
of referees and that's when you have a

821
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:36,480
fucking problem. You start knowing
the names of backup punters.

822
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,300
I guess some people
know that shit nowadays.

823
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,710
Those fantasy football playing people
do that got him on my fantasy team.

824
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,360
Um, what the fuck on my questions
for the week. All right,

825
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:51,450
that was 20 minutes of sports. I really
good. Let's, let's talk politics.

826
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,030
Let's talk.
Let's talk politics.

827
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,140
The elections where this past week,
where are you guys excited?

828
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,250
Are you excited that we
took the country back?

829
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,600
How many times are we going to do
that in these elections? You know,

830
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,950
like two years ago,

831
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:15,120
I remember everything was the Republican's
fault and then they vote in all

832
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:19,890
democrats and people were like, yeah,
we took the country back, right?

833
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,280
Two years,
fucking later,

834
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,460
they voted all Republicans and they
say the exact same fucking thing.

835
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,390
This is the theme this week is
that everything is fucking rigged.

836
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,260
You can't tell me you, you
can't. You don't notice

837
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,890
that no matter who you put in now,

838
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,860
it doesn't really make a difference
that this sort of, this, this common,

839
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,120
that toe in this, the same line. Anybody,

840
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,950
anybody noticed that none of them are
talking about bankers and how they took $1

841
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,230
trillion. No one's talking about
that and just kept the shit.

842
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:55,290
No one's talking about that.
No one's talking about, uh,

843
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,620
how all these companies have fucking
taken all the manufacturing out of this

844
00:54:58,621 --> 00:55:00,540
country.
We probably need to reverse NAFTA.

845
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,690
They'd probably be a good fucking idea.
No one's talking about that,

846
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,810
that Democrat or Republican,
the Algiers,

847
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,550
I think it's time to get
this country back to work.

848
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,620
Everybody starts screaming
like something's going to
fucking happen. You know,

849
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:17,330
Federal Reserve just printed another
$600 million out of thin fucking errands,

850
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,140
buying up bonds. It's, nobody's didn't,
nobody's talking about that shit.

851
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,370
Nothing,
nothing.

852
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:27,090
All they talking about is fucking family
values and getting people back to work

853
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,080
and a hard working Americans and
all this lip service, you know,

854
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,400
and then people vote Democrat
or Republican, right? Which
is your fucking right.

855
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,910
But then whenever I tell him I voted for,
uh,

856
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,790
somebody outside those two
parties who actually says, hey,

857
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,470
why don't we audit the Federal Reserve?

858
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,700
Why don't we figure out why there are
private corporation yet somehow print the

859
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:51,480
money for this country? They always
tell me that that's a waste of a vote.

860
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,970
So then you vote for fucking,
I don't get it.

861
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,320
I really don't fucking get it.
So I have one gives a shit.

862
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,310
This whole country's going
down the fucking shit.

863
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,600
Or everybody's just sitting
there yelling at each other,

864
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,370
fucking tea party screaming at people.

865
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,690
I fucking give it thought,
you know,

866
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I just find the whole thing
unbelievably fucking a depressing.

867
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,880
I think the world is run by
sociopath's and who manipulate morons.

868
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,053
You know,

869
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,160
you've got this whole sea of morons
could fill up the Pacific Ocean with the

870
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,200
amount of morons,
you know,

871
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:40,060
tell me what to thank those people and
then the sociopath's tell them what to

872
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:43,870
think in. Whoever's the best at
telling them what to think wins.

873
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:47,470
Gi Bill. That was fucking deep. I know.

874
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:50,170
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking above. You know what it is?

875
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:54,070
I just like the people who,
uh,

876
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,160
I don't know.
I got my me and explain it.

877
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,780
I just slides just like people who
just go, this, this is bullshit.

878
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,470
This is fucking fixed.
I like those guys.

879
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,650
I don't like people who go, uh, you
know, you know who are in the Jesus.

880
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,111
You know what?

881
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:13,960
This podcast went off the fucking
rails at least three minutes ago.

882
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:14,771
I don't even want him to say,
you know what?

883
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm so fucking stupid that I don't even
realize that I'm one of those morons in

884
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,120
the Pacific Ocean.

885
00:57:19,121 --> 00:57:23,290
That here I am trying to have this deep
fucking thought about politics and I

886
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:26,080
don't even have the fucking wherewithal,
the brainpower

887
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,180
to even convey my own thoughts.
So with that,

888
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,240
let's go with the obscure sports
stat of the week. This is a new,

889
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,350
this is for all the, the, the
sports nerds out there. Uh,

890
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,210
this is the obscure sports stat of the
week. This is a new segment. All right?

891
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,420
This is something I didn't
realize is how much, um,

892
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,680
teams from Massachusetts from
Boston have dominated St Louis.

893
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,450
Here's the tests. I was in Saint Louis
two weeks ago and somebody hit me.

894
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,210
Hit me with this stat. All
right, well, the last time

895
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,320
the St Louis Cardinals, uh, lost a world
series they lost to the Boston red sox.

896
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:10,710
The last time the city of
St Louis lost the Superbowl.

897
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,610
They lost to the New England patriots.

898
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,320
The last time the city is St Louis
lost a Stanley Cup finals game.

899
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,050
They lost to the Boston Bruins

900
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:26,890
and the most obscure of obscure the
last time St Louis lost in NBA finals in

901
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:34,060
1960 61 the St Louis Hawks
lost to the Boston Celtics.

902
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,860
We fucking own you guys.
St Louis. You hear me?

903
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,500
We've owned you since 60 61 and what
have you done about it? Nothing.

904
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,840
I'm all right. I'm bored shitless. Was
Sports too. Let's, let's move on here. Um,

905
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,410
what do we got here? Oh,
last week I asked you guys,

906
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,590
you know I was talking about that woman
who kept clearing her throat in a really

907
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:59,860
annoying way behind me on the plane.

908
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,830
And I presented this question to you.
I said,

909
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:07,720
what would happen if the most interesting
man in the world met the most annoying

910
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:10,330
woman on the planet?
What would happen?

911
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,740
And I asked you guys for your theories
and I got a bunch of them and I'm going

912
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:17,290
to try to read them now
and not fuck it up. Um,

913
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,620
this is what people had to
say without saying a word.

914
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:26,470
He can make even the biggest con shut up
and do the fucking dishes because he is

915
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,310
the most interesting man in the world.

916
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,030
All right. That's theory
number one. Theory number two,

917
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,900
most entering,

918
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,960
most interesting man plus contiguous
woman equals most miserable man.

919
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,570
That's pretty much yet bill.
Uh,

920
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:48,920
that is if your question implied in
inherent attraction between the two,

921
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:53,180
if it's just like a chance encounter,
like at a party or something like that,

922
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:56,600
the most instant interesting man would
probably just say it's such an annoying

923
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,150
cunt and he'd be on his merry way.
However,

924
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,480
if the two decided to form a relationship,

925
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,370
the most annoying woman would just siphon
everything interesting away from the

926
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:12,371
most interesting man chiseling him down
to a being that could equate her level

927
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:17,090
of unjustifiable existence. And then
he writes, wow, that's depressing.

928
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,870
Uh, someone should advertise
some pss or something.

929
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,660
There is no shame in a harrowing hunt.

930
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,750
So please do not settle for an annoying,
um,

931
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,000
brought to you by the people who hate
country throat clears allocated to their

932
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:36,130
immediate ear space. Um, all right,

933
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,420
let's move on with the
youtube videos for the week.

934
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:40,910
I'm going to blow through some topics
here just for some people cause I really,

935
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:43,700
I, I gotta I gotta tone down the
sports on this fucking thing.

936
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:46,610
It's just becoming the fucking,
uh,

937
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,380
beer and wings podcast here. Uh, youtube,

938
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,950
youtube videos of the week. Uh,
look at garbage day original.

939
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,020
All these, by the way, will be up
on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Uh,

940
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:06,590
look at garbage day original. And this
one right here, this one is from me.

941
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,660
And I think this is one of the
greatest fucking lines ever uttered in,

942
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,740
uh,
in movies ever.

943
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:20,000
Certainly in any sort of
teen movie that was a,

944
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:23,510
that's about teens rebelling.
This movie's called over the edge.

945
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,780
I believe it came out in 1979. Oh
yeah, that's what's over the edge.

946
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:31,760
1979 part nine. And, uh,

947
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,090
and just looking at that and you know,

948
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,950
I also started off with
revenge of the nerds.

949
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,000
That speech on this podcast that kind
of made me just think of some classic

950
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:45,810
movies could end bed. Ah, here's ALP.

951
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,430
Look up Al Pachino,
a great ass extended version.

952
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,183
Um,

953
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,770
one of the greatest actors of all time
with one of the worst performances I've

954
01:01:57,771 --> 01:02:01,880
ever seen in my life. And,
uh, what else do I got?

955
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,180
Incident at subway.
Check that one out.

956
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:08,390
Some kid at subway wants to fight every
fight. Somebody behind the counter.

957
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,880
And Jesus, I didn't know
what's going on. Um, Nino,

958
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,470
uh, what else? Underrated. Overrated.

959
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,420
What happened to this podcast?

960
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:24,480
Something at 22 minutes happen at this
podcast in order to just as I went

961
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:28,320
outside and I'm still wearing my fucking
hooded sweatshirt and I think I'm

962
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:31,200
getting too fucking hot and it's
siphoning all the goddamn funny up.

963
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:34,200
But now I can't take it off because
I have my fucking headphones on.

964
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,980
So I gotta lay the microphone down
as they slowly take this fucking,

965
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,920
all right, here we go. Now I'm ready. Oh,

966
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:44,850
I remember what I was going to do.

967
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:49,530
I was going to tell you guys the
story this week. I did this awesome,

968
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,520
unbelievable fucking Gig. Um, it was, uh,

969
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:57,350
the Bob would riff fund whatever you call,
uh,

970
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,730
uh,
Jesus Christ.

971
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,070
I really thought that this story was
going to get the podcasts go on again.

972
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:04,200
What the fuck was it called?
The Bob Woodward,

973
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,860
a charity fund auction thing.

974
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:11,070
Bob Woodward was a reporter.
Uh, he was in Iraq.

975
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,880
He got hit by a roadside bomb,
made a miraculous recovery.

976
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:18,960
And this is the fourth annual one where
they raise money for his foundation.

977
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,990
That's the word I was looking for his
fucking foundation to raise money for it,

978
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:27,640
for, uh, you know, for troops who,

979
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,150
who've been injured in battle in that
type of thing. Just one of those, those,

980
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,390
those charities you just cannot say
no to. You have to do it. And, uh,

981
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:38,270
it was all the way back in New York
City at the Beacon Theater, uh,

982
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,900
for music fans out there.

983
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:43,290
They know that the almond brothers have
been doin the beacon run for like the

984
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,300
last 30 fucking years.

985
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,770
So already I'm thrilled to be there just
because I'm gonna be standing on the

986
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:53,430
same stage as Duane almond. And, uh,

987
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:55,940
and I showed up in the,

988
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:59,790
in the lineup that I went on was the
most insane lineup I have ever been on.

989
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,640
Um, in my career. This
was the lineup. All right?

990
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,130
Max Weinberg was there and he
put together this big band,

991
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:11,730
so they're out there fucking killing it.
Jon Stewart was the host.

992
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:16,860
He goes out and he kills it talking
about politics in a very funny way,

993
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:21,090
unlike the Horse Shit that I did on
my podcast, a, he fucking kills it.

994
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,890
Then he brings out Tony Bennett,
Tony fucking Bennet,

995
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,330
who sings two songs, absolutely kills
it, sounds as good as he did 40,

996
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:32,700
50 years ago.
Just kills it.

997
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,870
Then they bring out John Stewart
comes back out, does some more jokes,

998
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,540
kills again.
Then he brings out Bruce Springsteen.

999
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Fucking Bruce Springsteen goes out
there and just fucking owns to stage,

1000
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:50,370
sliding around, jumping up on the
piano, tells him, telling jokes,

1001
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:54,300
just just fucking kills it.
Uh, then they had an auction,

1002
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,040
at least fucking rich people's played
like 150 grand for one of Bruce

1003
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,480
Springsteen's guitars, raised all this
money. Then the second half of the show,

1004
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:08,481
they bring out Joel Mchale who had to go
on after Tony Bennett and fucking Bruce

1005
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,530
Springsteen,
and he still somehow killed it.

1006
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:15,240
Then I went up and then the final act
of the evening was Jerry Seinfeld. Well,

1007
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,060
it's the do Jerry fucking Seinfeld,
the king,

1008
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:21,040
the master.
Right.

1009
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:26,041
And I'm on stage when I went out there
and my whole nervousness of the night was

1010
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:31,981
not going on after those people was my
nervousness was the fact that nobody had

1011
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,280
said fuck yet. And it
was a benefit, you know,

1012
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:39,700
and people talking about tragedy and I
was going to go out there and my opening

1013
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,310
bit was talking about,
you know, hitting women.

1014
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,320
So I'm backstage just like mine,
fucking myself going on guys.

1015
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,400
It's gonna be too harsh.
I shouldn't curse.

1016
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,370
Jerry's going to get mad
at me the second I curse.

1017
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,910
He's gonna look at me like I'm
not even a comedian, you know,

1018
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:59,350
and I so badly want his fucking approval,
you know,

1019
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,580
so I'm sitting there freaking out,
finally my age. It just goes, dude, gee,

1020
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,410
you see what Springsteen just did? He
went out. He just does what he does,

1021
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:12,190
jumps on pianos. Just go out there and
do what the fuck you do. I was like,

1022
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:16,570
you know what, you're right. You're right.
So I went out there and I, I definitely,

1023
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:19,750
I didn't say fuck as much as I
usually did, but I went out there,

1024
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:24,470
I did my get hit by women, uh,
hitting women, all that type of shit,

1025
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:25,510
a fucking killed.

1026
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,550
And when I get off stage and
walking and is going on next,

1027
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:35,410
so I'm walking off the stage
and there he is fucking Seinfeld

1028
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,680
who at this point it's,
it's like,

1029
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:43,240
it's like looking at Elvis Goddamn icon
is stand there and his suit just ready

1030
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:45,520
to go to work. And I
walked by him. I'm just,

1031
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:49,810
I'm just wincing when I'm waiting from
just completely blow me off or just be

1032
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:53,380
like, why did you say
fuck so much? You know?

1033
01:06:53,381 --> 01:06:58,381
And I walked by him and he fucking sticks
his hand out and he just goes really

1034
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:03,460
funny stuff. Really, really
funny stuff. And I was just like,

1035
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,540
oh, thanks a lot. You know,

1036
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:08,470
I try not to curse so much out of
respect for you going on, going on next.

1037
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:09,670
And he goes,
well I don't care.

1038
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,410
Then it felt like an idiot.

1039
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,140
I'm sitting in me and I'll nervous
like a little schoolgirl now.

1040
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:20,980
Just realize like, wait a minute, Jerry
has always worked totally fucking clean.

1041
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,770
He came up in the late seventies,
right through the 80s with all these,

1042
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,570
these barroom hack comics doing blow.
I mean,

1043
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:33,520
the amount of shit that that guy had
to go on after working squeaky fucking

1044
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:37,690
clean. He can't follow me. Well,
what the hell was I thinking?

1045
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,580
And I would say that he couldn't
follow me. I didn't think of that.

1046
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:43,630
He would be annoyed and a
then I stood there, you know,

1047
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:46,960
feeling like feeling like I was 90
miles in the air because he said that he

1048
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:49,330
thought that I was funny
or that it had good stuff.

1049
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:53,920
And then I watched him go out
there and it just absolute, uh,

1050
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:58,720
and not to bring up sports again,
but I guess I have to, you know,

1051
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:01,810
any port in a fucking storm here.
It was like watching a, you know,

1052
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:06,010
when somebody is just, just has
the, the, just the perfect swing,

1053
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,730
perfect jumpshot their form or
whatever that that's what it was like.

1054
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:12,580
There was just everything that he did,
there wasn't one wasted word,

1055
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:17,570
one wasted movement. Every everything,
okay, you want to talk moves.

1056
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,610
It's like toy story.
You go to see toy story.

1057
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:22,760
It's like every line in the movie
just propels the thing forward.

1058
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:27,170
There's not a line of fat in that
fucking script and it's just,

1059
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,540
just like his act and he
goes out there and just,

1060
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:33,890
just absolutely fucking destroyed.
And uh,

1061
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:35,601
it was awesome.

1062
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:39,950
The other than other night that I had
that ever compared to that was one night I

1063
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:44,030
was down at the comedy cellar in the,
uh, in the village in New York City.

1064
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,860
And,
um,

1065
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:51,190
that's the club where if you want to
see if go out and see great comedy or if

1066
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:56,921
you want to see a possibly somebody
super famous that's a comedian,

1067
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,880
just drop in and do a set.
That's where I would go.

1068
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,250
And it used to happen all the time.

1069
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:08,690
And One night I was
down the cellar and uh,

1070
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,170
give me name and a lot of names here, but
I, I never named names of the podcast,

1071
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:13,610
but there's nothing bad about this story.

1072
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:17,540
So Godfrey was hosting the show and um,

1073
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,610
you know, I was supposed to, I think I've,
I think it was me. I was going on next,

1074
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,690
but uh, all of a sudden, you know,

1075
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,470
I am, I can't really tell the
story without saying the names.

1076
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:33,350
This is basically just imagine you're
sitting in the fucking crowd. All right?

1077
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,970
You just seeing no name hacks like me
going up and all of a sudden the host goes

1078
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,440
, uh, hey everybody.

1079
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:44,000
We've got a very special guest that
just dropped by wanting to do like five

1080
01:09:44,001 --> 01:09:47,570
minutes. You might recognize
this guy from the hit TV show.

1081
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,800
Everybody loves Raymond.

1082
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,940
Please welcome Ray Romano and ray
walks on stage and the crowd goes,

1083
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:57,050
fucking not totally Fuck
Ray Romano, right? And um,

1084
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,080
as he's on stage,

1085
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,970
Seinfeld and Chris rock show
up and they also want to go on,

1086
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,600
all right, this has happened once
in 20 years of me doing stand up.

1087
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:11,570
This was the most unbelievable
night, right? So they go downstairs,

1088
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:12,770
Ray Romano finishes.

1089
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:18,700
So Godfrey goes back up and he kept doing
these great intros that was making the

1090
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,400
crowd lose their shit. He goes, keep
going for a remodel. He goes, all right,

1091
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,890
we got another special
guest just dropped in.

1092
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,340
You might recognize this guy
from the Chris rock show.

1093
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,810
Please welcome Chris Rock. And then
the fucking place standing ovation.

1094
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,490
Holy Fuck. We got to see fucking
Ray Romano and Chris Rock.

1095
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,480
And now at this point, every comic knows
that Seinfeld is waiting in the wings.

1096
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:42,890
So we're all standing there,

1097
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,760
huddled down in the little hallway
waiting to watch this crowd lose.

1098
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,000
It's fucking shit like those soccer
moms on fucking Oprah, right?

1099
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:54,200
Chris rock kills it.
Godfrey goes up, Chris Rock,

1100
01:10:54,201 --> 01:10:58,700
everybody crown is like out of breath
from fucking laughing. And then he goes,

1101
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,900
uh, we had another guest
dropped by at this point.
People just like, what the fuck?

1102
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:07,670
Right? He goes, you might recognize this
next guy from the hit TV show Seinfeld.

1103
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:12,530
And I hear this guy go no fucking
way in the crowd. And he goes,

1104
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:16,440
please Jerry Seinfeld. And that
like, half the crowd almost fainted.

1105
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:21,990
He goes up and just fucking destroyed.
And like people,

1106
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,350
I like elated. They have like, like
when he's done the everybody's faces,

1107
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,180
like in pain from grilling and from,
from, from grinning. I swear to God,

1108
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:34,230
this is true story, right? So
Seinfeld ends and he goes, ah,

1109
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:37,830
I keep it going for Jerry Seinfeld. He
goes, all right, you guys ready for more?

1110
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:41,670
Show the crowds like flipping
out. And they go, okay,

1111
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:45,480
this next comedian and the crowd at
this point is so goddamn spoiled.

1112
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,860
I'm standing there in the doorway waiting
to go on and everybody is trying to

1113
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:54,420
look around my head for somebody famous
to come on and he's bringing up me.

1114
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,270
He goes, please, you know, you might have
seen him on a VH ones. I love the eighties

1115
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,510
MTVs apartment two F
please welcome bill burn.

1116
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:10,040
I went on stage and there
was just, there was, uh,

1117
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:16,140
a noticeable sense of disappointment at
that point when I walked up to the Mike

1118
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:20,850
and the only way I got out of it
was I just addressed it. I was like,

1119
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:24,030
that's right. Welcome back to reality.
This is what the fuck you paid for.

1120
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,580
And then everybody laughed and
like, all right, he addressed it.

1121
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:29,250
He addressed the fact that
we're disappointed to see him.

1122
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:34,250
And at that point they kind of went along
for the ride and I swear to God in our

1123
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:37,200
later Dave Chappelle went up
and he went up and that was a

1124
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,470
dope. So that night and the
night I just did with the two,

1125
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,100
two most unreal nights that I've
ever seen in a, in standup comedy.

1126
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:50,610
I swear to God, that seller story,
I know it sounds like some bullshit.

1127
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,790
I swear to God it's fucking true.
Um,

1128
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,610
and I don't know why I'm
thinking that you're doubting it.

1129
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:00,630
So if you ever go to New York City and
you just want to go out and check out

1130
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:01,560
some fucking comics,

1131
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:06,561
go to the comedy cellar right
down on a west third and Mcdougal,

1132
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,230
right? I've said that like
9 million times in my life.

1133
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:15,660
Flagging down a cab back in the day when
you could do eight sets on the weekend

1134
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:19,500
every night,
flagging down the cab with the spot money.

1135
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:25,020
Take me to west third and Mcdougal. Do you
want me to think the, the, the highway?

1136
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:29,670
No, you fucking asshole. It's
going to cost me an extra $7. Okay.

1137
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:32,380
There's a lot of traffic.
All right,

1138
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:36,960
you Dick fucking take the other one.
You son of a bitch. What do I care?

1139
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,101
What do I care?

1140
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:42,510
Someday I'll have my own podcast and
I'll be selling ringtones at 99 cents a

1141
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:47,010
whack. Just raking in the
fucking money. Um, all right,

1142
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:51,330
let's get to underrated. Overrated
for this week. Um, all right.

1143
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:56,190
This first underrated overrated that
I'm going to read is a, this goes,

1144
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,110
this transcends the topic
of underrated overrated.

1145
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:05,460
Because what you re not only did he
get to hear this person's underrated

1146
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:10,320
overrated.
You get to see why having a tragic,

1147
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:16,090
uh, childhood and I dunno.

1148
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,130
I Dunno what, uh, yeah.

1149
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,730
Basically that leads you to
be fucking hilarious because

1150
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,180
all right, let me just
read this shit. This is,

1151
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:27,280
this is from the same fucking person.
Alright.

1152
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:31,360
Underrated your new girlfriend being
hotter than your ex-girlfriend.

1153
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:37,270
Uh, that first face to face
meeting between them is priceless.

1154
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:41,450
That's right. She's hotter and
skinnier than you enjoy the,

1155
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,510
the eating disorder.
You can't.

1156
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,600
So right off the bat you'd think,
wow, that's kind of harsh. The fuck.

1157
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:54,280
Where does that come from? You learn
where this comes from in is overrated.

1158
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:57,880
Overrated.
Your Dad telling you he loves you.

1159
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,870
I heard you fag.
I'm not saying it back now.

1160
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:05,500
Tell that fat bitch you left mom
for her to get me a fresh beer.

1161
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:15,130
Now I'm gonna tell you right now,
if this dude ever did stand up,

1162
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19,030
he would be the guy that the comedians
hang in the back of the club.

1163
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:22,090
Watching onstage is the crowds groaning,

1164
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:26,650
laughing their fucking ass off because
they're relating to everything that he's

1165
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:31,180
saying. Those are two classics. Those
are two fucking classics right there.

1166
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,960
Um, I heard you the first
time fag. I'm not saying it

1167
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,550
just completely walled off with the
emotions. Ah, that's fucking great.

1168
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:47,530
That's a funny guy right
there. You already know it.
You know what? Anyways, um,

1169
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,310
underrated modern horror movies.
Um,

1170
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,930
being that it was Halloween last week,

1171
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,960
every channel had a horror movie marathon
of some sorts and I watched some of

1172
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:02,410
them. What happened to horror
films? They used to be scary. Um,

1173
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,780
it might be that I have grown up,

1174
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,740
but I think the real problem is that
they spend most of their time trying to

1175
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:12,640
grow south. The audience. Have
you actually seen the movie saw?

1176
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,140
Um, the first one was good, but after
that they just try to make you throw up.

1177
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:18,941
I mean,

1178
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:23,140
does the movie really need a two minute
sequence of a guy being injected with

1179
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:27,850
acid and melting? Did that really happen?
That's kind of why I stopped watching.

1180
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:28,920
I saw the first song.

1181
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:31,990
I thought it was interesting and I started
to watch the second one and I'm like,

1182
01:16:31,991 --> 01:16:35,620
this is just gross.
This isn't really a scary,

1183
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,320
it's like a, it's like
scary g, uh, like no,

1184
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:46,180
it's like an even grosser jackass.
Right? Does that make any sense?

1185
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:50,170
F let me just keep reading this Goddamn
Shit. Why am I trying this week? Um,

1186
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,590
anyways, he goes on to say it would
be okay if they were unpredictable,

1187
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:56,860
but they always make the killer
the most obvious choice choice,

1188
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,940
which just makes it obvious. Did
that make sense? Yes, it did.

1189
01:17:00,941 --> 01:17:05,770
Why did you lose confidence in the
end? Um, no, I totally agree with you.

1190
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:07,420
I think the problem with a lot of movies,

1191
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:12,050
both action movies and horror movies
is that the special effects are so

1192
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:16,610
unbelievable now that that's
what they focus on. This happens,

1193
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:17,720
this happens,
this happens.

1194
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:21,740
And then the fucking special effects
that they don't build any suspense,

1195
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:23,720
you know,

1196
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,870
and they don't really build the characters
where you give a shit about them and

1197
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:28,040
you're rooting for them.
The amount of,

1198
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,040
I just like mentally tap out of
most of them. And I'm like, well,

1199
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:33,530
this guy is the lead,
so there's no way he's going to die or us,

1200
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:37,010
the movie would be over.
So what's the fucking point of this?

1201
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:41,150
And like I always bring it back to a
perfect storm. Like I could give a shit.

1202
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:43,850
You know,
by the time they got to the wave,

1203
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:48,380
I was like rooting for the wave because I,
I didn't care about their,

1204
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,860
their pathetic attempt to try to bring
some nobility to these guys who went

1205
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:57,990
fishing. They just so gloss over glossed
over the whole fucking thing I had.

1206
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:02,060
I didn't even give a shit. So
I would agree with you sir. Um,

1207
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:08,000
what else do we got here? A
underrated cane sugar. Seriously.

1208
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:12,320
So much better than that. High fructose
crap. Pepsi throwback is awesome.

1209
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,870
You know what? I'm going to try
it just because you said that,

1210
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:19,250
and I'm not even a big soda guy.
I'm underrated going to a concert.

1211
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,870
Most people I know have never been,

1212
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:24,710
never had the full concert experience
of going to see someone you love and

1213
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:29,570
seeing them live on stage, killing
it and leaving, uh, leaving def,

1214
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:33,420
sweaty, tired, bruised, and
loving every second of it. Uh,

1215
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,820
you're probably facing the same problem
with people going out to see stand up.

1216
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,010
Actually, I've got to be at
Mit. I've been really lucky,

1217
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:45,030
but lucky people have been coming out to
my shows. Uh, but anyways, he says, uh,

1218
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:48,410
they think it's going to be the
same thing as watching it on TV.

1219
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:51,650
I remember the first time I saw
you, do you stand up act? Um,

1220
01:18:51,651 --> 01:18:54,050
it was also the first time
I'd ever seen a comedy show.

1221
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,690
I'm paraphrasing because I don't
know where I am in this sentence.

1222
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:01,340
First Time we ever saw a comic
was you about four years ago.

1223
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,150
And the live experience of seeing someone
who is good at their craft is just so

1224
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:07,850
much better than watching it on
TV. Well, thank you very much, sir.

1225
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:11,330
And it's considering you just gave
me a little bit of a pat on the back.

1226
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,810
I want to thank everybody who's
gone out and is bought my DVD.

1227
01:19:14,811 --> 01:19:16,250
My DVD is killing it.

1228
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,030
It's still last I checked still
in the top 10 on iTunes. Um,

1229
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:25,910
I can't thank you guys enough this want
to sell and even better than why do I do

1230
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:26,091
this?

1231
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:31,091
Sold and I'm all the emails you guys are
sending me about that extra 21 minutes

1232
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,710
of material that you didn't get to see.

1233
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:38,660
Basically 25% of the special that you
didn't get to see on comedy central. Uh,

1234
01:19:38,661 --> 01:19:41,450
I read all of them.
I appreciate all the uh,

1235
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,290
all the kinds of emails and all
that type of shit. It's nice.

1236
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:49,760
It really offsets all the jet fans
giving me shit to read a nice compliment.

1237
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:54,560
Now jet fans going to write, I love the
DVD and then I'm going gonna open it up.

1238
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,590
Patriots suck. I already know you're
up to that. What do you think?

1239
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,990
I'm a fucking child.
Um,

1240
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,650
but seriously and Christmas is
coming up so keep buying those DVDs.

1241
01:20:03,651 --> 01:20:07,160
It's only like 10 bucks on amazon.com.
And as I stated before,

1242
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:10,950
it makes a great stocking stuffer for
someone you don't give a fuck about,

1243
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,990
but half to buy a gift for, go out,
bang out six of them for 60 bucks.

1244
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:21,030
There you go. Frisbee around. There you
go. You cunt. Fuck you. Dickhead Pussy,

1245
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:25,140
whatever. Up to six people, you know,

1246
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,060
whatever. Just by the goddamn thing.
Okay. My ringtone was such a Goddamn flop.

1247
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:34,070
People actually asking me to make another
ringtone and I feel like a band that's

1248
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:38,920
scratching their head why they haven't
been dropped by their label yet. Um,

1249
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:43,920
which actually segues us into some
of the questions for this week.

1250
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:48,330
If I could find them. Somebody actually
asked me some drum questions. So bill,

1251
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,540
I've got three questions for you after
I heard your drum battle on youtube and

1252
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,820
you didn't suck a,

1253
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:58,821
you seem like a relatively good drummer
and extremely good opinionator so I'd

1254
01:20:59,161 --> 01:21:02,760
like to ask your opinion
on some drum things. Um,

1255
01:21:02,761 --> 01:21:07,440
what do you think are some of the
hardest drum songs to play? Well,

1256
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:09,510
for me it would be just about all of them.

1257
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,230
Uh, I, I, uh,

1258
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,610
the hardest ones I would say.
I would say as far as like for a look,

1259
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,450
I'm going to get actually get into this
a little bit cause I really got hardcore

1260
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:26,820
into sports,
you know,

1261
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,420
not even remotely concerned about people
who could give a shit about sports.

1262
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,740
So I'll get into this a little bit for
the musicians out there is I actually

1263
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:39,741
found one of the hardest things to do is
to have the discipline to just sit down

1264
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,810
and try and make what I
could physically play.

1265
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,530
Actually sound good
because I think one of the,

1266
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:54,531
one of the big things when you're learning
an instrument is when you physically

1267
01:21:55,531 --> 01:22:00,060
get something down, you move
onto the next thing. You don't,

1268
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:04,200
you don't stay with it until you can
actually make it sound good and make it

1269
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:08,730
sound good to somebody listening to you
play it. You just, okay, I got that down.

1270
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,411
[inaudible] Pam.
Okay,

1271
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:14,010
now I'm going to move on to the next
fucking thing rather than, you know,

1272
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:17,760
if you learn like a drum fill, you
just get the fill down and you, yeah,

1273
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:20,580
you play a couple of fucking beats and
then you just throw it in. Yeah, yeah,

1274
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:22,440
I got that down.
You don't really have it down.

1275
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:25,950
So one of the hardest things for
me was having a discipline. Um,

1276
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:30,990
and it was something I learned when I was
watching Steve Jordan play drums and I

1277
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:35,370
was listening to him play something
and I was watching it going,

1278
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:40,430
I can physically play what he's playing
and what he's playing is actually really

1279
01:22:40,471 --> 01:22:42,630
simple,
but I could not make it sound.

1280
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,260
1000000th is good is he's
making it sound right now.

1281
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,500
Like he was playing a beat that would
actually be considered lame if I played

1282
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:55,080
it.
And the way he played it,

1283
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:01,300
it sounded unbelievably fresh and it
would make an entire arena just start

1284
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:04,500
smiling and get into whatever
song was being played.

1285
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:09,530
That was the fucking hardest thing is
far as trying to get halfway decent at

1286
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:14,650
drums for me. But as far as, uh,
just songs that are difficult,

1287
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:16,180
any of the shit by John Bonam,

1288
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:21,430
his foot is just so god damn fast
and you can catch up with speed,

1289
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,340
but you just can't play it
the way he fucking plays it.

1290
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,340
And I've had unbelievable arguments
about people like, you know,

1291
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:28,870
the coke and Pepsi argument with,

1292
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:31,510
with White Rock drummers
is who do you like better?

1293
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:35,050
Bottom or Neil Peart this is way
back in the day before all these,

1294
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,300
these other kids came along and I just
fucking killing it and I always pick on

1295
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:41,470
him. I didn't, I didn't think
Neil Peart was anywhere near him.

1296
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,050
I thought Neil Peart was
like a fucking technician.

1297
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,730
He played right on the beat and it was,

1298
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:50,731
sounded very fucking robotic as opposed
to John Bonam who could play once again

1299
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
the simplest fucking fill that I could
physically do but could never play it the

1300
01:23:57,941 --> 01:24:00,400
way he pleased that they just did.
This is the fucking shit.

1301
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,660
It's like watching a great
actor, you know what I mean? Who,

1302
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:08,410
who can just take like a really just
basic fucking monologue and make it the

1303
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:12,220
most interesting God damn
like a Christopher Walken
or even John Goodman that I

1304
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:16,150
was playing. Like I sometimes I forget
what a great fucking actor that guy is.

1305
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:20,800
Um, I dunno, I dunno. So,

1306
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:24,790
but as far as like songs that I would
say is difficult, I would say, uh,

1307
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:30,820
the wanton song is ridiculously difficult
and I think most people play it wrong.

1308
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,100
They actually leave out one bass drum
note where he's playing three in a row and

1309
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:39,430
they only play two in a row at that
fucking tempo was fucking ridiculous.

1310
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,430
Um,
out on the tiles,

1311
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:48,270
that second fill that he does that ends
where he plays a fucking triplet with

1312
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:52,900
one goddamn based Rome is
fucking ridiculous. And then
I also got to admit, uh,

1313
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:58,030
that drum and bass shit and a lot of stuff
that like a, I love really into like,

1314
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:03,280
uh, um, what's his face? A quest
love the shit that he plays.

1315
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:06,520
He's another guy where I think he took
like the Steve Jordan thing to like the

1316
01:25:06,521 --> 01:25:11,260
next level. Um, and he, he does shit.

1317
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:14,260
I don't even know what the fuck
he's doing, but I don't like,

1318
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,490
I'm fucking stutter in here cause I
can't really think of any specific song.

1319
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,260
I'll give you one here that I'm trying,

1320
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,530
that I want to break out my double
pedal because I don't play double bass.

1321
01:25:23,531 --> 01:25:24,790
I just play a single bass drum.

1322
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:27,790
But every once in awhile there's a drama
comes along that's so fucking good.

1323
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:31,290
It makes me want to play double bass.
And um,

1324
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:35,830
I've actually really, uh,
gotten into that band,

1325
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:37,900
lamb of God and uh,

1326
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:42,610
just to warn some of my older listeners,
uh,

1327
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:46,210
this is sort of that, that Rah Rah
Rah Rah Rah kind of fucking singing,

1328
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:50,820
but it's not as bad as some
of the other guys. But they,

1329
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:54,680
they got this song called
break you and this,

1330
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,840
there's a double bass pattern in the
end that I just think is the shit.

1331
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:00,940
I'm sure all you guys who played double
bass, this is a fucking joke for you,

1332
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:06,420
but this is something is the kind of shit
that makes me want to play double bass

1333
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,580
.
Let's see if I got it.

1334
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,230
Does here I can get this

1335
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,300
just sounds ridiculous the way he's
singing. All right, here we go.

1336
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:17,510
Listen to this fucking double
bass pattern. This is Chris Adler.

1337
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:21,470
This is one of my new favorite drummers.
I think this is the shit right here.

1338
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:22,304
Listen to this.
Here we go.

1339
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,440
That shit right there.
That fucking machine

1340
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,000
gun shit actually figured
out what the fuck he's doing.

1341
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:40,260
But I that just amazes me that the entire
band can be on fucking point like that.

1342
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:43,260
And I know you guys are gonna hit me
with a bunch of other double bass drum

1343
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,000
players who are faster or whatever.

1344
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:48,120
I liked their band because
the temple that they play at,

1345
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:52,120
it's still fucking music to me because
some of those other bands I try to get

1346
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:54,400
into, but it's maybe my
ear isn't ready to hear it,

1347
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:58,440
but this shit is so fucking fast
dad.

1348
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:02,220
It loses its effectiveness
that it stops being music.

1349
01:27:02,221 --> 01:27:03,660
It just sounds like a jet

1350
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,480
that's like flying by but never passes
my ears. It's just sitting there

1351
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,030
and my fucking ears. So, uh,
I guess that type of Shit.

1352
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,390
Does that make any fucking sense? Why
did I do with it? What did I do? Um,

1353
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:19,800
let's get to the next question.

1354
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:24,520
Who are some of the best recent
drummers of the past decade? Uh,

1355
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,510
I'll just tell you the guys that I like.
I like everyone from a,

1356
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:34,280
whoever played with those original Chuck
Berry's, I like Ringo, Charlie Watts,

1357
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:40,220
uh, Phil Rudd, Alex Van Halen,
Steve Gadd, Vinny, Vinny,

1358
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:45,730
Kali Uda. Yeah. Uh, Steve,
Steven Adler, Chris Adler,

1359
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:51,090
quest.
There's so many fucking guys.

1360
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:55,780
Um, and I'm going fucking blank on all of
them. I really should have made a list.

1361
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,930
You know what I'll actually
sense to the MM podcast.

1362
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:02,960
I'll send you a couple of youtube videos
of some guys that I think are just

1363
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:06,590
fucking amazing, uh,
amazing drummers. But, uh,

1364
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:09,500
I don't know anybody who gives me the
fucking chills when I listened to them and

1365
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,710
they know that that's
like the big thing that,

1366
01:28:10,711 --> 01:28:13,620
and they make me wish that I
could fucking do it. That's,

1367
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,010
that's how I judge whether a
drummer is good enough, if they,

1368
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:20,390
if they play some shit. And
it's so fucking good that
in might delusional head.

1369
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:25,250
I start driving down the street,
fantasizing that I'm doing it, you know,

1370
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:30,110
during the middle of the greatest HBO
standup special performance ever then then

1371
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:33,710
, then that's, I get into a, I
get into that drummer. All right.

1372
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,040
Number three is good times, bad
times, the only son that you can play.

1373
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:40,460
I can barely play that side, but now
this, I can play some other ones.

1374
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:45,520
I don't know. Did that bore the shit out
of you? Music people who gives a fuck?

1375
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,020
'Em All right,
advice.

1376
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,740
This is going to be the last thing and
I'm going to get on with my day here.

1377
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:56,610
MMM. Advice. Bill, how's it going?
I hope that wherever you're at,

1378
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:59,760
everything is going swell. Lol. All right.

1379
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,630
It's kind of a question about a
relationship. Here's my story.

1380
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:05,250
I'm 19 years old,

1381
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:10,350
19 year old female who's been dating
a 2021 year old male and we've been

1382
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:13,130
together almost five years old,
Geesh,

1383
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,140
five fucking years.

1384
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:22,020
And she writes fucking ridiculous.
Uh, fucking ridiculous. I know.

1385
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:25,200
And our relationship has had its ups
and downs, like any relationship,

1386
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:29,970
but lately I feel like I can't
stay in them anymore. Yeah,

1387
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:33,870
that's understandable. You've been dating
him like half of your fucking life. Um,

1388
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:36,450
I don't know what's wrong
with me or maybe it's him.

1389
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:40,350
I don't know what's going on.
I have no fucking clue.

1390
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,240
But he seems to have a really big
problem with weed. If he isn't high,

1391
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,290
he can't think about anything else
but getting high. Oh God. Here we go.

1392
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,760
His goal in life is to get high
as a fucking kite and giggle.

1393
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:59,010
That's a peaceful, nice fucking
goal. Uh, she writes, what the fuck?

1394
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,980
I don't want to be dating a
weakling who needs a drug,

1395
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:03,570
like who leads a drug like that?

1396
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:06,900
I want a man and I don't
know how to tell him that.

1397
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,310
Every time I tell him I have
a problem with the weed,

1398
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:14,910
we get into a huge argument
and I end up being the bitch.

1399
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:20,810
I just want him to care about me more
than he cares about his weed and it's

1400
01:30:21,031 --> 01:30:22,200
hurting us financially.

1401
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:28,190
We both only make 300 bucks a week and
he's spending 75% of his check on weed,

1402
01:30:28,231 --> 01:30:33,150
cigarettes and gas. I am the breadwinner.
I don't want to be the breadwinner.

1403
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:36,930
I'm so tired of taking
care of his dumb ass. Um,

1404
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,910
he doesn't even seem like he's willing to
change even a little bit. What do I do?

1405
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:46,380
I know I probably sound like a complete
prude, but I'm not at all. Well, anyways,

1406
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,040
uh, I really hope you read this and can
give me some good advice. All right,

1407
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:53,790
ma'am,
you are dating a fucking loser.

1408
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,570
Yeah, you're dating a loser, so you gotta
you gotta get out of it. I mean, the,

1409
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,670
the only red flag in
there is when you said,

1410
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:06,990
I just want him to care about me
more than he cares about his weed.

1411
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:11,400
Now
the only question I have there as well,

1412
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:14,100
what if he was really into playing guitar?
Would you then be like,

1413
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:18,270
I just want him to care more about me
than he does about his guitar playing?

1414
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,850
Because then,
you know,

1415
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:25,500
that's actually a red flag with you
because you could be one of those awful

1416
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:26,220
people.

1417
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,100
Like one of the worst relationships
you can seriously be in is when you're

1418
01:31:29,101 --> 01:31:31,760
dating somebody who,
uh,

1419
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,610
finds your passion to be a threat.

1420
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:39,420
And then they systematically,
like,

1421
01:31:39,421 --> 01:31:44,421
they try to mind fuck you out of basically
either your dream in life all the way

1422
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:49,020
down to just a simple hobby that you have
just because it steals focus from you

1423
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:51,600
paying attention to them,
which I don't think you are in this.

1424
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,440
I think you sound very rational. You
actually said, I don't know if it's me,

1425
01:31:55,441 --> 01:32:00,130
so I don't think you are being like that.
So I have to side with you 100% here.

1426
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,710
All right, let's roll. Let's first of all,

1427
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:04,300
we'll start with your
relationship and just,

1428
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:09,670
just completely ignore the
fact that he's 21 year, 19,

1429
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:12,640
you've been together for five years,
which means when you got together,

1430
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,680
you were 14,
he was 16,

1431
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:18,310
which means at some point he
was 18 and you were under 18,

1432
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,090
so there was some sort of statutory
rape going on there, right?

1433
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,700
Uh, we'll ignore all of that and
just get to the fact like, you know,

1434
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,260
I've met a lot of my listeners would
probably think that I was going to trash

1435
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:35,140
you for you saying that. I,
I am, I'm the breadwinner.

1436
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:38,740
I don't want to be the
breadwinner, you know, and I,

1437
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,950
and I would go out typical fucking broads,
you know,

1438
01:32:41,951 --> 01:32:45,190
they all talk about how they want to be
the independent Goddamn woman and Yada,

1439
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:49,090
Yada, Yada, and all of a sudden they
got to take care of some fucking sponge.

1440
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:52,610
Welcome to my goddamn world. I'm
not, I don't feel that, that,

1441
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:55,930
that you'll like that. I, I know what
you see, a date and a fucking loser.

1442
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:01,540
You're dating a future, a
subject on cops. It seems,

1443
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:06,040
you know, you had, the way you describe
him, it's his he shirtless too.

1444
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,810
This guy's a fucking loser.
He makes 300 bucks a week.

1445
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:15,460
I'm not judging that aspect of it,
but he spends 75% of it on weed,

1446
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:20,250
cigarettes and gas, you
know, right now, uh,

1447
01:33:20,251 --> 01:33:22,380
I'm picturing that guy that,
uh,

1448
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,370
Matthew mcconaughey played in dazed and
confused just hanging around the high

1449
01:33:26,371 --> 01:33:30,580
school. Like, where are the parties,
ed man, you know, with his cool car.

1450
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:35,200
Um, yeah, you got to get out
of the relationship, you know,

1451
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:39,070
and there's nothing wrong as a female if,
if,

1452
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,730
you know, I'm not saying that you go
out and just be a fucking gold digger,

1453
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:46,330
but you want your man to be able to
provide. That's what the fuck we do.

1454
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,810
We provide, we don't
provide, we're useless.

1455
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,770
We don't have a womb right now.
Seriously,

1456
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:59,460
but fucking useless. So I,
uh, I get it. Yeah, you got,

1457
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:03,970
you've got to break up with this guy.
You mean, how many times can you already,

1458
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:07,870
it seems like you're approaching
this guy on egg shells, you know,

1459
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:12,040
he'd be really nice with you. You know,
if you just stop being a fucking loser,

1460
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,410
you're pretty, you're not even saying
that you're being a nice person.

1461
01:34:14,411 --> 01:34:15,790
So if I had to give you any advice,

1462
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:20,200
I would say you need to get out of that
relationship and considering you've been

1463
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:23,880
in it since you're 14,
I think a,

1464
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:28,750
you might be a little codependent and I
think you need to to break up with this

1465
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:31,270
guy,
figure out who the fuck you are,

1466
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:36,510
which will involve you staying single
for a significant period of time and uh,

1467
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,470
and just know that you
don't break ups are painful.

1468
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:47,130
Just prepare yourself for that so you
don't go running back to this fucking

1469
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:51,280
loser and waste another five
years of your fucking life.

1470
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:55,420
Cause you don't want to go through
six weeks of pain just, you know,

1471
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,810
as they said and platoon take the pain.
All right?

1472
01:34:58,811 --> 01:35:02,510
Just get out of the fucking relationship
and just, just tell yourself,

1473
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:05,690
this is going to suck for six weeks.
I'm going to wake up crying.

1474
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,730
I'm going to feel lost.

1475
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:12,620
I'm going to be wondering what did I
used to do with all my free time before I

1476
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:13,640
was with this person.

1477
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:18,650
You can have that bizarre feeling where
now you're looking back on somebody who

1478
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:22,280
was a huge part of your life and
now they're becoming a stranger.

1479
01:35:22,281 --> 01:35:26,660
So then it just becomes this weird
episode. Like what was that? Who was that?

1480
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:31,230
What the, was that my life that just went
into that fucking room for five years?

1481
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,890
It's really busy. Just prepare
yourself that that's going to happen,

1482
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,620
but every day it gets a little
bit fucking easier. Yeah.

1483
01:35:38,621 --> 01:35:40,860
Then one day you're gonna wake up.
You're not going to give a shit.

1484
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,620
The Sun's going to be shining and uh,

1485
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,410
and then just enjoy being single.
Your only fucking 19 years old,

1486
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:52,160
there's no fucking reason to be in a
relationship that's serious for that

1487
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:56,320
fucking long with the fucking loser.
So get out of it,

1488
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,920
get through the pain. And then
after six weeks, you know,

1489
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:03,810
just hanging out with your friends,
have a good fucking time,

1490
01:36:03,811 --> 01:36:05,190
but do not get into another relationship.

1491
01:36:05,191 --> 01:36:07,680
I wouldn't get into another
relationship for like a year.

1492
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:12,940
Just be single for at least a fucking
year and feel how awesome that is to just

1493
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:16,420
be single, to wake up, you know,

1494
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,200
feel good about yourself,

1495
01:36:19,201 --> 01:36:23,190
but then not have to worry that someone
else is a Douche. So that drags down.

1496
01:36:23,191 --> 01:36:27,050
You're feeling good about yourself
quotient. Yeah. It just fucking be single.

1497
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,440
All right. There you go. I said the
same thing 90 times in a fucking roll.

1498
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:32,630
I realize it. And a, what are we going?

1499
01:36:32,631 --> 01:36:37,290
I'm a little over an hour
here on the podcast, so good
luck to Ya. All right. Uh,

1500
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,410
that's it. That's the podcast for this
week. I will talk to you guys next week.

1501
01:36:40,411 --> 01:36:42,960
This weekend I am at the
funny bone in Columbus,

1502
01:36:42,961 --> 01:36:46,840
Ohio and uh,
Friday,

1503
01:36:46,841 --> 01:36:49,640
Saturday and Sunday are the dates
that I'm going to be there. Actually,

1504
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,190
those are the days.
Here are the actual dates.

1505
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:55,960
November 12th 13th and the 14th and on
the 13th I'm going to try to go to that

1506
01:36:55,961 --> 01:37:00,320
Ohio state, Penn state game.
You know, because I've,

1507
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:02,300
I've been to Ohio state game,
but the first time I went,

1508
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:05,440
they played bowling green and it
was like the middle of September,

1509
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:07,150
one of those cupcake games and it sucked.

1510
01:37:07,151 --> 01:37:10,870
So I want to go there and get the
full on horseshoe fucking experience.

1511
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:14,080
So that is it.
Thank you guys for all the emails.

1512
01:37:14,081 --> 01:37:17,020
Thank you so much for buying my DVD.

surf and fucking turf here.

Beautiful. All right, I'll

1519
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:05,760
[inaudible].
