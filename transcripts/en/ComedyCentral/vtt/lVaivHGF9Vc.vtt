it was, uh, Queens,

I lived in my car, uh...

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.085
Not poverty or anything.
I just--I had this idea

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.421
that I wanted to be
in show business.

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.923
Ha ha. Uh...

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:33.326
I would be on the road
doing stand-up

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.829
35 or 40 or 45 weeks a year,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:41.934

it sounds glamorous, uh...

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.438
but the truth is, it's not.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.473
It beats working, though.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.745

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.448
One week I was not working

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.684
in, uh, Nashville
and I met this girl

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:01.120
working in the box office,
and she told me

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:03.956
she was having
a birthday party that night.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.691
And that was the Wednesday,
the first night of the week,

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.994
so I went, and, uh...

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.795
When I got there,
I saw her,

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:11.797
and she was dancing,
this natural redhead,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.767
and she was wearing skintight
leopard-print pants,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.803
and she was laughing
the whole time she danced.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.273
Never seen anybody
like that and then...

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.009
we were introduced, and
she just had this intensity,

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.677
you know,
she's like hypersexual

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.979
and just really interesting
right off.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.949
And I kinda halfway
fell in love with her, really,

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.485
right then, you know.
And she gave me a big hug

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.554
before she left me
standing there.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.222
And she was covered
with this--

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.990
There was like a mist
around her, you know.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.326
She'd been dancing,
the warm was room.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.196
Or, uh, the room was warm.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.997
[laughter]

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.035
The warm was not room
at all, but...

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.070
[laughs]
She'd been dancing,

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:53.472
and she was kind of sweaty,
you know,

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:54.974
and I got close to her.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.842
So she gave me one of
those hugs

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.378
that you give somebody
that you used to fuck.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.247
[laughter]

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.249
But you've since moved on.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.652
And, uh, somewhere between
her hair and her shoulder,

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:10.690
right there, and I caught a
whiff of, like, sex, you know.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.025
Just...the smell, you know?

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.361
And that was the first time
I smelled Laura.

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:18.397
And Laura...she expressed
a little attraction

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.032
towards me, I think.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.268
I don't know,
sometimes these things'll be

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.203
misinterpreted, but I--

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.771
[laughter]

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.007
I took it that way,
you know,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.876
because she said to me,
"If you weren't married,

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.213
I would take you home
and fuck your cock off."

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.881
[laughter]

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:38.751
And although it was true,
I was married,

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:42.188
I-I took that as a firm offer.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.790
So, uh...and my marriage
was kinda lousy.

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:46.559
We didn't talk to each other
anymore.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:49.195
We didn't--The more I was on
the road--I was gone a lot,

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:51.564
I wasn't home,
and we started to have

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.132
less and less in common.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:57.703
Laura, on the other hand--
pretty flexible.

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.905
And, uh, she was similar
to me, you know?

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.807
She was like, uh,
no responsibilities

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.409
and she would
sleep on couches

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:07.046
and she just kind of, uh,
was willing to travel.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.383
And so it got to be a habit,
whenever I would leave town,

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.884
I would pick her up

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.153
and we would go
and have sex in hotels.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.289
Cheap ones, mostly.
Disgusting.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.991
I know it's disgusting.
It really is.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.927
But I loved her--I was just
madly in love with her.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.765
I mean, she's a beautiful
girl, red hair and blue eyes,

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:29.268
and her answer to everything
was "yes."

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.904
[laughter]

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.407
And I didn't have any defense
for that right then.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.609
You know what I mean?
'Cause if you meet somebody

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.778
and they fill a void in you,
you know,

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.913
and you seem to fill
a void in them,

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.316
and you guys are filling
each other's voids and...

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.619
You should--There's one thing
you should do--run away.

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:49.155
Like when a woman will blow you
a couple times a day

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.324

you have that going,

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.792
and it changes your life.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.460
It changes the way
you process things.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:57.263

everything's great.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.201

is falling apart, you know,

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:10.943

finally coming together.

You're skipping.

But...just, uh,
more and more time,

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.368
I was starting to see her
pissed, you know.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.504
And as we moved into
the summer,

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.339
the summer got to be July,

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:43.676
and we had a big falling out,
and she left in a rental car.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.012
I figured that's it,
you know, it's ran its course.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:49.382
And when the phone rang
a couple days later,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:52.718
it was her, and I figured
it was for closure.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:54.820
But it wasn't.
she told me all about

00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:58.190
how she had downed
a lotta liquor and pills

00:05:58.223 --> 00:06:00.493
and had to be revived
in a hospital

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.695
outside of Atlanta.

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:06.732
And, uh, she had been dead
and brought back to life.

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:08.601
You know,
a lotta guys will bail

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.871
after the first suicide
attempt.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:14.540
But, uh...

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:16.342
I-I had a lotta hope.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:20.679
And, in fact, I think it made
the relationship stronger.

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:23.716
And, you know, I don't know if
you've had this experience,

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.050
maybe you have,
but you meet a girl

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:27.119
and it's great
and it's nice.

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:29.388

some inconsistencies

here and there, you know,
things don't quite add up.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:36.128
And then she starts talking
about killing herself.

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:39.198

be a woman, a guy--

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.303
[stammering] And all the
suicide talk, you know,

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.907
she's, like, uh,
she used to say, uh...

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.375
I remember one time
she told me,

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.744
"When you get back
from the show,

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.746
"I'm gonna be dead.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:56.415
I'm gonna be dead
in your hotel room."

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:59.952
When someone says that you say,
"Oh, my God, don't do that.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.054
"Jesus, that's terrible.

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:04.657
Whatever you do,
don't do that," you know?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.925
At first.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.995
[laughter]

00:07:10.028 --> 00:07:11.797
And then eventually
she tells me,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.265
"I'm gonna be dead
in your hotel room

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:14.834
when you get back,"
and you go,

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.237
"Sounds like
a housekeeping issue."

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.106
[laughter]

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.177
"I'll--I'll mention it."
Ha ha.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.780
"You know, it would solve
a lotta problems for me,

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:29.348
"actually, if you would...

00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.485
go ahead and pull the trigger
on that plan."

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:35.955
'Cause I mean, uh,
you know how it goes.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.957
I mean, you know,
the attempted suicide

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.825
and then the talk about
suicide.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:42.294
Like, I can't give this bitch
a reason to live, you know?

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:44.363
And then...
when you finally wanna

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.131
break up with her,
what happens?

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:49.368
Then she wants to tell
your wife everything.

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:52.004
Well, I know
we've all been there.

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:54.440
But, uh...

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:57.610
So my wife left,
and, uh, that was for good.

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.645
It was more of a formality
than anything.

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:01.213
And, uh...

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:03.649
then we're together
all the time, Laura and I.

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:05.651
You know, she, like I said,
kept everything

00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:07.319
in a couple of duffle bags,

00:08:07.352 --> 00:08:09.188
so she threw those
in the trunk of my car

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:11.290
and from that point on,
it was kind of a blur.

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:14.827
I mean, it was just sex
and hotels and fighting.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.731
A lot of fighting, you know,
a lot of suicide talk.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.067
You can't stop
the suicide talk.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.336
Only one way to do that.
Ha ha, so...

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:27.072
[laughter]
But, uh...

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:29.642
that didn't occur
and, uh, you know,

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.177
and--and there was a fake
pregnancy then.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.179
She told me she was pregnant.

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:36.749
And fortunately, it was
followed by a fake miscarriage.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.318
I mean, you have to kind of
take her at her word

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.020
at some point.
"Oh, you're pregnant?"

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:43.088
How do I prove she's not?

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.190
And so that becomes
your truth, you know,

00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:48.561
and now you're living in
this insanity, you know?

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:52.097
But I came a lot.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.333
And...and so that's what
keeps you in,

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:58.270
you know what I mean,
is that the sex is so good,

00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:02.207
you know what I'm saying.
[laughter]

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.344
That it--it's like the closest
thing to like, uh,

00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:09.048
evidence of the existence
of God that you've ever seen.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.584
And deep down,
we all wanna believe.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.552
And she was always
threatening the cops.

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:15.454
Even with the suicide talk.
I'd say,

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.056
"I don't know how to
handle this.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.624
"I think I should call
the police,

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.125
because I think we need help,"
and she'd go,

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:21.560
"If you call the police,

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:23.295
"I'll tell them you were
hitting me,

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:25.264
and you'll go to jail."

00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:28.133
Said, "Well," you know...

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:31.203
"Well played."
[laughter]

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:32.805
Like I said, I was very
ill-equipped

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.441
to deal with the situation.
I remember one time

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.977
I was in Indiana.
She told me...

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.912
You know, we were
fighting and everything,

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.580
and I was trying to get
rid of her.

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.482
"We have to break up.
This is insanity.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.618
I hate this," you know?
I felt imprisoned, you know?

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.319
She goes, "Oh, really?
I'll go you one better."

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.221
She goes,
"If you give me $200,

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:51.657
you'll never see me again."

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.495
I had $200 in my hand by the
time she finished the sentence.

00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:58.130
[laughter]

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.965
She took the money.
She looked at it, folded it,

00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:01.600
tucked it into her bra,

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:04.971
sat down on the couch,
and read a magazine.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:09.341
You win, you know?
I mean, I...

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:12.277
We never spoke of it again.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.181
I was like,
"Yet again, you win."

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:19.151
So she was drunk one night,
and I took her home.

00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:21.186
I left her with her mother,
and that was it.

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:22.821
I felt so free and alive,

00:10:22.854 --> 00:10:24.790
and it felt so good
just to be alone again

00:10:24.823 --> 00:10:27.092
and to not have all her shit
in my trunk.

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:29.128
And then, uh, the phone
started to ring,

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.363
and it rang throughout
December.

00:10:31.396 --> 00:10:34.366
It would ring 36 times a day,
25 times a day.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.635
And I remember
we had a mutual friend

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.271
who was gonna come and we
were gonna work together

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.473
in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:44.877
And, uh...
that's close to Nashville.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.478
So I said, "Don't call her.

00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:48.514
"Don't tell her you're gonna
be around, okay,

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.516
because she's kind of
stalking me."

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.885
He's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
I've had 'em do that before."

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.186
I'm like, "It's serious, okay?"

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:55.821
Tried to emphasize it.

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:58.824
She called me 15 minutes
later and said, uh,

00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:02.561
"Hey, quit telling people
I'm stalking you, okay?"

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:05.798
Said, "You don't know
the meaning of stalk."

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.399
And, uh...

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:11.670
it was January 4, 2004,
and I remember the date

00:11:11.703 --> 00:11:15.307
because that's the date that
someone tried to murder me.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.177
[scattered laughs]
I went to the IHOP,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.713
International House
of Pancakes, which...

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:24.349
I've had many great
experiences there.

00:11:24.382 --> 00:11:27.653
Like the food,
good service, you know?

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.021
So I get out of the car,

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:30.756
and I'm walking into
the restaurant

00:11:30.789 --> 00:11:33.692
and I hear my name.
"Dixon," you know.

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:36.395
And I turn around, and, uh,
there she is, you know?

00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:39.531
So angry.
Grabs me by the arm, you know.

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.400
She says, "I just wanna talk.
I just wanna talk to you!

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.702
I just wanna talk to you!"
and I'm like, oh, Christ.

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:47.673
So I'm trying to work my way
towards the pancakes.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.341
[laughter]

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:50.709
We get right up to the door,

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:52.411
and she reaches into
her jeans pocket

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:56.381
and she pulls out this
9 millimeter Glock--

00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:58.283
I later found out
that's what it was.

00:11:58.316 --> 00:12:02.254
At the time, my brain just
processed it as "Guh!"

00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:04.389
She goes, "Look, I've got
this 9 millimeter."

00:12:04.422 --> 00:12:06.558
And I grabbed her wrist
and, uh,

00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:08.560
I tried to shake the gun
out of her hand, you know,

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:11.230
squeeze it out.
And she jumped on my back,

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.465
and she starts scratching
my face, you know?

00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:16.235
She's growling like some--
Like an animal, you know,

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.870
like she's injured
or something.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.372
And she's holding on to
my head by my eyes.

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:22.040
She's digging into my eyes,

00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:24.643
trying to squeeze my eyeballs
and everything.

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:27.279
And, uh, so I had the gun
in my hand,

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.582
and I got inside and I
slid it across the floor,

00:12:30.615 --> 00:12:33.752
and there was
security guards there.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:35.654
At IHOP.

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:38.257
[laughter]

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.326
Pretty, uh, good luck.
And they separated us

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:44.429
and, you know, I was outside,
she was inside.

00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:47.399
And then I heard this banging
on the window, you know?

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:49.168
And I turned around,
and it was her.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.270
You know, she's like...

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.438
as if she'd gotten
what she'd wanted, you know?

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:57.176
Mission accomplished.
Take that.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.977
So I was filling out
a police report

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.247
a few minutes later,
and a policeman came over.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.817
And, uh...
it's a funny thing.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.319
He says, "You know"--
And I found out from him

00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:09.955
that they had told her--
They said, "What did you

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:12.257
intend to do with the gun?"
And she said,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.960
"I was gonna shoot
that motherfucker,

00:13:14.993 --> 00:13:16.862
and then shoot myself."

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:19.298
[crowd murmurs]
I said, "Oh, she says

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.266
shit like that all the time."

00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:24.102
[laughter]

00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:26.138
[applause]

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.006
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.843
<i> - Pat Dixon!</i>

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:33.412
[cheers and applause]
