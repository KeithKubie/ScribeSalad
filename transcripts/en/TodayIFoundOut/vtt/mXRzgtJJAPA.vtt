00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:12.710
Roger Courtney and a Watery Gamble - The Establishing
of the SBS

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.840
Described by the BBC as the “Shadowy sister
of the SAS”, The Special Boat Service (more

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.470
commonly known as the SBS) is likely one of
the most well-trained and elite special forces

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.500
units around today that few in the world have
ever heard of, despite performing countless

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.130
harrowing missions, dozens of hostage rescues
and more than its fair share of daring night

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.069
time raids going all the way back to WWII
when an officer by the name of Roger “Jumbo”

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:39.510
Courtney risked a court-martial to demonstrate
to his superiors just how valuable a unit

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.519
like the SBS could be.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.739
Little is documented about Courtney’s life
prior to his military service in WWII other

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.899
than that he was an avid big game hunter and
adventurer in Africa for a number of years.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.879
This is particularly important to the story
at hand as he often regaled his fellow soldiers

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.440
with stories about hunting lions and other
big game in a canoe.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.280
When Courtney heard about the outbreak of
WWII, he returned to Scotland and enlisted

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.080
in the military; sometime in 1940, he began
serving with the now defunct No 8 Guards unit.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.240
Almost as soon as he became a commando with
the No 8’s, Courtney managed to score a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.850
meeting with the Admiral of the Fleet, Roger
Keyes.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.280
In the meeting, Courtney tried to sell the
sceptical Admiral on the benefit of using

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.090
canoes to quite literally “hunt Germans”.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.189
He argued that small, collapsible canoes could
be used to silently sneak where powered boats

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.250
could not.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.921
Keyes summarily dismissed Courtney’s proposal,
stating that canoes were better suited for

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.790
the boy scouts than the army.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.689
Undeterred by Admiral Keyes’ lack of vision,
Courtney arranged for a meeting with another

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.380
high-ranking military official, Admiral Theodore
Hallett, in the hopes that he would see the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.070
benefit of the proposal.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.079
Like Keyes, Hallett dismissed Courtney’s
idea outright.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.180
Frustrated with how quick his superiors had
been to dismiss his proposal, Courtney, later

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.810
described by Major David Sutherland as “a
hard-drinking white hunter with a big line

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.729
of bullshit and a persuasive tongue”, came
to the conclusion that the only way to prove

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.310
that his idea could work was to put it into
practise.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.310
HMS Glengyle
HMS Glengyle

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.010
Four days after his failed meeting with Admiral
Hallett, Courtney silently paddled a canoe

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.280
along the River Clyde and stealthily climbed
aboard the HMS Glengyle.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.910
Once aboard, Courtney sneaked his way to the
Captain’s quarters and scribbled his initials

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.010
on the door.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.830
Just for good measure, before leaving he stole
one of the ship’s deck gun covers, which

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.310
had the ship’s name on it.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.000
Courtney then slyly slipped away undetected
and made a beeline for the nearby Argyll Arms

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.840
Hotel where he knew Admiral Hallett was currently
meeting some military bigwigs.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.620
Once there, Courtney waltzed up to Hallett’s
private room, reportedly dressed only in a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.980
pair of swimming trunks, barged in and proudly
proclaimed that he’d just managed to sneak

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.870
aboard the Glengyle and make it to the captain’s
quarters unmolested.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.930
When the captain of the Glengyle, who just
so happened to be present at the meeting,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.870
scoffed that his ship could be infiltrated
in such a way, Courtney unrolled the deck

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.270
gun cover and placed it on the table.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.530
Although Courtney had committed a potentially
court-martial-able offence, as well as risked

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.800
getting himself mistaken for an enemy and
shot during the infiltration of the Glengyle,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.050
the fact that he’d been able to do this
and make it to the captain’s quarters without

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.820
being spotted during war time while half naked
to boot, so impressed his superiors that they

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.910
reconsidered their stance on how effective
soldiers with foldable canoes could be.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.370
SBS-canoeAfter his stunt, Courtney was asked
to provide another demonstration, this time

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.800
sanctioned, infiltrating a submarine depot
ship.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.690
When that was successful as well, he was promoted
and given command of 12 men, who he then trained

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.210
in clandestine operations and the use of the
“fol-boat”, a collapsible canoe made of

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.180
rubber and wood that could be assembled or
broken down rapidly.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.310
The “fol-boat brigade”, as it was then
known, carried out numerous missions during

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.520
WWII, most notably paddling into an enemy
port near the mouth of the Gironde and destroying

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.950
several key ships harboured there in an operation
that Winston Churchill claimed accelerated

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.310
the end of the war by “six months”.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.080
As for Courtney, despite being highly involved
in the gruelling training of the first waves

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.670
of SBS commandos, he wasn’t with the force
very long, having to return to the U.K. due

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.690
to health issues.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.010
He was ultimately relegated to a desk job
and died just a few years after the war ended.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.870
Today his legacy lives on in the form of one
of the most highly trained and terrifyingly

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.270
effective units of soldiers on Earth.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.100
To join either the SAS or SBS you have to
pass an infamously brutal and unforgiving

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.640
selection process which involves a month of
gruelling physical exercise culminating in

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.350
a 40 km march across the harshest terrain
Britain has to offer.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.959
Nine weeks of training in the jungle.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.830
Fourteen weeks of training in demolitions,
reconnaissance and a variety of other advanced

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.830
combat tactics.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.660
The process then culminates in something known
as “Survive, Evade, Resist, Extract” training

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.460
which involves releasing the recruits into
the woods where they are hunted down by Royal

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.660
Marines who will then interrogate them for
several weeks using sleep, food, water and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.070
sensory deprivation.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.770
If a recruit fails during any one of these
or gives any answer other than their name,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.280
rank, date of birth or army number, during
the interrogation process, they will fail.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.620
Additionally, recruits hoping to join the
SBS are required to undertake several more

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.760
months of water-based training which involves
learning how to do such amazing things as

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.160
infiltrate and exit submarines while they
are submerged, and diving out of planes into

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.720
freezing cold water in near zero visibility.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.350
Unsurprisingly, over 90% of recruits who apply
for the SBS or SAS fail.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.010
Recruits hoping to join the SBS or SAS can
only apply a maximum of two times before they’re

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.410
barred from ever trying again.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.120
The SBS and SAS work in alternative six month
long shifts, during which they will train

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.400
constantly to keep their skills as sharp as
possible.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.211
These training sessions are understandably
rather secretive, but are known to involve

00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:30.540
live fire trainings exercises and mock raids
on potential terrorist targets to test their

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.540
security.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.920
In one such mock raid, members of the SBS
broke into a nuclear power plant in Scotland

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.930
in less than a minute, exposing various issues
with security at that plant.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.990
In regards to live fire training exercises,
both the SBS and SAS are said to always train

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.651
using live ammo and often use real people
as hostages.

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.860
The SAS in particular is known to invite foreign
dignitaries to take part in these exercises

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.920
to demonstrate their skill and composure.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.740
For anyone wondering about the difference
between the two units, while both the SAS

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.510
and SBS are fairly analogous in terms of their
reputation, skill and basic training, as their

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.520
names would suggest, the Special Air Service
specialise in aerial combat and parachuting,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.080
whereas the Special Boat Service has an affinity
for water-based and amphibious combat.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.580
That said, the SBS has been known to take
part in land-based missions when the need

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.580
arises and vice versa.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.090
Both units also set aside a small, constantly
rotating contingent of men for counter-terrorism

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.230
duties who are on call 24 hours a day, 365
days a year.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.330
Despite their close proximity to one another,
the relationship between the SBS and SAS is

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:49.349
a notably chilly one with both units displaying
various levels of animosity towards one another.
