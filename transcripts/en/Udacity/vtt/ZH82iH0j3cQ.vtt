00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, so, we need a new object, an attendee object.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.125
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:08.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I guess I have some way to make that here?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can use that nifty

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.960
little quick access menu on the right again.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.500
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Is this the only way to do it?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.030
&gt;&gt; It's not. There's a couple different

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.790
ways, I just think this is the simplest.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, oh, View Object, New Object?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.270
&gt;&gt; New Object.
