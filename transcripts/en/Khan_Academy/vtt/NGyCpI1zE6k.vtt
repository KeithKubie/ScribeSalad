00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:04.146
- [Instructor] We are in the year 1095.

00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:07.348
Just for context, this
is roughly half a century

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:10.984
after the Great Schism between
the Eastern Orthodox church

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:14.007
in Constantinople, or
centered at Constantinople,

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:15.894
and what eventually gets known

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:17.118
as the Roman Catholic church,

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:20.970
or the Latin church, centered at Rome.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.312
We have the Byzantine Empire

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:25.669
continuing to lose territory.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.915
Remember in the 7th century

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.922
as Islam expanded out over Arabia,

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:32.082
it quickly overran much of the territory

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.119
in the Holy Land that at the time

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.135
was controlled by the Byzantines,

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.463
Byzantine being another word

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:39.641
for the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.283
By the time of this map,

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:44.293
Islam had been in control
of the Middle East,

00:00:44.293 --> 00:00:47.034
the Holy Land, North Africa,

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:49.288
and even a good chunk
of the Iberian Peninsula

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:51.001
for several hundred years,

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.168
as much as over 400 years.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:57.322
As we get closer to this time period,

00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:00.875
you have the Seljuq Turks
continuing to eat in

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.622
to the Byzantine Empire

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:06.142
and taking most of the
Anatolian peninsula.

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:07.677
Also at this time, remember,

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:09.646
we are in the high Middle Ages,

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.920
which is a time when,
especially western Europe,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.771
is on the rise.

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.363
There's increased
agricultural productivity,

00:01:17.363 --> 00:01:19.780
the population is increasing.

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.413
And it's in this context

00:01:22.413 --> 00:01:25.487
that the emperor of the Byzantines,

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:28.410
the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.660
looks for help.

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:33.867
Emperor Alexios I sends a delegation,

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.399
sends an ambassador to Pope Urban II,

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.852
and he essentially asks
for some mercenaries

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:45.405
to help him retake some of Anatolia

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.822
from the Muslims.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.552
Well, Pope Urban II sees
an opportunity here.

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:53.689
It's been roughly half a century

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.113
since the Great Schism.

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:58.456
He has his own internal struggles going on

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:01.760
and struggles with some
neighboring states.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.597
He sees this, potentially,
as an opportunity

00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:06.101
to focus attention elsewhere.

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.836
And so later that year,

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.198
in November of 1095,

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.316
he makes a sermon at Claremont

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:15.399
in the kingdom of France.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.569
There are varying accounts of his speech,

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.601
but this is one of them.

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.530
I, or rather the Lord, beseech you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.950
as Christ's heralds to
publish this everywhere

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.172
and to perse, which is
another way of saying

00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:33.655
to persuade, all people of whatever rank,

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.913
foot soldiers, and knights, poor and rich,

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:39.026
to carry aid promptly to those Christians,

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.017
so to the Byzantines,

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:45.351
and to destroy that vile race
from the lands of our friends.

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:46.775
When he's talking about vile race,

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:48.698
he's talking about the Muslims

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:50.708
who have control of
the Anatolian peninsula

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.458
and of the Holy Land.

00:02:53.698 --> 00:02:56.160
I saw those to those who are present.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.955
It is meant also for those who are absent.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.372
Moreover, Christ commands it.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:03.682
And according to this account,

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:07.664
he goes onto say, all who die by the way,

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:11.819
whether by land or by sea, or
in battle against the pagans,

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.315
shall have immediate remission of sins.

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:18.040
So this is this idea of indulgences,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.806
where hey you do something for me,

00:03:19.806 --> 00:03:22.579
I can forgive your sins.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.225
This I grant them through the power of God

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.395
with which I am invested.

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:31.251
O what a disgrace if such
a despised and base race,

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:33.167
once again he's talking about the Muslims,

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.341
which worships demons,
should conquer a people

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.133
which has the faith of omnipotent God

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:43.118
and is made glorious
with the name of Christ.

00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:45.699
Pope Urban II's speech has an impact

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.716
larger than even he expects.

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:51.618
Throughout Western Europe,
news of his speech,

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:54.923
news of his call to go
and retake the Holy Land,

00:03:54.923 --> 00:03:58.430
to fight against this
despised and base race,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.430
the Muslims, takes hold.

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:04.418
And before the Pope is
even able to organize

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:07.059
a formal army, you have
someone by the name

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.016
of Peter the Hermit lead what's called

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.433
the People's Crusade in 1096.

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:15.698
And this is often considered

00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:18.695
the first part of the first crusade.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:20.755
As they march through the Rhineland

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:22.499
in what is now Germany,

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.160
they massacre Jews, several thousand,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.370
calling them Christ killers
on their way to the Holy Land,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.626
and this is a theme that you will see

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:32.172
throughout the Crusades.

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.414
Even though the crusaders
ostensibly were there

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:37.848
to help the Byzantines,
ostensibly to take back

00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:41.129
the Holy Land, as they
travel through foreign lands,

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.377
they often wreak a lot of havoc,

00:04:43.377 --> 00:04:46.668
even sometimes on the
Byzantines themselves,

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:47.935
but the People's Crusade itself

00:04:47.935 --> 00:04:50.096
was very unsuccessful.

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:52.526
By the time they got to
the Anatolian peninsula,

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.410
remember, Peter the Hermit was leading,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.977
there were women, there were children,

00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:58.238
there were untrained peasants fighting,

00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:00.223
they were massacred by the Turks

00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:03.676
when they got to the Anatolian peninsula.

00:05:03.676 --> 00:05:07.254
But eventually, the Pope
was able to organize

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:09.683
a more formal, what eventually gets called

00:05:09.683 --> 00:05:12.140
First Crusade, and once again,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.427
it surpasses the Pope's expectations

00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:17.341
and far surpasses Alexios,

00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:19.208
the Byzantine emperor's expectations,

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:21.105
and it's even a little
bit frightening to him

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:24.624
where you have on the
order of 100,000 soldiers

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.238
coming from western Europe

00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:29.796
taking these various routes

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.796
by both land and by sea.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.587
And in 1099, they are eventually
able to take Jerusalem

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:43.213
from the Muslims, and both
in their taking of Antioch

00:05:43.213 --> 00:05:46.755
and Jerusalem, most historical accounts

00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:48.573
say it was quite bloody

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:51.991
with significant chunks of
the cities being massacred.

00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:54.594
This is a later image of what
it might have looked like

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:57.837
when they conquered Jerusalem.

00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:59.292
And from that time period

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.571
through most of the 12th century,

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:04.821
they maintain control of the Holy Land.

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:11.746
This is what the map looks like in 1135,

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.257
and you might notice some changes now.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:16.482
The Byzantine Empire has reconquered

00:06:16.482 --> 00:06:18.612
chunks of the Anatolian peninsula,

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.825
in particular the west and the north,

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:22.928
and you see these blue regions here

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:26.431
which are known as Crusader Kingdoms.

00:06:26.431 --> 00:06:28.650
We can zoom in on these Crusader Kingdoms,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.017
or Crusader states, and
what's interesting about them,

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.277
even though these western
European crusaders,

00:06:35.277 --> 00:06:37.101
now they weren't called
crusaders at first,

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.846
but they wore a cross on their outfits

00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:41.151
and were eventually called crusaders,

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.088
even though their goal at first

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:46.156
was apparently to help retake land

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:49.859
for the Byzantines, when they
were able to take the land,

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:51.995
for the most part, they kept it.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.044
And they set up these Crusader states,

00:06:54.044 --> 00:06:55.540
or these Crusader kingdoms

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.424
that you see right over here

00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:58.938
that they're going to stay in control of

00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:01.515
for most of the 12th century.

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:03.675
As you get into the middle
of the 12th century,

00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:04.920
the Muslims are able to take back

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.872
a few significant cities,

00:07:06.872 --> 00:07:09.545
which is going to catalyze
the Second Crusades,

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:12.080
but then as we get to 1187,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.247
the Muslim ruler Saladin is
able to take back Jerusalem,

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:19.054
which as we'll see in the next video,

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:21.804
will instigate the Third Crusade.
