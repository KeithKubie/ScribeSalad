00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.460
- What have we got here?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.960
We have the whole set up
for the Mogen David ad, 1957,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.540
including the slides,
the progressive proof

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.380
that showed the whole process.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.710
And it ended up to be in
the "Life" magazine, and

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.670
other magazines, right there.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.880
OK.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.330
This is neat that
you have all this.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.540
This is the 1950s, and
Mogen David saw a market

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.830
that needed to be exploited.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.380
MATT: Right.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.080
It's just the United States
really wasn't into wine.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500
After Prohibition,
everyone was used to really

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.040
bad beer and really bad booze.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000
[laughter]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.710
[burping sound effect]

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.080
MATT: I am selling the Mogen
David proof ads class slides,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.380
including the original ad,
but it was in "Life" magazine.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.330
I got them at an estate
sale because they're cool.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.250
I think I can make some
good money off of them.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.420
I'm hoping to get $500 for them.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.710
The least amount of
money I'll take is $200.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.330
This is really, really cool.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.920
This was a really tedious
process back in the day.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960
Today, take a digital camera
and it does all the work.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.460
But back then, you had
to develop the film,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.380
and then you had
to decide how many

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.420
colors you wanted to do it in.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.790
So this one was
four-color lithography.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120
They take a color photo.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.920
Now, they take that
negative for that and they

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.460
put it in a machine, and
they put a bunch of filters

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.880
across the front of it.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.040
And they filter out
everything but this red.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.250
MATT: Right.
- OK?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.380
And they make this glass slide.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.790
They get it down so now they
have these four negatives.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.460
Each one of them
are for each color.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.120
And then it goes to
the printing press

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.040
four times for each color.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.250
And in the end, you get this.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.880
MATT: Wow.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.960
It was a really drawn-out
process, but that's the way

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.920
they did it back then.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.380
MATT: OK.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.330
I mean, you got some
interesting stuff here.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.620
What do you want to do with it?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.620
MATT: I'd like to sell it.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.750
OK.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.960
How much you want for it?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.830
Well, I'm asking $500.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.500
OK.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.330
It's really, really cool.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.080
And these glass plates, I
mean, they're interesting.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.120
And they tell a really cool
story to, maybe, someone

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.250
in the advertising business.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.120
But no one's going to buy them.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
There's nothing
collectible here.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.460
OK.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.830
Sorry to hear that.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.080
Thanks for coming
by, though, man.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.500
I appreciate it.
- Thanks.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.000
[music playing]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.580
I was kind of disappointed
he wasn't buying them.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.580
I'm bummed, but I
learned a lot today.
