thank you everyone for coming and it was

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.269
thank you everyone for coming and it was
 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:08.549
thank you everyone for coming and it was
the first talk of the day so I'm

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559
the first talk of the day so I'm
 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.560
the first talk of the day so I'm
surprised anyone came especially if we

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570
surprised anyone came especially if we
 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.910
surprised anyone came especially if we
talk about insects so I really

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920
talk about insects so I really
 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.310
talk about insects so I really
appreciate that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
appreciate that
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.590
appreciate that
and it's date of visual a visualization

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600
and it's date of visual a visualization
 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.550

week Columbia and so being the first

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560
week Columbia and so being the first
 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.640
week Columbia and so being the first
talk of the day I'm gonna discuss a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650
talk of the day I'm gonna discuss a
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.220
talk of the day I'm gonna discuss a
branch of biology where that deals with

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
branch of biology where that deals with
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.140
branch of biology where that deals with
single data points or small collections

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150
single data points or small collections
 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.020
single data points or small collections
of data points and often these data

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030
of data points and often these data
 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.819
of data points and often these data
points that represent the most amount of

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829
points that represent the most amount of
 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.849
points that represent the most amount of
data you can get and so the name of the

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859
data you can get and so the name of the
 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.799
data you can get and so the name of the
game is to try and really do justice to

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809
game is to try and really do justice to
 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.310
game is to try and really do justice to
these single data points and this branch

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320
these single data points and this branch
 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.770
these single data points and this branch
of biology is collections based research

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780
of biology is collections based research
 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.750
of biology is collections based research
so in museums around the world there are

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
so in museums around the world there are
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.849
so in museums around the world there are
hundreds of millions of specimens of all

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859
hundreds of millions of specimens of all
 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.119
hundreds of millions of specimens of all
kinds of organisms and minerals and

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129
kinds of organisms and minerals and
 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.680
kinds of organisms and minerals and
different objects from the natural world

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690
different objects from the natural world
 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.030
different objects from the natural world
and they've all been given names and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
and they've all been given names and
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.740
and they've all been given names and
it's this process of naming these

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750
it's this process of naming these
 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.600
it's this process of naming these
objects just to taxonomy which forms the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
objects just to taxonomy which forms the
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.940
objects just to taxonomy which forms the
foundation at least in biological

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950
foundation at least in biological
 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.730
foundation at least in biological
sciences for many other sub disciplines

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740
sciences for many other sub disciplines
 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.480
sciences for many other sub disciplines
within this field and so finding these

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490
within this field and so finding these
 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.760
within this field and so finding these
organisms in nature collecting them

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
organisms in nature collecting them
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.530
organisms in nature collecting them
giving them names putting them in these

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540
giving them names putting them in these
 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.090
giving them names putting them in these
museums which are then repositories for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
museums which are then repositories for
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.889
museums which are then repositories for
biologic biological objects is extremely

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899
biologic biological objects is extremely
 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.270
biologic biological objects is extremely
important and often in in biology all

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
important and often in in biology all
 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.160
important and often in in biology all
you can find is a single member of a

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
you can find is a single member of a
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.200
you can find is a single member of a
species or just a few representatives of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210
species or just a few representatives of
 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.350
species or just a few representatives of
their species and so for that species to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360
their species and so for that species to
 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.690
their species and so for that species to
become something that has a genuine

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
become something that has a genuine
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.359
become something that has a genuine
value in biology you have to describe it

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369
value in biology you have to describe it
 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.310
value in biology you have to describe it
you have to name it you have to put a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320
you have to name it you have to put a
 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.100
you have to name it you have to put a
label on it a holo type label have to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110
label on it a holo type label have to
 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.740
label on it a holo type label have to
store it in the museum and make that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750
store it in the museum and make that
 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.450
store it in the museum and make that
information available

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460
information available
 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.070
information available
to other people usually in the form of a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080
to other people usually in the form of a
 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.469
to other people usually in the form of a
publication okay so what I'm going to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479
publication okay so what I'm going to
 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.410
publication okay so what I'm going to
discuss today is how the role of imaging

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420
discuss today is how the role of imaging
 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.990
discuss today is how the role of imaging
in this process of taxonomy and species

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
in this process of taxonomy and species
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.660
in this process of taxonomy and species
description and the expansion of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
description and the expansion of
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.390
description and the expansion of
biological knowledge over the past two

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
biological knowledge over the past two
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.790
biological knowledge over the past two
to three hundred years okay so there are

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
to three hundred years okay so there are
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.699
to three hundred years okay so there are
about 1.7 million described species of

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
about 1.7 million described species of
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.380
about 1.7 million described species of
organisms so these are organisms that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
organisms so these are organisms that
 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.390
organisms so these are organisms that
people have found collected names

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
people have found collected names
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.229
people have found collected names
described put into museums and this

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239
described put into museums and this
 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.660
described put into museums and this
represents depends who you ask really

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670

throughout the world and this branch of
 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.420
throughout the world and this branch of
biology that does this is called taxon

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
biology that does this is called taxon
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.910
biology that does this is called taxon
and is the naming and describing of new

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920
and is the naming and describing of new
 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.000
and is the naming and describing of new
species new general new higher taxes so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010

taxonomy forms the basis of all biology

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000
taxonomy forms the basis of all biology
 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.490
taxonomy forms the basis of all biology
because it's only through describing

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500
because it's only through describing
 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.830
because it's only through describing
species that you can partition up the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
species that you can partition up the
 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.050
species that you can partition up the
natural world into these distinct living

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
natural world into these distinct living
 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.000
natural world into these distinct living
entities and this is really the kind of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010
entities and this is really the kind of
 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.380
entities and this is really the kind of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390
foundation for all of these other fields
 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.670
foundation for all of these other fields
so for example an evolution in biology

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680
so for example an evolution in biology
 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.589

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450
species have evolved and how they're
 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.030
species have evolved and how they're
related to each other we wouldn't

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
related to each other we wouldn't
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.349
related to each other we wouldn't
understand the process of speciation

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359
understand the process of speciation
 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.199
understand the process of speciation
whereby one species splits into two and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209
whereby one species splits into two and
 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.640

and you work through the specimen and

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800
and you work through the specimen and
 

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.610
and you work through the specimen and
then using a montage algorithm you can

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:06.620
then using a montage algorithm you can
 

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.170
then using a montage algorithm you can
project all of these images together and

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180
project all of these images together and
 

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.480
project all of these images together and
filter out the parts of the image which

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:11.490
filter out the parts of the image which
 

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.050
filter out the parts of the image which
are out of focus so you can produce this

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.060
 
 

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.570
 
a montage picture where all parts of the

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:18.580
a montage picture where all parts of the
 

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.160
a montage picture where all parts of the
insect are now in view and this has

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.170
insect are now in view and this has
 

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.500
insect are now in view and this has
really transformed species descriptions

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:22.510
really transformed species descriptions
 

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.300
really transformed species descriptions
so if you look in the taxonomic journals

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.310
so if you look in the taxonomic journals
 

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.190
so if you look in the taxonomic journals
now a lot of the time you'll see these

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:26.200
now a lot of the time you'll see these
 

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.660
now a lot of the time you'll see these
montage images and they do a really

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:27.670
montage images and they do a really
 

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.050

flight wings the females got reduced
 

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.320
flight wings the females got reduced
flight wings and so the male probably

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.330
flight wings and so the male probably

can then zoom in to individual specimens
and see see their body structures this

00:35:59.340 --> 00:35:59.350

lot of me get back to a couple of these

as soon as I put these beetles

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780
as soon as I put these beetles
 

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.200
as soon as I put these beetles
underneath confocal microscope I saw

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.210
underneath confocal microscope I saw
 

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:34.250
underneath confocal microscope I saw
them in a new way with a new a level of

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260
them in a new way with a new a level of
 

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.840
them in a new way with a new a level of
detail that I'd never really encountered

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:35.850
detail that I'd never really encountered
 

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.100
detail that I'd never really encountered
them before and it was almost like

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.110
them before and it was almost like
 

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.160
them before and it was almost like
getting to know them again so it was you

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:40.170
getting to know them again so it was you
 

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.570
getting to know them again so it was you
know I've collected these things since I

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:41.580
know I've collected these things since I
 

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.490
know I've collected these things since I
was 16 years old and there's only a few

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500
was 16 years old and there's only a few
 

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.440
was 16 years old and there's only a few
years ago that I started to do this and

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:45.450
years ago that I started to do this and
 

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.980
years ago that I started to do this and
it was it wasn't like you know a

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:47.990
it was it wasn't like you know a
 

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.810
it was it wasn't like you know a
revolution in my head and so I really

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820
revolution in my head and so I really
 

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.310
revolution in my head and so I really
like love this technique well I couldn't

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320
like love this technique well I couldn't
 

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:03.970
like love this technique well I couldn't
hear you other questions

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:03.980
 
 

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.680
 
Oh motion like it how they move oh yes

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:08.690
Oh motion like it how they move oh yes
 

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.140
Oh motion like it how they move oh yes
so that's a very interesting point I

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.150
so that's a very interesting point I
 

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.710
so that's a very interesting point I
think there's a I think that that is to

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720
think there's a I think that that is to
 

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.090
think there's a I think that that is to
some extent and there really should be

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.100
some extent and there really should be
 

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.920
some extent and there really should be
more of an effort not to just document

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:17.930
more of an effort not to just document
 

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.349
more of an effort not to just document
the morphology of these insects but also

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359
the morphology of these insects but also
 

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:21.520
the morphology of these insects but also
their behavior

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:21.530
their behavior
 

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.800
their behavior
okay so ultimately these specimens have

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:23.810
okay so ultimately these specimens have
 

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.690
okay so ultimately these specimens have
to be taken from the wild and put inside

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:25.700
to be taken from the wild and put inside
 

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.150
to be taken from the wild and put inside
into museums where they're dead but

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160
into museums where they're dead but
 

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.240
into museums where they're dead but
before that's done if some aspects of

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:31.250
before that's done if some aspects of
 

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.920
before that's done if some aspects of
their behavior the way they move the way

their behavior the way they move the way
 

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.810
their behavior the way they move the way
they behave maybe what they feed on or

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:34.820
they behave maybe what they feed on or
 

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.450
they behave maybe what they feed on or
documented that just increases the

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:36.460
documented that just increases the
 

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:41.400
documented that just increases the
richness of this discipline you know

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:41.410
 
 

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.250
 
substantially so and this these are also

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:45.260
substantially so and this these are also
 

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.260
substantially so and this these are also
diagnostic characters so different

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.270
diagnostic characters so different
 

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:51.730
diagnostic characters so different
species have different behaviors and as

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:51.740
species have different behaviors and as
 

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.740
species have different behaviors and as
you say like the way they move all of

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:53.750
you say like the way they move all of
 

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.060
you say like the way they move all of
these kinds of things are different and

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:55.070
these kinds of things are different and
 

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.859
these kinds of things are different and
potentially taxonomically very

00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:56.869
potentially taxonomically very
 

00:40:56.869 --> 00:40:59.050
potentially taxonomically very
informative I think recently there was

00:40:59.050 --> 00:40:59.060
informative I think recently there was
 

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.440
informative I think recently there was
an example of a frog which was found on

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:02.450
an example of a frog which was found on
 

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.590
an example of a frog which was found on
Staten Island which looked like a frog

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:05.600
Staten Island which looked like a frog
 

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.150
Staten Island which looked like a frog
that you find right across the East

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160
that you find right across the East
 

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.120
that you find right across the East
Coast but it's got a different call and

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.130
Coast but it's got a different call and
 

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.730
Coast but it's got a different call and
that led some herpetologist to try and

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:12.740
that led some herpetologist to try and
 

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.440
that led some herpetologist to try and
explore whether this represented the new

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:14.450
explore whether this represented the new
 

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.720
explore whether this represented the new
species and so they sequence this DNA

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:16.730
species and so they sequence this DNA
 

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.849
species and so they sequence this DNA
and it turns out it was definitely a new

00:41:18.849 --> 00:41:18.859
and it turns out it was definitely a new
 

00:41:18.859 --> 00:41:20.200
and it turns out it was definitely a new
species and they wouldn't have been able

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.210
species and they wouldn't have been able
 

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.090
species and they wouldn't have been able
to do that had they not you know tuned

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.100
to do that had they not you know tuned
 

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.040
to do that had they not you know tuned
into this aspect of its biology and you

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.050
into this aspect of its biology and you
 

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.020
into this aspect of its biology and you
could imagine any aspect of the way

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.030
could imagine any aspect of the way
 

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.300
could imagine any aspect of the way
something behaves or acts could be

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:28.310
something behaves or acts could be
 

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.130
something behaves or acts could be
informative in that regard

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140
informative in that regard
 

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.900
informative in that regard
this have you seen any efforts to use

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:34.910
this have you seen any efforts to use
 

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:43.000
this have you seen any efforts to use
artificial intelligence

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.010
 
 

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.559
 
yes yeah definitely there's all these

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:44.569
yes yeah definitely there's all these
 

00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:46.240
yes yeah definitely there's all these
kind of machine learning approaches

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:46.250
kind of machine learning approaches
 

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.370
kind of machine learning approaches
where computers are presented with

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:48.380
where computers are presented with
 

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.150
where computers are presented with
images of this is this was there was a

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.160
images of this is this was there was a
 

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.710
images of this is this was there was a
group working on this at the Museum

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720
group working on this at the Museum
 

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.480
group working on this at the Museum
looking at images of I think jumping

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:58.490
looking at images of I think jumping
 

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.280

spider or some kind of spiders eyes

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:00.290
spider or some kind of spiders eyes
 

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.349
spider or some kind of spiders eyes
which are kind of diagnostic of and and

00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359
which are kind of diagnostic of and and
 

00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:04.540
which are kind of diagnostic of and and
and seeing if their computer can

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:04.550
and seeing if their computer can
 

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.680
and seeing if their computer can
partition them into different groups

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:05.690
partition them into different groups
 

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.230
partition them into different groups
which you know biologists had recognized

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240
which you know biologists had recognized
 

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.990
which you know biologists had recognized
the species so I would say yes yes there

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000
the species so I would say yes yes there
 

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.220
the species so I would say yes yes there
is it's not at the stage where it's any

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:15.230
is it's not at the stage where it's any
 

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.780
is it's not at the stage where it's any
kind of substitute for the skill

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:16.790
kind of substitute for the skill
 

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.329
kind of substitute for the skill
taxonomy but yeah in the future like

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:19.339
taxonomy but yeah in the future like
 

00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:21.910
taxonomy but yeah in the future like
like I said you know the fraction of

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920
like I said you know the fraction of
 

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.109
like I said you know the fraction of
life on earth that we have just

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119
life on earth that we have just
 

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:25.569
life on earth that we have just
described so far may be quite small and

00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:25.579
described so far may be quite small and
 

00:42:25.579 --> 00:42:26.980
described so far may be quite small and
maybe if there was some kind of

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:26.990
maybe if there was some kind of
 

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.440
maybe if there was some kind of
high-throughput way of documenting it

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:29.450
high-throughput way of documenting it
 

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.270
high-throughput way of documenting it
that would be fantastic but I still

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280
that would be fantastic but I still
 

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.790
that would be fantastic but I still
think it's going to be a while for

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800
think it's going to be a while for
 

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.620
think it's going to be a while for
there's any substitute for the kind of

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:35.630
there's any substitute for the kind of
 

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.710
there's any substitute for the kind of
training knife for taxonomy yeah okay

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720
training knife for taxonomy yeah okay
 

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.430
training knife for taxonomy yeah okay
thank you very much that's great
