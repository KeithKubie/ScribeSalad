NEWSFLASH: Kissing is dirty, disgusting, and
also kinda great for your health.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.700
Take that, Duggars!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.760
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and everybody
loves kissing, right?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.760
That’s a thing.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.640
Well according to a new study, it’s actually
a very disgusting thing.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.370
A paper published this week in the journal
Microbiome - can you tell where I’m going

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.309
with this? - says that just a 10-second French
kiss, can spread up to 80 million bacteria

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.600
between mouths.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.379
This was a study conducted on 21 couples,
who agreed to have their tongues swabbed before

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.190
and after a 10-second long French kiss.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.600
Based on that experiment, scientists discovered
that people who are in committed relationships

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.719
tend to harbor similar collections of bacteria
on their tongues.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.559
And the more often they kiss, the more bacteria
they seem to share.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.179
To find out exactly how similar those bacteria
were, researchers repeated the experiment

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.469
- but this time, they instructed one of the
partners in each relationship to partake in

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.330
a probiotic yogurt drink, and then wait a
bit before making out with their significant

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
other.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.900
Sure enough, the probiotic bacteria - which
aren’t normally found in a person’s mouth

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.610
- transferred over to their partner, along
with 80 million other bacteria.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.890
It sounds kinda gross, but keep in mind that
as long as you’re not transferring any infectious

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.550
pathogens, increasing the diversity of bacteria
in your body is actually a very good thing.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.230
According to Remco Kort, the author of this
study, kissing is essentially a form of immunization,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.830
enabling you to build up resistance by exposing
yourself to more and different kinds of microorganisms.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.070
So the next time you find yourself at a club,
flirting with an attractive lady… try using

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.800
this pick-up line: “Hey baby, wanna diversify
your microbiome?”

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Works every time.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.190
What do you guys think about this, any thoughts?

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.750
Any amazing pick-up lines you’d like to
share with the class?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.860
Feel free to leave em all in the comments
down below.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.170
Otherwise, thanks for watching - and happy
kissing!
