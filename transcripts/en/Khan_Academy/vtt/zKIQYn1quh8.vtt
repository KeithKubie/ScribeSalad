00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.030
Let's do some SAT problems.
Let's see, we're starting test

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.350
5 now and it's problem
number 1.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.550
This is page 652.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.740
According to a certain recipe,
20-- I'm getting deja-vu, this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.860
looks like a question I did in
the last test, but maybe this

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.160
is different-- 25 pounds
of flour are

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.940
needed to make 300 rolls.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.110
So 25 pounds per 300
hundred rolls.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.070
At this rate, how many
pounds of flour are

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.960
needed to make 12 rolls?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.780
Well, we can make
a ratio here.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.680
So I need 25 to do
300 rolls, right?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.500
But they're asking us well, how
much do I need if I only

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.520
need to do 12 rolls?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.190
So 12 is what fraction of 300?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.090
Whatever that fraction is, the
fraction of rolls of pounds of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.690
flour I need to use will
be the same fraction.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.820
Let's say that this is
x is the pounds of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.030
flour I need to use.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.220
So x is to 25 as twelve
is to 300.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.460
And I can tell you from
inspection that 12 over 300 is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.450
the same thing as 1/25.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.400
If you don't believe me,
divide 300 by 12 and I

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.000
come up with that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.660
Well, you know 25 goes into
100 4 times and then

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.360
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240
If you don't believe me,
you can confirm this.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.980
And they did it on purpose
because this is the first

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.880
problem, which tends
to be a quick one.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.250
So x over 25 is equal to one
over 25, so x equals 1.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.090
So you need 1 pound of flour.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.030
And you could have also set the
ratio up like this: you

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.770
could have said 25 is to
300 as x is to 12.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.820
This would have also worked.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.080
Here we would have put the rolls
all on one fraction and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.850
we could've put the pounds
of flour all

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.610
on the other fraction.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.860
Next problem.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.750
Switching colors.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.260
Problem number 2.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:21.850
If xy is equal to 10, what is
the value of 2 times x divided

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.050
by y times y squared?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.790
Well the trick here is you've
got to simplify this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.040
expression before you attempt
to do anything.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.990
And simplifying, what's x
divided by y times y squared?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.390
Well this right here, this is
the same thing as xy squared

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.160
divided by y, right?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.340
We could put the 2 out here.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.820
And see, we have a 2 on top and
the y on the bottom is the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.340
same thing as y to the first,
so this is the same thing.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.270
What's y squared divided by y?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.830
Well it's just y, right?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.320
So we get 2x and y squared
divided by y is just y, right?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.830
The squared cancels out
with this entire term.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.880
This just gets 1.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.770
I divide the top and
the bottom by 1.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.240
So all I'm left with is 2xy, and
we know that xy is equal

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.910
to 10, so 2 times 10 is 20.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.950
That's choice e.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.750
Next problem.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.685
Problem 3.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:23.720
Let's see if I can fit it on
this without having to-- x

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.400
plus y is equal to 30.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.370
I might be talking funny.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.140
I just came from the dentist.
And x is greater than 8.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.220
Which of the following
must be true?

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.210
Well, we know x is greater than
8, and we also know that

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.530
x is equal to 30
minus y, right?

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.576
I just subtracted y from both
sides of that equation.

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:53.920
x is equal to 30 minus y.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.250
Well we also know that x is
greater than 8, so 30 minus y,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.250
which is the same thing
as x, must also be

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.730
greater than 8, right?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.580
30 minus y is also going
to be greater than 8.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.190
And we could play with
this a little bit.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.800
We could add y to both
sides and get 30 is

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.300
greater than 8 plus y.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.890
We could subtract 8 from both
sides and then you get 22 is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.615
greater than y, or y
is less than 22.

00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:26.900
And that's choice b.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.640
Next problem.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.890
Problem 4.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.410
I'm writing in toothpaste color
in honor of my recent

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.110
visit to the dentist. OK,
what do they have here?

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.930
They have three points.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.320
So point p, which
is 3 comma 2.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.950
Point q, which is 7 comma 2.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.980
And point r, which
is 7 comma 4.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.450
The coordinates of points p, q,
and r and the xy plane are

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.610
given above.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.410
What is the perimeter of pqr?

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.830
Let's draw that real fast. I
think that'll make things make

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.890
more sense, especially
if you missed it

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.160
the first time around.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.110
So p is 3 comma 2.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.950
So 3 comma 2, approximately.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.005
q is 7 comma 2, so this is 3.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.640
So this is going to be
a straight line.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.950
And what's this length
going to be?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.430
Well, it's going to be 4 because
it's going from 3 to 7

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.480
and we have no change in the
y, they're both at 2.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.750
Then we have r is 7 comma 4.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.845
It's going to be roughly
over here.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.760
This is q, this is r.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.290
And what's this distance?

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.790
Well we had no change it x, so
the distance is just going to

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.700
be the change in y,
so this is just 2.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.760
And now we have to-- and this is
r-- and now the only thing

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.980
we have to do to finish
this problem is

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.270
figure out that distance.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.640
And how do we figure
out that distance?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.600
Well this is a right triangle,
so we could use the

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.470
Pythagorean theorem.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.340
2 squared-- this is the
hypotenuse, right?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.640
The green side I drew, that's
the longest side and it's

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.320
opposite the 90-degree angle,
so it's the hypotenuse.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.260
So 2 squared plus 4 squared is
equal to-- let's call this x--

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.162
is equal to x squared.

00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:36.860
So this is 4 plus 16 is
equal to x squared.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.750
20 is equal to x squared.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.380
So x is equal to the
square root of 20.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.870
So x is equal to-- let's try to
simplify this, that's the

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.440
square root of 4
times 5, right?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.990
And we know what the square
root of 4 is, so we

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.720
can take that out.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.630
So that's x is equal
to 2 root 5.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.750
I find that this is actually
where most people have a lot

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.000
of trouble, simplifying
root 20 to 2 root 5.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.440
All we did is we factor 20 as a
product of a perfect square

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.690
and another number that's
not a perfect square.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.930
And then we took the
perfect square out.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.630
We said the square root of 4 is
2, so we can take it out.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.850
So x is 2 root 5.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.660
So what's the perimeter?

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.640
It's 4 plus 2 plus 2 root 5.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.050
So 4 plus 2 is 6
plus 2 root 5.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.750
Now let me see what
the choices are.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.620
Oh, I didn't even have
to do 2 root 5.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.150
They actually have choice
c says 6 plus the

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.640
square root of 20.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.480
So I didn't even have to do this
but that's good to know.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.110
This, what I did here,
is good to learn.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.840
But they made it so we didn't
have to do that.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.540
So it never hurts to glance at
your choices before you move

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.900
forward like I just did.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.150
Invert colors.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.840
I'm getting tired of this
color, so I will switch.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.240
Problem number 5.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:12.570
They give us a sequence: 8,
17, 26, 35, 44, and so on.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.260
The first five terms in a
sequence are shown above.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.970
Each term after the first is
found by adding 9 to the term

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.620
immediately preceding it.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:30.180
Which term in the sequence
is equal to 8 plus 26

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.309
minus 1 times 9?

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.590
Fascinating.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:42.080
So each term is equal to 9 plus
the previous term, right?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.410
So the first term, let's
say term one, let's

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.820
call this the term.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.130
Term one is 8.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.310
Term two, let's call
this t for term.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.680
Term two is 17.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.340
And an equation we could have
gotten that is we could've

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:12.130
gotten 8 plus 2 times-- oh
sorry, 8 plus 9 times what?

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.740
The term minus 1, right?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.730
Because that's just 8 plus
9 so if the term is 2,

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.360
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.470
So we multiply it times
9 and we add it to 8.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.930
Similarly, the third
term, which is 26.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.020
That's essentially
8 plus 16, right?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.310
So that's 8 plus-- I'm
sorry, 8 plus 18.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.950
So it's 8 plus 9 times--
once again, t minus

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.800
1, or 3 minus 1.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.920
Right here it's 2 minus 1,
here it's 3 minus 1.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.450
So in general, this
is the t-th term.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:54.030
This is the equation of the t-th
term, which looks oddly

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.100
familiar to what they give
us in the beginning.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.790
And if we do a little pattern
matching, we see that t is

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.850
equal to 26.
