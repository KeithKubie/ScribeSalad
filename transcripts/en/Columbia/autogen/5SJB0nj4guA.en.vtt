we are talking about the the imperative
 

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.730
we are talking about the the imperative
of job creation what these statistics

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:29.740
of job creation what these statistics
 

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.769
of job creation what these statistics
demonstrate is the challenge of

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:31.779
demonstrate is the challenge of
 

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:33.540

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:33.550
confronting urbanization and job
 

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.090
confronting urbanization and job
creation must go hand in hand they must

creation must go hand in hand they must
go in tandem this also may makes it

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.430
go in tandem this also may makes it
 

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.790
go in tandem this also may makes it
clear that this is also clear a very

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800
clear that this is also clear a very

urbanizing in a number of countries you

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480
urbanizing in a number of countries you
 

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.510
urbanizing in a number of countries you
see a very large concentration of the

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:54.520
see a very large concentration of the
 

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.870
see a very large concentration of the
poor now in urban areas and it's not

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880
poor now in urban areas and it's not
 

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.600
poor now in urban areas and it's not
because cities are making people poor it

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:00.610
because cities are making people poor it
 

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.510
because cities are making people poor it
is because poor people are coming from

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:03.520
is because poor people are coming from

the villages looking for economic

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:05.529
the villages looking for economic
 

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:08.220
the villages looking for economic
opportunities in the cities and so let

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.230
opportunities in the cities and so let
 

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.840
opportunities in the cities and so let
me give you another statistic just to

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:09.850
me give you another statistic just to
 

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:15.300
me give you another statistic just to
illustrate that in Lagos Nigeria every

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.310
illustrate that in Lagos Nigeria every
 

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.280
illustrate that in Lagos Nigeria every
hour so this is the hour while we are

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.290
hour so this is the hour while we are
 

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.980
hour so this is the hour while we are
having this lunch every hour 11 new

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:19.990
having this lunch every hour 11 new
 

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.350
having this lunch every hour 11 new
residents are going to move from the

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360
residents are going to move from the
 

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.780
residents are going to move from the
village from the villages to Lagos

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:24.790
village from the villages to Lagos
 

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.939
village from the villages to Lagos
looking for new opportunities so about

00:12:26.939 --> 00:12:26.949
looking for new opportunities so about
 

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:30.269
looking for new opportunities so about
200 250 300 people a day that is

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279
200 250 300 people a day that is
 

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:32.850
200 250 300 people a day that is
permanently residing coming to the city

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:32.860
permanently residing coming to the city
 

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.819
permanently residing coming to the city
so they are looking for jobs they are

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:35.829
so they are looking for jobs they are
 

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.740
so they are looking for jobs they are
looking for economic opportunities and

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:37.750
looking for economic opportunities and
 

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.870
looking for economic opportunities and
so the urbanization agenda is critical

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880
so the urbanization agenda is critical
 

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.139
so the urbanization agenda is critical
for job promotion it is critical for for

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:43.149
for job promotion it is critical for for

potential of what urbanization can do

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880
potential of what urbanization can do
 

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.210
potential of what urbanization can do
the fact is that urbanization and the

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:51.220
the fact is that urbanization and the
 

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.670
the fact is that urbanization and the
urban agenda is well placed to meeting

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680
urban agenda is well placed to meeting
 

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.150
urban agenda is well placed to meeting
this challenge throughout history

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
this challenge throughout history
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.620

urbanization and job economic growth

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:58.630
urbanization and job economic growth
 

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.040
urbanization and job economic growth
have gone in tandem so one global

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.050
have gone in tandem so one global

and happier of course it's the potential
 

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.020
and happier of course it's the potential
because there are some cities which also

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.030
because there are some cities which also
 

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.420
because there are some cities which also
don't meet that potential but the

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:45.430
don't meet that potential but the
 

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.510
don't meet that potential but the
question is if cities have this promise

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:48.520
question is if cities have this promise
 

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.370
question is if cities have this promise
and if cities have this robust

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:50.380
and if cities have this robust

question we should think about is what
 

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.840
question we should think about is what
is it about cities that makes them

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:57.850
is it about cities that makes them
 

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.629

palpable reason why cities have such a
 

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.889
palpable reason why cities have such a
dominant effect is because they have

00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:13.899
dominant effect is because they have
 

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.350
dominant effect is because they have
high population density and what we call

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360
high population density and what we call
 

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.829
high population density and what we call
a clustering of economic activity so in

00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:43.540
and service delivery but if we look at
 

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.259

innovation and entrepreneurship what is

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:46.269
innovation and entrepreneurship what is
 

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:48.720

you think about the high population

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:54.550
you think about the high population
 

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.579
you think about the high population
density it means this much higher level

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:56.589

is a good example where successful firms
want to locate in Bangalore because they

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:55.930
want to locate in Bangalore because they
 

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.749
want to locate in Bangalore because they
have a large pool of skilled labor and

that large pool of skilled labor comes
 

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:02.249
that large pool of skilled labor comes
to Bangalore because their large number

you also have the problem of the of the
 

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.359
you also have the problem of the of the
actual implementation in other cases so

00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:14.369
actual implementation in other cases so
 

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:16.579

doesn't mean it cannot be done and it

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:18.630
doesn't mean it cannot be done and it
 

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.180
doesn't mean it cannot be done and it
can be done where the capability is

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:20.190
can be done where the capability is
 

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.680
can be done where the capability is
strong and where checks and balances are

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:21.690
strong and where checks and balances are
 

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.359
strong and where checks and balances are
strong so the only thing is when you

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:23.369
