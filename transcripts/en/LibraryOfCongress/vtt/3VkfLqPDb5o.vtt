00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:15.180
[ Silence ]

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.480
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Good
morning everyone.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.780
I'm John Cole.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.210
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
and it's my pleasure to welcome you
to a continuation of the Library

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.610
of Congress's Bicentennial
Celebration of Poetry.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.480
This indeed is the Library of
Congress's bicentennial year.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.650
We are 200 years old and we are
marking the occasion by emphasizing

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.480 position:56%
and expanding on some of the Library
of Congress's special programs.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.880
As many of you know poetry
has been part of the Library

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.250
of Congress's programing since the
1930's when the office consulted

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.200
in poetry was established.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.660 position:56%
In recent years we have been blessed

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.350
with very activist
poetry consultants

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.910
who also are poet laureates
of the United States

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.840
and this has brought a whole new
range of activity to the Library

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.480
of Congress and it's a
pleasure that you can be part

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.110
of this poetry bicentennial
celebration.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.070
There is material on the
table as you came in --

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.770
as you come in about the Library
of Congress's Bicentennial

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.890
and about some of the
other poetry events

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.380
and activities that
are going on now.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.370
I would like to say first
of all how pleased we were

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.200
that so many people turned out
last night for the reading.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.440
I think that those of you who
were there not only enjoyed it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.680
but you'll see that it
provides a fertile field

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.970
for today's discussions.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.340
I also would like to point out
that we have a few of the people

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.800
who were involved in last
night's activity here.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.960 position:56%
The co-chair of today's events will
be Prosser Gifford whom you met last

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.660
night, who's the director
of Scholarly Programs here

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.440
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.900
I would like to recognize Grace
Cavalleri who is here today.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.730
There's a press announcement about
Grace's interviews with our poets,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.440
which are part of the
bicentennial celebration.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.820
They are -- those interviews
are now being broadcast

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.570
on public broadcasting and are
helping us celebrate poetry

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.330
and the Library of Congress.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.040
One of the reasons we're
doing the symposium is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.550
to give not only last
night's experience that we had

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.980
in hearing favorite poems
on film and in person,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.120
we're trying to give
it a historical context

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.450
to give this particular
celebration an after-life.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.080
Therefore we have today gathered
together not only scholars

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.290
but poets, participants, people
who are interested in poetry,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.340
the spoken word, and
the written word to talk

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.160 position:56%
about not only their perceptions of
last night, but of course the topics

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.520
that are in your program.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.430
And I hope you've all
picked up a program

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.300
which also has some biographical
information about our participants.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.880
For this reason I'm not going to go
into detailed introductions of each

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.840
of the panel members, I refer you
to your program, but I would say

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.660
that what we are trying to
do today and what we will do

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.900
through the discussions and
what we can do with your help is

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.570
to give context, historical
context and context for the future

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.930
about this poetry experience.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.230
We're starting with the panel
on "Recovering the Experiences

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.490 position:56%
of American Readers," where people
interested in book history are going

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.130
to present some points for
discussion, contemplation.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.750
We then will move on
with the panel chaired

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.490
by Prosser Gifford talking
about poetry and voice.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.940
We're hoping that Robber Pinsky
our poet laureate has recovered his

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.940
voice by the time this comes on.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.930
Robert is of course,
and actually is --

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.100
we're hoping to get his
throat taken care of.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.820 position:56%
There will be a panel at 1:30 on the
making of the Favorite Poem Project,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.990
which many of us saw last night.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.970
We'll talk about poets and
publishers in the afternoon panel

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.540
and conclude with a look
at poetry in America today

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.460
where we bring our consultants
and some of our poets

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.540
and our participants together
for a final look at the day

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.770
and reflections on the day.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.500 position:56%
I would now at this time like to
turn this over to our panel members.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.440
Each is going to make a brief
presentation in the order

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.660
in which they're listed
on the program.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.560 position:56%
After that is over we will open this

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.790
up for your ideas and
a panel discussion.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.430
I've asked our panelist to
decide whether they want to come

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.530
to this podium or speak
from the table

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.070
and our first speaker is David Hall
of the Harvard Divinity School.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.510
David? Give David a hand.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:34.070
[ Applause ]

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.010
&gt;&gt; David D. Hall: My remarks
are not about my favorite poem

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.890
but about a -- mostly
about a favorite novel,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.920
although as you will see shortly,
not everyone's favorite novel.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.990
In 1851, a young man named Charles
Holbrook, very much a Yankee,

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.500 position:56%
very much a native of Massachusetts,
graduated from Williams College.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.840
During the closing months

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.920 position:56%
of his college career he had worried
a good deal about his future.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.230
Should he enter the ministry

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.170
or perhaps start out
as a school teacher?

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.300
A few months after
graduating he noted

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.310
in a pocket diary he had been
keeping and would continue

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.860
to keep during the experiences
I'm about to describe, that --

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.370
and this is very characteristic
of recent college graduates,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.390
that he had been thinking
of happy days at college

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.160
and wished almost they
were not ended.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.560
Several days later he received a
letter informing him that a planter

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.840
in North Carolina was seeking
someone to instruct his children.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.700
Lacking, it seems, any other offer
of employment and, as he put it,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.740
tired of working on the family
farm, Charles, though unsympathetic

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.810
to the institution
of slavery as we know

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.510
from various entries,
accepted this offer.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.730
And in February 1852 traveled the
long way down to Rockingham County,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.060
North Carolina where he joined
the household of Thomas Galloway,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.110
a substantial planter who owns
some 30 slaves and whose children,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.920
together with those of a brother,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.330
become the new teacher's
responsibility.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.760
Several months later on
October 1st a neighbor arrived,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:34.510
and now I quote the diary, from
New York bringing many presents

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.150
and <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.670
Immediately Charles took hold of
this book and began to read it.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.540
October 1st, "I've been
reading the first volume

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.340
of <i>Uncle Tom's </i>tonight and
am much interested in it."

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.820
It was a two-volume work
when it was printed.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.340
The next day, October 2nd.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.010
"I have completed volume
one of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.870
Became much interested in it.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.750
It relates some exciting scenes."

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.650
October 3rd.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.780
"Read the sublime, the pathetic,

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.600
and affecting description
of Eva's death."

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.070
That's the little girl who dies,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.320
described at some considerable
length, just a long time to die.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.400
"Oh, there are some such children
even in this land of darkness.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.210
The tears rushed into my eyes as
I read about her peaceful death

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.870
and resolve tonight
to be more devoted."

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.410
October 4th.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.250
"Finished <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>
this morning at recess.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.890
I believe it to be the most
interesting book I have ever read.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.290
Poor, old Uncle Tom.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:02.670
He has gone to meet little Eva
in the better spirit land."

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.560
October 5th.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.040
"Read some of <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin </i>to Sandy,"

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.230
who happened to be
one of his pupils.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.840
"He says Edie's sister

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.910
at Mr. Harris's was tied
to a tree and whipped!"

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.120
Lots of exclamation points.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.710
"That the man struck her first

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.320
in the forehead with
the tobacco stick!"

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.890
More exclamation points.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.730
Then we learn from the diary
that this novel was passing

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.460
into other hands on the plantation.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.760
October 14th.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:41.850
Mr. G. likes <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin </i>but Mrs. G.,"

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.180
Mrs. Galloway, "is
bitter against it."

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.640
October 15th.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.830
"Great talk in the
house about Mrs. Stow.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.000
Mr. G. is honest, he says he
admires <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>for its

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.560
true characters."

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.800
October 16th.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.800
"Mr. Galloway says he will
burn <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.010
He has changed his mind on it.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:10.280
Mrs. G. thinks Mrs. Stow
is worse than Legree."

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.750
Out of this sequence of reactions
recorded for us in a diary

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:22.500 position:56%
that by chance has survived into our
own times, I and Barbara Sicherman,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.510
and Joan Rubin, and
others, many others,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:31.860
are helping to fashion a history
of reading in America that has

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.720
to simplify two principle
objectives.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.120
The first is to understand the
text that readers encountered

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.230
in past times as well
as in the present.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:51.180
And the second is to understand the
responses of readers themselves.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:57.220
And as we are constantly
rediscovering these two elements

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.300
of a history of reading,
text on the one hand, readers

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:09.390 position:56%
and their responses on the other are
confusingly ambiguous and complex

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.890
as indeed as indicated by
these episodes narrated

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.910
in the diary of Charles Holbrook.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:23.470
Texts most certainly imposed
themselves on readers.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.250
Like Charles Holbrook weeping
as he read <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:33.090
who among us has not been
captured, or swept away,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.820
or possessed by something
we have read?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.860
But on the other hand, who among
us has not been suspicious of,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.850
or found ourselves resisting
text that we encounter?

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.760
A resistance summed
up in the truism,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.470
the merits of which are
demonstrated every day,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.420
don't believe everything you read.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.720
The history of reading is at once
therefore a history of agency,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.360
that is of readers as actors
choosing, appropriating, modifying,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.470
reworking in various
ways, and of texts.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.970
And by texts I mean all kinds
of texts, poems, and novels,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.900
and many other forms of
printed work or written work.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.900
Of texts or narratives structures
that impose themselves on us,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.830
that constrain in some
manner, that are free

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.010
and that shape us in
some deep sense.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.930
Both aspects, agency and
constraint are evident

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.350
on the Galloway Plantation
in October 1852,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.920
as the remarkable novel made its
way around this group of readers.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.940
Charles Holbrook, swept away --

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:46.110
swept away by the power of this
story of mothers, white and black,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.900
who lose their children to
illness or to the social death

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.140
that slavery causes as
it splits families apart.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.360
A story which the underlying
plot contrasts.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.170
An amoral world in which money
and men have all the power

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:12.950
and do cruel things to
women, children, and slaves,

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:21.530
as opposed to the moral power
of women who resist this world

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.880
of men and their amoral ways.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.330 position:56%
And then there's still a deeper plot

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.740
that Charles Holbrook surely
was captured by as well,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.030
a world that God seems to
have abandoned, the distant

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.480
and caring God of the
old [inaudible] theology

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.690
that Harriet Beecher Stowe herself
found so cold and unsatisfying.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.010
And then the redemptive action,
not of churches and ministers,

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.950
but of women and innocent children
such as Eva, and of Christians

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.150
such as Uncle Tom, who like Christ

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.220
of whom he is a figure
-- or refigured as.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.090 position:56%
Who like Christ submits to suffering
even unto death and in doing

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.650
so from her perspective challenges
and even triumphs over the forces

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.990
of cruelty and amorality.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.370
Yet this of course is not the only
way to read <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.480
Like Mr. and Mrs. Galloway
southerners in the 1850's

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.910
and even some northerners
were outraged by the novel

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.380
and produced a rash of
fictional responses.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:32.780
Aunt Phyllis's cabin, or Uncle
Robin in his cabin in Virginia

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.880
and Tom without one in Boston.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.560
That's effort to -- maybe
you already know this --

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.990
that's an effort to reverse the
plot of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>and

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.660
to suggest that wage slavery
in the North was far crueler

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.330
than the paternal,
loving, domestic slavery --

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.910
slave system in which the
planters, or the fathers

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.780
and the planters wives, or the
mothers, and so forth and so on,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.510
to take the same domesticity idea
and make it work for the South.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.990
Incidentally an idea
that is referred

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.560
to in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>where
little Eva at one point says,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.030
astonishingly enough when the
question raised is slavery moral

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.930
or immoral, she says,
"Well slavery makes

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.200
so many more around us to love."

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.520
That's the domestic
ideology transformed

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.340
into a defense of slavery.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.930
I suspect however that Mrs.
Galloway, who is clearly the one

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.700
who detests the novel the most
was reacting to other threats

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.250
in the novel, including for
example, the many examples --

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.990
including the characters who are
black women serving as mistresses

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.560
of white men and of white
women who are lazy, indolent,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.320
and really in some
sense anti-mothers.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.690 position:56%
Much later after the Second World
War certain African American readers

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.960
would join the Galloway's
in resisting this text,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.870
at a point where it's theological
framework of suffering women

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.950
and slaves as stand-ins for Christ
and of redemption occurring not

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.160
by social revolution but by some
longer arc of God's providence,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.520
no longer made much sense.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.120
These readers refigured Uncle
Tom, not as an agent of salvation

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.970
but as someone who
accommodated himself to a corrupt

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.700
and amoral social system
and in doing

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.740
so betrayed the possibilities
for direct resistance.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.570
Uncle Tom, the way we use
the term so often today.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:35.360
Still closer to our own days
feminist readers have resisted the

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.310
idea and image of home as
this remarkably harmonious

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.770
and benevolent place that's
still accepted and exalted

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.060
as the proper place for woman.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.130
And feminist readers have also
resisted Stowe's arguments the way

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.500
for woman to overturn an amoral
social system was through suffering

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.100
and sacrifice in their
own distinctive sphere.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:06.160
In these readings and re-readings,
and I daresay mis-readings

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.280
of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>lay
the concrete particulars

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.270
of a history of reading in America.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.530
A history that as I have indicated,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.550
is structured around an ever
recurring tension between the power

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.370
of text to impose themselves on us,
to enter into our very selfhood,

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.660
and on the other, as in these
examples that I have given,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.500
the power of readers to
suspend belief to accept

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.010
or reject the logic of the text.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.840
There is therefore no simple
answer to the question how was such

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:47.860 position:56%
and such a book read in the past or
what does a particular text reading?

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.250
The history of reading is a great
field to work in because it is

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.650
so remarkably open-ended
as we attempt to do justice

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.500
to the complexities both of text

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.840
and of the responses
of those who read them.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.640
Thank you.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.910
[ Applause ]

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.210
&gt;&gt; Barbara Sicherman: Thank you.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.090
Having been privileged to see
the videos last night I see this

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:19.150
contribution to today's events
as the meeting of reading

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:24.050
in two past lives, or at
least a segment of that.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.140
"Books are the dreams we would most
like to have," writes Victor Nell,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.250
author of <i>Lost in a Book </i>.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.630
"Like dreams," he continues,
"they have the power

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.960
to change consciousness,
turning sadness to laughter,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.550
and the anxious introspection
to the relaxed contemplation

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.810
of some other time and place."

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.640
Nell focuses here on
reading as escape.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.820
A fitting concern for a book
subtitled, "The Psychology

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.610
of Reading for Pleasure."

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.200
No mention of nightmares here.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.000
By examining the stories of
reading of two women born

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.970
under quite different circumstances
in the late 19th Century I hope

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.670
to show that reading not
only changes consciousness,

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.180
but by doing so can
also change lives.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.300
M. Carey Thomas, later
president of Bryn Mawr College,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.610
grew up in upper middle class
privilege, tempered somewhat

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.460
by the family's Quaker
heritage, which in theory

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.460
at least banned theater,
music, and novels, though not,

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.720
it should be noted, poetry.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.320
But Thomas had access to
the world's great literature

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.140
through a neighboring uncle
and to more current fare

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.960
at Baltimore's Mercantile Library.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.940
Reading was as necessary
to her as breathing.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.190
On returning from an
Adirondacks vacation

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.380
in her early 20's she
headed for the local library

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.780
where she read for
four days straight.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.170
"And the hours were like seconds,
it was like treading on air.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.890 position:56%
It is the purest happiness, the one
thing which no man taketh from you."

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.320
For Thomas reading was also
a vehicle for articulating

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.270
and thereby intensifying ambition.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.670
"The fact is," she proclaimed
at 14, "I don't care much

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.980
for anything except dreaming about
being grand, and noble, and famous,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.070
but that I can never be."

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.970
But even then she hoped
to show that the woman

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.530
who has fought all the battles
of olden time over again,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:19.090
whilst reading the spirited pages
of Homer, Virgil, Herodotus,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.670
been carried away by Carlisle,
and mildly enchanted by Emerson.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.760
Is not any less like what God
really intended a woman to be,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.120
than the trifling ballroom
butterfly,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.410
an ignorant doll baby
which they admire.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.480
The passage reveals
the possibilities

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.450
for female heroism Thomas found
in classic text and demonstrates

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.900 position:56%
as well the reciprocal relationship
between her reading and her ambition

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.920
for it concludes, "My greatest
ambition is to be an author,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.380
an essayist, an historian,
to write hardy, earnest,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.130
true books that may do their part
towards elevating the human race.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.620
The woman who could read herself

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.770
into books might grow
up to write them."

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:06.310
Toward this end Thomas engaged in a
wide variety of literary activities

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.470
from the ages of 13
and 15, and later,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.620
but these are the ones
I'm going to discuss.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.380
In addition to starting a journal
she kept a commonplace book,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.260
a list of favorite poems,
which I should've brought,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.530
and lists of books she had
read or wanted to read.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.200
She also wrote poetry
and short stories

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.330
and sent one of each Harpers.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.630
Both were rejected.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.610
She was 12, 13 at this time.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.300
Although Thomas was precocious
she claims to have learned to read

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.470
by age three and she started
Greek in her early teens.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.520
These pursuits were
by no means unusual.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.250
Girls of her class were expected

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.760
to cultivate literary
self-consciousness.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.460
Like Thomas they kept diaries,
wrote and recited poetry,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.420
read aloud together, and
aspired to authorship,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.910
then the most prestigious
career available to a woman.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.530
When Thomas began her journal
in 1870, at the age of 13,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.180
she did so in the persona
of Jo March,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.440
the heroine of <i>Little Women </i>.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.270
"Ain't gonna be sentimental.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.210
No, no, not for Joe.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.120
Not Joe." And I should explain,
the first Jo is Jo March,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.420
and the second is a J-O-E, Joe.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.670
So she's saying that
this is a female Joe

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.270
that she's going to be like.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.540 position:56%
Emulating a literary character was a
common practice among young diarists

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.860
as they attempted to
establish their own personal

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.010
and literary identities.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.150
Like Thomas, Jo was
a tomboy, a bookworm,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.580
and eager to do something splendid.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.900
Most importantly she
was a successful author

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.890
who was paid for her writing.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:46.860
Alcott [inaudible] appealed,
because as Jo, J-O, not Joe, J-O-E,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.800 position:56%
she demonstrated that women could
be writers and in other ways aspire.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.530
Years later when Thomas was
embarking on graduate study

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.660
in Germany a childhood
friend who had joined her

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.570
in adolescent roleplaying
which centered

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.490
around <i>Little Women </i>reflected,
"Somehow today I went back

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.310
to those early days when
our horizon was so limited,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:12.070
yet so full of light, and our
path laid as plain before us.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:18.650 position:56%
It all came of reading over Ms.
Alcott's books, now the quintessence

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.520
of philistinism, then a Bible.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.960
Doesn't thee remember when to turn
out a Jo the height of ambition?"

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.710
<i>Little Women </i>was only
the beginning of course.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.210
In early adolescence Thomas also
crossed gender boundaries reading

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:36.490
herself as a Carlislian
hero a [inaudible] hero.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.330
Later a devotee of the romantic
poets, Shelly especially,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.220 position:56%
Thomas adopted a worldview mode of
reading that fostered self-creation.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.760
In her early 20's her ambitions
were reinforced by members

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.640
of a feminist reading circle
who read and wrote and dreamed

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.760
and schemed to advance the
[inaudible] women together.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.760
Their later achievements included
securing the admission of women

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.350
to Johns Hopkins Medical School.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.430
Can I get some water?

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.180
Thank you.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:13.400
A very different story is
that of Rose Gollup Cohen,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.290
who was born in the Russian
[inaudible] in 1880 and grew

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.790
up in an old world
tradition where reading

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.800
and storytelling both
centered on religion.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.830
Like other Jewish girls she
learned Yiddish, not Hebrew,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.290
the language of sacred
text was for men only.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.880
Neither her mother or
father could write.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.120
Coming to the United
States at the age of 12,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.290 position:56%
as the oldest child she went to work

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.390
in a factory foreclosing the
possibility of further education.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:48.170
In her autobiography, <i>Out of
the Shadow </i>, published in 1918,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.860
Cohen narrates her progress from
marginal literacy in Yiddish

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.700
to authorship in English,
a change accompanied

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.000
by an awakening self-consciousness.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.670
Unused to reading in the new
land she initially had to spell

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.670
out the words of the
neighbor's Yiddish book,

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.970
astonished that it was not
about religion but just a story.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.210
She became a regular customer
at the soda water stand,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.980
borrowing books at
five cents a copy.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.910
She read the volumes,
mainly romances,

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.520
to her mother and siblings.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.470
They transported her.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.290
"And I live now in
a wonderful world."

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.100
She was alternately a beautiful
countess living in a palace

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.820
and a beggar's daughter
singing in the street.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.420
Her encounter with <i>David
Copperfield </i>in the Yiddish

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.110 position:56%
translation was of a different kind.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:41.370
Electrified by the title of
the first chapter, "I Am Born,"

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.720
and by the intimate first-person
narrative, she was filled

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.100 position:56%
with a strange feeling of happiness.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.880
"Someone was talking to me.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.200
I could almost hear the voice."

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.640 position:56%
Cohen had no doubt that this story
was real, something she used to love

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.440
to know and she did
not want to let it go.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.300
She and her family did not
read another book for a week.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.280
Another volume, part letters,
part diary, similarly appealed

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.280
because of its intimate tone

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.610
and precipitated her
first hesitant efforts

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.050
at authorship in the
form of a diary.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.750
Though she had to rub out most
of the first night's labor one

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.670
but bold sentence remained.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.970
"I hate the shop.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.270
I feel sick.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.570
I feel tired.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.620
I cannot see any meaning in life."

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.050
By this time Cohen's
reading went beyond the stage

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.800
of vicarious adventure.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.460
Books were now a springboard
for emotional communication.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.380
Reading the diary had
triggered the desire

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.020
to express herself
in personal writing.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.850
Diary-keeping and self-awareness
were mutually reinforcing.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.320
The diary encouraged introspection,
but the desire to keep one

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.720
and her rejection at this
time of an arranged marriage

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.180
to an incompatible man symbolized
in Cohen's account by his lack

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.750
of interest in reading,
signaled an already

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.590
heightened self-consciousness.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.600
Like many immigrants
Cohen learned English

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.560
through a series of intermediaries.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.410
Night school, settlement
houses, and libraries.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.660
Although, she encountered
these only after she'd been

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.930
in the States for five years.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.550
She finally learned to read English

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.950
from the Bible during a three-month
stay at Presbyterian Hospital.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.220 position:56%
But her achievement was problematic.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.000
The volume was a New
Testament and her reading

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.600
in Gentile books enraged her father

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.550
who threw one of them
out the window.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.500
These books came mainly from
the [inaudible] Free Library

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.230
at the Educational Alliance, a
Jewish Settlement in New York

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.540
where she had gone first
seeking a volume of Shakespeare.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.750
Unable to understand <i>Julius Caesar</i>
she requested an English book,

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.750
like for a child, and was
rewarded with <i>Little Women </i>,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.700
which seems to have been the
iconic book for immigrants.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.740
As her skills improved Cohen
read widely, favoring Dickens,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.560
Longfellow's <i>The Day is Done </i>,
and Olive Schreiner's <i>Dreams </i>,

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.520
a series of allegories,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.310
which I think influenced
her own writing style.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.540
Reading not to escape her
situation but to comprehend it,

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.260
Cohen turned to Silas Marner
which a friend recommended

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.300
when there was trouble at home.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.700
"It was so that I loved
best to read.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.150
When I could see a connection
between life and literature,

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.450
literature to me was
as real as life.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.740
Literature was life.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.640
Many amusement that was within
my reach I gave up to read."

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.970
Reading offered solace that made
her own situation easier to bear,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.940
elicited a sensibility that helped
her understand it, and provided her

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.840
with a language into which she
could translate her own experience.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.620
What did she mean when she
declared that literature was life?

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.960
That she lived in books rather

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.200
than amidst her impoverished
surroundings?

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.430
That literature made life bearable?

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.200
That she could not live without it?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.940
Perhaps something of all of these.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.040
<i>Out of the Shadow </i>ends
on an ambiguous note,

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.700
with Cohen still laboring
to write English.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.480
We know she succeeds because she
has written her autobiography.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.870
It begins with the line, "I
was born in a Russian village."

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.130
Perhaps an unconscious
echo of the passage

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.280
in <i>David Copperfield </i>that had
captivated her years before.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.190
Cohen went on to publish
several short pieces,

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.240
one a story of Russian village
life was selected as one

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.030
of the best stories of 1922.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.130
As she described the process of
creation, when the first pictures

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.020
of the story came to her she fell

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.740
into weeping with the
peasant mother.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.330
"I was no longer building a
story, I was living the life

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.580
of my childhood over again."

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.710
Perhaps the emotional intensity
of the creative act helps

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:47.910
to explain why the editor of the
volume ranked Natalka's portion

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.730
as one of the works that unite
genuine substance and artistic form

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.830
in a closely woven
pattern with such sincerity

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:00.060
that these stories may fairly claim
a position in American literature.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.220
It was an extraordinary achievement
for one who had struggled

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.770
for literacy and who
had learned English

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.070
on her own in her late teens.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.480
It also I think is an
interesting definition

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.070
of what constitutes
American literature,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.190
since these were Russian stories.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.990
In different ways then
reading helped Thomas

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.630 position:56%
and Cohen obtain more self-assertive
identities than were expected

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.980
of women of their time and place.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.410
During adolescence both moved on
from reading and dreaming to trying

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:34.090 position:56%
to realize their dreams in the first
instance by bringing them to life

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.940
through the act of writing.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.910
I would argue then that reader --

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:43.350 position:56%
reading, even pleasure reading bears
a more complex relationship to life

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.270
than the one suggested
earlier by Victor Nell.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.680
The imaginative space
opened up by reading can,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.880
under the right circumstances
stimulate creativity

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.340
and foster a reciprocal rather

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.510
than a one-way relationship
between books and lives.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:07.080
[ Applause ]

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.380
&gt;&gt; Joan Shelley Rubin: Thank you.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.120
After seeing the videos last night
several of us were tempted just

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.380
to throw out our remarks for today

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.240
and to let those stand
in all of their power.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.680
I guess I've been dissuaded
from that move.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.340 position:56%
But before I start my brief comments
I do want to just say that our idea

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.170
as John Cole already indicated,

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:33.380
was to connect the Favorite Poem
Project, to some of the work

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.210
that we're doing in the History of
Reading to give the project a kind

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.230
of historical context and also,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.690 position:56%
to indicate how much this project is
going to mean for us as historians.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:50.810
This is exactly what we wish
we had for readers in the past.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.830
I also want to thank all of the
participants in today's symposium,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.340
many of whom I personally
dragooned into being here.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.480
They have told me that they were
delighted to be there last night

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.910
and also of course to carry
on the conversation with you

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:13.290
but they already feel well paid
by what we saw last evening.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:18.330
Well, I began to look into the
history of poetry reading --

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:23.300 position:56%
God now quite a few years ago and
when I began that undertaking I came

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:28.770
across a comment that William Dean
Howells, the novelist but also

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.180
at that time, this was 1902.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:38.020
Howells was occupying the editor's
easy chair at <i>Harper's </i>magazine,

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.890
and I came across a comment that
he made after he polled his readers

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.770
about whether or not they
believed that the United States was

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.950
in the midst of a slump in poetry.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.330
There was no denying
Howells' acknowledged

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:59.720
that the Anglo-American lords
of rhyme, as he called them,

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.660
Longfellow, Whittier,
Bryant, Tennyson, Wordsworth,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.940
had passed from the
ranks of working poets.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:13.800
Some of the readers Howells
queried bemoaned this demise

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.760
of the Anglo-American lords
of rhyme and they felt

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.110
that there was a slump in poetry.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.380
Others insisted that the
genre was flourishing.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.090
But Howells himself made
a crucial observation

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:31.190
when he remarked the really
interesting and important thing

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.290
to find out would be
whether the love

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:40.950
of poetry shares the apparent
decline of poetry itself.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.800 position:56%
Today no one would argue that poetry
is in a slump, quite the opposite.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.090
But in a sense the
Favorite Poem Project

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:52.970
after almost 100 years gives
Howells his answer and that is

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.410
because the poet laureate's
inquiry has followed

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:02.600
through on Howells' instinct to
disconnect reading and writing.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.990
Those of us who have
been working in the field

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.960
of print culture have
been attempting

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:13.470 position:56%
to construct a literary history that
describes more than just a series

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:19.090
of movements, romanticism,
realism, modernism, and so forth.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:24.620
And instead to separate at least
somewhat the history of reading

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.120 position:56%
from the vicissitudes of production.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:34.060
In that way we hope to recover the
ideas and values of ordinary people

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.200
and to understand how they have
made sense of their experience.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.800
So I got into this myself a
few years ago when it dawned

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.020
on me that poetry was a genre.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.360
That because it was
both intimate and public

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:57.050
at least gave us half a chance of
recovering both what people read

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:04.270
and how and why they read the text
that they had chosen and the way

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.040
that the text gave them both
agency and constrained them,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.150
as David Hall has remarked.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:17.970
I can remind you that in the
period roughly from 1880 to 1950,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:23.560
Americans routinely encountered
poems at school, in church,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.700
at family gatherings, at community
events, and even as it turns

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.930
out for some, in summer camp.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.300
I want to share with you this
morning just a brief look at some

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.270
of the lessons that I've learned

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.680
by exploring poetry
read at those sites.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.250 position:56%
I've already hinted at the first
lesson but I want to make it clearer

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.690
to you by giving you an example.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.610
None of us can talk, including
Robert Pinksy himself.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.790
Thank you.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.980
Okay, this is an example
from the autobiography

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.660
of a man named Walter Locke,
who became editor of the Dayton,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:07.300
Ohio Daily News in 1927, but
who grew up in the 1890's.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.650
Locke developed eye
problems after, as he put it,

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.010 position:56%
he delighted intemperately in books.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.700
He decided that the
way out of this was

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.990
through poetry and
through memorizing.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.100
Longfellow, Whitman, and
later Sandburg, and Millay.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.500
This memorization and then
recitation of the poems

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:34.500
to himself became what he
called a way to carry on a life.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.920
But Locke described his
pursuit of poetry in language

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.280
that suggests the cultural
tensions surrounding the genre.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.570
He was aware, in his words that
the age was choosing between poetry

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.740
and speed and it was
not choosing poetry.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:55.500
And so he saw himself
forging an alliance

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.050
with the poets the
world was passing by.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.010
In addition he associated
reading with addiction,

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.990
intoxicant effects, and indulgence.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.450
So poetry was for Locke
a guilty pleasure,

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:18.280
a source of what he called
his secret, joy, and shame.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.690
Now most of us are not accustomed
to thinking of reading Longfellow

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:27.660 position:56%
in the terms we usually reserve for
sex and so this is a jarring remark,

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.750
his secret, joy, and shame.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.430 position:56%
But Locke's clandestine relationship

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.590
to poetry is highly
instructive I think.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:41.320
First it points out the inadequacy
of depicting the early 20th Century

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.700
as simply the period
when the beginnings

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.980
of early modernism planted
the schoolroom poets.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:52.460
Not only is Longfellow's work
alive and well but Locke,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.300
as he goes on as reader,
assimilates Carl Sandburg --

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.000
this is very interesting --
he assimilates Carl Sandburg,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.680
a poet of smoke and steel, to
what he imagines was the simpler,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.100
slower life of the 19th Century.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.240
So this is an instance of
that kind of appropriation

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.100
or we might even say misreading

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:16.220
because of his own needs
and predispositions.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.460
Furthermore these eclectic
texts survive

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:24.590
in Locke's memory giving them
an ongoing life in culture long

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.410
after he has put aside
the printed page.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.970
There's another reader in
the same period who talks

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.540
about his secret shelf collection.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.750
The books that he really loved
even though he knew that he had

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.240
to exhibit what he called an
intelligent social self and that

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.360
to do that meant that
he wouldn't talk

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.440
about Longfellow's most sentimental
poems or the battered old volume

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.800
of Tennyson that he had
on his secret shelf.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:56.690
That remark reveals not only this
closet of affection for verse

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.570
but also, incidentally, the
practice of rereading older works,

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.090
this battered old volume
that he keeps coming back to.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.690
So these confessional accounts

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.710
of these [inaudible] poetry
lovers thus illuminate

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.070
for us how the history of reading
can elude both conventional

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.050
categories of literary
scholarship such as modernism

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.890
and customary measures of
distribution such as sales figures.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:28.390
The second lesson that I
discovered is that site matters,

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.180
the setting in which
readers are reading matters.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:37.060
Text acquire values and functions
as a consequence of those settings.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:41.800
Here I want to give you an
example of the classrooms

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.400
of progressive educators in
the 1920's, those teachers

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.440
who experimented with new ways
of instructing their students.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.780
In one of those classrooms we
find that pupils are learning

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.770
to approach Edna Saint Vincent
Millay's lyrics by striving

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:04.380
for what one educator called
apprehension, not comprehension.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.310
It doesn't seem to me those
have to be mutually exclusive

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.010
but they were in this formulation.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.320 position:56%
And so in that milieu the
progressive classroom reading Millay

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.000
became the occasion for
submitting to feeling.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.730
We have this review
that one student wrote

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.530
after reading <i>The Harp
Weaver </i>and other poems.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.740
"It is cruel to review it.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.420
It is too lovely.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.710
Nothing can be said
better than read it."

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.010
Now -- right.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:37.260
So, actually that's
sort of akin to how some

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.540
of us felt about speaking today.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.600
It's cruel for us to do this
kind of analytical presentation.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.070
Nevertheless, for cultural
historians who are inclined

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.570
to regard the 1920's as an era
of tough-mindedness and sort

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.480
of new-minded sensibility,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.870
that comment is a telling
counter example.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.960
That's a very romantic
approach to the text to submit

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.460
to the feelings of the text.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.370 position:56%
And yet at roughly the same time, in
the 20's, there's also the example

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:11.820
of a Methodist minister who was
given to incorporating poetry

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.760
into his sermons and he pronounced
Millay's <i>Renascence </i>an account

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.140
of what he called a good,
old-fashioned religious conversion,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.230
thereby yoking her rebellious
sexuality to conservative impulses.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:33.170
Right? Which also characterized
the culture of the interwar period.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.070
That is the conservative
impulses are also there

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.110
in the culture of the
interwar period.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:42.840
Finally, for the journalist
Margaret Parton, reading Millay,

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.250
this is somewhat later, became
a test of the relationship

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.260
between father and daughter.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.140
In the early 1930's while
Parton was a student

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.640
at Swarthmore College she grew
anxious that, in her words,

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.970
she might, "Let down
her parents by failure."

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:04.390
She wrote home, as she said, "To
prepare them for this possibility."

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:07.090
And her father calmed
her down with a letter

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.700 position:56%
that reveals how this family worked.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.580
He responded, "If when I handed you

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.300
that little Edna Saint Vincent
Millay poem you had tossed off some

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.440
flip crack, or had been insensitive

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.720
to its quaint Elizabethan
charm I would have flunked you

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.650 position:56%
in practical and applied aesthetics.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.770
And I would not have felt
the serenity and assurance

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:36.090
which now I give you my
word I feel about you."

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:41.440
She passed the test and the poem
certainly further strengthened the

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.510
bond between Parton and her
father, though it is clear

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.160
that there is a great deal
at stake in this reading.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.950
So at school, in church, at home,
Millay's poetry read according

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:59.140 position:56%
to different rules, served different
psychological and cultural purposes

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.620
which I think were integral

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.740
to reader's understanding
of its meanings.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.220 position:56%
Furthermore, and I hope this isn't
too dismaying to the poets among us,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.660
sometimes the history of poetry
reading reveals that the content

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.900
of a poem matters far less
than the act of reading of it.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:23.460
Readers queried about their use of
verse frequently report practices

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.060
that we might call anesthetic.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:30.290
So, you know, in the dentist
chair, on an airplane,

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:34.620 position:56%
and it doesn't really matter at
that point so much what the text is.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.780 position:56%
More subtlety in many
circumstances of reading the setting

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.440
and the feelings that
the reader brought

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.900
to that setting overshadow
the poet's form and language.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.850
So here I'll give you
just one example.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.240
This comes from a woman named Clara
Holloway who was a teenager growing

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.830
up on the Iowa frontier in the
1880's and who grew despondent

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:05.070
because her future husband,
Eddie Grossbeck, failed to show

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:07.950
up for her 18th birthday party

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.860
and she was actually
given to self-blame.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.560
It's quite an interesting diary.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.130
But at any rate a few days later
Eddie made amends by coughing

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.830
up a book of Wordsworth poems.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.120
Clara found reading
Wordsworth enjoyable

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.640
but of much more importance was
the symbolism of receiving a book

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.550
of verse from a boy of whose
affections she was uncertain.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.500
She later actually married him.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.260
But as she remarked in what I take

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.100
to be a wonderful 19th Century
expression, "I shall prize it

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.890
for the givens sake more
than for anything else."

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.870
If the historical record
reveals that the site

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.590
of reading sometimes
imparted to text,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.600
meanings we might call
extraneous due

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.680 position:56%
to their literary qualities however,
it is equally important to see

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.360
that it also shows us how
the same poems linked readers

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.890
who occupy different social
and economic circumstances.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.940
And here I am thinking not only of
the Millay example where it's safe

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:11.970 position:56%
to say that all of the readers I
mentioned were middle class but also

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.230
of instances involving
working class readers

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.800
such as the ones Barbara Sicherman
has noted, and more affluent ones.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.240 position:56%
With the development of a relatively
standardized educational curriculum

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:29.220 position:56%
by around 1900 virtually everybody
read Longfellow and Byron in school.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.690
And to associate such poems only
with middle class culture is

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.340
to forget what one writer, a
man named Rollo Walter Brown,

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.350 position:56%
recalled in his memoir about growing

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.900
up in the clay mining
country of Ohio.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:47.310
Brown discovered Byron
and Longfellow

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.600
in a cookbook his mother
had borrowed --

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.450
printed that is in the cookbook,

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.160
and this fact I think
underscores one thing.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.200
The multiple and pervasive
forms of printed verse assumed

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.510
in the early 20th Century.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.880
Reading Byron over and over he
committed lines to memory until,

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:12.220 position:56%
in his words, "I could drop back
over my heels against a pile of clay

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.950
and recite to myself with
unvoiced eloquence these

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:20.320
or any other poems I knew and
then sit up and rake the shovel

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.590
across the gritty floor with
pandemonium of approval."

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:30.940
In that way he transmuted his
experience of work into an occasion

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.660
when he said he could sort out
the choice parts of a world

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:41.150
that ran off everywhere from the
face of the clay until a splash

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.180
of roof somewhere reminded
him, woke him up,

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.810
that he was still in a clay mine.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.160
While Brown's poetry reading
permitted him a vision

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.660
of what we might call upward
mobility, it does still seem

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.610
to me a mistake to say that it was
not part of working class life,

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:06.030
especially since his approach
to rereading is quite parallel

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.440
to the way his father reads
religious periodicals,

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.110
which is to say that he reads them
over and over half a dozen times.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:18.980
At the same time, Brown's class
did not restrict his access

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.640
to the same text that his more
affluent contemporaries were

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.130
memorizing in other
settings at the same time.

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:33.080
So, to those lessons that poetry
reading exhibited sustained,

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:38.260
if sometimes hidden, a clandestine
vitality, that sites mattered,

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:43.360 position:56%
that in some respects class did not,
I just want to add a final lesson,

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.010
a final point, and that is that
for American readers the figure

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.360
of the poet has worn
a variety of guises.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.390
The representation of the poet
as seer and visionary has been

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:00.650
and remains a powerful
idea, but it has coexisted

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.560
with more accessible images.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.540
In the correspondence of Carl
Sandburg one finds letters

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:13.010
such as this one from a woman
in Fort Worth, Texas dated 1927.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.910
"I am not a poet and do
not want anything accept

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.320
to tell you how much I love you,

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.240
and how your poems have been a good
influence in my life which I hope

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.270
to pass on to other lives.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.110
This is not a mash note.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:36.140
You have spoken to me individually
in the loneliness of my heart.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.320
You have spoken to me individually
in the loneliness of my heart

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.320
and I have found in your sympathy
understanding and encouragement

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.210
to go on telling the story
of my kind of people."

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.530
No doubt the poets in
attendance have sometimes wished

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:55.810
for more remote [inaudible]
or at least less mail.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.250
Certainly the question
of the poet's ideal role

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:04.020
in a democratic society is
complicated and controversial

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:08.860
but by bringing poet and public
together today this symposium

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:15.120 position:56%
and the project it celebrates embody
what the historical record affirms.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.000
That poetry has been a
vibrant act of presence

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.810 position:56%
in the lives of the American people.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:22.610
Thank you.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:32.550
[ Applause ]

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.210
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: I'd like to
make the brief observation

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.200
that through these three wonderful
speakers we've had a terrific

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.740
introduction to the field of
the history of reading and many

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:47.170
of its implications and indeed this
is going to be a good background

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.850
for our discussions for the rest
of the day and for our reflecting

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.710
on the Favorite Poem Project and
the archive that's being built

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.180
as Joan Rubin was saying.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:02.280 position:56%
And I would like to thank Joan for
her help in corralling, as she said,

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.590
such a distinguished
group of speakers

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.320
and this is what we're going
to be able to look forward

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.040
to for the rest of the day as well.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.740
Before I open it up for questions
I'd like to ask our panel

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.080
if they have any questions
or observations based

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.510
on each other's comments.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:23.190
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.970
It's interesting, though, even
the concept favorite poem which,

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:31.580 position:56%
of course, Robert Pinsky has
carried on so effectively is an idea

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.390
that comes from our past and I'm
sure those of you like myself

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:39.600
who memorized a lot of
poetry for different reasons.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.820
When I was a child I did also
have a list of favorite poems

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.740
which I found my old
anthology, one of my first ones,

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.820
the Louis Untermeyer anthology.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:56.610
Which in fact I discovered later
when I traveled I actually clip --

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.690 position:56%
I got a second copy of the paperback
and I actually clipped out some

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:02.680
of the poems and I took them
with me in my guidebooks

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.020
when I went to different places.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.410
So each of us I think will find as
we go through today's discussion

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.230
and observations that we can relate

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:15.000
to this favorite poem
concept in a different way.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.840
David any thoughts?

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.460
&gt;&gt; David D. Hall: I have to say.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:23.230
I read an essay by Mary
[inaudible] on the subject

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:30.040
of [inaudible] plausible
idea about the book.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:38.060
It argues essentially that
[inaudible] this [inaudible]

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:46.040
who has been [inaudible] by books
and [inaudible] extraordinary idea

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:52.510
and I wondered whether in
[inaudible] reading of books

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.760
that [inaudible] scholars
like yourselves,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:03.130
this aspect of the history of
reading plays and the part,

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.160
any significant part
[inaudible] interesting.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.910
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:10.210
Thank you.

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.510
Please, yes, it's on.

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:16.160
&gt;&gt; I can provide a
17th Century example

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:24.260
and then others perhaps
can add more recent ones.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:30.010
But in the 17th Century which
is [inaudible] the very familiar

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.330
[inaudible] the very
familiar concept

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:38.270
that reading could lead one astray

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.040
and very often this is
a gender [inaudible].

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.970 position:56%
That's to say women were more easily
led astray than men [inaudible].

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:49.370
And John Winthrop, the first
governor of Massachusetts,

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:57.710
who kept an extraordinary
diary/journal, tells us the story

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:02.400
of [inaudible] Hopkins
of Connecticut

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:09.350
who he says actually becomes
mentally ill [inaudible] misogynist

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.320
[inaudible] because
she had read too much.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.430 position:56%
So it's a -- there are warning signs
posted everywhere in the history

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.890
of reading for what is good
and what is bad and of course,

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.440
what is reflected in our own school
system and so many other systems

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.120
in which we're a part [inaudible]
trying to parse for us [inaudible]

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:31.020
like the internet debate, you
know, what is good and what is bad

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.450
and trying to police or regulate
or license in some fashion.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:37.570 position:56%
License in the sense of
regulating, not license in the sense

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:40.280
of open-ended [inaudible].

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.980
So that's one quick way
of saying absolutely.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.190 position:56%
It's a charged field and the history
of reading is in part a history

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.580
of [inaudible] a history of efforts
to of course run around or get

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:50.880
around those regulations.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joan Shelley Rubin: I just wanted
to add, on the notion of the power

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.740
of the book is so striking.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:06.940
Certainly throughout the 19th
Century and even today but I think

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:15.250
by the late 19th Century it was
also dangerous for boys as well

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:16.950
as for girls [inaudible] a
child murderer [inaudible]

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:21.470
claims that he was led astray
by reading novels and other --

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.840
claim other boys gave him
specific novel [inaudible].

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.440
But it's fascinating isn't
it [inaudible] of all sorts

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:37.660
and I think some of it
[inaudible] great fear

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.910
about pleasure reading [inaudible]
figure out exactly [inaudible]

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:45.640
to some extent [inaudible]
they should be doing more

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.940
worthwhile things.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:58.400
&gt;&gt; Right. And I [inaudible]
is the physicality of it

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:06.300
and I have not seen that in any

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:21.880 position:56%
of the other [inaudible] I have seen
it [inaudible] that is women readers

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:35.130
who don't feel comfortable socially
and [inaudible] social world

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:59.540
and even sexual world [inaudible]
it's not exactly an escape its

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.690
[inaudible] control [inaudible].

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.140
&gt;&gt; Just one quick addition here.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.160
An American novelist who admired
[inaudible] Henry James of course

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.100
in <i>Portrait of a Lady </i>, it's
a young growing up in Albany

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.620
who reads novels [inaudible] Europe

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.390
and then cannot read
[inaudible] read it correctly

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:29.350
because of the fictional framework
through which she sees things,

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:35.530
so she's violated in some
sense by her reading.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.400
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Other
comments on this topic

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.300
from anyone in the audience?

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.600
Yes, sir?

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.210
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible],
I'm a reader.

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:58.430
The thought just came to me,
asking about [inaudible] we seem

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:04.200 position:56%
to [inaudible] television very
easily, which is another way is kind

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.520
of reading being translated
into visual medium

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.410
and I would appreciate your
comments on that thought.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joan Shelley Rubin: After seeing
the videos last night it's very hard

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:28.200
-- if you saw them last night
[inaudible] visual translation

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:35.260
because they were so wonderful and
they will be shown on television.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:44.400
So, and I guess I certainly share
the dismay that many people feel

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.070 position:56%
when we see kids who are not
reading and we think that, you know,

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:55.790
they're putting their energy
into computer games and TV,

00:57:55.790 --> 00:58:00.840
but I'm cautious enough as
an historian and as somebody

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.440
who knows a little
bit about the concerns

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.190
when radio came along [inaudible].

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:10.910
I'm cautious enough that
I want to say, you know,

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:15.620 position:56%
we can't just [inaudible] just
because we have this powerful medium

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:22.080
and it's having this sweeping
detrimental effect and we know

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.400
that there's some good
consequences [inaudible].

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.920
I'm not sure what your
own views are.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.510
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Joanie,
let me say a word on this

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.120
because in a way I'll give
you the official Center

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.420
for the Book position.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.000
Because Center for the Book
was created 22 years ago

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.580
to stimulate public interest in
books, reading, and libraries

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.850
and it was created by
Daniel Borsten who was

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.810
with us last night at the showing.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:51.000
But the very beginning
Dr. Borsten said,

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.580
"We must use the new
technologies to promote reading."

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.210
And in fact the one that we
should be using is television.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.670
And it's not the enemy it's the way
you entice people into the world

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:05.040
of books and you must make
certain that while we recognize

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.370
that if people are watching
television they're not reading.

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:11.140
Nonetheless, through a project
called "Read More About It"

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.200
that we started 20 years
ago with CBS Television,

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.430
we've used television to introduce
people to the world of books

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.200
and the notion, as Joan has
indicated, is to use all media

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.800
which includes radio, and
television, and now the computer.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:31.850
To open up this world of books and
to look for ways that we can work

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.140
in common rather than being
viewing new technology

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.270
as any kind of an enemy.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:42.360
So we join the enemy right away
with some television projects

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.630 position:56%
and to this day have used technology
in kind of this cautious way.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:52.330
But again, if what you
saw last night in this --

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:57.160
with those wonderful films about
reading and about the experience

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.270
and fact of literature,
again, I would submit

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:06.390
that this is a wonderful
enticement into the world of books.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:10.630
At least that's how we prefer
to view it and always working

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:13.660
to find new opportunities
for partnership kinds

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.270
of programs and promoting reading.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.720
Go ahead, please, Barbara.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.020
&gt;&gt; Barbara Sicherman: I
think it's interesting

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.750
that probably the most influential
figure I've been reading these days

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.870
is a television figure.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:28.290
Oprah's reading, I mean,
when she sells, what,

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:33.410
750,000 copies of each
of those books.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:36.670
So, I mean, that's
pretty interesting.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.970
&gt;&gt; David D. Hall: Yes, sir.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.820
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: I'm Paul
Breslin and I [inaudible].

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.960
My question is for you, Barbara.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.150
I was quite struck on the story of
Ms. Cohen by her learning English

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:58.200
by reading the New Testament,
her father becoming furious.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.330
And it resonates with a great
deal of what I've been reading

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:09.570
in my studies across colonial
literatures [inaudible]

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.430
English [inaudible].

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:17.670
Was there any sense in materials
you examined by her of resentment

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:22.790
or a sense of tension [inaudible]
to Gentiles to the other culture

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:27.280
or just a sense of gratitude and
[inaudible] in learning English?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.310
Just -- I mean Derek Walcott
for instance feels that way

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.360
about the English language,

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.520
that it's not tainted
[inaudible] colonialism [inaudible]

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.610
that there'd been other
kinds of responses.

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:41.400
So I'm interested in
anything you may have --

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.700
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.220
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.550
&gt;&gt; Barbara Sicherman: Well, I think
it was probably difficult for her

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:53.370
but I think she really -- I found
with the Jewish women I've read

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:58.440
that much of the material is in
autobiography, so it's [inaudible].

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.410
That because they were denied
the sort of main literacy

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.910
of their own culture in terms

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:10.360
of not learning Hebrew they
[inaudible] appreciated value

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.660
of literacy.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.530
And so they really welcomed,
they really went more

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.980
than any other group of women
to night schools here and tried

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.280
to learn English so that

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.120
in many [inaudible] early
generation I think took

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.620
to it rather wholeheartedly, at
least the ones that I read who --

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.160
these are writers in English
[inaudible] my own limitation.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.280
So in her case I don't --

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.710 position:56%
it was difficult for her but I don't
see her feeling it was [inaudible].

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:41.450
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: I was going
to ask Jerry Ward first,

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.340
did you have a question
on this Jerry?

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.020
Or -- your hand was up.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.330
And I'll come to you sir.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:52.080
&gt;&gt; Jerry Ward: [Inaudible]
I forgot what it was.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.260
I'm Jerry Ward [inaudible] College.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.880
My question for the panel was
really [inaudible] general one

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:08.200
about how your research informed
you about the history of literacy,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:14.080
which is a very complicated history

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.090
when you [inaudible]
wonderful videos last night.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:22.810
That people are crossing all
kinds of artificial boundaries

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:26.700
that are set up now in terms
of race, gender, class,

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:32.600
in order to access
poetry and embrace it,

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.130
make it part of their lives.

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:36.160
I think this is going
on for a very long time,

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.600
but just what are you discovering

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.110
about how this has informed
American literacy [inaudible]?

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:49.050
&gt;&gt; Do you want to take this?

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:50.650
&gt;&gt; David D. Hall: Appreciate
the question.

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.190
Excellent question.

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:59.400
Very, very often we, we in
this audience and those of us

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.330
who are historians
working out of the present,

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.230
start with the very
limited notion of literacy,

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.650
namely it's the capacity
to read the printed text

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.890
which is the way it's
[inaudible] taught in our schools.

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:15.470
But when we turn back at the past
or stimulated by the past we think

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:23.770
about the present moment we
realize that we absorb text,

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:32.000
we learn text through oral and
performance context all the time.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.210
Hymn-singing would
be a great example.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:37.340
Where I grew up in a
hymn-singing church

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.520
and although I've lost
somewhat of the capacity

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.390
to sing those hymns I'm not going
to break into one right now.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:48.830
Nonetheless, it's a pure
example of where persons,

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:52.120
who might be described in the
Census record in 1800, or 1810,

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:58.370
or 1840 as illiterate, nonetheless
could command the remarkable

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.070
repository, repertoire of text.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:06.730
And there those texts do cross
every line, class, race, gender.

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.310
Camp meeting songs of the south,
camp meetings were attended,

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.370
they were interracial
events, I mean they --

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:15.100
the slaves were free
[inaudible] very often.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.220
[Inaudible] but nonetheless
they were interracial events.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.060
Pure example of this.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:27.330
So we need to work with much more
fluid notion of literacy in order

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:30.260
to recognize how deeply
we are influencing.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.890
People in past times, even
more so than today [inaudible]

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:39.400 position:56%
by the performances in oral aspects
of literacy, the making of literacy.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.890
I think of people who can sing.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:47.270
I once knew someone who claimed
to be able to sing 5000 pop songs.

01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:48.740
I can't sing one.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.520
I can't remember one.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.320
But that's another example of
a kind of astonishing literacy

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.840
that is not part of
the school curriculum

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.180
but nonetheless is an empowerment;

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.320
it's a form of empowerment,
very direct empowerment.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:07.760
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Barbara?

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.060
Go ahead.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.050
&gt;&gt; Barbara Sicherman:
Well, I just done some work

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.230
on post-reconstruction African
Americans going to school

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:20.630
and it's very moving to see
older people, younger people,

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.700
and just be -- and the reversal

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:29.290
in the way children teaching
their parents and I don't know.

01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:33.710
Just -- it's a very different
version and the importance

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:39.730
of that version was very
striking I think [inaudible].

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.360
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Sir, the
gentleman behind Jerry.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.660
Yes.

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:49.490
&gt;&gt; My name is Robert
Garten, I'm a poet.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:53.470
My question perhaps is better
addressed to Ms. Rubin,

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:56.270
if you are able to answer.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.820
My question is on the
delivery of poetry.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.440
You mentioned that that
was extremely important

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:08.420
and my question is the trend
towards dramatic presentation

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.720
or [inaudible] presentation

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.800
versus the more academic
presentation, if you will.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.860
And any comment that you might have
about that, whether it's poetry,

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.720
or fiction, or non-fiction.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.020
I'd be interested to know.

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:25.260
&gt;&gt; Joan Shelley Rubin:
I think that --

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:31.030 position:56%
probably hear more about this in the
next session, which I hope is enough

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.010
to talk about tomorrow [inaudible].

01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:41.750
But I would just say that it varies
tremendously and [inaudible] first

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:50.320
of all just within the school
setting different ways of reading.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.620
One of the practices in the late
19th, early 20th Century was

01:07:54.620 --> 01:08:01.180
to have poetry recitation on
Friday afternoons in small towns

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.930
and parents would sometimes come
to the school and hear these.

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:11.400
And these, I gather, were
rather formal deliveries

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.550
but also disclosed a different
rhythm so to speak for the week

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:20.220
and so there was some [inaudible]

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:25.340
and at the same time I'm
sure people wanted to get

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.680
out of there [inaudible].

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.810
So, and then it's also
an occasion for children

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:35.780
to impress their parents
and in some instances really

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:41.110
to secure their love or
at least their approval.

01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:53.690
And then by the same token we
see this kind of [inaudible] some

01:08:53.690 --> 01:09:02.090
of the students are really
replicating Millay's own behavior

01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:03.390
[inaudible] romantic.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:09.570
Or I've looked at meetings and
church today, which is to say

01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:16.100 position:56%
in non-denominational services,
where the service is not constrained

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:19.690
by fixed liturgy and
poetry [inaudible],

01:09:19.690 --> 01:09:29.620
and there I would say the
practice of a group reciting a poem

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:34.900
in unison lends a kind of weight
and authority to the text,

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:44.050
so much so that [inaudible] really
makes everything sound good.

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:46.000
[Inaudible] confounds the
hierarchy [inaudible].

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:55.940 position:56%
So I think in particular the popular
poet Edgar Guest whose lines were

01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:01.770
written in newspapers [inaudible]
for decades [inaudible] century

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:07.560
and when an Edgar Guest
poem is recited

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:17.460
at a congregation [inaudible]
certainly a modernist [inaudible].

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.050
So I think it varies very much

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:24.280
and again I've [inaudible]
contribution [inaudible]

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.880
this process.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.180
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Other questions?

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.480
Yes, in the back.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.780
I'll come to you next.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.080
&gt;&gt; One of the things

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.280
that [inaudible] Favorite
Poem project has been --

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.390
I think we were all struck
last night at the videos

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:44.370
about the poems were not just
[inaudible] one text after another

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:48.990
but it was like we were
turning over and over

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:53.260
to a single text [inaudible]
memorizing it.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:00.240
And it was mentioned on the panel
today that this kind of return

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.730
to a single text was kind

01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:04.680
of religious model
[inaudible] reading practices.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.970
So I was wondering if the panel
might address this idea of poems

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:14.980
or texts that have a relationship
of returning to the same text.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.280
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Thank you.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:21.060
Question relates to the tendency
to return to the same text again

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.960
and again, and how the panel
members feel about that.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.260
David?

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.230
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.530
Okay.

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:31.410
&gt;&gt; Joan Shelley Rubin: So,
I [inaudible] because one

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:38.190
of the ideas floating around
the history of the book

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.550
for a while was the distinction

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:43.950
between intensive and
extensive reading.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:50.650 position:56%
And I think the notion here was that
when there wasn't a lot of print

01:11:50.650 --> 01:12:00.140
around that people read the same
page over and over and [inaudible]

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.390
and also, the [inaudible] religious
artifacts, which is [inaudible].

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:07.100
And then more recently people
[inaudible] to see [inaudible]

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:15.070
and what you're alluding to
here, what you're talking

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:19.660
about is a really good
example of that.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:28.900
People do read both intensively
and extensively at the same time,

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:34.570
depending on what it is
that they're reading.

01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:38.630
So, and I [inaudible] it's worth
pointing out that the recitation

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:42.300
of poem itself echoes the
memorization of [inaudible] Bible

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:50.040
and reciting Sunday school so
there are these novels [inaudible]

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.630
that precede and coexist

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:59.070
with reciting poetry
in a more secular way.

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.340
&gt;&gt; David D. Hall: I'll
just add one thing.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.640
I think what's interesting to
watch from the point of view

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:11.140
of the historian reading is how
devotional practice linked to text

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:17.440
that might be considered sacred,
such as Psalms or what have you.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.340
That the sacred becomes an
elastic and an expansive category,

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.820
it can be transposed to
other kinds of texts.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.610
So of course to say the 19th
through the 20th Century much

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:30.540
of what many [inaudible]
have been given by Barbara

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.550
and Joan [inaudible] have really
demonstrated how this is a

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:38.520
wonderfully elastic category and
other things take on this quality

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.610
for us not just things that are
strictly speaking religious.

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:47.610
So it's really a kind of --
it may be rooted in religion

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:50.470
but [inaudible] once
rooted in religion but later

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:53.720
on it became something that could
be transposed or appropriated

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.020
by writers who could say

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.860
or by readers working
in very different ways.

I'm a poet and I live
in Stafford, Virginia,

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:22.150
and I'd like to preface my
question with an observation.

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:28.400
Or a -- this past Saint
Patrick's Day,

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:35.160 position:56%
a National Public Radio broadcast, a
little excerpt of Yeats' [inaudible]

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:43.640
and what I was really concerned
about, I was driving in my car

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:49.440
at the time so I couldn't pull
over, but I was really concerned

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.550
because when it was first broadcast
on the radio, the famous line,

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:59.250
"That is no country for old
men," they told Yeats that had

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:02.420
to be changed for the radio.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.270
And I was just devastated
when I heard that.

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:09.480
&gt;&gt; That he did it, right?

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.930
&gt;&gt; He actually changed the first
line so that it would be read

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:18.610
on the radio when it was
first read on the radio.

01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:24.640

We have one slight impediment

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:57.390
and that is I think our poet
laureate has no voice [laughter].

01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:03.040
And I hope he doesn't try to
do too much and strain it.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.280
But one way or another,
he will communicate.

of which I have absolutely
no connection [laughter].

I teach history.

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:04.830
I don't teach poetry.

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:09.920
I don't teach much poetry at
all in what I do for a living.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.500 position:56%
In point of fact, my connection
with poetry is probably a lot closer

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:19.720
to the people that we saw
in the videos last night

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:25.240
than most university types that
you'd think of who would be

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.540
up here talking about poetry.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.370
Poetry was extraordinarily
important in my life.

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:39.200
When I would say roughly
from age 13 to age 17,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.030
when I thought I was going to be
a poet, when I thought I was going

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.220
to be, you know, Robert
Pinsky [laughter].

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:48.370
But in fact, my life's taken a
different turn, a downward spiral

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:52.180
and I teach history
instead [laughter].

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.200
And there was a point
for several decades

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.510
where poetry was not particularly
important in my life at all.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:02.310
And there's become a point
in the past few years

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.140
where poetry has come back.

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:09.020
But poetry is something
that I read by myself,

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.360
that I read unprofessionally,

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.660
that I love

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.490
to read unprofessionally,
but matters a lot to me.

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:18.200
So why am I here?

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:24.090
I'm here because Joan Rubin
corralled me to be here.

01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:28.170
And because I've written on
eloquence and oratory in the 19th

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.840
and early 20th Century before.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.210
And today, I'm going to talk which
something which actually turns

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:41.060
out to be a little bit of
history and a little bit of me.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:45.210
And the history is
probably half right

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:49.590
and the me is probably
uninteresting to most people

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:51.480
but I've got 15 minutes
and you're going

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.840
to be listening to it [laughter].

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:59.090
First, the first -- I'd like
to start out with a few facts.

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:01.790 position:56%
I teach, as I said, I teach history.

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:03.820
I have 30-some colleagues.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.130
I talked to about six colleagues
about coming here to do this.

01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:10.890
I was extraordinarily excited
about coming here and doing this.

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:16.870
And so I was actually flattered
when Joan asked me to do this.

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:20.070 position:56%
And as I said, I was very flattered.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.260
And I thought last
night was spectacular.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:28.260
Last night was just a grand
experience for me personally.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:31.760
However, I talked to about
six people in my department

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.920
that teach history at a
university, PhD's 21st Century.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.900
And not one that I
talked to could figure

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.610
out what the hell I was
doing here [laughter],

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:47.610
could figure out why a historian
would talk about poetry?

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:50.950
And it was clear that none
of them really read poetry

01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:54.010
or thought about poetry themselves.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:57.370
I state that to start
out by just saying

01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:00.190
and reminding people not
everybody reads poems.

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:05.310
Not everybody who's educated, who's
considered educated reads poems,

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:09.000
or likes poems, or
cares about poems.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.180
And some do but many don't.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.790
And in a setting like this,
I suppose it's important

01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:17.090 position:56%
to remember both sides of the story.

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:21.110
Contrast this, I would say,
with the mid-19th Century

01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:23.070
where Walt Whitman
could actually dream

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.810
of a poet chanting a
nation's soul into being,

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:28.730
where the poet could
be conceived of as --

01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.030
I'm sure I'm getting this wrong,

01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.640
the unacknowledged
legislator of mankind.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.940
What's the real [inaudible]?

&gt;&gt; Of the world.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.540
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Cmiel: Of the world,

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.840
the unacknowledged
legislator of the world.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.810
That a president like
Lincoln could greet visitors

on occasion, as he did, with a poem.

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.400
That by the time you went
through the Sixth McGuffey Reader,

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:51.490
you had read some Milton,
Burns, Longfellow, Pope,

01:20:51.490 --> 01:20:54.780
William Cullen Bryant and
Shakespeare, among others.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.340
I don't want to overplay
this and I don't want

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.500
to romanticize the Romantics
but it is a surely --

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.160
assuredly a case that poetry
held a different place

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.190
in the world then than
it does today.

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:09.540
Now what I'm going to do in the
next few minutes is give you

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.700
as a historian, what
I think are a few

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:19.540
of the major pillars
in that history.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.260
And to keep it short,
I'm going to try

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:25.580
to make three basic points
and leave it at that.

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:29.270
Poetry has to jostle with all kinds

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:32.970
of new culture between
1890 and 1940.

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:37.490
And as Joan has pointed out in her
paper, poetry lives on and I want

01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:39.840
to talk about poetry
living on but living

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.780
on in a different cultural space.

01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:46.500
So this is related to new
forms of sound which appear

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.140
in the early 20th Century.

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.510
Point number one.

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.230
Point number two is that
poetry starts to think

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:53.530
about itself differently.

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:56.510
It shifts in purpose
from a more public civic

01:21:56.510 --> 01:22:00.000
to a more personal
form of expression.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.590
It injects a form of expression
that injects wonder, imagination,

01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:08.760
reflection as a counterweight
to mass culture.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.120
It is a quieter voice
in the culture.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.700
And third, I want to
briefly talk about what

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.650
from my personal perspective, leave
aside the history, the dangers

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:21.730
and benefits of this shift.

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:24.590
Point number one; between
1890 and 1940,

01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:30.190 position:56%
sound culture undergoes major shifts
which affect the place of poetry.

01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:34.530
First, the popular
music industry explodes.

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.370
We always had popular music.

01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:38.250
And there's always been music.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.210
But there is just a
dramatic explosion

01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:46.070
in the whole music industry
beginning in the 1890's.

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:48.680
Tin Pan Alley starts in the 1890's.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:51.680
Mechanically reproduced
sound starts in the 1890's.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:55.020
The player piano goes
on the market in 1898.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.970 position:56%
Records which were around for a
while, really take off in the teens.

01:22:58.970 --> 01:23:00.400
The radio is there in the 20's.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.930
The jukebox is there
in the 20's and 30's.

01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:07.840
Poetry is a mix of
cadence and words.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:15.110
Music is a mix of cadence, words
often and melody and harmony.

01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:18.940
There are whole ranges of ways
that these pieces then interact

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:22.470
but music is not the
same exactly as poetry.

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:25.550
And always in music,
words are diminished

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:30.380 position:56%
in at least some small measure by --
because some part of the response,

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.640
some part of the oral
response is devoted

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.790
to the melody, the
harmony, the beat.

01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:40.880 position:56%
Cadence too -- actually while
there's flexibility in both mediums,

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:49.400 position:56%
cadence too has less -- cadence too
has less flexibility in music rhythm

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.200
than in poetry where you can really
dramatically change the reading

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.470
of a poem by just deciding
you're going

01:23:55.470 --> 01:24:01.590
to stop, pause, and make a point.

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:05.110
You can do this at times with music
but especially in ensemble music

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:09.550
and live ensemble music,
the flexibility is less.

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:14.420 position:56%
To the extent that popular music
becomes so important in the culture,

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.610
it pushes poetry and the form

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:19.220
of poetic expression
to a different place.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:24.020
If music is one thing in the
popular music industry is one thing

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.550
that changes, a second
thing that changes

01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:29.600
in those periods is different
attitudes towards words

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:31.120
and performance.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:38.420
One, is the rise in a dramatic
way of the plain style of prose.

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:43.110
Rhetoric falls off the
map between 1880 and 1930.

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:48.420
It was the most important way that
people initially learned some talk

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.570
about poetry in the
mid-19th Century.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:54.210
It was through rhetorics
and rhetoric classes

01:24:54.210 --> 01:24:57.950
in high schools as
well as in college.

01:24:57.950 --> 01:25:01.860
As rhetorics fade, as
formal rhetoric fades,

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.890
what takes its place, literally
takes its place in the late 19th

01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:10.540
to early 20th Century, the rhetoric
class is freshman composition.

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.930
And freshman composition
becomes ruthlessly devoted

01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:20.480
to straightforward, plain, solid,
clear, unaffected English prose.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:23.110
Strunk and White's <i>Elements
of Style </i>rmal, for instance,

01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:25.120
a book more -- I can't think

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.070
of a book more ruthlessly
devoted to the plain style.

01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:34.760 position:56%
It is originally published by Strunk
alone in 1919 as one of the end

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.380
of the first wave of these freshman
composition books which are meant

01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:42.020
to replace older rhetorics.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:47.070
If the plain style becomes one
thing that becomes a new norm,

01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:49.200
the second is conversation

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.200
or conversational style
of public performance.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.980
If rhetoric falls off
the map, oratory,

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.500
formal oratory falls
off the map as well.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.720
Oratory was a sister art to poetry.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.340
It was about words and
rhythm, words and cadence.

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:07.680
By the 1920's, people
like H.L. Mencken

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.710
and Walter Lippmann are
making fun of formal rhetoric.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:14.150
By the 1920's, Dale Carnegie
who's famous <i>How to Win Friends</i>

01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:16.300
<i>and Influence People</i>
which was published

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:18.570
in '30 -- in '36, I believe.

01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:23.540 position:56%
But by the 1920's, he is already
making a fortune teaching people how

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.950
to speak in the new way and he
keeps saying, "Don't be affected.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.250
Don't be formal.

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.660
Don't be rhetorical.

01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:32.210
Be conversational."

01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.570
Even in music,

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:40.260
the new conversational style
appeared with crooning.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:44.090
Males had to project
before the microphone.

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:48.150
Males had to project and
they had to and it led

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:53.430
to a more formal sounding
song style.

01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:57.360
Crooning allowed people to
be relaxed and conversational

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.690
in the 1920's and 30's, someone
like, Rudy Vallee or Bing Crosby.

01:27:03.690 --> 01:27:05.670
And finally, of course, the person

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:08.410
who masters the new
conversational style

01:27:08.410 --> 01:27:12.350
of public communication is Franklin
Delano Roosevelt whose fireside

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:16.870
chats are have nothing to do with
the formal oratory but are meant

01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:19.280
through the radio to
convey the impression

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:26.230
that here is someone conversing
with you in your living room.

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:29.920
Poetry can respond by and
certainly you can think

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.900
of William Carlos Williams
as one example.

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.970
But to the extent that poetry
consists of charged words,

01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:38.490
and where the delight comes

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:41.580
from language centrally
then the conversational

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:46.860
and the plain style also placed
poetry some place outside

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:52.790
where the mainstream of public
communication was heading.

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:56.200
Poetry then becomes, as Joan
talks about, a secret pleasure,

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.980
a guilty pleasure for
people by the 1920's.

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.080
By the late 1920's, Edmund
Wilson is making the point,

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.380
is making this point.

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.340
In his <i>Is Verse A Dying Technique?</i>

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:09.200
Wilson says basically
yes, it's dying.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.160
And in this essay, he
pointed to both music

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.010
and prose as displacing poetry.

01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:18.150
"Don't trust the talk about the
different schools of poetry.

01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:20.160
Don't let that get in
the way," Wilson said.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.560
"The important thing is to
recognize, it seems to me,

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.750
is that the literary technique
of verse which was once meant

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:31.620
to serve many purposes, now
we as a rule, use prose."

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:35.720
Wilson basically thought
that prose was being --

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.170 position:56%
was replacing poetry and he thought,

01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:41.680
"For the prose was
equal to the task."

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.800
Wilson basically had
a tin ear for poetry.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.090
He was not good on poetry and he
was not concerned that he thought

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.600
that verse was a dying technique.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.390
Yet, as we've seen today,
as we've seen from --

01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:59.100 position:56%
as we've seen in the videos
yesterday, as you all know very well

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.420
from your life experience
more than me,

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.960
as my life experience
says, "Wilson was wrong.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.910
Verse wasn't a dying technique."

01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:11.620
And this leads to point number
two, poetry's role shifts.

01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.590
Consider the contrast with oratory.

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:17.390
By 1930, oratory is gone.

01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:18.700
No one's studying it.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.000
No one's thinking about it.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.140
In 1880, both poetry
and oratory were listed

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:25.960
in most conventional
lists of fine arts.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.420
They were fine arts.

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:34.470
By 1930, oratory is a distant
remain, and poetry continues

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:36.690
to be one of the fine arts.

01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:42.370
In 1942, another essay
on poetry was delivered,

01:29:42.370 --> 01:29:46.170
Wallace Stevens' is <i>The Noble
Write and the Sound of Words </i>.

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:49.900
Stevens saw as much as Wilson
the triumph of the real.

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.760
He knew that the modern
poet "cannot be both --

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:56.620
cannot be too noble a writer, that
he cannot rise up loftily in helmet

01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.870
and armor or horse
of imposing bronze."

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.500
Yet he still, unlike Wilson,

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.890
he still thought that
poetry had a place.

01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:09.000
Poetry was the fruitful mediation
between imagination and reality.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.460
And imagination itself gave
nobility to the real for Stevens.

01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.720
It was contemplation.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.970
"It was a way," he
says in this article,

01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:22.940
"to step outside mass culture."

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:26.170
And he says, it was not
social but personal.

01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:30.710
He makes this point several
times and he makes it firmly.

01:30:30.710 --> 01:30:33.420 position:56%
"The poet's role in short," he says,

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.010
"is to help people
to live their lives."

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:39.410
In that same paragraph he says,
"I might be expected to speak

01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:42.550
of the social, that is to say the
sociological or the political,

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:47.300
that those political
obligations of the poet but,"

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:52.140
Stevens says, "He has none."

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:55.460
Stevens' essay, I'd like to
make two quick points about.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:59.470
One is in some way; it's suggesting
recognizing a shifting place

01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:02.430
for poetry in the culture.

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:09.380
That is, poetry is not the
real legislature for humanity,

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:13.210
for mankind, for whatever it
is, for the universe [laughter].

01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:15.780
Like I always forget
-- but poetry is --

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:18.270
&gt;&gt; The unacknowledged
legislators of the world,

01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:19.570
[inaudible] of Shelley's
<i>Defense of Poetry </i>.

01:31:19.570 --> 01:31:20.870
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Cmiel: Yes,

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:23.170
so it's unacknowledged
legislators of the world.

01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:25.410
In some way, he recognizes
that it's not going

01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:27.900
to be the unacknowledged
legislator of the world.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:32.100
And that if it's not having the
sort of dramatic civic force

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:36.300 position:56%
that Shelley imagined, that it still
had a strong place in the culture.

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.610
So that's point number one.

01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:40.750
And point number two is
that this role was personal.

01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:43.120
That poetry becomes
a form of wonder,

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.160
reflection on ourselves
and condition.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.990
It is a moment of quiet
in a loud mass culture.

01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:54.910
And this, as I watched the
spectacular videos last night

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:58.850
which actually confirmed my own
thoroughly unprofessional contact

01:31:58.850 --> 01:32:01.240
with poetry in the past few years,

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.030
is what I saw most of
the reciters doing.

01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:08.080
Whether it is people reflecting
and thinking about suicides

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.440
in South Boston, about being
a gay African-American male

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.330
in Atlanta, I believe.

01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:18.580
Whether it was having a
daughter dying of cancer

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.980
or whether it was simply
a meditation on a slug,

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:24.800
these were people who were
talking about reflecting

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.100
about their condition,
who were trying

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.200
to bring some expression
to the wonders of life.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.940 position:56%
These were people where words worked
like a clearing in the forest,

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.680
where light can peer
down allowing us

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.910
to see what might have always
been there but hidden from us.

01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:43.760
This was poetry as a
sort of uncovering.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:47.160
This is a personal
quieter form of poetry,

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.370
a sort of wonder and reflection.

01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:52.320
If you think about it this way
then Emily Dickinson becomes the

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.310
paradigmatic first modern poet.

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:59.630
Now, if this is where we said
what Stevens in the 1940's,

01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:03.470 position:56%
I want to briefly talk about --
mention for one second, the benefits

01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:06.180
and dangers and the
benefits are this is a moment

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.340
of quiet in a loud culture.

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.090
And I like loud cultures.

01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:12.530
I think loud cultures are fun.

01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:15.850
As one of my favorite poets
and great moralist of our time,

01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:21.190
the Cat in the Hat says, "These
things are fun and fun is good."

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:22.490
I like the internet.

01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:23.790
I like music.

01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:25.090
I like it all.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:26.390
I like my kids when they like it.

01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:29.970
But at the same time, I must
say, that I come back to poetry

01:33:29.970 --> 01:33:35.770
because it is a moment of quiet
for me in a rather loud culture.

01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.910
But the danger is that it can
become -- it's the same thing,

01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:41.910
the quietness, that it could
become too quiet, too personal.

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:46.360 position:56%
I do not like Archibald MacLeish's
lines that a poem should be palpable

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.970
and mute as a globed fruit.

01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:53.020
I have mixed feeling about
Stevens' <i>Of Modern Poetry </i>which

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.000 position:56%
in some ways is a wonderful
introduction to 20th Century poetry.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.070
But when Stevens speaks of "the
poem of the act of the mind,"

01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:05.380
or of words speaking "in the
delicatest ear of the mind,"

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:09.210 position:56%
or if he speaks -- when he speaks
of the invisible audience listening,

01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:12.360
it seems too self-contained
and a little bit too quiet.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.080
Poetry is sound, as Stevens knew

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.890
but did not always adequately
express, to my opinion.

01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:20.560
Too quiet, too personal.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.760 position:56%
If you look at the last 10 to 15
years and if you think of two things

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.620
that -- I strike me as important
in the public culture of poetry,

01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:36.500
one being the poetry slam movement
and the second being this sort

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:43.430
of affair and the work that
Robert Pinsky has done.

01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:45.460 position:56%
Both of those things, it strikes me,

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.510
are trying to say we can't
let poetry be too private.

01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:52.070 position:56%
We can't let poetry be too personal.

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:54.610
It has to be a blend.

01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:57.640
Stevens was close but he
didn't entirely get it right.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.720
You have to have a mix, lest it
become too private, too personal.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.530
Lest it become too many people

01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:07.570
like my six colleagues
who've never read a poem.

01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:09.370
Thanks.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:17.890
[ Applause ]

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:20.260
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: We move on
now to Paul Breslin but I just

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.570
like to take a moment to --

01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:31.040
this is from <i>The Idea of Order
at Key West </i>, the opening stanza.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.020
"She sang beyond the
genius of the sea.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:38.170
The water never formed
to mind or voice.

01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:42.840
Like a body wholly body,
fluttering its empty sleeves and

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.840
yet its mimic motion
made constant cry.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:52.510
Caused constantly a cry that was
not ours although we understood.

01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:55.930
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean."

01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:59.590
Stevens knew public as well.

01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:01.740
Okay, Paul's on.

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.940
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: I
was encouraged not

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.770
to write a formal talk so I didn't.

01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:16.590 position:56%
What I'm going to give you is first
of all, a kind of quick jumping tour

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:22.710
of a longer essay that I've written
called "The Sign of Democracy

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.360
and the Terms of Poetry."

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:28.720
That's going to include the
sections I'm going to deal

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.760
with include an analysis of a
poem that appeared in Dear Abby

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.090
and my experiences as
a participant observer

01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:39.060
at the Uptown Poetry
Slam in Chicago.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.940
Then I want to talk a little
bit about the perspectives

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:47.840
on these things that I've gained by
working for the last several years

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.750
on a book about Derek
Wolcott and spending time

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:53.960
with West Indian literature
and culture.

01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:00.320 position:56%
And on the extraordinary perspective
provided by what we saw last night,

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.680
the various people
presenting their favorite poems

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.540
from the Favorite Poem Project.

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:13.490
And I think what I have
to say segues very nicely

01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.690
from what Ken was saying.

01:37:15.690 --> 01:37:22.230 position:56%
It's sort of about the distinction
between poetry as public performance

01:37:22.230 --> 01:37:29.720
and poetry, I think, it was Joan in
the first panel who quoted someone

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.190
who read a letter to Carl Sandberg
saying, "You've spoken to me

01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:34.810
in the loneliness of my heart."

01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:38.890
That sense of poetry is something
that happens quietly apart

01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:41.370
from collectivity, and poetry

01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:46.550
that also is a public performance
and speaks to everybody.

01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:51.120
One of the classic sources on
this is T.S. Elliot's Essay

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.250
of the Three Voices of Poetry in
which he distinguishes three --

01:37:55.250 --> 01:38:00.170
the poem that is addressed to the
whole community or collective,

01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:04.490
something like Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>
Homer's <i>Iliad </i>telling a story

01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:07.470
that everyone listening
knows that defines

01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:11.230
in some way the collective
identity of the group.

01:38:11.230 --> 01:38:15.740
The second is poems addressed to
a smaller, more intimate audience,

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:19.280
perhaps one person or a
few particular people.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:26.160 position:56%
And then the third kind seems to be
the voice of inner thought overheard

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.800
as if the poet is aware
of speaking to no one.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.820
These things will be on
my mind as I proceed.

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:42.760
Well, to take up the essay, I got
the title, <i>The Sign of Democracy</i>

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.460
<i>in the Terms of Poetry </i>rmal
from two lines in Whitman's <i>Song</i>

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.630
<i>of Myself </i>which keeps
coming up at this --

01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:51.770
at these meetings as a kind

01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:57.500
of central founding
text in American poetry.

01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.350
Whitman writes, "I speak
the password primeval.

01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:02.450
I give the sign of democracy.

01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:04.250
By God, I will accept nothing

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:08.160
which all cannot have their
counterpart of in the same terms."

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.730
These words appear in the
1855 edition and remain apart

01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:17.210
from minor changes unaltered in the
deathbed edition of 1891 to '92.

01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:19.220
They are core Whitman.

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:24.530 position:56%
So I ask, "Can an American concerned
with poetry read them unmoved?

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:28.440
Can an American with any
brains read them uncritically?

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.060
What if some things worth
having cannot be had

01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.430
on the same terms by all people?"

01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:37.750
Whitman seems worried
enough by that possibility

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:42.690
to include the translation
term counterpart of.

01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:45.360
But what in poetry is an
acceptable counterpart

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.440
and where does counterpart
end and impoverishment begin?

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.890
Can poetry adapt its terms to the
demands of all and remain poetry?

01:39:56.890 --> 01:40:01.190
And who defines the
terms of poetry anyway?

01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:03.210
Are the verse homilies
printed occasionally

01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:06.320 position:56%
in Ann Landers and Dear Abby poetry?

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:13.450
And I guess my first example
was to try to deal with that.

01:40:13.450 --> 01:40:16.270
So I have a little section
in this essay called "Poetry

01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:18.860
and Self-Flattery" which
sort of is my attempt

01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:21.550
to understand what I'm looking for

01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:25.400
and what I'm not looking
for in a poem.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.480
So I tried the experiment of trying
to put down my preconceptions

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.820
which I imagine are shared by
most people in the room and try

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:36.160
to think what it would mean to
become the ideal reader of one

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.600
of those poems in Ann
Landers or Dear Abby.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.290
So you know, I point out that the
poem I chose which is from a couple

01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:49.690
of years ago maybe kind of
like shooting fish in a barrel

01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:51.290
for an audience like this.

01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:54.940
But the point of the exercise is
to be as articulate as possible

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:58.550
about why I can't take these poems
seriously and to try to think

01:40:58.550 --> 01:41:02.330
about what it would mean
to be able to do so.

01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:08.420 position:56%
So here's the poem complete with the
prose that framed it in Ann Landers.

01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:11.520
Dear Ann Landers, I found this
verse in a column of yours

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.470
in my father's desk drawer.

01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:16.250
It was in a datebook from 1974.

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:18.650
It's just good today
as it was 23 years ago.

01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:20.250
I can't argue with that [laughter].

01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:23.410
Please rerun it, Dixie.

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.260
Dear Dixie, I agree.

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:26.560
Thank you for asking.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.860
Here it is.

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.820
And the poem is called "Forget
It" by Judd Mortimer Lewis.

01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.260
"If you see a tall
fellow ahead of the crowd,

01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:37.920
a leader of men marching
fearless and proud and you know

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.250
of a tale whose mere telling
aloud would cause his proud head

01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:43.230
in anguish be bowed.

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.990
It's a pretty good
plan to forget it.

01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:49.940
If you know of a skeleton hidden
away in a closet, and guarded,

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:51.770
and kept from the day in the dark

01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:55.700
and whose showing whose sudden
display would cause grief,

01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:58.590
and sorrow, and pain, and dismay,

01:41:58.590 --> 01:42:01.570
it's a pretty good
plan to forget it.

01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:04.950
If you know of a tale that will
darken the joy of a man or a woman,

01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:07.810
a girl or a boy, that
will wipe out a smile

01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:13.170
or the least bit annoy a fellow,
or cause any gladness to cloy,

01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.560
it's a pretty good
plan to forget it."

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.930
So you know, if you're set upon
someone says this is good today

01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:23.360
as it was 23 years ago,
valued by father and daughter

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.760
across generational lines, it
passes Samuel Johnson's test

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.170
of pleasing many or three
at least, and pleasing long.

01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:33.700
So what does it please by?

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.140 position:56%
Well, it has this kind of
insistent anapestic tetrameter meter

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.640
and it's got a trimeter line
that functions as a refrain.

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.940
It sounds singable.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:48.970 position:56%
It's instantly recognizable as
verse, not prose chopped into lines.

01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:51.050
Each stanza has four
consecutive rhymes

01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:54.460
and the refrain provides relief
not only by varying the meter

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:58.090
but by breaking the pattern of
rhyme at predictable intervals.

01:42:58.090 --> 01:43:02.420
The refrain functions as a punch
line, reversing the temptations

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.600
to indiscretion in the
previous four lines.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.930 position:56%
Well, no poet I know would be caught
dead owning up to a poem like that.

01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.040
But if you think back
to the 19th Century

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.610
when famous poets had three names
like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,

01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:21.970
John Greenleaf Whittier,
or Judd Mortimer Lewis,

01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:25.650
the author of this one -- highbrow
poems might still have much

01:43:25.650 --> 01:43:27.610
in common with this piece.

01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:31.850 position:56%
Of course, they'd be more gracefully
written, with fewer redundancies

01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:34.340
and clumsy enchantments
but they would rhyme

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.750
and lilt and point a moral.

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:39.660
I mean, if you know the once
beloved recitation piece,

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:43.880 position:56%
<i>The Village Blacksmith </i>by
Longfellow, it's got closing stanzas

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.210 position:56%
in praise of Ernest Humble industry.

01:43:47.210 --> 01:43:49.710
And yet this poem is written
by the first Harvard professor

01:43:49.710 --> 01:43:53.270
of modern languages and
able translator of Dante,

01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:56.610
an up-to-date literary
intellectual of his time.

01:43:56.610 --> 01:44:02.090 position:56%
So as has already been remarked this
morning, the conventions of popular

01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:05.990
and what I'll call professional
or "highbrow verse" have sort

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:07.300
of drifted apart in the years

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:10.870
between Professor Longfellow
and Mr. Lewis.

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:15.070 position:56%
And then I start thinking about
what you would have to not care much

01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:20.880
about in order to like that poem.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.030
There's no progression because
each case is parallel to the last.

01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:29.430
And it's full of appositive
rephrasings of the same idea

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:33.290
and little paratactic add-ons.

01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:36.330
So in order to like "Forget
It", you have to want a poem

01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:40.280
that develops a helpful maxim in
a clear unmistakable way rather

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.330
than a poem that questions
its own statements

01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:43.630
or leaves them to implication.

01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:47.770
You can't value economy
of means too highly

01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:51.290 position:56%
or you'll find yourself asking why
and then I have a bunch of questions

01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:53.430
about why all these
things have to be in there.

01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:56.460
But the moral shallowness
of "Forget It" --

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:59.480
and here's where I'm getting
to my point about the poetry

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.090
of self-flattery, the
moral shallowness

01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:04.600
of "Forget It" bothers me even more

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.910
than its prefab diction
and lazy versification.

01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:12.300
To show what I mean, I tack on the
stanzas still doggerel, of course,

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.650
that would have made a difference.

01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:18.690
But suppose the young fellow whose
head is so proud writes by night

01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:22.170
with the clan though he's
never avowed the connection

01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:23.750
and afterwards going home,

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:26.980
plowed starts beating his
children until they are cowed.

01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:30.930
Speak up or you'll live
to regret it [laughter].

01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:35.410 position:56%
Or to spell it out, tact is a virtue
but it's not the highest virtue

01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:38.480
and there are times when other
responsibilities outweighs

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.630
its claims.

01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:43.350
So I guess what bothers me most

01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:46.980
about that poem is it
thinks it knows we are.

01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.580
It thinks it knows what
we think and what we ought

01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.110 position:56%
to think before we begin reading it.

01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:55.380
And what it can offer us is a kind
of pat on the back and tell us

01:45:55.380 --> 01:46:00.510
to keep on being whoever we were
before we started reading it.

01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:03.280
And then I go on and say, it would
be nice to think that when you pick

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.310 position:56%
up a reputable literary journal that
all of this thing is far behind you

01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:11.450
and we enter a different
order of discourse.

01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:15.240 position:56%
But apart from the undeniably much
higher level of pure literary skills

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:20.860
that one encounters there, I
found that there are poems in --

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:23.730
oh, I won't mention
names, but I, you know,

01:46:23.730 --> 01:46:27.470
say magazines that I've published
in and had been proud to be publish

01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:31.650
in that nonetheless strike me
as having something in common

01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:33.670
with the poem that I just read you.

01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:38.730 position:56%
There is one -- you know, I won't --
it could have been any of a number

01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:40.120
but there's a poem by
Robin Becker called

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.340
<i>"Why We Fear the Amish" </i>that
was in American Poetry Review

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:50.560
and it has lines like, "Because
they smell us in fellowship

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.840
with the dead works of darkness and
technology" and at the end it says,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.300
"We know their frugality
in our corpulence.

01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:00.680
We know their sacrifice
for the group

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.070
and our love for the individual.

01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:08.540
Our gods are cross dressers,
nerds, beach bums and poets.

01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:10.060
They know it.

01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:15.230
By their pure talk and practice
do they eye us from their carts?"

01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:18.370
Well you know, it's
pretty good in a way

01:47:18.370 --> 01:47:21.850
but that self-indicting placement
of poets at the end of the list

01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:25.200
of our gods is kind of
a giveaway of something

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.650
that bothers me a little bit on.

01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:34.520 position:56%
I think that it sort of identifies
its ideal reader as a poetry person,

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.280
someone who might be
contributing to this journal

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.400
or at least the regular
reader of it.

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.280
And that's the "we" and
that "we" is supposed

01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.290
to have certain attitudes
known in advance.

01:47:46.290 --> 01:47:52.340 position:56%
And that, I guess, is what
troubles me about that kind of poem.

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:59.130 position:56%
Well, I'm skipping over a good deal.

01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:02.500
I think I will go to the second
part of what I have to say which is

01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:05.440
to give you a report on my trip

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:09.760
to the Uptown Poetry Slam
equipped with a questionnaire.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.830
I returned -- I got 61 of them
back from people in the bar.

01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:18.280 position:56%
And I hadn't planned to
participate in the slam when I went,

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.090
but it was a slow night and to
avoid things being too boring,

01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:27.430
I decided to enter at the last
minute and ended up winning

01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:29.780
by a tenth of a point which
is a very dubious honor

01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.530
since there were only
three of us [laughter].

01:48:31.530 --> 01:48:35.790
I recall from my youthful
obsession with baseball

01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:38.080
that the lowest league-leading
batting average

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.070
in major league history was 306

01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:45.450
so I think this was
sort of like that year.

01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:53.370
So on -- all right, the
night of the slams on.

01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:56.360
Attempting to gather less
impressionistic evidence

01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.080
about audience for poetry than
appears to exist at present

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.160
and this was written a year ago.

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.080
Got some very interesting evidence
last night, which I'll come

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.550
to in a couple of minutes.

01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:10.400
But I decided to write
this questionnaire

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.450
and pass it out at the slam.

01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:17.730
So I -- when only one person had
signed up for the slam that night,

01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:20.690
Mark Smith, the host
proposed that that person read

01:49:20.690 --> 01:49:23.760
against himself [laughter].

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.560
And for various reasons, I had
my poetry manuscript as well

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.970
as the questionnaires with me.

01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:31.500 position:56%
I was polishing it up at that point.

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:35.440
So I volunteered and
somebody else volunteered.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.040
And so three judges were appointed
at random from the audience.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.530
Some of you may know the drill at
poetry slams but I assume that --

01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:46.170
how many of you have been to one?

01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:50.810
Maybe 25 to 30% of the
people in the room.

01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:53.780
Well, they got three judges
at random from the audience

01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:55.280
who were asked to introduce
themselves.

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.420
One was a teacher.

01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:01.960
One worked for Dow Chemical and
took no end of crap for that.

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:09.090
I mean [laughter] and then there
was one who was sort of in the arts

01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:11.990
but not in the literary arts.

01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:17.990
And Smith's role as emcee seems to
be kind of heckling participants.

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:22.240
So each judge was asked to
hold up a score from zero to 10

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.650
after each poem so it's
like Olympic skating

01:50:24.650 --> 01:50:28.300
or diving events in this respect.

01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.780
The three scores were then
averaged and the contestant

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.080
with the lowest score was dropped.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.910
The two survivors read another poem

01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:38.150
and whoever got the higher
composite score would win.

01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:41.390
Smith sort of shall we say
Mirandized the audience.

01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:44.890
He read it its rights
and prerogatives.

01:50:44.890 --> 01:50:47.230
So if listeners thought
a poem was dragging,

01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:52.610
they could come like
this [laughter].

01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:56.260
If it rhymed too predictably,
they were invited to shout

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.290
out the rhyme word along
with the poet [laughter].

01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:07.010 position:56%
And any content judged to be sexist
was fair game for the feminist hiss.

01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:11.830 position:56%
So there were two other contestants,
one of whom was a young woman

01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:15.210
who had signed up at
that very last second.

01:51:15.210 --> 01:51:17.510
And she didn't seem used
to reading in public.

01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:24.230
She was nervous and her
delivery of her poem, I think,

01:51:24.230 --> 01:51:27.500
was what caused her to
lose in the first round.

01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:32.180
The guy who gave me a
run for my money was --

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:37.230 position:56%
had participated in a slam scene for
people under 25 in North Carolina

01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:40.380
and was an experienced veteran.

01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:43.730 position:56%
His first poem was a diatribe
against his poetry teacher delivered

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:47.090
from memory with much
dramatic flair.

01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:50.100
The student, it seems, had
wanted to write an erotic poem

01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.460
about women's legs but
and I quote from memory,

01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:59.270
"My PC teacher said you are
objectifying women and I said,

01:51:59.270 --> 01:52:02.460
you are objectifying poetry."

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.670
The instructor wanted analysis
of poetry but the student thought

01:52:05.670 --> 01:52:09.520
or felt that poetry
was all about emotion.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.720
Toward the end of the poem,
the poet faced the audience

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.210
and shouted, "Feel, feel, feel!

01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:16.760
Legs, legs, legs!"

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.060
[ Laughter ]

01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.590
There was no feminist hiss

01:52:19.590 --> 01:52:23.010
and the poem got the warmest
audience response of the evening

01:52:23.010 --> 01:52:25.060
and as I recall, the highest score.

01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:30.100
I came in second and survived
through the next round.

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:34.290
Mark Smith gave me almost as
much flak about being a professor

01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:38.280
as the chemist judge got
about his job with Dow.

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:42.600 position:56%
As my young opponent finished, I sat
in the front row waiting my turn,

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.020
and I closed my eyes to
concentrate, Smith said,

01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:47.700
"The professor's nervous now.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.200
He's doing his yoga.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.770
He's been reading too
much Gary Snyder."

01:52:51.770 --> 01:52:53.070
[ Laughter ]

01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:57.500 position:56%
Determined to take up in good humor,
I replied, "You could do worse!"

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:00.270
And then it was time to read

01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:04.740
and I chose a political poem
called <i>The Scale </i>published

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:07.710
in TriQuarterly some years back.

01:53:07.710 --> 01:53:09.440
And I think -- shall
I read it to you?

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:11.990
Yeah, why not [laughter]?

01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:15.130
This is my 15 minutes of fame.

01:53:15.130 --> 01:53:19.920
The Scale -- and I
read it about this way.

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:25.250
It wasn't this kind of
highly choreographed reading.

01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:27.540
The man doing life with no chance

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:30.810
of parole watching
the walls grow visible

01:53:30.810 --> 01:53:35.490
in the first light thinks how
all over the city men wake

01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:39.850
up beside women, even the
losers get lucky sometimes

01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:42.670
but nobody gets lucky here.

01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:44.830
Where they put you to make
sure you have no pleasure

01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:47.120
and miss it constantly.

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.230
The guilt that had seemed
almost nothing inside him,

01:53:50.230 --> 01:53:52.390
they had made solid.

01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:56.910
So they could not look away from it
to take some comfort from the sky

01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:59.910
without seeing bars also.

01:53:59.910 --> 01:54:03.030
It could have been worse.

01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:06.630 position:56%
One hears that in certain countries,
political prisoners are locked

01:54:06.630 --> 01:54:12.910 position:56%
in boxes too short to lie down in,
carried down to a cellar and stacked

01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:17.060
like so many warehouse
crates in one dense tenement

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:22.030
of tormented flesh soaked
in its own excrement.

01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:26.600
For someone somewhere,
this is actual.

01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.280
One of those boxes is where he
is and has to continue being.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.950
If he dreamed of a prison
cell with a bed and a toilet,

01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:41.200
he would weep bitterly to wake in
his box and find it all a dream.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.360
This is the stone on the
far pan of the scale.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.130
Load what you will on the other.

01:54:48.130 --> 01:54:51.170
It scarcely trembles.

01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:54.510
So that was -- it got
me to the second round.

01:54:54.510 --> 01:55:02.250
[ Applause ]

01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:09.360
Anyway, on -- fortunately for me,
the leg man's second poem wasn't

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:16.300
as hot as his first and so my
quiet second poem beat him by --

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.640
you know, my composite score came
out fractionally higher than his,

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:26.600 position:56%
and I found myself the winner of $13
and a board game called Poetry Slam.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.510
Which Mark Smith said
had it all wrong

01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:31.510
and every previous winner had
returned it after receiving it.

01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:34.890
[ Laughter ]

01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:38.580
So the questionnaires
were modestly revealing.

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.160
I'm acutely aware having
been in conversation

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.710
with sociologists friends
that my sample is minuscule.

01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:47.170 position:56%
My methods probably need refinement.

01:55:47.170 --> 01:55:49.240
But at least my questionnaire
was symmetrical

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:50.660 position:56%
which is apparently good [laughter].

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:55.550
And this is what I got.

01:55:55.550 --> 01:56:00.480
It was a young crowd, 44%
gave their age as 20 to 29.

01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.730
But there were more people over
30 than under, 26% in their 30's,

01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:08.440
11% in their 40's,
and 11% in their 50's.

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.260
One of my 61 respondents
admitted to being 60 and over.

01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:17.830
Fifty-nine percent of
them had attended slams

01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:21.030 position:56%
and poetry readings before this one.

01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:25.570
Another 20% had attended
poetry readings but not slams.

01:56:25.570 --> 01:56:28.960
The remaining 21%, so that's
over a fifth, had never been

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.750
to a poetry reading
of any kind before.

01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:37.490
It was a more diverse
audience than --

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.550
well, I compared it to
one that Robert gave

01:56:39.550 --> 01:56:42.310
at Borders a few years ago on.

01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:44.720
But it was still predominantly
white although a number

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:47.560
of the respondents declined
to give race or ethnicity

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.980
or they ridiculed the question.

01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:54.580
So for race, they wrote triathlon
[laughter] or this was my favorite,

01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:55.990
none of your damn bigness
[laughter].

01:56:55.990 --> 01:57:01.060
So it kind of spoiled my
statistical results but if I go

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:04.300
by what they said, 8%
checked African-American,

01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.490
3% identified themselves
as Hispanic.

01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:10.810
Most interesting was the
spread of occupations.

01:57:10.810 --> 01:57:14.110
Five percent said they worked
as clerks or wait staff

01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:18.720
and these were usually the ones
who were 21 or 22 years old,

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.880
still looking to see
what they wanted to do.

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.980
Twenty-three percent
worked in business or sales.

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:29.240 position:56%
Sixteen percent were in
professions such as law or medicine.

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.300
And 10% were engineers
or technicians.

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:38.270
Only 8% identified themselves
as teachers and 11% as students.

01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:41.400
Another 11% indicated that
they had careers in the arts

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.990
but only 3% claimed to be writers.

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:46.360
So the prevailing notion
that only poets

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.100
and their force-fed students attend

01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:51.160
to poetry does not
hold for this audience.

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.710
That was the most encouraging
thing that I found.

01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:57.860 position:56%
Now, just a couple of quick remarks.

01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:02.730
I've been engaged in for
almost a decade in a book

01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:05.350
that I just finished about
Derek Walcott when I started,

01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:08.670
I knew nothing about the
Caribbean where he comes from.

01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:11.200
So I had to learn a lot.

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.130
And that culture gives you a
kind of basis for comparison

01:58:14.130 --> 01:58:18.060
because there is a tradition
of verbal play and performance

01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:22.710
that is not necessarily
confined to educated people.

01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:28.480
And there are extravagant uses of
speech in things like the rants

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.860
of the Midnight Robber
and Trinidad Carnival.

01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:36.870
Or you know, when I look
at the poetry slams,

01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:41.600 position:56%
I think of another Trinidad
Carnival convention, the Calypso War

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:45.000
where the leading Calypsonians
improvise verses sometimes

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.750
satirizing each other and whoever
makes the wittiest responses

01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:51.920
and gets the most applause
wins the Calypso War.

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.830
So it has this competitive
edge as well.

01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:59.860
Walcott has said, "I come from a
society that likes big gestures."

01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:06.800
And I think we come from a
society where ever since the turn

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:09.020
of the 20th Century
when the conventions

01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:13.520
of Victorian poetry were getting
kind of flyblown, we've been kind

01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:17.290
of walking backwards
away from big gestures.

01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:21.660
Ken's remark about the decline
of rhetoric and the replacement

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:25.700 position:56%
of rhetoric classes with composition
classes that emphasize clarity

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:31.210
and plainness rather than flourish,
I think is quite indicative.

01:59:31.210 --> 01:59:36.860
I think World War I really
did a lot to kill rhetoric.

01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:41.140
You know, people came back
from the war like Wilfred --

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.200
well, Wilfred Owen didn't
come back from the war.

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:47.320
But people who saw it would
look at the kinds of rah,

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:52.640
rah war poems comparing it to
soccer or rugby written by people

01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:56.060
like Sir Henry Newbolt and
say, "What the hell is this?"

01:59:56.060 --> 02:00:00.060
and look for some way to register
the shock of that experience.

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:06.990
We've had since then, you know, I
think another event that was bad

02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:11.350
for the faith of rhetoric was the
Vietnam War because of the kinds

02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:16.830
of very calculate uses of
language to manipulate the public

02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:19.140
that were used at that time.

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:24.480
So you know, it's interesting
to me to see a society

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:28.670
that somehow has come from a
different history where all

02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:31.550
of these inhibitions
against rhetoric and flourish

02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:34.860 position:56%
and bravado are not so much in place

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:37.460
and it produces a different
kind of art.

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:41.300
In closing, just a couple of
reflections about the slams

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.840
in relation to what
I saw last night.

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.490
What I liked about the slams
was the kind of possibility

02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:51.500
of openness and spontaneity.

02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:54.990 position:56%
Although in fact, many things are
heavily choreographed and rehearsed,

02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:58.840
you don't see too much of that
but potentially, it can be that.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:06.260
And the idea of coming not to some
kind of sanctimonious location

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:10.500 position:56%
but to a bar, you know, it could be
a little bit more like an Irish pub,

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:13.530
it would be better yet but
it's, you know, it's a bar.

02:01:13.530 --> 02:01:14.860
You're sitting in there in a bar.

02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:19.040
People are reading poetry and
if you like it, you can show it

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:20.890
and if you don't like
it, you can show it.

02:01:20.890 --> 02:01:22.910
And that's nice.

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:25.720
What I don't like, two things.

02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.630
The competitive aspect,
you know the aspect

02:01:28.630 --> 02:01:31.800
of it that's a little
too much like wrestling

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:36.410
or professional sports
of other sorts.

02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:40.190
Blake said, "Among true poets,
there is no competition."

02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:43.650
And the speed of judgment,
that is on --

02:01:43.650 --> 02:01:48.270
here's a poem, what do you think?

02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:49.940
Clap, don't clap.

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.220
If you're bored, go like this.

02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:57.110 position:56%
You know, it doesn't -- it says in
essence and this is the relationship

02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:59.890
to the poetry of self-flattery,

02:01:59.890 --> 02:02:03.100
I am the all competent
judge of this poem.

02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:04.540
I already know who I am.

02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.590
I already know what I want.

02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:10.040
This poem has nothing to tell
me that I don't already know.

02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:11.340
That I don't like.

02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:16.540
And it struck me in the
extraordinarily powerful videos

02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:17.840
of people from all walks

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:21.330
of life presenting their
favorite poems last night,

02:02:21.330 --> 02:02:22.820
that they don't think like that.

02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:25.520
The construction worker who
loved <i>Song of Myself </i>said,

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:27.820
"When I first read this, it
didn't make any sense to me.

02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:31.520
I couldn't follow it but
something caught my attention."

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.660
And Whitman himself when he says,
"Failing to fetch me one place,

02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.530
you'll find me in another,
you know, keep encouraged."

02:02:38.530 --> 02:02:41.330
He says, "That seemed to be
directing me how to be patient

02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:43.800
with the poem, how to get it."

02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:47.890
The Jamaican immigrant
who loved <i>Nick</i>

02:02:47.890 --> 02:02:50.660
<i>and the Candlestick</i>
by Sylvia Platt says,

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:53.200
"I love this because it doesn't
follow any rational process.

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.340
It doesn't make any
sense but it's powerful.

02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:56.820
It's raw. It's bitter.

02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:59.810
It doesn't seem to me a
false use of language."

02:02:59.810 --> 02:03:04.860
Over and over again, they talk
about being looked by something

02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:07.670
that was opaque to
them for a long time

02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:09.680
until they've lived
with it for a while.

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:12.540
And that's what I think we're in
danger of being too impatient with.

02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:19.240
The poetry slam has too much in
common, I fear, with the rock video

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.280
and with other sort of
short attention span forms.

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.400
That's one problem with it.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:30.680
The other thing I noticed
last night was

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:33.830
that there isn't the
ferociously anti-intellectual

02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:37.110
and anti-academic bias in most
of the respondents we heard

02:03:37.110 --> 02:03:41.310
from last night that seems to
be a kind of stock attitude

02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:42.610
which you must affect whether

02:03:42.610 --> 02:03:46.150
or not you actually
believe it or not at a slam.

02:03:46.150 --> 02:03:49.290
In other words, the
professor isn't the enemy.

02:03:49.290 --> 02:03:51.360
A lot of these people
said, "I first ran

02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.830
into this poem when
I went to school."

02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:59.110
I have the impression that
people come to poetry later

02:03:59.110 --> 02:04:04.250
than they did instead of being
read it by their parent's maybe

02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:06.800
or being made to memorize
it and recite it

02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:09.160
in grade school or in church.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.450
It's kind of terra incognito
until they get into college.

02:04:12.450 --> 02:04:15.730
And college is a kind of
door into this other thing.

02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:19.290
And some of these respondents
seemed very grateful for that.

02:04:19.290 --> 02:04:23.170
So while I don't want to
whitewash the literary academy

02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:27.040
and I'm well aware of its follies
and failings and my own sins

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:32.250
in that regard, I think
it's refreshing to see

02:04:32.250 --> 02:04:37.440
that people don't necessarily have
this kind of stereotypical academic

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:41.020
versus free spirit
notion of what poetry is.

02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:45.450
And I think the universities and
colleges are one of the places

02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:48.700
where poetry survives, where
people learn when they're young

02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:51.510
that they still want it for
the rest of their lives.

02:04:51.510 --> 02:05:04.360
[ Applause ]

02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.860
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Thank you.

02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:11.890
A plug that is also, I think,
germane, on the 26th of April,

02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:19.860
we will have here a reading from
the New American Library two-volume

02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:26.820
collection on the -- essentially on
the first half of the 20th Century.

02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:31.180 position:56%
Some of you probably saw the review
by Bill Pritchard in Sunday's Times.

02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.970
One of the things that he remarks
on and that others have remarked

02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:40.600
on is the amazing breadths,
two volumes of --

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:43.990
to be in that anthology,
you have to be dead.

02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:50.090
So it only [laughter] -- it only
goes up to around the 1960's.

02:05:50.090 --> 02:05:53.540
But it includes popular
songs, ballads,

02:05:53.540 --> 02:06:00.280
blues as well as Elliot
Pound, Stevens, et cetera.

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:06.200
So it is a testimony to the
enormous breadth and indeed,

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:11.380 position:56%
musicality of poetry in the first
half of the 20th Century in America.

02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:15.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Pinsky: It's the voice

02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:18.660
of whoever likes the
work of art and loves it.

02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:33.660
If poetry is as it appears to
becoming more popular than it was,

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:37.660 position:56%
my conviction is that is in response

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:41.840
to an eloquent, beautiful
mass culture.

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:43.760
I join Kenneth in admiring

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:52.280
and enjoying mass media very
much whereby their nature

02:06:52.280 --> 02:07:02.870
on a mass scale, the poem by its
nature is on an individual scale.

02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:08.030
The instrument is the reader's
body as we saw last night.

02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:10.730
Ken spoke of loud and quiet.

02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:16.360
I would speak on of
individual scale and mass scale.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:21.500
I hope that some people
here will help us find ways

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:25.050
to get the Favorite Poem
videos into schools.

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:31.100
Two powerful forces I've learned

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:38.130
as a teacher are autonomy
and physicality.

02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:45.030
If you ask the student to choose,

02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:48.700
the student's individual
dignity is your ally.

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:55.100
If you ask the student to
read aloud in their own voice,

02:07:55.100 --> 02:08:04.510 position:56%
to listen to your voice, the voices
of their peers, corporeality as well

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:07.780
as autonomy is joining you.

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:17.570
What we saw last night was evidence
to me that the work of art lives

02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:21.010
in whoever loves the work of art.

02:08:21.010 --> 02:08:28.510 position:56%
And if it has people or teachers, as
humans, we're not willing to trust

02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:33.050
that cultural principle, we
might as well give up anyway.

02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:37.790
Principle involves dignity of
the individual and the belief

02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:39.090
in the beauty of the work of art.

02:08:39.090 --> 02:08:41.680
I'm sorry I don't have
any more here.

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.480
Thank you.

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:58.580
[ Applause ]

02:08:58.580 --> 02:08:59.880
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Okay,

02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:02.800
we now fortunately have a
good deal of time for you.

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:08.350
So I think the panelists
would love to have it opened

02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:12.580
up to your questions and
concerns, indeed, your voices.

02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:14.470
Who wants to start?

02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:15.780
Yes, can you come?

02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:20.930
I think its best if you come
forward because otherwise people --

02:09:25.530 --> 02:09:35.570
&gt;&gt; My question has to do with
the influence of mnemonics

02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:38.860
on the composition [inaudible].

02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:43.780
Does the end [inaudible]
that tells about [inaudible]

02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:48.710
and in a certain memory
or tradition [inaudible].

02:09:48.710 --> 02:09:52.820
The same thing applies
to the [inaudible]

02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:56.900
of the Iliad where the [inaudible].

02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:01.090
It seems that there
was a [inaudible].

02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:09.470
And there used to be a [inaudible]
whereby constant sounds were used

02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:13.450
in conjunction with [inaudible] and
I was wondering if anybody knows

02:10:13.450 --> 02:10:18.370
about that tradition or
knows anything [inaudible]?

02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:20.070 position:56%
My name is Robert Birch, by the way.

02:10:20.070 --> 02:10:22.370
I live over in [Inaudible].

02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:27.270
[ Laughter ]

02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:31.020 position:56%
I turned around [inaudible] with one
person [inaudible] is my colleague,

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:36.930
Martin Miller, who has just put the
Greek [inaudible] in the Odyssey

02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:41.380
on a database to study
stylistic variation.

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:42.940
Some of you is very interested

02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:46.860
in what might be learned
about [inaudible].

02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:48.350
&gt;&gt; Martin Miller?

02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:53.760
&gt;&gt; M-U-E-L-L-E-R, he's from
Northwestern University.

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.350
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] that's
the kind of [inaudible]?

02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:06.490
It applies also to Dante and
to Conan Doyle [inaudible].

02:11:11.370 --> 02:11:13.670
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Yes.

02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:18.530
&gt;&gt; I have been writing a lot of
poetry in my native language --

02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:19.830
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Could --

02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:21.130
&gt;&gt; In Portuguese.

02:11:21.130 --> 02:11:23.430
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Could you
come to the microphone, please?

02:11:26.590 --> 02:11:29.200
&gt;&gt; Recently, I have been
writing a lot of poetry

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:30.960
in my native language
which is Portuguese.

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.620
And I have been asking if you --

02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:34.280
my question is [inaudible]
to common knowledge

02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:37.780
and there is always a
comment that puzzles me.

02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:41.040
And the comment is it
needs more universality.

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:44.750
And I've been thinking about this.

02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:48.220
What makes a poem more universal
than just a [inaudible] collection

02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.220
of one's life or experience?

02:11:56.410 --> 02:11:58.220
&gt;&gt; People have been trying
to answer that question

02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:00.020
for more than a thousand years.

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:04.910
[ Laughter ]

02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:11.420
&gt;&gt; Robert Pinsky: The most
universal thing is physical appeal.

02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:13.860
&gt;&gt; How does that go in a poem?

02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:20.000
&gt;&gt; Robert Pinsky: It's evidenced
in beauty of the sounds.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.840
It's basically consonants
and vowels.

02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:27.910 position:56%
If they're arranged artfully enough,
if you [inaudible] a long time

02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:31.550 position:56%
for that arrangement, the most
universal thing is this [inaudible].

02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:34.320
&gt;&gt; Can I say something?

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.620
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: I think --

02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:38.560
&gt;&gt; I think her point is universal
when it can be written all

02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.690
over the world and can
we [inaudible] a message

02:12:40.690 --> 02:12:42.190
to all over the world.

02:12:42.190 --> 02:12:45.930
Not for just one group
of people or country.

02:12:45.930 --> 02:12:48.840
I think that makes it universal
and that's the [inaudible].

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.140
&gt;&gt; Could I continue?

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.350
You see, what happens is they say
my poems have too much musicality.

02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:57.420
They rhyme too much.

02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.220
&gt;&gt; Robert Pinsky: Maybe
you're right.

02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:02.120
[ Laughter ]

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:04.490
&gt;&gt; It's not impossible.

02:13:04.490 --> 02:13:10.810
One further observation, sometimes
it's not when people are setting

02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:15.540
up more self-consciously to
be universal but they are so.

02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:21.070
We had last night a couple of
instances of people saying,

02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:22.370
"You know, this poem is written

02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:26.940
by someone whose life experience
was utterly different from mine,"

02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:30.290
and often the poems were
very personal in their use

02:13:30.290 --> 02:13:32.780
of the poet's life experience.

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:37.580
Yet the reader for some reason
said, "Yes, this speaks to me."

02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:42.960
Emerson's answer would have
been that if you're utterly true

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:48.440
to your own inner experience,
you end up speaking universally

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.270
without quite knowing
how you got there.

02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:54.000
I would like to hope at
least that it's true.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: I think we ought
to be a little cautious though.

02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:01.820 position:56%
Bearing in mind the first panel this
morning and that is, tastes change.

02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:06.610
Byron was certainly at one point
considered almost universal.

02:14:06.610 --> 02:14:09.590
His death in the Greek
revolution helped.

02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:12.750
But I don't know that
that's true anymore.

02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:15.620
But it may become true again.

02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:24.740 position:56%
In other words, what -- there's a --

02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:31.830
universality is as much subject
to changes of taste and influence

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:37.620
and resonance as other
things in our lives.

02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.050
Did you have a question?

02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:40.970
Please.

02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:46.020
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Mary Case.

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:48.270
I teach at American University

02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:50.900
of Washington this semester
in the arts program.

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:54.270
My question is for Dr. Breslin.

02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:55.570
Do you --

02:14:55.570 --> 02:14:56.870
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] please, yeah.

02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:58.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

02:14:58.170 --> 02:14:59.810
I don't want to [inaudible] way.

02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:01.460
&gt;&gt; No.

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.010
&gt;&gt;You talked about the poetry
[inaudible] and one of the things

02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:10.180
that you found that you [inaudible]
the competitive nature of it.

02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:12.510
You won that poetry --

02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:16.210
[ Laughter ]

02:15:16.210 --> 02:15:17.510
And I'm interested in this

02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:20.860
because you have this wonderful
poetry slam program here

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:23.830
in Washington, for the
junior high school aged kids

02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:26.860
and they really engage.

02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:31.170
So, I'm wondering about this
whole thing about competition.

02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:32.470
[Inaudible].

02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:39.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: Yes, the arts
competitive in a certain true sense.

02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.650
I mean, [inaudible] how
well am I doing, you know,

02:15:44.650 --> 02:15:48.700
who's doing the work
that I love the best.

02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:53.920
Would my [inaudible] be found
[inaudible] by those standards?

02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:56.480
What can I do to make it better?

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.580
My sense is that they were
kind of more in competition

02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:03.720
with what is is given you by
your combination of [inaudible]

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.970
and weaknesses to achieve.

02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:08.990
I mean, if you worry
too much about --

02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:11.620
I mean, I'm speaking
personally [inaudible].

02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:17.240
I just find that the less
I think about what X, Y,

02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:20.960
and Z [inaudible] are doing and
measure what I'm trying to do

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.280
against them, the less blocked
I am, the better the work

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:29.980
that I produce is the less
satisfied with it I become.

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:33.870
You notice I don't say
the more it satisfies me,

02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:38.580
the less it satisfies
me [inaudible] become.

02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:40.860
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] society
question which is a big one.

02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:48.280
The whole direction was in the form
of [inaudible] literature test 25

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:51.680
to 30 years has been
to attack [inaudible]

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:56.850
and when people say something is
universal, they mean that a lot

02:16:56.850 --> 02:17:02.040
of -- mostly white, mostly male
people with a lot of access

02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.940
to culture and power
[inaudible] pass it on.

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:11.240
And if I take -- you know, I
think this is taken to the point

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:16.810 position:56%
where the question of trying to
explain why we value something other

02:17:16.810 --> 02:17:20.130
than as the outcome of the
power struggle has become almost

02:17:20.130 --> 02:17:22.070
an embarrassment.

02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:28.210 position:56%
And I'm very concerned with the idea
that although [inaudible] to change,

02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:32.000
of course cultural power and
cultural wars have a great deal

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.240
to do with what [inaudible].

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.060
I don't think these
suspicions are irreversible,

02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:43.000
and I think more it's a
matter of faith than something

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.560
that I could prove intellectually
that in some kind of rough balance

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.920
where -- survives the
sifting [inaudible] meant

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.960
to have something other than
cultural good luck behind it,

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.870 position:56%
which is not to say that some things

02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:02.840
that don't survive it aren't worth
reviving and might be just as good

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:04.250
as [inaudible] has survived.

02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:07.910
And I also think there's
such a thing as [inaudible].

02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:09.970
That sucked, you know [laughter],

02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:13.950
and I think that that poetry is
finally okay when we're young

02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:19.040
and we're starving, but at a
certain point it becomes trouble.

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.570
I do believe that.

02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:26.080
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: Just
a word on competition.

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:28.320
I think if you read
between the lines,

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:31.480
or not even between the lines,
you read the lines in the Odyssey

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:39.230
or the Iliad, there is a point when
it's quite clear that the speaker,

02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:42.430
the Bard - and this goes back
to the pneumonic question,

02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:47.980
is lauded because of the complexity
and the fullness of memory.

02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:51.440
You get the same thing in
the Griots and Senegal.

02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:54.870
There's a sense that the greatest
of the Griots are the ones

02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:59.390
who have the great legends
of [inaudible] and whatever,

02:18:59.390 --> 02:19:03.250
and they can bring
them in the fullness.

02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:04.810
So, there's a sense of competition,

02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:07.200
the Calypso's already
been mentioned.

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.600
There's a sense of competition
not, I think, solely in the quality

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:17.510
of the poetry, although that's
important, but in the fullness

02:19:17.510 --> 02:19:20.820
of recollection and the aptness
of recollection certainly

02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:23.080
in the great oral traditions.

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:26.770
And those are valuable qualities.

02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:30.240
Yes?

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:33.290
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible].

02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:43.540 position:56%
In response to the universal success
of poetry, I think it's the ability

02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:47.630
to connect because only in America
are we going to market poetry

02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:49.980
with its competent repetitiveness,
you know, [inaudible]

02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:54.250
but it's ability for some kids,
junior high kids to connect

02:19:54.250 --> 02:19:55.780
and relate with a [inaudible].

02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:59.550
When I first read Walt Whitman, he
was like - where is he coming from?

02:19:59.550 --> 02:20:01.050
I had no interest and
didn't connect at all.

02:20:01.050 --> 02:20:05.150
Later, I took the book off the
shelf and I heard him calling to me

02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:07.790
and I heard him raising
me, and affirming me,

02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:09.210
and really calling me
back to life [inaudible].

02:20:09.210 --> 02:20:14.610 position:56%
And I have a friend from Ireland
whose oral tradition is so precious,

02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:17.240
he's memorized poem after poem
and he carries it with him

02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:19.040
when he visits here in America.

02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:21.350
And I watch him as he'll
take a woman off the street,

02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:25.910
or a man off the street, or in some
context [inaudible] socializing

02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:29.730
while he was here and he knows
a poem would fit this man's life

02:20:29.730 --> 02:20:31.580
and he will say, "I've got a poem

02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:34.430
for you [laughter] [inaudible]
recitation of this poem.

02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:38.130
It does have a [inaudible] to it."

02:20:38.130 --> 02:20:42.240
[Inaudible] watched the man tear up
or to watch [inaudible] just open

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:45.500
up of a flower under the light
of somebody touching somebody

02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:46.800
and connecting with them.

02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:49.740
That's what it's all about.

02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:54.560 position:56%
So, I would say connect with people,
give them as many [inaudible]

02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:58.530
of imagery, [inaudible]
and that's giving the gift

02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:02.510
of life and poetry --

02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:07.130
[ Applause ]

02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:08.560
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford:
That is indeed voice.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.200
Yes.

02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:12.020
&gt;&gt; I too have a [inaudible]

02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:16.900
by that question [inaudible]
on his achievement.

02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:24.000
What I would like to do is recite
a few lines and compare them

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.990
and see what they [inaudible].

02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:33.600
The last line, "It matters
not how strait the gate,

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.270
how charged with punishments

I am the master of my fate;
I am the captain of my soul.

With rue, my heart is laden,
for the many friends I have,

02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:58.320
for many a rose-lip maiden
and many a light foot lad.

02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:06.330
By brooks too broad for leaping,
the light foot boys are laid.

02:22:06.330 --> 02:22:20.850
The rose-lip girls are sleeping
in fields where roses fade.

02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:23.510
Which if the [inaudible] universal.

02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:26.110
[ Laughter ]

02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:28.960
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: I -- we've
just been enjoined not to act

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.760
like judges in a poetry slam.

02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:39.110
[ Laughter ]

02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:44.460
&gt;&gt; One of the things that struck
me is [inaudible] Roberts had sound

02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:48.430
and the person over there basically
said meaning for younger sounding

02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:54.000
and in some ways, in some
ways, those are the two poles

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.410
by which people find universality.

02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:02.980
You know, to be universal, you
know, I can hear the rhythms

02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:07.480
of a Portuguese poem and I can
proudly hear most of the rhymes

02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.760
but I sure don't know what
the hell that poem's about.

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:17.250
[Inaudible] and so once it moves
into translation, it has to be --

02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:22.260
it has to be reworked, so there's
a sound to it [background noises].

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:27.810
For me, the whole universality
[inaudible], I --

02:23:27.810 --> 02:23:30.980
in a sense, why do we care?

02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:32.530
I care less.

02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:38.710
My sense is that poems that takes
change, tastes move in and out

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:42.320
and that's a good thing, that
taste move in and out sometimes

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:47.300
for reasons of power but
sometimes for other reasons,

02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:53.250
for reasons of the lifecycle,
for reasons of culture sitting

02:23:53.250 --> 02:23:55.600
in certain places at
certain moments.

02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:59.970
Other things going on
[inaudible] culture.

02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:05.920
So, you know, things can move
in, move out and who knows?

02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:09.940
In 20 years, people might
be reading in a [inaudible].

02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:19.120
Maybe many of you are, you
know, but I just don't - for me,

02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:23.910
it doesn't seem to be a problem.

02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:33.320
Yes, it all has been a bunch of - a
bunch of white males from the West

02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:37.550
and I do agree that there's
considerable truth to that.

02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:41.720
On the other hand, I've been
thrown here in the 21st Century

02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.830
and I'm busy trying to figure
out how to live my life.

02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:49.950
Well, in keeping both [inaudible].

02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:56.900
I guess I've come to like
[inaudible] thinking more

02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:01.560
about ethics and translation
for somebody.

02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:05.030
In other words, [inaudible]
overnight, different context.

02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:09.780
After all, it's not as if God said,
"Before there were human beings,

02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:15.340
let's create this idyllic
form called [inaudible]."

02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:18.760
And all earth and poetry
that's universal,

02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:21.490
be some asset that [inaudible].

02:25:21.490 --> 02:25:24.420
Emerson said something like that,

02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.500
but I beg to differ
with [inaudible].

02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:30.990
No, it's more than, you know,
people from ancient Greece

02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:32.290
on a ship [inaudible] coast

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:36.940
through the language barrier say
[inaudible] some people did serve

02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:38.240
[inaudible] different kinds

02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:39.540
of [inaudible] called
Policious [assumed spelling].

02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:51.310 position:56%
You were something like that too and
later when Westerners made contact

02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:56.920
with places like [inaudible],
you know, gradually - but that,

02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:58.990
there's kind of an agreement

02:25:58.990 --> 02:26:03.530
to translate the term poetry that's
covered all these different things.

02:26:03.530 --> 02:26:04.970
It's not absolute.

02:26:04.970 --> 02:26:10.100
We're talking about
desire, not fact here.

02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:14.540
Poetry is what people
in a wide range of times

02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:16.900
and situations have wanted

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:20.110
to call poetry [inaudible]
recognize [inaudible] kinship.

02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:26.210
To get back to your two
examples, I think [inaudible]

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:33.230
from [inaudible] recited the last
stanza [inaudible] trouble with now

02:26:33.230 --> 02:26:37.070
because it celebrates
this kind of [inaudible]

02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:41.710
of the inviolable [inaudible]
soul that is somehow able

02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:47.410
to master its own fate out
of context and I think a lot

02:26:47.410 --> 02:26:53.110
of people have trouble buying
that anymore and have trouble -

02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:57.280
it sounds to my ears as a
family protests too much.

02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:04.780
There's a kind of hysterical
[inaudible] about that rhetoric.

02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:10.720
The house and the farm [inaudible]
George Orwell's essay when he talks

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:15.930 position:56%
about having "[Inaudible] going back
to Rita to finding out [inaudible].

02:27:15.930 --> 02:27:18.180
It just tinkles."

02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:20.460
So, you never know [laughter].

02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:22.790
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Let me
suggest a couple of other examples.

02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:26.300
I've been thinking about
this universality question

02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:29.660
and I'll give two from
this very room.

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:32.560
Let's take the Japanese haiku.

02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:40.270
A very constrained and restricted
and long-polished form in Japan,

02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:42.740
but Bob Haas as many of
you know, has translated -

02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.000 position:56%
there's a whole book of
translations from three great haiku,

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.460
three of the greatest haiku
writers and they do come across.

02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:57.380 position:56%
You do feel the intelligence, and
irony, and the delight in constraint

02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:01.600
and contrast, and then I think
of an evening, one of the --

02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:06.510
probably one of the most memorable
evenings in this room with --

02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:15.390
[ Laughter ]

02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:16.970
-- Joseph Brodsky.

02:28:16.970 --> 02:28:20.780
Joseph Brodsky was reading
[inaudible] in Russian

02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:28.280
and I was reading translations in
English from various translators

02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:34.470
and there's no question that
some of that poetry is universal.

02:28:34.470 --> 02:28:39.820
That is, you feel the
power, you feel the tragedy,

02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:44.340
you feel the magnificent
uplift of the human spirit

02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:47.090
in terrible conditions

02:28:47.090 --> 02:28:50.750
and it doesn't matter really
what the language is as long

02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:54.340
as you can understand the language.

02:28:54.340 --> 02:29:01.460
So, I think - I think universality
is of course, it's best judged

02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:06.590
in the original language but if
it can come across in translation

02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:10.870
into another language and if it
can still give you that thrill

02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:15.290
of intellectual and emotional
recognition, then it's on the way,

02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:17.890
I think, to becoming universal.

02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:20.840
Another question?

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:23.140
Yes, please?

02:29:34.050 --> 02:29:37.220
&gt;&gt; My name is Jennifer Hubbard
and I'm a hostile English teacher

02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:42.040
and since I'm taking the
day off from my students,

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:45.780
I thought I would ask a
question on their behalf.

02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:48.620
They would love a professional
opinion

02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:57.510
as to why we English teachers make
them memorize and recite poetry.

02:29:57.510 --> 02:30:12.220
[ Laughter ]

02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:13.520
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Let's --

02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:15.460
we'll save Robert's
voice, so you're on, Paul.

02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:17.060
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: Well,
as Robert said,

02:30:17.060 --> 02:30:23.210
maybe the most primal [inaudible]
poetry [inaudible] included

02:30:23.210 --> 02:30:31.380
in the experience [inaudible]
and you don't really get

02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:33.590
to recite poems [inaudible] page.

02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:38.590
I think there's a tremendous
tendency in the way we're taught

02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:43.100
to read especially in
[inaudible] college curriculum

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:44.400
that people [inaudible].

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:48.160
The idea is [inaudible] what you
have to read, extract what you need

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:50.720
on the exam, get back out,

02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:54.810
and particularly [inaudible]
is not important.

02:30:54.810 --> 02:31:01.750
The poetry [inaudible], it
is first face of the language

02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:06.930 position:56%
and [inaudible] the idea [inaudible]
in which [inaudible] exists.

02:31:06.930 --> 02:31:14.580
So, when you memorize too,
it starts to be [inaudible].

02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:18.690
In order to memorize, you have to
pay attention to how it sounds.

02:31:18.690 --> 02:31:20.590
You have to say it to yourself.

02:31:20.590 --> 02:31:23.800
You have to live with it a
while and kind of dwell on it.

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:28.770
I made my students memorize
two poems per quarter

02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:34.670
when I teach Reading
[inaudible] Poetry [inaudible].

02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:41.840
This is how they have to live word
by word, the decisions poets take.

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:49.150
Every poem was once one page
and every word that's added,

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:57.700 position:56%
it's [inaudible] direction and away
from [inaudible] directions and it's

02:31:57.700 --> 02:32:04.190 position:56%
in that changing process, that field
of energy as that process continues,

02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:07.600
the poem has [inaudible]
and that's true [inaudible],

02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:11.510
that's true for formal
poetry, as well.

02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:44.590
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:47.540
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford:
Kenneth, you want to say?

02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:52.280
No? Yes?

02:32:55.090 --> 02:32:56.810
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

02:32:56.810 --> 02:33:02.700 position:56%
I would like to address the
universality of the poetry question.

02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:09.870 position:56%
I feel that when we bring forth our
truths, the truth of our experience,

02:33:09.870 --> 02:33:17.370
that is when we question to
the universality of who we are

02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:24.670
and we all in different cultures,
experiences, ethnic groups,

02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:30.450
can feel that universality when
it is truth and the essence

02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:33.210
of the person's experience.

02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:36.010
Now, I am not an academia.

02:33:36.010 --> 02:33:40.390
My work is in healing and I
have found that I have been able

02:33:40.390 --> 02:33:46.070
to touch the muse and
teach through poetry,

02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:49.180
so I think when the
truths are who you are

02:33:49.180 --> 02:33:55.470
and your experience comes through,
that's who [inaudible] for me.

02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:57.910
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Thank you.

02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:59.210
Yes, back there?

02:33:59.210 --> 02:34:02.970
No, there's nobody behind you.

02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:14.620
Just speak.

02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:20.730
&gt;&gt; My name's Greta Erick and I'm
a poet as well, a coming poetess

02:34:20.730 --> 02:34:26.110
and first of all, I appreciate
all that you've talked about today

02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:31.490
and [inaudible] topics
that you raised.

02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:35.290
But I guess I would --

02:34:35.290 --> 02:34:37.170
I feel strongly to
[inaudible] conservation,

02:34:37.170 --> 02:34:41.340
which is that for me
there's been a real absence

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:44.210
of women's voices on this panel.

02:34:44.210 --> 02:34:50.160
That the only two women poets
that have been discussed

02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:54.930
by this panel [inaudible], uses
examples of [inaudible], actually.

02:34:54.930 --> 02:35:03.500
And, I guess my question
-- excuse me --

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:10.310 position:56%
would be, given the context in which

02:35:10.310 --> 02:35:14.730
such a [inaudible] thing could
occur [inaudible] celebrations,

02:35:14.730 --> 02:35:18.900
but how would you propose
nurturing the voices

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:26.170
of women [inaudible]
minorities in our culture?

02:35:26.170 --> 02:35:35.010
And I don't mean to be, like,
a huge downer, I was just -- --

02:35:35.010 --> 02:35:37.010
[ Laughter ]

02:35:37.010 --> 02:35:38.310
[Inaudible].

02:35:38.310 --> 02:35:41.730
And I'd like to hear from
the panelists, as well,

02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:47.400
[inaudible] audience if you
have ideas or suggestions

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:53.710
about this issue, I would be
happy to talk with you afterwards.

02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:55.420
Thank you.

02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:57.720
&gt;&gt; Well, let me think.

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:09.990
It was a matter of what
happened that the nervous person

02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:15.440
at the poetry recital was the
woman who maybe [inaudible].

02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.690
I mean, if I knew more
why that was the case,

02:36:19.690 --> 02:36:25.570
it might turn out that
she [inaudible] possible.

02:36:25.570 --> 02:36:34.700
In my teaching, [inaudible]
course that was [inaudible].

02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:48.090 position:56%
It's funny you focus on different
things in different contexts, and --

02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:51.490
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: I can only
say come back late afternoon

02:36:51.490 --> 02:36:56.430
when you have Naomi Nye and
Rita Dove and Louise Gluk.

02:37:01.090 --> 02:37:07.120 position:56%
I don't think there's any attempt
to discourage or exclude, I think --

02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:08.420
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: No,
the question is,

02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:11.320
why unconsciously [inaudible]
played out that way.

02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:15.010
It's a serious question.

02:37:15.010 --> 02:37:16.310
Yeah.

02:37:16.310 --> 02:37:17.610
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

02:37:17.610 --> 02:37:27.600
Given that context, how can we
nurture the voices of young poets

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:30.430
who don't see themselves
represented [inaudible]?

02:37:30.430 --> 02:37:33.740
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: I think
you're generalizing for --

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:36.900
were you here for the first panel?

02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:38.200
&gt;&gt; Pardon?

02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:42.060
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: Yeah, there
were some women's voices

02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:45.060
prominently represented.

02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:48.210
&gt;&gt;. [Inaudible], especially
[inaudible] voice.

02:37:48.210 --> 02:37:59.560
I just find it interesting
that [inaudible].

02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:08.470
I just find it interesting that the
panelists happened to be like that,

02:38:08.470 --> 02:38:16.550
and that [inaudible] so
were all these [inaudible].

02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:19.830
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: I recall
mentioning [inaudible]

02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:27.720
at the [inaudible] one of her poems
in the presentation [inaudible].

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:29.270
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: We are--

02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:31.510
[ Multiple Speakers ]

02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:33.880

that [inaudible] voices?

02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:43.830
[Inaudible] who wouldn't be
sitting up there, you know,

02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:47.970
when it comes to be our time?

02:38:47.970 --> 02:38:49.270
&gt;&gt; Paul Breslin: They often are.

02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:51.070
I think you're --

02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:59.490
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:38:59.490 --> 02:39:02.370
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Yes, we
are drawing to a close --

02:39:02.370 --> 02:39:06.200
no, please, come forward,
but just let me say

02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.510
that we are drawing
towards noon and we're going

02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:12.060
to have to cut off fairly soon.

02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:15.810
So, please keep your
questions succinct.

02:39:15.810 --> 02:39:17.110
Thank you.

02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:18.410
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is [inaudible].

02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:26.490
How I started liking the poetry
when I saw a poet performer,

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:31.540
and that is the way that I think
[inaudible] little children

02:39:31.540 --> 02:39:34.920
because many people used to
say that poetry was boring

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:37.200
and just it was very
hard [inaudible]

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:40.200
and people didn't like it.

02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:42.970
When I saw a teacher,
when I was in school,

02:39:42.970 --> 02:39:46.030
I loved the performance,
and I started studying.

02:39:46.030 --> 02:39:48.900
I started studying and [inaudible]
and I didn't [inaudible].

02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:54.240
I think once you go to all over the
world, not just to a little group

02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:58.300
of people that [inaudible],
they should go to everybody,

02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:01.870
because it changed the world.

02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:08.900
It changed [inaudible] change
many things in this time and then.

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:14.100
I just wanted to tell you that.

02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:15.630
And, [inaudible] actress,

02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:18.240
and I think we should
work together [inaudible]

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:22.510
to make enjoy more
poetry, everybody.

02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:23.980
Thank you, very much.

02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:25.380
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Thank you.

02:40:25.380 --> 02:40:27.970
Yes, that gentleman, please.

02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:47.180
&gt;&gt; I very much admired
the work that [inaudible]

02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:51.590
and I thought [inaudible] comment
from the panel upon the subject

02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:59.010
or the fact that when you get into
the various cultures [inaudible]

02:40:59.010 --> 02:41:03.690
to them, you find out in our
history, our early history

02:41:03.690 --> 02:41:09.180
that each is very unique, each
perceived music in different ways

02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:11.400
and the arts, the paintings,
and so on.

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.580
And of course, their poetry.

02:41:15.580 --> 02:41:19.870
I was wondering if there is a
belief here, to some degree,

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:23.730
that perhaps there are
[inaudible] in existence

02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:30.310
which are not intercultural
or cannot be completely

02:41:30.310 --> 02:41:34.680 position:56%
or perfectly translated [inaudible].

02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:40.700
&gt;&gt; Yes. Translation is always
imperfect, it strikes me

02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:42.190
and that's what translation is.

02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:47.050
It's trying to move
halfway or move partway

02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:50.630
or see what you can bring
from one to the other.

02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:55.470
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I think what's
plain now is the problems

02:41:55.470 --> 02:41:58.820
with translation are really
more visible when you move

02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.030
between languages [inaudible]
than a single language.

02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:07.550
We're taught the dictionary
means words we acquire a sense

02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:10.180
of [inaudible] of words
from all of the uses

02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:12.890
over time, which we [inaudible].

02:42:12.890 --> 02:42:16.710
And, in fact, there's a lot
of common ground [inaudible]

02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:20.350
because there's also things
[inaudible] variation.

02:42:20.350 --> 02:42:25.170
And depending on which particular
artist [inaudible] I'm from,

02:42:25.170 --> 02:42:27.020
I'll feel differently.

02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:33.400
So, we're already translating
when we talk to each other

02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:38.230
in English or any other language.

02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:41.620
It only becomes more intense
and more visible when we try

02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:44.630
to translate from one
language into another.

02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:48.530
One of the best books I read
[inaudible] is called <i>Acts</i>

02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:52.720
<i>of Identity: Creole-based
Approaches</i>

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:54.890
<i>to Language, Ethnicity, and Race </i>.

02:42:54.890 --> 02:42:57.980
And the authors come
up with the idea

02:42:57.980 --> 02:43:01.030
that everyone is performing a
kind of instant [inaudible],

02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:06.450
a kind of improvised
lingual [inaudible]

02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:09.640
and it develops according
to feedback in the sense

02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:13.130 position:56%
that people are picking up on what
they're saying and continue further.

02:43:13.130 --> 02:43:16.870
If you don't, you back up the
truck and try something else.

02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:24.070
Another article [inaudible] how
in London, it's considered cool

02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:31.170
in the youth culture [inaudible] to
speak like a Rastafarian but most

02:43:31.170 --> 02:43:32.720
of the immigrants aren't
from Jamaica.

02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:34.630
That's another [inaudible],
they may never have heard a

02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:36.480
Rastafarian speak.

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:41.510
So, there's this kind of
invented Dred talk in London

02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:43.240
and to the extent that
people buy it.

02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:45.880
That's Rastafarian speech
[inaudible] in London

02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:48.740
until someone comes along
and notes that or comes

02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:51.350
up with a more convincing
version of it.

02:43:51.350 --> 02:43:54.170
I think that's kind
of how things work.

02:43:54.170 --> 02:44:02.110
The miracle is and maybe this
is [inaudible], the miracle is

02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:04.110
that we understand and are moved

02:44:04.110 --> 02:44:08.980
by each other's language
as often as we are.

02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:11.930
Don't ask me how.

02:44:11.930 --> 02:44:13.230
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Yes?

02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:15.090
I think this is going to
have to be the last question.

02:44:15.090 --> 02:44:16.390
Thank you.

02:44:16.390 --> 02:44:20.220
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Peg [inaudible].

02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:24.640
I'm a poet, I'm half
Cuban, [inaudible],

02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.540
so I have a great access
to a great [inaudible].

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:33.480
And I'd just like to [inaudible].

02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:43.070
I want to say that, it's our
responsibility to take poetry

02:44:43.070 --> 02:44:46.770
to great richness of all of the
traditions and one of the functions

02:44:46.770 --> 02:44:53.070
of poetry is to provide a
window out of our parochialism,

02:44:53.070 --> 02:45:00.370
our national parochialism which
[inaudible] gender parochialism.

02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:12.250
And I would say that it's
irrelevant to want [inaudible]

02:45:12.250 --> 02:45:17.510
on the panel [inaudible]
focus on [inaudible].

02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:22.010
[ Applause ]

02:45:22.010 --> 02:45:24.140
[ Silence ]

02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:26.980
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: That's
a nice note on which to end

02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:32.590
from two great poetic
cultures, Spanish and Irish.

02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:35.680
This panel, as I think
the program is clear,

02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:39.750
is about this exciting
project, that is the making

02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:43.950
of the favorite poem
project and the tapes.

02:45:43.950 --> 02:45:47.480
And there will be some
tapes shown, so those of you

02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:54.490
who are not favored visually may
want to move back a little bit.

02:45:54.490 --> 02:45:58.990
I'll ask Maggie Dietz, who's
standing talking to Robert,

02:45:58.990 --> 02:46:05.280
to introduce her fellow
panelists, who are the producers

02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:07.890
of the tapes, is that correct?

02:46:07.890 --> 02:46:09.190
&gt;&gt; Maggie Dietz: That's correct.

02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:10.490
I'll introduce them.

02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:11.790
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: All right.

02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:13.090
So it's over to you, Maggie.

02:46:13.090 --> 02:46:15.390
&gt;&gt; Maggie Dietz: Okay.

02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:21.870
We decided to change the
nature of this panel,

02:46:21.870 --> 02:46:26.700
because this is actually, as you
noted, a short panel, a more casual

02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:29.220
and kind of relaxed panel.

02:46:29.220 --> 02:46:31.420
We'd like to invite -- we're going

02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:36.030 position:56%
to show you a few more videos
[inaudible] that you saw last night,

02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:39.030
which we thought would be fun,
which [inaudible] has ever seen,

02:46:39.030 --> 02:46:41.310
but you will be the first.

02:46:41.310 --> 02:46:44.890
And then invite questions
to the number

02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:48.990
of people whose talents
contributed to this project.

02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:53.970
It doesn't matter for this
panel that Robert can't talk,

02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:58.420
because [laughter] the idea is

02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:02.150
that what you saw last night
speaks [inaudible] to the project

02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:05.450
and to the goals of the project.

02:47:05.450 --> 02:47:08.910
We have on the end, next to
Robert Pinsky, Mark Stafford,

02:47:08.910 --> 02:47:12.940
who is the senior audio producer
for the Favorite Poem Project.

02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:18.310
You have not seen or -- you have
not heard, excuse me, Mark's work,

02:47:18.310 --> 02:47:22.450
in particular because we didn't
do an audio presentation,

02:47:22.450 --> 02:47:27.060
but it should be known that the
audio segments are ended separately

02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:29.420
based on the same raw materials.

02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:32.620
And it may be of interest to some
of you to ask Mark some questions

02:47:32.620 --> 02:47:37.700
about his approach to honing
the pieces for that medium.

02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:41.820
Juanita Anderson is
the executive producer

02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:43.470
of the Favorite Poem Project.

02:47:43.470 --> 02:47:45.670
She is on Robert's left.

02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:48.760
And I can't say enough
good about her.

02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:52.040
Without Juanita Favorite Poem
Project would not be possible.

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:54.480
And Juanita was responsible
for finding all of the people

02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:56.530
who are sitting up
here at this table.

02:47:56.530 --> 02:48:02.960 position:56%
On Juanita's left is [inaudible],
who was one of the principle editors

02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.690
for the Favorite Poem
Project video pieces.

02:48:06.690 --> 02:48:11.970
I think [inaudible] did more than
half the pieces, 21 of the 50,

02:48:11.970 --> 02:48:15.120
and many of those that
you did see last night.

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.280
So one of the first
things we're going

02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:21.010
to show you is a completed
segment --

02:48:21.010 --> 02:48:22.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:48:22.310 --> 02:48:23.610
Pardon me?

02:48:23.610 --> 02:48:24.910
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:48:24.910 --> 02:48:26.210
Oh, no, no, I'm getting to Deborah.

02:48:26.210 --> 02:48:30.030
In fact, I'll just go there first.

02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:33.830
Deborah [inaudible] was
a production manager

02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:37.930
for the Favorite Poem
Project and she had a big job,

02:48:37.930 --> 02:48:39.230
and she worked long hours.

02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:42.250
And she was also one
of the field producers

02:48:42.250 --> 02:48:45.600
for the Favorite Poem Project,
and the piece that Deborah shot

02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:47.810
in Barbados is the
last piece on the tape,

02:48:47.810 --> 02:48:50.190
which we very much [inaudible].

02:48:50.190 --> 02:48:51.490
It's Reverend Michael
Haines [assumed spelling],

02:48:51.490 --> 02:48:58.870
a Baptist minister from Boston
who did this shot in Barbados.

02:48:58.870 --> 02:49:02.150
I was talking about the first piece
we were going to show with respect

02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:03.640
to [inaudible], because
you're actually going

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:08.160 position:56%
to be probably the only people ever,
besides the people at this table,

02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.260
to see Favorite Poem
Project outtakes [laughter].

02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:14.380
And we've just -- we've
just chosen one.

02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:16.870 position:56%
We're going to show the entire piece

02:49:16.870 --> 02:49:18.910

02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:30.030
And then we're going to show, as a
demonstration, some of the things

02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:32.770
that the production team has
encountered when they were

02:49:32.770 --> 02:49:35.050
out on these shoots, and I
won't say more than that.

02:49:35.050 --> 02:49:39.590
I'll let, again, the
videos speak for themselves.

02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:44.650
So I will begin by playing that
piece, and then we'll stop and it

02:49:44.650 --> 02:49:46.690
and maybe invite some questions
for the production team,

02:49:46.690 --> 02:49:52.390
and then see if there's an
appropriate point to see more.

02:49:52.390 --> 02:49:54.160
&gt;&gt; I'm Alexander Shir.

02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:58.270
I'm a Law Professor at the
University of Georgia, in Athens.

02:49:59.510 --> 02:50:01.280
I'm 45 years old.

02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:05.740 position:56%
I was born in New England, lived out
West for awhile [inaudible] Midwest.

02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:11.140
Now I live on a farm about 15
minutes away from where I work.

02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:14.650
We have horses and the land
has three fields on it,

02:50:14.650 --> 02:50:17.950
and a real nice barn,
so it suits to them.

02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:22.120
The trees are just beautiful here.

02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:24.880
There's a real nice [inaudible]
between where the building's sit

02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:29.570
and where the land is, everything
seems aligned just the right way.

02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:31.930
So when I'm here, I really
feel like I'm settled

02:50:31.930 --> 02:50:36.460
down in a place that I want to be.

02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:40.830
After the Fish Houses is a poem
that [inaudible] read for years.

02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:46.740
I think I first read it when I
was in college, 25, 30 years ago.

02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:49.320
It speaks, at least in
parts, [inaudible] background

02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:53.990
from the Rocky New England
coast, cold water ocean,

02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:58.010
and the very harsh landscape
that exists at that spot.

02:50:58.010 --> 02:51:03.660
I have a real admiration for
Elizabeth Bishop's method

02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:08.040
of paying attention to small,
domestic, really tiny details.

02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:10.860
It's a preference of mine to
look carefully at things and try

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:13.690
to understand things
the way they are.

02:51:15.940 --> 02:51:18.690
I have a complete book of her
poems, which I keep around here

02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:21.820
in my office, [inaudible]
my office at work.

02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:24.070
But I also -- I used to carry
around a paper version of it,

02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:27.650
but I actually have one of
those little palm pilots

02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:31.820
that I have it on,
and when I need to,

02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:34.200
I [inaudible] read it whenever
I can [inaudible] to hear it.

02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:38.170
So I try to keep it pretty close.

02:51:38.170 --> 02:51:42.800
I've long had the feeling that
life has lots of hard edges to it.

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:46.530
We all have [inaudible] in
one way or another [inaudible]

02:51:46.530 --> 02:51:49.820
from our own doing or from
circumstances beyond our control,

02:51:49.820 --> 02:51:53.990
and it's often hard to get a
feel for why it's happening,

02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:56.920
or just how to understand
it and stay steady,

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:59.610
and stable, and keep your balance.

02:51:59.610 --> 02:52:03.030
The thing that's wonderful to me
about At the Fish Houses is the way

02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:05.760
that she looks at all
these things in the world,

02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:09.740
she locates everything,
including the human being,

02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:13.140
the fisherman at the beginning
[inaudible] this world response

02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:16.940
to it and allows herself to
get the sensation of knowledge,

02:52:16.940 --> 02:52:19.030
which she speaks to at the
very end, that encompasses

02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:20.330
that everything that she's seen.

02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:21.840
And because that's a real --

02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:27.210
it's a dark sensation but
a real reassuring feeling

02:52:27.210 --> 02:52:32.140 position:56%
that however hard things might be
we can look at it and understand it,

02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:36.570
and come to terms with it.

02:52:36.570 --> 02:52:39.920
At the Fish Houses
by Elizabeth Bishop.

02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:41.900
Although it was a cold evening,

02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:45.940
down by one of the fish houses
an old man sits netting.

02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:51.110
His net [inaudible] almost
invisible, a dark purple brown.

02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:54.370
And his shuttle warm and polished.

02:52:54.370 --> 02:52:57.110
The air smells so strong
of cod fish,

02:52:57.110 --> 02:53:00.720
makes one's nose run
and one's eyes water.

02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:04.510
The five fish houses have
steeply peaked roofs,

02:53:04.510 --> 02:53:09.440 position:56%
and narrow [inaudible] gang planks
slant up to storerooms in the gables

02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:13.260
for the wheelbarrows to
be pushed up and down on.

02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:15.040
All is silver.

02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:17.850
The heavy surface of the
sea [inaudible] slowly

02:53:17.850 --> 02:53:21.050
as if considering the spilling
over [inaudible] opaque.

02:53:21.050 --> 02:53:23.940
But the silver of the benches,
the lobster [inaudible]

02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:27.210
and mats scattered along the
[inaudible] jagged rocks is

02:53:27.210 --> 02:53:30.060
[inaudible] like a
small old [inaudible]

02:53:30.060 --> 02:53:34.510
with an [inaudible] growing
on their [inaudible] walls.

02:53:34.510 --> 02:53:37.420
The big fish [inaudible] are
completely lined with layers

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:42.000 position:56%
of beautiful herring scales and the
wheelbarrows are similarly plastered

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.850
with [inaudible] coats
of [inaudible]

02:53:43.850 --> 02:53:47.530
with small iridescent
flies crawling on them.

02:53:47.530 --> 02:53:50.920
Up on the little slope, behind
the houses [inaudible] sprinkle

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.820
of grass is an ancient
wooden [inaudible],

02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:59.730
cramped with two long bleached
handles, and some melancholy stains

02:53:59.730 --> 02:54:03.610
like dried blood, where
the iron work has rusted.

02:54:03.610 --> 02:54:05.870
The old man [inaudible]
lucky strike.

02:54:05.870 --> 02:54:08.060
He was a friend of my grandfather.

02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:11.160
We talk of the decline of the
population [inaudible] cod fish

02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:15.050
and herring while he waits
for a herring boat to come in.

02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:18.060
There are sequins on his
vest and on his thumb.

02:54:18.060 --> 02:54:21.310
He has scraped the
scales, a principle beauty

02:54:21.310 --> 02:54:24.780
from unnumbered fish from
that black old knife,

02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:28.340
the blade of which
is almost worn away.

02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:32.100 position:56%
Down at the water's edge, at the
place where they haul out the boats,

02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:34.820
up the long ramp, descending
into the water,

02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:39.420 position:56%
fins silver [inaudible] are laid
horizontally across the gray stones.

02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:43.750
Down and down [inaudible]
of four or five feet.

02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:47.110
Cold, dark, deep and
absolutely clear.

02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:52.260
[Inaudible] to no mortal,
to fish and to seals.

02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:56.030
One seal particularly I've seen
here evening after evening.

02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:57.640
He was curious about me.

02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.290
He was interested in music.

02:54:59.290 --> 02:55:01.790
Like me, a believer
and total [inaudible],

02:55:01.790 --> 02:55:04.150
so used to seeing [inaudible].

02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:08.980
I also [inaudible] water and
regarded me, [inaudible],

02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:11.530
moving his head a little.

02:55:11.530 --> 02:55:14.000
Then he would disappear,
then suddenly emerge almost

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.700
in the same spot with
a sort of shrug,

02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:19.350
as if it were against
his better judgment.

02:55:19.350 --> 02:55:25.350
Cold, dark, deep and absolutely
clear, the clear gray icy water.

02:55:25.350 --> 02:55:29.350
Back behind us the
dignified tall firs begin.

02:55:29.350 --> 02:55:33.070
Bluish, associating with their
shadows a million Christmas trees

02:55:33.070 --> 02:55:36.000
stand, waiting for Christmas.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.300
The water seems suspended
above the [inaudible] gray

02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:40.930
and blue gray [inaudible].

02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:46.430
I have seen it over and over,
the same sea, the same slightly

02:55:46.430 --> 02:55:50.100
and differently swaying
above the stones,

02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:51.690
[inaudible] free above the stones.

02:55:51.690 --> 02:55:54.810 position:56%
Above the stones and then the world.

02:55:54.810 --> 02:55:58.730
If you should dip your hand in,
your wrist would ache immediately,

02:55:58.730 --> 02:56:01.840
your bones would begin to
ache, and your hand would burn

02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:06.350
as if the water were [inaudible]
of fire that feeds on stones

02:56:06.350 --> 02:56:09.650
and burns with a dark gray flame.

02:56:09.650 --> 02:56:13.780
If you tasted it, it would
first taste bitter, then briny,

02:56:13.780 --> 02:56:16.460
then surely burn your tongue.

02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:22.600 position:56%
It is like what we imagine knowledge
to be, dark, salt, clear, moving,

02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:27.160
utterly free, drawn from the cold
hard [inaudible] of the world.

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.010
Derived from the rocky
grasses forever.

02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:32.500
Flowing and drawn.

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:43.550
And since our knowledge is
historical, flowing and flowing.

02:56:45.090 --> 02:56:47.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: I have a number

02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:51.930
of things I wanted to
say about this piece.

02:56:51.930 --> 02:56:54.230
When I think about
the work in general,

02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:57.320
it seems Robert plays [inaudible]
filmmakers a tremendous challenge

02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:01.260
for people who are used to
working in television and film.

02:57:01.260 --> 02:57:09.620
The notion that the human
body, the human voice is a form

02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:15.650
of a human expression becomes
the instrument [inaudible]

02:57:15.650 --> 02:57:17.050
which poetry is [inaudible].

02:57:17.050 --> 02:57:22.970
It meant for us that [inaudible]
much of what [inaudible] in poetry,

02:57:22.970 --> 02:57:24.630
particularly in our
public television,

02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:27.420
because we would not
make the attempt

02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:30.880
to use visual medium
to interpret the poem.

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:37.620
But to let the human beings
speak for the poetry themselves,

02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:40.290
which meant that they
would be on camera

02:57:40.290 --> 02:57:46.040
at all times while the
poem was being read.

02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:50.760
Which is very contrary to
what most of us who work

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:53.070
in public television
are brought [inaudible].

02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:57.490
So the challenge for us is to
really try to look at engaging ways

02:57:57.490 --> 02:58:00.130
to make the poem come alive,

02:58:00.130 --> 02:58:06.530
to really use Robert's
notion [inaudible] television

02:58:06.530 --> 02:58:14.040
to rebuild this concept of
Robert's vision for this project.

02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:18.920
I think that one of the
instructions that I left

02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:24.420 position:56%
with the filmmakers was that, in
addition to the reading of the poem,

02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:26.080
we wanted to give a
sense of who they were,

02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:30.040
as well as a sense of place.

02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:49.210
And a sense of sense of place
in some cases meant geography,

02:58:49.210 --> 02:58:50.530
in some cases it meant [inaudible]
or other producer directors

02:58:50.530 --> 02:58:52.300
on the program looking for visual
codes that would give you insights

02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:53.920
to who that person was, or in
some cases using environment

02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:55.220
to convey something
about the poem itself.

02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:58.690
I have to confess, I was not
a poetry major, [laughter]

02:58:58.690 --> 02:58:59.990
and this is my first segment.

02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:05.550
I did seven segments as the
producer/director myself,

02:59:05.550 --> 02:59:10.730
and they were all based in Georgia.

02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:12.050
This was our first shoot
day and it illustrated all

02:59:12.050 --> 02:59:13.350
of the potential problems.

02:59:13.350 --> 02:59:15.010
First of all, I was
intimidated by this poem.

02:59:15.010 --> 02:59:19.110
There were three pages in front
of me that read to me more

02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:21.820
like a visual treatment
of the setting as opposed

02:59:23.270 --> 02:59:31.410
to what I was accustomed
to in terms of poetry.

02:59:31.410 --> 02:59:34.650
And I went like, gosh,
the first stanza is a page

02:59:34.650 --> 02:59:36.040
and a half, what do you do with it?

02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:38.880
Fortunately both Natasha and I
had the privilege [inaudible]

02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:49.470
who was the West-Coast based
producer and Nick [inaudible]

02:59:49.470 --> 02:59:53.480
who shot in New York State,

02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:55.320
and in Washington DC did not
have the privilege of doing,

02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:57.620
was to do site surveys previously
with each of the participants.

02:59:57.620 --> 02:59:58.920
Natasha got to do it
in Massachusetts

02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:06.010
and Connecticut [inaudible]
all at once, and made two trips

03:00:06.010 --> 03:00:08.350
to them [inaudible] and meeting
with people [inaudible] shooting.

03:00:08.350 --> 03:00:14.210 position:56%
But in meeting Alex Shir, I remember
reading his letter that talked

03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:20.750
about the notion of there being
a dark side into his life.

03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:26.840
And when I met him I think I took
him off guard and I asked him about

03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:28.780
and it and he was quite
revealing about what he meant

03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:30.080
about his dark side,
but I instinctively knew

03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:31.380
that he would not discuss
it ever again.

03:00:31.380 --> 03:00:39.220
We had asked him in a
pre-interview process --

03:00:39.220 --> 03:00:42.640
there was a pre-interview that we
did with each of potential readers

03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:46.690
to really gauge how they would
read the poem to find out more

03:00:46.690 --> 03:00:48.280
about them, so that we could
help plan how we wanted to deal

03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:49.580
with the visual treatment.

03:00:49.580 --> 03:00:52.620
Sort of figure out
what their stories were

03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:56.170
and how best we could
convey and bring them out,

03:00:56.170 --> 03:00:57.850
and each one individual
was just like each

03:00:57.850 --> 03:01:00.270
of these pieces is so individual.

03:01:00.270 --> 03:01:05.470
We worked to really use the medium
based on who the people were

03:01:05.470 --> 03:01:07.180
and what story they had to tell.

03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:11.410
It wasn't a formula that we
created to make this happen.

03:01:11.410 --> 03:01:16.180
But, Alex, in his pre-interview was
asked a question by the [inaudible]

03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:22.130
who did the interview, "Where
would you like to do this?

03:01:22.130 --> 03:01:23.430
Where do you see yourself
reading it?"

03:01:23.430 --> 03:01:25.680
And at first Alex thought, well,
maybe I should try to take a look

03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:28.920
at someplace [inaudible] mostly
[inaudible] describing it,

03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:36.570
which didn't quite make sense to
me, because here he was in Georgia,

03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:40.830
there was no Rocky
New England shore,

03:01:40.830 --> 03:01:42.200
there was no ocean, so
why would he do that.

03:01:42.200 --> 03:01:44.900 position:56%
So I spoke with him on the phone and
I said, you know, we're not looking

03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:51.580
for a imitation setting, but I'm
more interested in finding a place

03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:54.180
where you feel comfortable in,
and does that make sense to you.

03:01:54.180 --> 03:01:57.360
He says, you mean the
point of [inaudible]?

03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:58.660
Yes [laughter].

03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:05.170 position:56%
I have no clue exactly what he
thought, but the point of connection

03:02:05.170 --> 03:02:07.080
for him [inaudible] talked
to me about environment

03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:10.810
and how important environment
was to him.

03:02:10.810 --> 03:02:12.520
So the concept that I had was

03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:15.450
that I would [inaudible] visually
link what was important to him

03:02:15.450 --> 03:02:22.040
about his environment to
the kind of environment

03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:25.110
that Elizabeth Bishop was
describing [inaudible].

03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:28.730
But I still didn't
get the [inaudible].

03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:33.330 position:56%
And we drove two and a half hours
in Athens, and I'm reading the poem,

03:02:33.330 --> 03:02:37.510 position:56%
and I shared it with my crew people.

03:02:37.510 --> 03:02:41.920
By the way, [inaudible]
makes a film solo.

03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:50.040
I mean, it takes a lot of
work and a lot of people.

03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:58.350
We went [inaudible], camera
person, and [inaudible] takes care

03:02:58.350 --> 03:03:00.210
of [inaudible] microphone
[inaudible]

03:03:00.210 --> 03:03:05.040
and that's only the
beginning [inaudible].

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:08.660
But we get there and I take my crew
around and show them the location

03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:13.100
that [inaudible] has chosen and
why they were important to him.

03:03:13.100 --> 03:03:14.400
And we begin to do the interview.

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.050 position:56%
We had a lot of problems because the
sun was in the wrong in the place

03:03:18.050 --> 03:03:23.490
at the wrong time and we were
working with these mini TV cameras

03:03:23.490 --> 03:03:25.410
which were not broadcast standard,
but we wanted to [inaudible],

03:03:25.410 --> 03:03:30.720 position:56%
but we had [inaudible] to what
those cameras could and couldn't do,

03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:34.040
so lighting was extremely
important in this case.

03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:36.160
We start the interview
and [inaudible]

03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:40.370
at the very beginning during
the interview [inaudible]

03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:45.950
where we had the antenna
for the microphone

03:03:45.950 --> 03:03:49.040
and chewed the microphone
[laughter].

03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:52.100
So that was sort of the
beginning of the day

03:03:52.100 --> 03:03:55.950 position:56%
and [inaudible] opening is
actually Alex going back [inaudible]

03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:57.270
and felt very badly

03:03:57.270 --> 03:04:00.030
because he had [inaudible].

03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:07.540
I was actually trying
to [inaudible] back up.

03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:10.380
So that was how the day went.

03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:17.770
Then, you know, Alex
[inaudible] very quiet area,

03:04:17.770 --> 03:04:20.040
you know, [inaudible] very quiet.

03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:22.800
Well, he didn't realize
that, you know,

03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:26.040 position:56%
the sounds of the airplanes
[inaudible] small airport four miles

03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:30.710
away from him, and they were,
like, crop duster planes.

03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:36.980 position:56%
So we were getting sound, and I knew
that Mark was going to kill me --

03:04:36.980 --> 03:04:39.220 position:56%
where was Mark [laughter] -- because
we were [inaudible] recording

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:40.680
on [inaudible] separately.

03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:44.990
And [inaudible] missed the turn off
because I was [inaudible] figuring

03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:51.110
out the [inaudible], so I forgot to
tell [inaudible], finally made it.

03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:54.610
All of a sudden the
airplanes start going on.

03:04:54.610 --> 03:04:59.610
Across the road there is some
construction going on, hammering

03:04:59.610 --> 03:05:04.410
and buzz saws, and so we have
to stop taping and Alex goes

03:05:04.410 --> 03:05:06.790
and gives them the rest of our
scones that he had bought us

03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:08.570
for breakfast to appease
the [inaudible]

03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:12.900
so that they can be quiet for
a couple of hours [laughter].

03:05:12.900 --> 03:05:15.680
Then a bull gets stuck in the
middle of the road [laughter].

03:05:15.680 --> 03:05:17.610
Horns are honking,

03:05:17.610 --> 03:05:21.920
and [inaudible] stop, and
[inaudible] which I really began

03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:27.490
to understand once he started
to reading it, I finally got it.

03:05:27.490 --> 03:05:34.560
And, oh my gosh, Robert
is so right [laughter].

03:05:34.560 --> 03:05:40.570
But [inaudible] sort of envisioned,
you know, we don't want television

03:05:40.570 --> 03:05:44.820
who are used [inaudible] get
bored, you know, I'm still paranoid

03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:46.940
about this, and I've since
changed my whole attitude

03:05:46.940 --> 03:05:50.980
by the time I've gotten
through 50 of these now.

03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:54.950
But I had worked out in my head
scenes in the different locations

03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:57.690
that we would use, and the
scenes are there, but they're not

03:05:57.690 --> 03:05:59.010
in the way that I had
envisioned them in terms

03:05:59.010 --> 03:06:11.400
of where they would fall in
the placement of the poem,

03:06:11.400 --> 03:06:13.700
because so much happened.

03:06:15.790 --> 03:06:19.620
Every time we went to roll tape

03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:21.170
and shoot a particular scene
there would be some noise,

03:06:21.170 --> 03:06:23.190
the bulls were the absolute
worst because cars were honking.

03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:24.570
Finally somebody comes down
the gravel road and says,

03:06:24.570 --> 03:06:25.870
"Is this your bull in the road?"

03:06:25.870 --> 03:06:27.170 position:56%
And Alex has to go and
[inaudible], let me call my neighbor

03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:28.470
because it's [inaudible] day.

03:06:28.470 --> 03:06:29.770
Finally [inaudible].

03:06:29.770 --> 03:06:37.710
We got to [inaudible]
last page and a half.

03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:39.910
It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:52.870 position:56%
I had been trying in two locations
to do the whole [inaudible] through,

03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:54.670 position:56%
and it just didn't happen,
particularly with the very last part

03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:56.970
of the poem, [inaudible].

03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:02.080
And I knew that it was supposed
to be connected to [inaudible],

03:07:10.650 --> 03:07:12.060
very hard to figure out
since we couldn't connect it

03:07:12.060 --> 03:07:13.380
in the same scene because there
were either airplane noises

03:07:13.380 --> 03:07:15.970
or something going on, how to make
the two different scenes connect.

03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:29.140
So [inaudible] what I thought
was amazing audio transition

03:07:29.140 --> 03:07:34.430 position:56%
where there was sort of this overlap
of audio between the two locations.

03:07:34.430 --> 03:07:36.730 position:56%
And I [inaudible] feel it in my gut,

03:07:39.920 --> 03:07:40.720
but Robert thought it
was a mistake [laughter].

03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:42.020
So we had to get rid
of it [laughter].

03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:43.320
And when Robert [inaudible] the
poem really should [inaudible]

03:07:43.320 --> 03:07:45.620
in a different place.

03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:52.660
And [inaudible], you know, how to
make these cuts work and finally,

03:07:52.660 --> 03:07:53.960
after we did the best we could
[inaudible] the only way I'm going

03:07:53.960 --> 03:07:56.260
to

03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:00.790
convince Robert that we can't
do the scene any other way,

03:08:00.790 --> 03:08:02.090
[inaudible], why not.

03:08:02.090 --> 03:08:05.520
So what I want to share
with you is the one take

03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:12.370
that we did [inaudible] all the
way through [inaudible] mid-way

03:08:12.370 --> 03:08:14.670
and [inaudible] to get to the end.

03:08:16.200 --> 03:08:17.500
Again, it's [inaudible]
about 4 o'clock

03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:19.800
and we had maybe 20
takes of the poem.

03:08:25.250 --> 03:08:26.550
I'm still thinking of
Mark because I know

03:08:26.550 --> 03:08:27.850
that he wants [inaudible] location,

03:08:27.850 --> 03:08:29.150
[inaudible] so that the
audio will be consistent

03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:30.450 position:56%
and we're trying to get [inaudible].

03:08:30.450 --> 03:08:32.250
We're about halfway through.

03:08:32.250 --> 03:08:38.910
[ Noises ]

03:08:38.910 --> 03:08:42.510
&gt;&gt; -- moving [inaudible]
then he would disappear,

03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:47.060
then suddenly emerge, almost in the
same spot, with a sort of shrug,

03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:49.740
as if it were against
his better judgment.

03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:55.330
Cold, dark, deep and absolutely
clear, the clear, gray, icy water.

03:08:55.330 --> 03:08:59.560
Back behind us, the
dignified tall first begin.

first taste bitter, then briny,

then surely burn your tongue.

03:09:48.310 --> 03:09:50.720
It is like what we
imagined [inaudible].

03:09:50.720 --> 03:10:01.140
Dark, salt, clear, moving,
utterly free, drawn from the cold,

to [inaudible] forever,
flowing and drawn.

03:10:06.210 --> 03:10:14.510
And since our knowledge is
historical, flowing, and flowing.

03:10:32.850 --> 03:10:39.290
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: I think
we'll be able to open it

03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:44.050
up to a few questions [inaudible].

03:10:44.050 --> 03:10:46.350
&gt;&gt; I thought we should [inaudible].

03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:54.010
Well, first, I thought
we should do [inaudible],

03:10:54.010 --> 03:10:55.310
just because I thought it
was so fantastic how he kept

03:10:55.310 --> 03:10:56.610
on [inaudible] such [inaudible].

03:10:56.610 --> 03:11:02.880
And he reminded me a lot of
something that [inaudible] a story

03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:09.430
about [inaudible] and she
had just come to the point

03:11:09.430 --> 03:11:14.500
where she [inaudible] and she
figured out what she was going

03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:15.800 position:56%
to write, and she [inaudible] orange
juice all over the [inaudible]

03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:17.100
and she just wrote [inaudible].

03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:18.400
She thought she had that moment.

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:21.300
So, you know, [inaudible]
it reminded me

03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:26.550
of that kind of earnest
approach, so.

03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:29.510
But I think [inaudible] film, I
think we made the better choice.

03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:34.610
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: [Inaudible]

03:11:34.610 --> 03:11:36.740
after I saw this I remember being
there in that moment and saying,

03:11:36.740 --> 03:11:38.040
he's going to get through
this, he's going [inaudible].

03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:39.340
I'm not going to stop him.

03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:40.640
But actually looking at him,

03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:42.860
our cameraman didn't say anything
[inaudible] he normally would stop

03:11:42.860 --> 03:11:46.650
in a heartbeat to say, can
we stop and do another take.

03:11:46.650 --> 03:11:50.680
Everybody kept going [laughter].

03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:57.250
&gt;&gt; We'll open it up.

03:11:57.250 --> 03:11:58.900
If anybody has any questions,
not only about this piece,

03:11:58.900 --> 03:12:00.410
but about what you saw last night,

03:12:00.410 --> 03:12:05.710
or just for the production
team in general.

03:12:05.710 --> 03:12:08.430
&gt;&gt; How did you manage to get
everyone to be so [inaudible]?

03:12:08.430 --> 03:12:14.120
How did you manage to get
everyone to be so [inaudible]?

03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:17.940
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: I think
that there is a bonding process

03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:24.070
that happens between
producer/director and participant.

03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:31.470 position:56%
It's sort of one of the key elements
I think about [inaudible] filmmaking

03:12:31.470 --> 03:12:35.150
where the subject is
really critical.

03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:40.030 position:56%
Someone once used the term "cocoon",
that as a [inaudible] you try

03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:44.890
to really get inside what
that person is thinking,

03:12:44.890 --> 03:12:48.170
let them get to know you,

03:12:48.170 --> 03:12:51.640
and you them until [inaudible]
are comfortable with you,

03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:52.940
and it works in many ways.

03:12:52.940 --> 03:12:54.360
I mean, you don't -- I
mean, a lot of people think

03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:56.420
about asking questions and
you write down the questions

03:12:56.420 --> 03:12:57.720
that you're going to ask.

03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:00.010
It doesn't work that
way when you do that.

03:13:00.010 --> 03:13:04.430
You really have to have a
conversation with people.

03:13:04.430 --> 03:13:06.380
I found that's work
best for me, certainly.

03:13:06.380 --> 03:13:11.090
But I think part of the task
is getting them to forget

03:13:11.090 --> 03:13:15.300
that the cameras there,
which is really hard to do

03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:16.600
when people are saying,
[inaudible], you know,

03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:17.900
this didn't quite work out.

03:13:17.900 --> 03:13:19.470
And, I mean, you're there and
you're paying attention to them

03:13:19.470 --> 03:13:27.570
and you're paying attention to
what your camera person is doing,

03:13:30.460 --> 03:13:31.760
what your sound person is doing.

03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:33.060
Some people are notorious for
letting me know when [inaudible],

03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:34.360
at least the really good ones are.

03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:35.660
And you're in the moment.

03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:37.980
I had a case where I
was really in a moment

03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:45.170 position:56%
and my subject [inaudible] this very
powerful story, was almost in tears,

03:13:45.170 --> 03:13:46.950
and my sound man said, [inaudible],
and it broke the moment.

03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:48.250
So you have to really
try to rebuild it.

03:13:48.250 --> 03:13:52.620 position:56%
But I think -- I mean, what was so
special about this is because we got

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:55.040
to meet so many wonderful people.

03:13:55.040 --> 03:13:56.700
And last night when Mike
[inaudible] was here,

03:13:56.700 --> 03:14:05.370
who did the [inaudible] poem, I
mean, the first thing he says,

03:14:05.370 --> 03:14:06.670
"Well, where's David?"

03:14:06.670 --> 03:14:12.180
I mean, he and David [inaudible]
is here today and David wrote --

03:14:12.180 --> 03:14:15.860
[inaudible] maybe you can respond.

03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:22.830
&gt;&gt; Well, it got [inaudible] and
David talked to me a few times

03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:25.130
on the phone [inaudible].

03:14:40.980 --> 03:14:42.510
The first time that I was supposed
to read, I had a terrible flu

03:14:42.510 --> 03:14:43.810
and there was no way
[inaudible], so he --

03:14:43.810 --> 03:14:45.110
I don't know, I haven't
seen the piece,

03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:47.410
I don't know how it came out, but I

03:15:01.820 --> 03:15:03.320
think he did a superb job
because he had very limited time,

03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:04.620
he had no chance to see
where we could do the poem,

03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:05.920
and I had trouble finding a place.

03:15:05.920 --> 03:15:07.220
And so we wound up doing
it in my office downstairs,

03:15:07.220 --> 03:15:08.600
which is a horrendous mess because
I had just moved to that office,

03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:10.130
so there was piles of stuff
everywhere, and I was embarrassed.

03:15:10.130 --> 03:15:11.930
He said, no, no, no,
[inaudible] actually work.

03:15:11.930 --> 03:15:16.050
[ Laughter ]

03:15:16.050 --> 03:15:20.090 position:56%
And he put me very much at ease and
whether he meant it or not he seemed

03:15:20.090 --> 03:15:48.260
to relate very much to the poem
and I think that he was inspired

03:15:48.260 --> 03:15:49.560
by the poems that [inaudible].

03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:50.860
It was a very [inaudible]
experience for me.

03:15:50.860 --> 03:15:52.660
I don't know [inaudible].

03:15:52.660 --> 03:16:05.200
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:10.740
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that you were
concerned about pasting or editing

03:16:10.740 --> 03:16:14.230
with this so it wouldn't get boring
and I was just going to ask you,

03:16:14.230 --> 03:16:16.040
you and the sound and
actually everybody

03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:22.090
if there was anything that you
discovered or realized or changed

03:16:22.090 --> 03:16:24.550
about how your thinking
because you were doing poetry

03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:25.850
as you went into it.

03:16:25.850 --> 03:16:29.890
But is what was your thought
process about, what was unique

03:16:29.890 --> 03:16:33.720
about doing this poetry versus,
other things that you've done

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:38.140
in any dimension of
production, if any?

03:16:39.290 --> 03:16:42.380
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] could you maybe
repeat the question [inaudible].

03:16:42.380 --> 03:16:44.960
&gt;&gt; The question I wanted
to eloquently state.

03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:51.690
&gt;&gt; You stated that it's all very
eloquently I think the short part

03:16:51.690 --> 03:16:56.590
was there was something in the
process that was different for us

03:16:56.590 --> 03:17:02.230
because we were doing
poetry [inaudible].

03:17:02.230 --> 03:17:06.560
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: Okay, well,
I edited many of the pieces

03:17:06.560 --> 03:17:14.050 position:56%
so in terms of pacing that's where
a lot of things happened [inaudible]

03:17:14.050 --> 03:17:16.940
and I think one of the
things that happened for us

03:17:16.940 --> 03:17:21.840
in the edit [inaudible] of the is
an appreciation, for the rhythms

03:17:21.840 --> 03:17:24.380
of the poem and kind of
leaving them be still.

03:17:26.610 --> 03:17:30.830
But is that different from
other forums that in terms

03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:36.000
of a documentary filmmaker, I do
not think so actually because one

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.970
of the things that especially
in editing, that we try so hard

03:17:40.970 --> 03:17:43.560
to do is kind of maintaining
integrity the person that's given

03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:46.870 position:56%
their time to be a part of the film.

03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:51.620
And then that's not always so
evident in some of the films

03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:55.640
that you may have seen, but
it is part of the process

03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:58.040
when you're editing you're
actually really dropping things

03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:02.910
that people said, gestures,

03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:05.480
and you're highlighting
others or, you know,

03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:09.940
I would maybe on first chance I
would have [inaudible] the dogs.

03:18:09.940 --> 03:18:17.510 position:56%
But that wasn't necessarily disciple
to the poem, poet Alex, or the dogs.

03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:20.190
[ Laughter ]

03:18:20.190 --> 03:18:24.660 position:56%
But -- so these are the choices that
we had to make and I don't think

03:18:24.660 --> 03:18:27.020
that they are particular to poetry.

03:18:27.020 --> 03:18:28.860
The thing that I did feel

03:18:28.860 --> 03:18:34.680
in the process is really what
Robert set out to do, came true.

03:18:34.680 --> 03:18:38.680
In the sense that, as we were
cutting these pieces together there

03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:41.300
were many poems that
I had no relation to,

03:18:41.300 --> 03:18:45.300
you know I just really
wasn't attracted to.

03:18:45.300 --> 03:18:49.290
But when you match these
poems and these poets again

03:18:49.290 --> 03:18:52.990
through these people
they really had meaning

03:18:52.990 --> 03:18:57.250
that perhaps they didn't
have before at first.

03:18:57.250 --> 03:19:04.470
And I thought that the
reading and the creation

03:19:04.470 --> 03:19:09.980
of this poem being theirs was
really a practice and that really

03:19:09.980 --> 03:19:14.950
in the end I feel like this
is a very strong format

03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:20.550
for understanding poetry
personally and I really enjoyed it,

03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:29.090
and loved most of the poems
that we worked on in the end.

03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:32.040 position:56%
And [inaudible] say that [laughter].

03:19:32.040 --> 03:19:35.040
&gt;&gt; Could you talk about
the collection

03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:39.850
because you got these letters
right and you read them

03:19:39.850 --> 03:19:45.570
and decided which one [inaudible].

03:19:47.530 --> 03:19:52.320
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson:
I'll quote Robert.

03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:55.470
Always the governing
principle [inaudible] selection

03:19:55.470 --> 03:20:00.070
for both narrowing
the18,000 letters we received

03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:05.650
down to what became the 200
poems and 360 letters in the book

03:20:05.650 --> 03:20:12.710
and then these 50 first videos
was that the main criterion

03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:18.170
for selection is the relationship
between the person and the poem.

03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:24.800
&gt;&gt; So that the thing that we were
trying to capture and perpetuate

03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:28.730
by creating this archive was the
unique or particular relationships

03:20:28.730 --> 03:20:31.350
between Americans and
very particular poems

03:20:31.350 --> 03:20:35.560
that had become part of what
they go through their lives with.

03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:39.900
But one of the things that
is actually interesting to me

03:20:39.900 --> 03:20:43.020
about the video is that it
changes the scope that [inaudible]

03:20:43.020 --> 03:20:49.550
with these video pieces is
quite unlike reading the letters

03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:51.770
and the accompanying
poem for example

03:20:51.770 --> 03:20:53.070
as they are explained in the book.

03:20:53.070 --> 03:20:59.250
It does emphasize more the
personal elements, the people

03:20:59.250 --> 03:21:02.490
and their stories and how
that relates to the poem

03:21:02.490 --> 03:21:08.060
and that's what makes them
dramatic, that's what makes it TV.

03:21:08.060 --> 03:21:13.170
But I was also very pleased to
feel that that was successful

03:21:13.170 --> 03:21:17.970
and it's slightly different
from the original idea.

03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:30.080
&gt;&gt; A two-part question, ballpark
estimate what's the ratio

03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:32.530
of qualitative footage to
finished product [inaudible]?

03:21:32.530 --> 03:21:38.030
And the second half of the question

03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:42.530
for the most part were the outtakes
removed because of dog problems,

03:21:42.530 --> 03:21:45.350
[inaudible] in the middle of
the [inaudible], carpenters

03:21:45.350 --> 03:21:50.830
or because something wasn't
working, or something not going

03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:54.190
where you wanted it
to in the shoot itself

03:21:54.190 --> 03:21:57.240
without external interruption?

03:21:57.240 --> 03:21:59.610
&gt;&gt; Juanita Anderson: No generally
there were I mean there were cases

03:21:59.610 --> 03:22:03.770
where again, [inaudible] element
to so we often would start

03:22:03.770 --> 03:22:10.250
in the middle of the take
because of something [inaudible].

03:22:10.250 --> 03:22:13.210
Any barrier [inaudible]
the first thing you do

03:22:13.210 --> 03:22:18.330
when you're shooting indoors in
someone's home is you ask them

03:22:18.330 --> 03:22:20.000
to turn off their refrigerator,

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:23.430
which [inaudible] very
[inaudible] thing to ask someone.

03:22:23.430 --> 03:22:28.300
But it's something that if we were
in our home don't pay attention to

03:22:28.300 --> 03:22:31.920
but on a shoot when there are
refrigerator noise in the kitchen,

03:22:31.920 --> 03:22:36.420 position:56%
or when the heat or air conditioning
[inaudible] it's very noticeable

03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:39.310
with the microphones.

03:22:39.310 --> 03:22:43.580
So yet it's often [inaudible]
I asked each of the producers

03:22:43.580 --> 03:22:47.550
to limit the tapes that
they shot to an hour.

03:22:47.550 --> 03:22:51.900 position:56%
Most of them limited it to somewhere
between an hour and an hour

03:22:51.900 --> 03:22:54.830
and a half, more like
on the latter range.

03:22:54.830 --> 03:23:02.090
But there [laughter] but there was
reasons and one of the things just

03:23:02.090 --> 03:23:06.580
in the whole process of
[inaudible] think about it,

03:23:06.580 --> 03:23:11.600
when people are talking
about their lives

03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:15.470 position:56%
and they are talking [inaudible] who
they are is to really try to work

03:23:15.470 --> 03:23:18.300 position:56%
to make stories concise as possible.

03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:21.030 position:56%
So there is lots of usable material,

03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:26.840
but it's really finding the most
concise way of telling that story

03:23:26.840 --> 03:23:29.010
and [inaudible] can
certainly attest to I came

03:23:29.010 --> 03:23:32.250
into the editing [inaudible] and
saying oh my gosh I've narrowed it

03:23:32.250 --> 03:23:38.130
down to half an hour
now [laughter], help!

03:23:38.130 --> 03:23:44.310
But to be honest though [inaudible]
a number of the producers

03:23:44.310 --> 03:23:48.650
and I think it depended upon
the person and that they were,

03:23:48.650 --> 03:23:52.900
who the reader was, as well
as the poem itself to try

03:23:52.900 --> 03:23:55.970
to use different angles or
different vocal [inaudible].

03:23:55.970 --> 03:23:59.440
So we often found ourselves
[inaudible] asking the reader

03:23:59.440 --> 03:24:04.150
to read the poem ten times
maybe, seven or eight times.

03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:08.430
So that we could record it
at different perspectives,

03:24:08.430 --> 03:24:11.240
different vocal [inaudible],
different angles so there would be

03:24:11.240 --> 03:24:15.730
that option of how it would
be cut into final segment.

03:24:15.730 --> 03:24:19.510
So it wasn't so much the
material wasn't usable it was more

03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:26.510 position:56%
about the choices that were actually
made both visually, as well as --

03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:32.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:36.100
&gt;&gt; Sure. The amazing thing for me
working on this project was to get

03:24:36.100 --> 03:24:40.840
to know the sound patterns of
50 peoples' voices because apart

03:24:40.840 --> 03:24:44.090
from the fact that
I worked with David

03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:48.620
on actually holding the
boom mic and recording

03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:53.470
on location twice I've never
seen any of these people.

03:24:53.470 --> 03:24:55.830
The way that if you didn't
already understand it

03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:58.630
from Juanita's introduction,
the way it worked with regards

03:24:58.630 --> 03:25:03.640
to creating pieces which hopefully
are going to be played on the web,

03:25:03.640 --> 03:25:08.040
or played through the radio,
or available on cassette,

03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:13.290
was that I would take
the complete recording,

03:25:13.290 --> 03:25:16.910
including the outtakes
from the filmmakers.

03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:21.080
And I would listen to them and
then I would try and make a piece

03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:25.060
of about between five
and six minutes long.

03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:29.430
Getting exactly the same spirit
of that the filmmakers have got

03:25:29.430 --> 03:25:36.240
in basically quite a different way
because obviously I was just going

03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:39.910
to use sound and I had to
get right to the relationship

03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:43.760
between the reader and the poem.

03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:49.730
So my process was to basically, for
those of you who are not familiar

03:25:49.730 --> 03:25:53.600
with any aspect of
digital sound editing.

03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:59.240
What you do is you take a dap
tape that a filmmaker gives you,

03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:02.050
you put it through a
mixer and then you're able

03:26:02.050 --> 03:26:06.030
to sample different tracks
from all that's recording

03:26:06.030 --> 03:26:08.840
and the track basically
yes you can listen to it,

03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:11.490
but primarily what comes
out is, something that looks

03:26:11.490 --> 03:26:15.990
like a cardiogram just a
very beautiful representation

03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:21.750 position:56%
of the movement of somebody's voice.

03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:27.760
And the fascinating thing is
that it goes both north and south

03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:29.810
so you have a sense
in which the voice,

03:26:29.810 --> 03:26:31.390
the pattern of the
voice is being reflected

03:26:31.390 --> 03:26:36.330
as like a tree would be
reflected in a pond or a river.

03:26:36.330 --> 03:26:40.900
So for me I was involved in looking

03:26:40.900 --> 03:26:45.260
at this visual representation
knowing what part

03:26:45.260 --> 03:26:49.610
of the poem it represented
and then looking

03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:57.630 position:56%
to see how concentrated I could
make the recording not with any kind

03:26:57.630 --> 03:27:02.080
of visual reference, not with
knowing that there is no way

03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:05.380
that anybody is going to understand

03:27:05.380 --> 03:27:09.430
from any visual image
what this person is like.

03:27:09.430 --> 03:27:12.700
So my process was I had
the privilege of being able

03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:19.150
to over you know overhear all of
these takes and in fact I was able

03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:22.640
to use material that the
filmmakers weren't able to use

03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:26.390
because the tape was
spoiled or altered

03:27:26.390 --> 03:27:27.920
because the visual
thing didn't work,

03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:32.910
but in terms of the actual
expression it worked fantastically.

03:27:32.910 --> 03:27:36.710
So far as many times as
there are beautiful moments

03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:39.820
where the person doing
sound on location said,

03:27:39.820 --> 03:27:41.120
"You know you can't tape

03:27:41.120 --> 03:27:43.340
that because it's got too
much background noise,"

03:27:43.340 --> 03:27:48.300
there are also many moments
which are only captured hourly

03:27:48.300 --> 03:27:50.960
and wouldn't appear visually.

03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:54.310
So I think that's part
of the justification

03:27:54.310 --> 03:27:57.510
for having these two different
directions to the project.

Mark, you wanted to add something.

03:37:25.090 --> 03:37:28.250
&gt;&gt; Just that one of the
fantastic things about working

03:37:28.250 --> 03:37:33.310
on this project was the whole
question of this context,

03:37:33.310 --> 03:37:35.230
of how it would be received.

03:37:35.230 --> 03:37:40.010
What is the -- how
do you really relate

03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:43.230
to this person's relationship
to the poem?

03:37:43.230 --> 03:37:47.150
And the fascinating thing to
me is that the filmmakers,

03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:49.230
just because of the medium
that they're working in,

03:37:49.230 --> 03:37:51.730
have to give some kind of context.

03:37:51.730 --> 03:37:55.110
They can't -- I mean, [inaudible]
Rodney reading last night's very

03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:57.810
interesting because it
worked fantastically largely

03:37:57.810 --> 03:37:59.690
because he was completely in black

03:37:59.690 --> 03:38:02.760
and that all you see is
some photographs which,

03:38:02.760 --> 03:38:05.320
if he hadn't identified
himself as a photographer,

03:38:05.320 --> 03:38:09.370
you never would have known
that they are his work.

03:38:09.370 --> 03:38:12.500
And it still works fantastically.

03:38:12.500 --> 03:38:15.400
You could do all of them that way.

03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.610
But it wouldn't function
as a whole project.

03:38:19.610 --> 03:38:24.820
So the filmmakers almost
have an impediment in --

03:38:24.820 --> 03:38:28.530
like looking for a
context because the heart

03:38:28.530 --> 03:38:33.060 position:56%
of the project is something in which
you have to throw the context away.

03:38:33.060 --> 03:38:35.260
What's so moving about this is

03:38:35.260 --> 03:38:39.980
that what the person reading
the poem reveals is that they --

03:38:39.980 --> 03:38:43.070
yes, it's true -- physically
are reading the poem.

03:38:43.070 --> 03:38:48.930
But, actually, the poem is speaking
them, and that is really what is

03:38:48.930 --> 03:38:55.550 position:56%
so extraordinary about this project,
and why it's so wise in a sense not

03:38:55.550 --> 03:39:00.500
to have famous people
read their poems.

03:39:00.500 --> 03:39:02.790
Mr. Kunitz [assumed spelling]
does a fantastic reading,

03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:05.440
and we all learn something
about the origin

03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:07.790
and meaning of poetry in his life.

03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:14.650
What you see when you listen and
when you watch the videos of people

03:39:14.650 --> 03:39:19.340
who you don't know is you
find something out about them

03:39:19.340 --> 03:39:21.350
which you could never have known,

03:39:21.350 --> 03:39:24.170
and which they never would
have told you unless they had

03:39:24.170 --> 03:39:25.470
that poem to read.

03:39:25.470 --> 03:39:26.890

very brave of them.

bare, and it's not only them.

in this, and for our readers

03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:48.860
to be willing to allow us
to come into their lives

and interrupt their lives and
rebuild so much of who they are,

I mean, she's a producer in her
own right and agreed to come

03:40:09.890 --> 03:40:13.560
on this project to [inaudible] to
make sure that our structure was

03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:15.350
in place because of
all the [inaudible]

who actually lived

03:40:21.570 --> 03:40:24.160

to be in Barbados.

03:40:24.160 --> 03:40:29.430

in pre-interview, "Where would you

like to be taped," he
said, "Oh, Barbados."

03:40:34.050 --> 03:40:37.680
But we realized that from the
standpoint of a production schedule

03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:40.750
that we were dealing with it
was the logical place to do it.

not have Barbados money.

that was the intention after
speaking with Reuben Haines briefly,

03:41:34.400 --> 03:41:39.450
the intent was to have him walking
the beach, to have him, you know,

03:41:39.450 --> 03:41:42.980
sitting at the beach reading books
and sort of reflecting and talking

about the significance
of his poem in his life.

03:41:46.260 --> 03:41:52.550

that it seemed quite simple was

well, he got better.

"Well, we'll go to Barbados

03:42:24.060 --> 03:42:25.360
and we'll tape it there."

03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:28.400

bit of him preaching.

it as an 11-year-old.

on the threshold of

My parents were -- half
were Caribbean immigrants

from the Island of Barbados.

03:43:42.980 --> 03:43:47.010
The Great Depression brought
difficult times in our family,

exposed us to public

and a lot of other things.

03:43:53.630 --> 03:44:01.330
My father had hopes of gold in
America so he became depressed

and became part of oppression of
racism and all the other things

03:44:04.840 --> 03:44:10.470
that could impose itself upon a man
of color at that time in history.

03:44:10.470 --> 03:44:15.050
So I grew up poor, but I grew up
seeking for some faith and hope.

teacher kept quoting verses

to be a hero in the strife."

didn't understand all

learned it and it stayed in my mind.

Later on feeling called
to the Christian ministry

03:44:39.600 --> 03:44:43.350
as a theological student "The
Psalm of Life" began to take

03:44:43.350 --> 03:44:46.970
on real meaning for me in my
own personal struggles in life,

upon my childhood, you know,

Oftentimes West Indian immigrants
with their foreign accents

03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:06.670
and their foreign ways were
so stereotyped and ridiculed

don't think that Iowa some

about having parents who had come

03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:17.800
from a foreign land and
spoke a foreign accent

03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:21.110
and oftentimes might have
been called monkey-chasers

03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:25.290
or banana-eaters or all these sort
of negative stereotypical things.

03:45:25.290 --> 03:45:29.340
My mother was about
19 when she left.

03:45:29.340 --> 03:45:32.940
I'm happy she reached
her 65th birthday.

03:45:32.940 --> 03:45:36.960
She stated that she wanted to visit
her home one time before she died,

03:45:36.960 --> 03:45:38.920
and someone had to
take her to Barbados.

03:45:38.920 --> 03:45:42.510
So then I ended up
being that person.

03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:51.110
[ Music ]

03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:55.550
To come to this hill called Mount
Tabor and to see this church

03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:57.620
that my father sung
in the choir here.

03:45:57.620 --> 03:45:59.950
He was tenor soloist.

03:45:59.950 --> 03:46:02.220
My mother was very
active in this church.

03:46:02.220 --> 03:46:04.180
And I developed a new interest

03:46:04.180 --> 03:46:07.390
and a new pridein what
Barbados represented in terms

03:46:07.390 --> 03:46:10.150
of its independence, in
terms of its culture,

03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:13.140
in terms of its religious faith.

03:46:13.140 --> 03:46:17.640
He became very proud to be, as
they say here, of being some --

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:46:21.090 --> 03:46:25.230
Coming to this place just makes
me think of all of the names

03:46:25.230 --> 03:46:29.480
that are tied in with my family.

03:46:29.480 --> 03:46:36.090
My grandmother was a Basque
[inaudible] when she married Payne.

03:46:36.090 --> 03:46:39.800
My father's family were
Haines's, Nichols and Howards.

03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:42.650
So they were all in here.

03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:47.390
"Life is real; life is earnest;
and the grave is not its goal.

03:46:47.390 --> 03:46:51.130
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
was not spoken of the soul."

03:46:51.130 --> 03:46:54.740 position:56%
And this is the real significance of
what Christian faith is all about.

03:46:54.740 --> 03:46:58.880
It gives you a hope that goes
beyond the grave for the essence

03:46:58.880 --> 03:47:02.200
of who you are, that the
soul can live eternally,

03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:06.510
you know, in a better existence.

03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:08.590
And if you didn't have
that whole life become sort

03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:11.570
of a dead-end street and it becomes
futile and you have the right to go

03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:15.200
to the cemetery and
cry and give her hope.

03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:19.440
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
"Psalm of Life."

03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:26.390
"Tell me not in mournful numbers,
life is but an empty dream.

03:47:26.390 --> 03:47:32.020
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
and things are not what they seem.

03:47:32.020 --> 03:47:33.680
Life is real.

03:47:33.680 --> 03:47:35.630
Life is earnest.

03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:41.260
And the grave is not its goal;
dust thou art, to dust returnest,

03:47:41.260 --> 03:47:43.980
was not spoken of the soul.

03:47:43.980 --> 03:47:50.950
Not enjoyment and not sorrow is our
destined end or way; but to act,

03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:54.850
that each tomorrow find
us further than today.

03:47:54.850 --> 03:48:01.120
Art is long, and time is fleeting,
and our hearts, though stout

03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:05.460
and brave, still, like
muffled drums,

03:48:05.460 --> 03:48:08.100
are beating funeral
marches to the grave.

03:48:08.100 --> 03:48:14.120
In the world's broad field of
battle, in the bivouac of life,

03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:16.750
be not like dumb, driven cattle.

03:48:16.750 --> 03:48:19.000
Be a hero in the strife.

03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:22.000
Trust no future, however pleasant.

03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:25.190
Let the dead past bury its dead.

Act, act in the living present.

Heart within, and God overhead.

03:48:31.900 --> 03:48:37.900
Lives of great men all remind us
we can make our lives sublime.

03:48:37.900 --> 03:48:43.870
And, departing, leave behind us
footprints on the sands of time.

03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:49.250
Footprints that perhaps another
sailing over life's solemn main,

03:48:49.250 --> 03:48:55.030
a forlorn and a shipwrecked brother
seeing, shall take heart again.

03:48:55.030 --> 03:49:00.500
Let us, then, be up and doing,
with a heart for any fate;

about Barbara, is I've never been

in a screening in my life
when someone has gotten

03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:21.510
up after watching a few
films and goes, "Yes."

[ Laughter ]

03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:25.850

thank you all.

03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:35.140
We will reconvene in about 10
minutes for the next session.

03:50:35.140 --> 03:50:36.900
Thank you, Robert, Juanita, Maggie.

03:50:36.900 --> 03:50:39.240
It was terrific.

03:50:39.240 --> 03:50:44.280
Their form of outreach if you will
with poetry -- actually, I had a --

03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:48.100 position:56%
I was thinking during that wonderful
film presentation a little bit

03:50:48.100 --> 03:50:52.010
about how we are talking
about using all media.

03:50:52.010 --> 03:50:55.300
This morning one of our earliest
questions had to do with television

03:50:55.300 --> 03:51:01.180
and use of other media in promoting
poetry or in promoting books,

03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:02.950
reading, and the written word.

03:51:02.950 --> 03:51:07.020
And I feel, in part,
we've now covered --

03:51:07.020 --> 03:51:09.510
we are answering our own
question a little bit

03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:14.010
by demonstrating the power of film
with the demonstration for some

03:51:14.010 --> 03:51:15.850
of you who had not seen
the films last night.

03:51:15.850 --> 03:51:20.290
We are going to continue
to talk about other media.

03:51:20.290 --> 03:51:23.760
We had a good discussion this
morning about radio as well.

03:51:23.760 --> 03:51:26.010
But now, if we're going to
concentrate a little bit

03:51:26.010 --> 03:51:30.670
on the print media and
publishing and talk about poetry,

03:51:30.670 --> 03:51:34.420
which is what, of course, brings
us all together, and the publishing

03:51:34.420 --> 03:51:39.290
of poetry and how it has
changed in recent times as well

03:51:39.290 --> 03:51:41.490
as a little bit through history.

03:51:41.490 --> 03:51:45.680
And for that discussion we have
added a panelist who is nice enough

03:51:45.680 --> 03:51:51.520 position:56%
to come up, take time -- Jack
Shoemaker, who is from Counterpoint,

03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:55.340
the book publisher, and Jack has
agreed to add his perspective

03:51:55.340 --> 03:52:00.260
to our discussion of
poets and publishing.

03:52:00.260 --> 03:52:03.520
But what I would like
to do, again, is to,

03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:07.130
rather than introducing everyone,
to refer you to your programs

03:52:07.130 --> 03:52:09.160
and we will go through
with brief statements

03:52:09.160 --> 03:52:11.240
from each of our panelists.

03:52:11.240 --> 03:52:14.410
Then we will ask the panelists
to add anything they would

03:52:14.410 --> 03:52:16.200
like after hearing the others.

03:52:16.200 --> 03:52:20.300
And then we will open it up to
hear one more time from you.

03:52:20.300 --> 03:52:25.540
So we would like to start with Bob
Boyers who, I learned from talking

03:52:25.540 --> 03:52:31.300 position:56%
to Bob on the phone, is indeed the
Founding Editor of Salmagundi and --

03:52:31.300 --> 03:52:33.620
the well-known poetry journal --

03:52:33.620 --> 03:52:37.640
and also has been involved in
poetry institutes and I would

03:52:37.640 --> 03:52:40.180
like to turn it over to
Bob for his statement.

03:52:40.180 --> 03:52:42.480
Bob.

03:52:52.210 --> 03:52:55.780
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: I begin
by noting just that contrary

03:52:55.780 --> 03:52:58.540 position:56%
to what's indicated in the
program, I'm not actually the Editor

03:52:58.540 --> 03:53:01.640
of a poetry journal exclusively,
but of a generalist magazine

03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:03.700
that publishes lots of poetry.

03:53:03.700 --> 03:53:06.960
It's a small distinction but it may
be an important one given what I

03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:08.420
have to say.

03:53:08.420 --> 03:53:12.360
My little talk comes in
two very brief parts.

03:53:12.360 --> 03:53:17.210
The first one devoted to
poetry in periodicals,

03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:20.550
the subject I suppose I
know best, and the second

03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:25.000
to other questions recommended
by Mr. Cole for this meeting.

03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:31.090 position:56%
It's indisputable that most
literary magazines exist principally

03:53:31.090 --> 03:53:33.840
for those whose work they publish.

03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:38.830
Very few of the tens of thousands
of poets who send out their work

03:53:38.830 --> 03:53:41.870
to "AGNI, or "The Sutton
Review," or "Grand Street,"

03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:45.530
or my own "Salmagundi" support
those magazines by taking

03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:47.540
out subscriptions or, in fact,

03:53:47.540 --> 03:53:52.300
most of the time reading
those venerable periodicals.

03:53:52.300 --> 03:53:56.500
In fact, poets are as little
inclined to buy literary magazines

03:53:56.500 --> 03:53:58.940
as the species once
commonly referred

03:53:58.940 --> 03:54:01.420
to as the general literate reader.

03:54:01.420 --> 03:54:06.110
At a time when those of us with
a stake in poetry have more

03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:10.520
than a little to be thankful for,
when our Poet Laureate has stirred

03:54:10.520 --> 03:54:12.810
or renewed the interests
and the sentiments

03:54:12.810 --> 03:54:16.510
of a great many people not
apparently susceptible to

03:54:16.510 --> 03:54:20.940
or thoughtful about poetry,
when throngs sometimes turn

03:54:20.940 --> 03:54:25.950 position:56%
out for a public reading by Frank
Bidart or Rita Dove or Louise Gluck,

03:54:25.950 --> 03:54:29.860
or Carolyn Forche, the
situation of poetry is,

03:54:29.860 --> 03:54:32.160
let's call it complicated.

03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:37.160
A survey of the better-known
magazines devoting substantial

03:54:37.160 --> 03:54:40.460
attention to poetry
reveals the following.

03:54:40.460 --> 03:54:42.760
I have a little list.

03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:45.940
One, they continue to have

03:54:45.940 --> 03:54:51.580
and to hold relatively few
long-term poet readers.

03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:55.510
Two, they receive greater
and greater volumes

03:54:55.510 --> 03:55:00.580
of unsolicited manuscript
material, mostly poetry,

03:55:00.580 --> 03:55:06.030
and mostly by poets not previously
published in their pages or likely

03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:09.260
to read around in them
unless they expect to be

03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:12.650
or to find their own
work published there.

03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:18.140
Three, they have tended in recent
years to reduce the reading period

03:55:18.140 --> 03:55:23.010
in which they consider
manuscripts from 10 or 12 months

03:55:23.010 --> 03:55:26.330
to at most six months each year.

03:55:26.330 --> 03:55:32.410
Four, many editors routinely place
a moratorium on the consideration

03:55:32.410 --> 03:55:38.470
of unsolicited manuscript material
as the Kenyon Review did last fall

03:55:38.470 --> 03:55:41.050
and so I've been told as AGNI

03:55:41.050 --> 03:55:44.100
and the Missouri Review
have lately done.

03:55:44.100 --> 03:55:49.830
Magazines like <i>Raritan </i>publish
work by solicitation only,

03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:51.970
and this would seem
to be the direction

03:55:51.970 --> 03:55:54.870
in which many magazine will go.

03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:59.600
Five, many magazines, my own
included, which publish lots

03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:02.710
of poetry and devote
space in each issue

03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:09.250 position:56%
to younger poets also devote a large
proportion of their space to writers

03:56:09.250 --> 03:56:14.240
who have published with them
before so that even very fine work

03:56:14.240 --> 03:56:18.380
by potential new contributors
will usually be rejected

03:56:18.380 --> 03:56:20.570
for lack of space.

03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:27.740
Six, most poets report that often
their manuscript submissions are

03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:31.790
never responded to either
by national magazines

03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:36.630
like the <i>New Yorker </i>or by many
of the smaller literary quarterlies

03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:43.010
which routinely lose or otherwise
lose track of manuscripts.

03:56:43.010 --> 03:56:46.840
The reporting time for most
magazines is between four

03:56:46.840 --> 03:56:50.010
and eight months with
some not likely

03:56:50.010 --> 03:56:53.480
to respond even within a year.

03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:56.780
Seven, very few magazines are able

03:56:56.780 --> 03:57:01.950
to offer a grown-up editorial
assessment to manuscripts,

03:57:01.950 --> 03:57:05.630
many of them relying
on unpaid student help,

03:57:05.630 --> 03:57:09.670
sometimes on the graduate
students' help to give a first,

03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:13.660 position:56%
usually final, reading to new poems.

03:57:13.660 --> 03:57:17.980
Rejection slips typically
come in one kind only,

03:57:17.980 --> 03:57:24.010
the thanks-but-no-thanks kind
and spare-me-the-explanation.

03:57:24.010 --> 03:57:29.480
Eight, younger or newer
poets are right to complain

03:57:29.480 --> 03:57:36.330
that the situation often seems
intolerable and editors overwhelmed

03:57:36.330 --> 03:57:40.970
by the inexorable tide of
manuscripts coming in each week --

03:57:40.970 --> 03:57:46.130
we get more than 5000 unsolicited
manuscripts a year at Salmagundi.

03:57:46.130 --> 03:57:48.870
We're not the <i>New Yorker.</i>

03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:52.410
-- are right to respond
that they are mostly doing

03:57:52.410 --> 03:57:54.570
as well as they can.

03:57:54.570 --> 03:57:59.220
Most editors, in fact, have
accepted the fact that a good deal

03:57:59.220 --> 03:58:03.500
of what they consider will
be a multiple submission

03:58:03.500 --> 03:58:09.270 position:56%
so that the longer they take to
look at a first-rate group of poems,

03:58:09.270 --> 03:58:12.160
the less likely will
those poems be free

03:58:12.160 --> 03:58:14.850 position:56%
by the time they get around to them.

03:58:14.850 --> 03:58:18.330 position:56%
But though editors will occasionally
be disappointed to learn

03:58:18.330 --> 03:58:23.060
that a poem they covet has
been grabbed by someone else,

03:58:23.060 --> 03:58:26.230
there are so many attractive
poems to be had

03:58:26.230 --> 03:58:30.990
that the disappointment
will be short-lived at best.

03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:36.730 position:56%
Nine, even the best-known literary
magazines are apt in any given issue

03:58:36.730 --> 03:58:42.070
to publish one or two or
more brilliant poems along

03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:46.040
with many others that are merely
competent, though it is rare

03:58:46.040 --> 03:58:49.980
to find many bad poems
in the better magazines.

03:58:49.980 --> 03:58:52.720
Of course, what seems
merely competent

03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:57.340
to one editor may seem considerably
better than that to another.

03:58:57.340 --> 03:59:00.060
But I would contend
that the proliferation

03:59:00.060 --> 03:59:04.400
of write-in programs all across
the country has raised the level

03:59:04.400 --> 03:59:08.590
of poetry generally so that the
average submission takes rather

03:59:08.590 --> 03:59:14.460
longer to reject than was
the case 25 or 30 years ago.

03:59:14.460 --> 03:59:17.730
I started 35 years ago,
so I've actually been able

03:59:17.730 --> 03:59:20.230
to watch this for some time.

03:59:20.230 --> 03:59:24.010
Writing programs cannot
make great poets,

03:59:24.010 --> 03:59:29.240 position:56%
but they can often help hard-working
poets to become serious writers

03:59:29.240 --> 03:59:33.160
who will produce creditable work.

03:59:33.160 --> 03:59:38.110
Number 10, the poetry scene
is diverse in ways that seem

03:59:38.110 --> 03:59:40.670
to most of us very healthy.

03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:45.520
At this moment no one school
dominates the leading magazines

03:59:45.520 --> 03:59:50.420
which rarely follow a predictable
party line in their selections

03:59:50.420 --> 03:59:54.090
so that the followers
of Ashbury and Bishop

03:59:54.090 --> 03:59:58.060
and Plath are not much better
represented than the followers

03:59:58.060 --> 04:00:02.340
of Adrienne Rich or C.K.
Williams or Louise Gluck.

04:00:02.340 --> 04:00:06.800
Adams Zagajewski, the Polish poet,
recently argued in an article

04:00:06.800 --> 04:00:11.190
in the <i>New Republic </i>that most
of the poetry out there is tepid,

04:00:11.190 --> 04:00:17.720 position:56%
ironic, and conversational, and has
no interest in high or final things.

04:00:17.720 --> 04:00:21.980
But I have a hard time applying
those derisory epithets to much

04:00:21.980 --> 04:00:26.080
of the work that I see in the
Salmagundi offices though,

04:00:26.080 --> 04:00:30.380
of course, tepid ironies
are always plentiful.

04:00:30.380 --> 04:00:35.830
Eleven, last one, so few
magazines any longer print

04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:41.370
or commission serious reviews of
poetry that most poets have ceased

04:00:41.370 --> 04:00:47.250 position:56%
to write them or, except where their
own work is concerned, to miss them.

04:00:47.250 --> 04:00:52.940
And, of course, even poets inclined
to regret the absence of steady,

04:00:52.940 --> 04:00:55.010
bracing criticism coming

04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:59.700
from first-rate poet critics
can easily console themselves

04:00:59.700 --> 04:01:02.400
for the loss by simply intoning --

04:01:02.400 --> 04:01:05.170
once or twice each
afternoon should be enough --

04:01:05.170 --> 04:01:09.020
the words "William
Logan," and giving thanks

04:01:09.020 --> 04:01:12.030
for William Logan's decision,
at least for the moment,

04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:16.840
not to offer a scathing
review of their latest work.

04:01:17.950 --> 04:01:19.930
That's Part One.

04:01:19.930 --> 04:01:23.030
Part Two is somewhat briefer.

04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:29.160
These are responses to questions
put to me on a phone by Mr. Cole.

04:01:29.160 --> 04:01:31.850
I'll tackle them in
very summary fashion.

04:01:31.850 --> 04:01:35.080
One, who writes poetry?

04:01:35.080 --> 04:01:38.290
Answer, just about anybody.

04:01:38.290 --> 04:01:41.300
And to judge from the
manuscripts coming

04:01:41.300 --> 04:01:45.450
into our little magazine
mailbox five days each week,

04:01:45.450 --> 04:01:47.270
just about everybody.

04:01:47.270 --> 04:01:53.600
At the Summer Writers Institute
I direct each summer our Poetry

04:01:53.600 --> 04:01:57.390
Workshops are filled with
people, some of whom live

04:01:57.390 --> 04:02:02.120
and breathe poetry, but also
with many others who are doctors,

04:02:02.120 --> 04:02:07.680
lawyers, musicians, businessmen,
social workers, and so on.

04:02:07.680 --> 04:02:10.820
Question Two, who certifies
for those

04:02:10.820 --> 04:02:15.060
who write poetry that
they are poets?

04:02:15.060 --> 04:02:18.820
This is hard to answer,
and no doubt most of those

04:02:18.820 --> 04:02:22.630
who write poetry just
know what they're doing

04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:27.430
and need no reassurance about
who they are when they write.

04:02:27.430 --> 04:02:31.350
Others less confident
will require, I suppose,

04:02:31.350 --> 04:02:36.390 position:56%
confirmation from some external
source, often an encouraging mentor,

04:02:36.390 --> 04:02:40.790
sometimes an encouraging
magazine editor willing

04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:42.850
to publish their work, and thereby

04:02:42.850 --> 04:02:47.590
to confer upon them I guess
what we call an identity.

04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:50.570
Whatever the means, many
people apparently believe

04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:55.490
that writing poetry confers upon
their lives some meaning or dignity

04:02:55.490 --> 04:02:58.610
or shape that is highly desirable.

04:02:58.610 --> 04:03:00.350
And I don't blame them.

04:03:00.350 --> 04:03:02.180
Three, last question.

04:03:02.180 --> 04:03:07.240
What is the poetry scene
today or what is it like?

04:03:07.240 --> 04:03:09.400
I've already indicated in Part One

04:03:09.400 --> 04:03:11.670
of this very brief
talk what the scene is

04:03:11.670 --> 04:03:17.210
like from the peculiar perspective
of a long-time magazine editor.

04:03:17.210 --> 04:03:20.500
But I'll add that the
scene can claim many,

04:03:20.500 --> 04:03:26.720 position:56%
many excellent poets whose work
appears in so many different places,

04:03:26.720 --> 04:03:31.440 position:56%
from so many different presses, that
it is no longer possible to suppose

04:03:31.440 --> 04:03:35.520
that only the commercial presses or
the national magazines will bring

04:03:35.520 --> 04:03:38.250
out really distinguished work,

04:03:38.250 --> 04:03:43.030
though things out there can seem
dark or difficult especially

04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:47.940
for poets trying to break into
print at the better magazines.

04:03:47.940 --> 04:03:51.420
There are many editors around
who are more than eager

04:03:51.420 --> 04:03:54.840
to discover new talent
and to promote it

04:03:54.840 --> 04:03:58.850
in the modest ways
available to most of them.

04:03:58.850 --> 04:04:04.450
Yes, the scene is crowded
with many voices, so many,

04:04:04.450 --> 04:04:09.330 position:56%
that it is impossible for most of us
to attend even to a small fraction

04:04:09.330 --> 04:04:14.160
of those many voices and, yes,
most of us will be very fortunate

04:04:14.160 --> 04:04:19.400
if we can find the time to love
and to master the new books coming

04:04:19.400 --> 04:04:24.020
out by Robert Pinsky or Louise
Gluck, or Seamus Heaney.

04:04:24.020 --> 04:04:32.300 position:56%
But some of us will continue to make
time for the grayer frailer voice

04:04:32.300 --> 04:04:36.750
of a poet like Carl Dennis,
the mordancies of a young poet

04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:41.050
like Danial Levin, or
the orchestral resonances

04:04:41.050 --> 04:04:46.110
of a strange anachronistic
poet named Herbert Morris.

04:04:46.110 --> 04:04:51.780
None of these three, with titles
presently available at Kramer Books

04:04:51.780 --> 04:04:56.120
or Politics and Prose where I
investigated the local scene

04:04:56.120 --> 04:05:01.420
on Monday morning, and did so
with those three names of persons

04:05:01.420 --> 04:05:04.740
with recent books in
print were not to be found

04:05:04.740 --> 04:05:09.800
in the rather nicely
stocked poetry sections.

04:05:09.800 --> 04:05:15.790
In short, though there is too
much poetry out there to take in,

04:05:15.790 --> 04:05:20.090
we can see that much of it
is admirable and compelling,

04:05:20.090 --> 04:05:24.480
sometimes even thrilling
or austerely beautiful.

04:05:24.480 --> 04:05:28.910
And though there is always reason
to complain about look-alikes

04:05:28.910 --> 04:05:33.330
and sound-alikes in the graduate
writing programs about the thinness

04:05:33.330 --> 04:05:38.050
of air and idea in many of
the well-made poems churned

04:05:38.050 --> 04:05:41.130
out in major MFA programs,

04:05:41.130 --> 04:05:45.600
we have only to remember how
much really good work there is

04:05:45.600 --> 04:05:48.860
that we haven't the time to master

04:05:48.860 --> 04:05:54.020 position:56%
and how consistently our best poets
have struggled to exceed themselves.

04:05:54.020 --> 04:05:59.670
We don't live in an age of
poetry, but we have more than two

04:05:59.670 --> 04:06:04.700
or three handfuls of poets
whose work may well be read

04:06:04.700 --> 04:06:08.450
and loved long after we are gone.

04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:10.250
Thank you.

04:06:10.250 --> 04:06:16.850
[ Applause ]

04:06:16.850 --> 04:06:21.290
&gt;&gt; Jerry W. Ward: I'd like
to thank Robert Pinsky,

04:06:21.290 --> 04:06:25.240
the Center for the Book,
and the Library of Congress,

04:06:25.240 --> 04:06:29.310 position:56%
and everyone else who was
responsible for having me come here.

04:06:29.310 --> 04:06:34.060
I must tell tales out of school.

04:06:34.060 --> 04:06:39.920
Last spring, Robert
Pinsky was in Mississippi,

04:06:39.920 --> 04:06:43.230
and we met for the first time.

04:06:43.230 --> 04:06:49.530
And I think we enjoyed the
meeting despite our disagreement

04:06:49.530 --> 04:06:52.260
about a few things.

04:06:52.260 --> 04:06:57.830
And most of my discussion today
is based upon that disagreement,

04:06:57.830 --> 04:07:02.540
which is a friendly one,
about the use of the Internet.

04:07:02.540 --> 04:07:05.270
So I decided that maybe
I ought to talk to you

04:07:05.270 --> 04:07:14.420
about my antiquated beliefs that
poetry still loves the page more

04:07:14.420 --> 04:07:21.910
than the screen or, as a kind
of subtitle for my remarks,

04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:26.540
it's what you have to say when
you ain't no spring chicken,

04:07:26.540 --> 04:07:34.150
as my poet friend [inaudible]
whom I was very pleased to publish

04:07:34.150 --> 04:07:40.620
in <i>Troubled Waters </i>said, and
having been here for the videos

04:07:40.620 --> 04:07:42.810
and having watched
the audience today

04:07:42.810 --> 04:07:49.980
and the way people are responding,
I just felt moved to read this.

04:07:49.980 --> 04:07:55.790
"I am as old as sin,
quiet as it's kept.

04:07:55.790 --> 04:08:01.880
As ancient as an exorcism
from paradise.

04:08:01.880 --> 04:08:08.830
I used to swing by my feet, make
a dance out of trees catching me.

04:08:08.830 --> 04:08:10.360
I used to stand on my hands

04:08:10.360 --> 04:08:15.660
and throw huge rocks
with the bow of my legs.

04:08:15.660 --> 04:08:20.350
I used to outrun daylight home
to a woman dressed in nightfall,

04:08:20.350 --> 04:08:24.840
older than the blues, older than
the grace of sitting years later

04:08:24.840 --> 04:08:29.470
on the porch of a rocking
chair poem.

04:08:29.470 --> 04:08:34.860
I used to turn my eyes
inside-out and cure a headache

04:08:34.860 --> 04:08:42.130
in a time before color 3D TV, in a
time before footprints on the moon,

04:08:42.130 --> 04:08:45.690
in a time before the wheel.

04:08:46.900 --> 04:08:54.130
Let me tell you of a time long
before Lucifer when the sky

04:08:54.130 --> 04:09:02.920
and the sea were the same, when
we could swim to the stars.

04:09:02.920 --> 04:09:06.900
I am slow dragging against
the walls of a cave,

04:09:06.900 --> 04:09:10.320
combing the wind with my hair.

04:09:10.320 --> 04:09:16.430
I wear a rainbow as my diaper
and a feather in my ear.

04:09:16.430 --> 04:09:19.720
I am tapdancing majestic waves,

04:09:19.720 --> 04:09:24.650
surfing for the rocky ground
where the tribe waits.

04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:28.800
They throw chains out to fetch me,

04:09:28.800 --> 04:09:33.610
pulling me in like old
age with open arms.

04:09:33.610 --> 04:09:40.200
They bite and growl a
song which welcomes me.

04:09:40.200 --> 04:09:48.690
Even then there was more to
the world than meets the eye."

04:09:49.890 --> 04:09:54.390
That's about the way I feel when
I talk about what's happening

04:09:54.390 --> 04:09:59.850
to poetry now, because no doubt
I belong to some ancient tribe

04:09:59.850 --> 04:10:07.760
of scriveners who were very much
put out when the craft they loved

04:10:07.760 --> 04:10:13.190
and the livelihood they depended
upon was undeniably diminished

04:10:13.190 --> 04:10:16.280
by the triumph of printing.

04:10:16.280 --> 04:10:21.470 position:56%
As a writer who has moved from
pencil and what we in the South used

04:10:21.470 --> 04:10:28.880
to call cornbread paper to pencil
and nice paper, through the manual

04:10:28.880 --> 04:10:34.740
and electric versions of the
typewriter, to a now shameless use

04:10:34.740 --> 04:10:41.500 position:56%
of the computer as a word processor,
I must admit that I have a kind

04:10:41.500 --> 04:10:47.830
of residual kinship with those
ancient makers of manuscripts.

04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:52.800
No, I do not want to return
to the use of pen and ink

04:10:52.800 --> 04:10:55.460
as a habitual mode of writing.

04:10:55.460 --> 04:10:57.930
My hand would cramp.

04:10:57.930 --> 04:11:01.130
But at certain stages
in composition,

04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:04.170
particularly when I
am writing poems,

04:11:04.170 --> 04:11:07.760
I must have the evolving
product on the page

04:11:07.760 --> 04:11:10.710
and not on the computer screen.

04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:14.970
I must have the paper in hand.

04:11:14.970 --> 04:11:21.530
The screen does not permit me to
touch the word as the page does.

04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:26.440
And as I remarked yesterday
after looking at the collection

04:11:26.440 --> 04:11:31.750
of treasures in a new exhibit
in the Jefferson Building,

04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:38.360
unless there was a paper there with
ancient printing on it I don't know

04:11:38.360 --> 04:11:45.550
that that particular magic
moment would happen for me.

04:11:45.550 --> 04:11:50.370
So in my creative projects
and in my creative responses,

04:11:50.370 --> 04:11:53.330
poetry still loves the page.

04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:56.020
And as a reader of poems,
I still want the look

04:11:56.020 --> 04:11:58.520
and feel of the printed page.

04:11:58.520 --> 04:12:02.360
My brain is not hardwired
in the intellectual

04:12:02.360 --> 04:12:06.340
and aesthetic acts it performs
for the e-book or the Palm book

04:12:06.340 --> 04:12:11.480
or whatever it's called, and
any other extremes in the future

04:12:11.480 --> 04:12:15.840
to which we will wind up as we
explore the full possibilities

04:12:15.840 --> 04:12:18.340
of hypertextuality.

04:12:18.340 --> 04:12:22.090 position:56%
By sheer habit I respond more warmly

04:12:22.090 --> 04:12:25.290
to <i>Dover Beach </i>in
a printed anthology

04:12:25.290 --> 04:12:29.250
than to the most handsome
presentation the electronic village

04:12:29.250 --> 04:12:31.770
at the University of Virginia
might be able to make.

04:12:31.770 --> 04:12:41.160
In 1992, Robert Coover wrote
a rather starting piece

04:12:41.160 --> 04:12:46.450
for the <i>New York Times</i>
called "The End of the Book."

04:12:46.450 --> 04:12:50.950
And I think what he had to
say is to be taken seriously.

04:12:50.950 --> 04:13:00.240
He contended -- or at least I
suppose he partially contended --

04:13:00.240 --> 04:13:05.200
that poets and publishers
cannot behave

04:13:05.200 --> 04:13:09.640
as if the electronic has not
changed how we communicate,

04:13:09.640 --> 04:13:14.850
conduct our daily affairs, enjoy
or suffer a quality of life.

04:13:14.850 --> 04:13:17.060
Indeed the revolution is well

04:13:17.060 --> 04:13:19.720
on the road toward changing
the cognitive functioning

04:13:19.720 --> 04:13:21.290
of the human brain.

04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:27.360 position:56%
We can't ignore either the unsettled
questions regarding intellectual

04:13:27.360 --> 04:13:32.030
property, copyright, and
something I learned recently

04:13:32.030 --> 04:13:39.010
which is called copyleft which
pertains only to the computer.

04:13:39.010 --> 04:13:42.570
Other entitlements
and most especially

04:13:42.570 --> 04:13:46.750
as the Authors Guild reminds
me, I have to be concerned

04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:51.440
about the recovery of
royalties from various misuses.

04:13:51.440 --> 04:13:54.870 position:56%
Writing from the vantage of fiction,

04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:58.420
Robert Coover really
humorously remarked,

04:13:58.420 --> 04:14:01.430
"You will often hear it said
that the print medium is a doomed

04:14:01.430 --> 04:14:04.420
and outdated technology,
a mere curiosity

04:14:04.420 --> 04:14:10.220 position:56%
of bygone days just [inaudible] to
be consigned forever to those dusty,

04:14:10.220 --> 04:14:16.930
unattended museums we
now call libraries.

04:14:16.930 --> 04:14:19.540
Indeed. The very proliferation
of books

04:14:19.540 --> 04:14:23.190
and other print-based media
is held to be a signal

04:14:23.190 --> 04:14:28.330
of its feverish moribundity,
the last futile grasp

04:14:28.330 --> 04:14:35.590
of a once vital form before it
finally passes away forever,

04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:37.340
dead as God."

04:14:37.340 --> 04:14:41.670
That's the end of Coover's
quotation.

04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:45.880
Coover has willing to face
the new world by experimenting

04:14:45.880 --> 04:14:50.690
with hyperspace at Brown University
in the creation of narrative

04:14:50.690 --> 04:14:54.580
that would free a writer
from the tyranny of the line.

04:14:54.580 --> 04:14:58.640
As he said, "Hypertext
reader and writer are said

04:14:58.640 --> 04:15:03.490
to become co-learners or co-writers
as it were, fellow travelers

04:15:03.490 --> 04:15:08.020
in the mapping and remapping
of textual and visual kinetic

04:15:08.020 --> 04:15:12.670
and aural components, all of
which are provided by what used

04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:17.210
to be called the author," unquote.

04:15:17.210 --> 04:15:19.050
The number of fiction
writers willing

04:15:19.050 --> 04:15:23.230
to go the whole nine yards
with hypertext is small.

04:15:23.230 --> 04:15:26.570
To my knowledge, the number
of poets willing to do

04:15:26.570 --> 04:15:30.890
so would be absolutely miniscule.

04:15:30.890 --> 04:15:35.000
We -- or at least I can
speak only for myself --

04:15:35.000 --> 04:15:41.360
we are reluctant to have co-poets
tamper with out creations except

04:15:41.360 --> 04:15:46.690
in workshops or by way of
private feedback solicited

04:15:46.690 --> 04:15:50.740 position:56%
from other writers or kindred souls.

04:15:50.740 --> 04:15:53.310
Such poems as are published
at various sites

04:15:53.310 --> 04:15:58.150
on the World Wide Web are
more or less imitations

04:15:58.150 --> 04:16:01.080
of what one finds on paper.

04:16:01.080 --> 04:16:06.580
And it is disappointing to me that
you can't even write marginal notes

04:16:06.580 --> 04:16:09.420
on the Web-published poem.

04:16:09.420 --> 04:16:14.260
It is probably pleasing
to the publishers

04:16:14.260 --> 04:16:18.830
of the amazingly popular
new translation

04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:23.330
of <i>Beowulf </i>that Seamus
Heaney did not opt

04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:27.120
to sell it by way of the Web.

04:16:27.120 --> 04:16:33.490
That book is selling well according
to the <i>New York Times </i>of 29 March.

04:16:33.490 --> 04:16:40.560
But maybe another edition of his
translation will include a CD

04:16:40.560 --> 04:16:45.850
or of him reading or of some
well-spoken print reading at --

04:16:45.850 --> 04:16:53.380
which will return it to its
natural context as poetry.

04:16:53.380 --> 04:16:54.930
The sales of this new version

04:16:54.930 --> 04:17:01.910 position:56%
of an old epic is probably one small
indicator that the book is not dead,

04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:06.450
the text lives, and will
live in new transformations.

04:17:06.450 --> 04:17:12.240
I do not think that we need
to do a hatchet job on poetry

04:17:12.240 --> 04:17:15.020 position:56%
and new technologies of publication.

04:17:15.020 --> 04:17:19.100
There is something to be
said about the positive good

04:17:19.100 --> 04:17:24.610
of getting people interested in
poetry by way of the Internet.

04:17:24.610 --> 04:17:28.300 position:56%
Robert Pinsky's project is probably,

04:17:28.300 --> 04:17:37.010
especially after last night's
cybercast, a very fine example

04:17:37.010 --> 04:17:42.760
of how you can use the Net to
reach a democratic audience.

04:17:42.760 --> 04:17:50.870
I think there's something very good
to be said about this because some

04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:55.570
of those materials will find
their way to the joys of print.

04:17:55.570 --> 04:18:01.000
Some of the people who find
things on the Net will again learn

04:18:01.000 --> 04:18:07.980
to enjoy the heft of a book in
hand and the turning of pages,

04:18:07.980 --> 04:18:10.770
rather than the clicking of mice.

04:18:10.770 --> 04:18:17.880
And I have to ask learned people
here, is the plural of mouse used

04:18:17.880 --> 04:18:24.710
as a computer instrument
"mice" or "mouses?"

04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:29.690
I really don't know, but I
would like an answer, please.

04:18:29.690 --> 04:18:35.920
The act of reading encourages
then a very active participation

04:18:35.920 --> 04:18:37.750
in one's literacy.

04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:41.620
The reading of a poem, as those
wonderful videos have shown us,

04:18:41.620 --> 04:18:46.360
shows that there is a very
active use of the voice,

04:18:46.360 --> 04:18:50.720
but also of various powers
of imagination in figuring

04:18:50.720 --> 04:18:55.460
out the meanings that emerge
from that kind of encounter

04:18:55.460 --> 04:18:58.760
which are quite different
and perhaps more blessed

04:18:58.760 --> 04:19:02.910
than the meanings that
ever occur in my classroom.

04:19:02.910 --> 04:19:06.610
For academic purposes I do not
object to preparing the text

04:19:06.610 --> 04:19:13.210
of poems so that students can
have access to links for now

04:19:13.210 --> 04:19:16.710
that can do what footnotes
and glosses

04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:19.450
in the old technology used to do.

04:19:19.450 --> 04:19:23.380
On the other hand, as a
teacher I always warn students

04:19:23.380 --> 04:19:25.160
about the dangers of thinking

04:19:25.160 --> 04:19:28.740
that somehow it's all
there in hyperspace.

04:19:28.740 --> 04:19:30.440
No, it is not.

04:19:30.440 --> 04:19:35.500
There is so much in the library in
print that awaits our discovery.

04:19:35.500 --> 04:19:41.960
The epiphany for me yesterday was,
my God, I'm over half a century old

04:19:41.960 --> 04:19:47.910
and I could spend another century
reading in the Library of Congress.

04:19:50.370 --> 04:19:59.320 position:56%
No, this new enthusiasm and wonder
for what a well-chosen configuration

04:19:59.320 --> 04:20:02.670
of words might contain
has this possibility

04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:06.250
of springing forth even
in the new technology.

04:20:06.250 --> 04:20:10.030
And the Library of Congress
website has done much

04:20:10.030 --> 04:20:15.040
to disseminate the possibilities
to hundreds of thousands

04:20:15.040 --> 04:20:19.540
of Americans who got there online.

04:20:20.840 --> 04:20:24.310
No doubt in the future things
will be very different.

04:20:24.310 --> 04:20:27.450
Surely there will be fewer
of us around to carry

04:20:27.450 --> 04:20:35.030
on a long-term love affair with the
poem manifested on paper in ink.

04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:41.970
Perhaps some century hence poets
will alienate their individuality

04:20:41.970 --> 04:20:44.970
for the good of the
commonwealth of poetry.

04:20:44.970 --> 04:20:50.530
Perhaps e-Lit-zines web-located
literary magazines will be all too

04:20:50.530 --> 04:20:56.000
commonplace and people will fashion
anthologies from electronic poems

04:20:56.000 --> 04:20:59.360
with real audio readings.

04:20:59.360 --> 04:21:04.350
Neither poets nor publishers can
stop the revolution involving the

04:21:04.350 --> 04:21:07.320
new management of boundless
centerless space

04:21:07.320 --> 04:21:13.680
and unlocked time or,
perhaps, unclocked time.

04:21:13.680 --> 04:21:19.050
But any conclusion that
poetry on the Internet is more

04:21:19.050 --> 04:21:23.570
than an interesting and
emerging set of possibilities is,

04:21:23.570 --> 04:21:30.080
as was the announcement about
Truman losing to Dewey, premature.

04:21:30.080 --> 04:21:36.510
The page still simply
loves the poem.

04:21:36.510 --> 04:21:45.600
[ Applause ]

04:21:45.600 --> 04:21:46.900
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Thank you, Jerry.

04:21:46.900 --> 04:21:49.350
Our next speaker is Leslie Morris

04:21:49.350 --> 04:21:52.580
who will present another
perspective.

04:21:54.460 --> 04:21:55.760
Leslie.

04:21:55.760 --> 04:21:58.280
&gt;&gt; Leslie Morris: I should
probably begin by saying

04:21:58.280 --> 04:22:00.410
that I'm not a publisher.

04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:03.370
So I feel a little bit out
of place on this panel.

04:22:03.370 --> 04:22:07.730 position:56%
I'm an archivist and what I'm
interested in is what the publishers

04:22:07.730 --> 04:22:10.090
and the poets leave behind.

04:22:10.090 --> 04:22:14.620
And what I'm talking about
primarily today is my experience

04:22:14.620 --> 04:22:17.710
as an archivist with one
particular publisher,

04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:21.520
and that was New Directions
Publishing Company.

04:22:21.520 --> 04:22:25.160
The outline of the story
of James Lockland IV

04:22:25.160 --> 04:22:27.930
and his New Directions
Publishing Corporation is familiar

04:22:27.930 --> 04:22:31.050
to anyone interested
in 20th century poets.

04:22:31.050 --> 04:22:34.970
So I will only recap it
briefly here to set the scene.

04:22:34.970 --> 04:22:39.080 position:56%
Jay, as he was usually known, became
a publisher because he was told

04:22:39.080 --> 04:22:41.130
to become one by Ezra Pound.

04:22:41.130 --> 04:22:44.770
He had sought out Pound in
Italy, taking leave from Harvard

04:22:44.770 --> 04:22:49.020
in his sophomore year to
attend Pound's Ezuversity,

04:22:49.020 --> 04:22:51.950 position:56%
hoping in this way to become a poet.

04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:55.740
After several months with Pound,
Pound finally said to him,

04:22:55.740 --> 04:22:59.790
and I quote from Jay's
reminiscences of Pound here.

04:22:59.790 --> 04:23:01.560
"No, Jazz, it's hopeless.

04:23:01.560 --> 04:23:03.380 position:56%
You're never going to make a writer.

04:23:03.380 --> 04:23:06.520
No matter how hard you
try, you'll never make it.

04:23:06.520 --> 04:23:09.560
Go back to America and
do something useful.

04:23:09.560 --> 04:23:11.560
Go back and be a publisher.

04:23:11.560 --> 04:23:14.350
If you're a good boy your
parents will give you some money

04:23:14.350 --> 04:23:15.920
and you can bring out books.

04:23:15.920 --> 04:23:17.630
I'll get all my friends
to send you stuff."

04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:20.040
[ Laughter ]

04:23:20.040 --> 04:23:23.130
Lockland's family owned the
Pittsburgh steel company Jones

04:23:23.130 --> 04:23:27.220
and Lockland and Jay did not really
need to work to support himself.

04:23:27.220 --> 04:23:30.290
But following Pound's advice
he returned to Harvard

04:23:30.290 --> 04:23:33.770
and in 1936 while still
a student brought

04:23:33.770 --> 04:23:37.240
out his first New Directions book.

04:23:37.240 --> 04:23:40.780
Almost half of the titles that
New Directions has published have

04:23:40.780 --> 04:23:42.230
been poetry.

04:23:42.230 --> 04:23:45.010
Many poets who are now part
of the accepted mainstream

04:23:45.010 --> 04:23:48.070
of 20th century poetry had
their early work published

04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:51.860
in New Directions, in one of the
firm's annuals, or have been kept

04:23:51.860 --> 04:23:54.020
in print by New Directions,

04:23:54.020 --> 04:23:57.800
when other more commercial
publishers were not interested.

04:23:57.800 --> 04:24:00.340
To name only a few of the poets --

04:24:00.340 --> 04:24:03.910
Ezra Pound and William Carlos
Williams are foremost, of course.

04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:08.090
They are the two pillars upon which
the house of New Directions rests.

04:24:08.090 --> 04:24:11.940
Tennessee Williams, who was a
poet as well as a playwright,

04:24:11.940 --> 04:24:15.500
and New Directions has published
almost all of Williams' work.

04:24:15.500 --> 04:24:19.090
Dylan Thomas, Delmore
Schwartz, Kenneth Patchen,

04:24:19.090 --> 04:24:21.410
Thomas Merton, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti.

04:24:21.410 --> 04:24:26.700
<i>A Coney Island of the Mind </i>was one
of ND's biggest and best sellers.

04:24:26.700 --> 04:24:29.980
Denise Levertov, Elizabeth
Bishop, Gary Snyder,

04:24:29.980 --> 04:24:32.980
and the list could go on and on.

04:24:32.980 --> 04:24:35.950
New Directions was also
extremely important in bringing

04:24:35.950 --> 04:24:39.390
to an American public
translations of foreign writers,

04:24:39.390 --> 04:24:43.950
exposing American poets to the
traditions of French modernism

04:24:43.950 --> 04:24:48.120
such the work of the surrealist
Paul Eluard, and a Spanish

04:24:48.120 --> 04:24:51.990
and Latin American lyric in the
work of Federico Garcia Lorca,

04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:55.960
Pablo Neruda, and Octavio Paz.

04:24:55.960 --> 04:24:59.940 position:56%
When I read off the names of the
poets that New Directions published,

04:24:59.940 --> 04:25:02.930
you might be excused for
thinking that, of course,

04:25:02.930 --> 04:25:05.920
with such a list the firm
must have made some money.

04:25:05.920 --> 04:25:10.670
And, after all, it's still in
business today after 64 years.

04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:13.780
The fact is, however, that the
firm operated in the red for close

04:25:13.780 --> 04:25:18.100
to 40 years until the explosion
of courses in contemporary poetry

04:25:18.100 --> 04:25:22.340
in American universities
in the mid-1970s.

04:25:22.340 --> 04:25:25.820
Only New Directions had the
essential text still in print

04:25:25.820 --> 04:25:29.010
and so, finally, they
began to make profits.

04:25:29.010 --> 04:25:32.610 position:56%
Although often in the years the firm
did make a profit it would not have

04:25:32.610 --> 04:25:35.930
been in the black had its
publisher taken a salary.

04:25:35.930 --> 04:25:39.670
Life, even for successful poetry
publishers, can be marginal

04:25:39.670 --> 04:25:43.110
and it helps greatly to
be independently wealthy.

04:25:44.290 --> 04:25:46.330
Jay Lockland's publishing
philosophy was

04:25:46.330 --> 04:25:48.870
to publish only work that he liked.

04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:51.980
Jay was proud to say that
he'd turned down Rod McKuen

04:25:51.980 --> 04:25:56.340
who sold millions of books
because quote, "It's poetry, sure.

04:25:56.340 --> 04:26:01.170
I admit it's poetry, but it's not
a kind of poetry that I like."

04:26:01.170 --> 04:26:04.550
Because he didn't need to turn a
profit in order to support himself,

04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:09.490
he could, again, in his words,
quote, "do things I wanted to do

04:26:09.490 --> 04:26:10.860
without having to waste a lot

04:26:10.860 --> 04:26:14.220
of time publishing
junk to support them."

04:26:14.220 --> 04:26:16.840
Jay also subscribed
to a belief of Pounds

04:26:16.840 --> 04:26:20.660
that there was almost always
a time lag of 10 to 20 years

04:26:20.660 --> 04:26:23.340 position:56%
until a poet's work was appreciated.

04:26:23.340 --> 04:26:28.380 position:56%
Consequently, New Directions keeps
books in print for a very long time,

04:26:28.380 --> 04:26:30.950
waiting for that period
to end and to be ready

04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:34.510
to sell those books when it does.

04:26:34.510 --> 04:26:37.150
But I'm on this panel today
not simply to tell the story

04:26:37.150 --> 04:26:41.390 position:56%
of New Directions as a case study in
poetry publishing, but to speak also

04:26:41.390 --> 04:26:44.260
in my professional
capacity as an archivist.

04:26:44.260 --> 04:26:47.790
What does the written record left
behind by this company tell one

04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:51.590
about the relationships
between poets and publishers?

04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:55.700
One might expect that the proofs
and other production materials

04:26:55.700 --> 04:26:58.700
for the books of poetry New
Directions published would be

04:26:58.700 --> 04:27:02.140
extremely revealing of how
Jay worked with his authors.

04:27:02.140 --> 04:27:05.060
But, in point of fact, the
proofs tell one very little.

04:27:05.060 --> 04:27:08.570
For the most part Jay did
very little line editing

04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:12.220
for his writers largely because
most of them wouldn't stand for it.

04:27:12.220 --> 04:27:16.000
Can you imagine trying to
edit Pound or Williams?

04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:18.910
Instead, he invested
time and long letters,

04:27:18.910 --> 04:27:22.680
occasionally dispensing advice
or offering a point of view,

04:27:22.680 --> 04:27:25.410
but for the most part
simply being the facilitator

04:27:25.410 --> 04:27:28.000
of their creative work.

04:27:28.000 --> 04:27:32.290
Denise Levertov, a poet whom Jay
published early and often summed it

04:27:32.290 --> 04:27:36.930
up eloquently when she said,
"For over 20 years I have had

04:27:36.930 --> 04:27:40.140
in Jay a publisher who
has consistently affirmed

04:27:40.140 --> 04:27:43.500
and supported my development
through all its changes,

04:27:43.500 --> 04:27:46.690
a friend whose personal
kindness has been practically,

04:27:46.690 --> 04:27:49.150
as well as verbally, expressed.

04:27:49.150 --> 04:27:52.960
And in association with a
fellow poet, consistently fine

04:27:52.960 --> 04:27:58.490
and at the same time modest and
totally unselfserving" The letters

04:27:58.490 --> 04:28:00.450
between poet and publisher

04:28:00.450 --> 04:28:03.950
in the New Directions archive
are quite truly remarkable

04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:07.600
and repeatedly showed the
devotion, kindness, lack of ego,

04:28:07.600 --> 04:28:11.570
and passion for poetry
that Levertov mentions.

04:28:11.570 --> 04:28:14.890
Fortunately, Jay usually
kept carbons of his letters,

04:28:14.890 --> 04:28:20.370
so one can actually sit down and
read both sides of these exchanges.

04:28:20.370 --> 04:28:22.940
I find one of the central
pieces for understanding Jay

04:28:22.940 --> 04:28:24.650
as a publisher an exchange he had

04:28:24.650 --> 04:28:27.850
with William Carlos
Williams in 1937.

04:28:27.850 --> 04:28:29.600
Williams had just published
his novel,

04:28:29.600 --> 04:28:31.350
<i>White Mule </i>with New Directions

04:28:31.350 --> 04:28:35.310
and it had brought him some long
overdue recognition and success.

04:28:35.310 --> 04:28:39.530
But, as do many writers who become
successful with a small publisher,

04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:41.720
he was now thinking of
taking his next book

04:28:41.720 --> 04:28:44.150
to a more commercial publisher.

04:28:44.150 --> 04:28:49.220
Williams wrote to Jay, in part,
"Tentatively, I've been thinking

04:28:49.220 --> 04:28:52.510
that it might be wisest to approach
a regular commercial publisher

04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:55.110
concerning my next
book when it is ready.

04:28:55.110 --> 04:29:00.220 position:56%
Harcourt Brace once smiled at me and
Simon and Schuster grinned broadly.

04:29:00.220 --> 04:29:04.810
I'm just talking along, let it
go in one ear and out the other.

04:29:04.810 --> 04:29:08.300
I won't make a move
without a talk with you."

04:29:08.300 --> 04:29:11.720
Jay thought about this for 10
days and then wrote back --

04:29:11.720 --> 04:29:13.190
and just a reminder, at this point,

04:29:13.190 --> 04:29:17.020
Williams is 54 years old
and Jay is all of 23.

04:29:17.020 --> 04:29:22.030
"Dear Bill, you're thinking
that you want somebody else

04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:24.450
as a crisis in my life.

04:29:24.450 --> 04:29:27.240
I had thought that I was doing
all right in what I had taken

04:29:27.240 --> 04:29:30.680
up in what was probably
to be my lifework and now,

04:29:30.680 --> 04:29:33.510
if you doubt me, I don't know.

04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:35.900
You are the cornerstone
of New Directions,

04:29:35.900 --> 04:29:39.470
and if you left me I think I
wouldn't be able to go on with it.

04:29:39.470 --> 04:29:41.950
I have built my plans around you.

04:29:41.950 --> 04:29:44.990
You are my symbol of everything
that is good in writing,

04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:46.790
and if you go over to the enemy,

04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:49.510
I just don't know where
the hell I'm at.

04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:52.080
[ Laughter ]

04:29:52.080 --> 04:29:54.590
"Would they take the mule?

04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:57.160
Now that you have made
a success they want you.

04:29:57.160 --> 04:30:00.090
They think they can exploit you.

04:30:00.090 --> 04:30:01.550
"It isn't a case of publishers.

04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:04.970
It's a case of life and
death, or right and wrong,

04:30:04.970 --> 04:30:08.510
of good writers starving and
lousy writers going to Palm Beach.

04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:11.060
[ Laughter ]

04:30:11.060 --> 04:30:13.290
"Of course, I see the other side.

04:30:13.290 --> 04:30:14.950
I see that you need money.

04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:16.250
Well, if you will trust me

04:30:16.250 --> 04:30:18.980
for a little while I'll
see that you get that.

04:30:18.980 --> 04:30:21.060
You are different from their trade.

04:30:21.060 --> 04:30:23.750
You and literature
are not merchandise.

04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:25.620
They cannot fake you.

04:30:25.620 --> 04:30:27.420
Suppose your next book is too good

04:30:27.420 --> 04:30:30.380
and doesn't pay its
share in their overhead.

04:30:30.380 --> 04:30:34.060
Those fair-weather friends
will kick you right downstairs.

04:30:34.060 --> 04:30:35.640
They don't understand you.

04:30:35.640 --> 04:30:37.700 position:56%
They don't know what it's all about.

04:30:37.700 --> 04:30:40.790
They just want to exploit
your success.

04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:42.370
But you are free.

04:30:42.370 --> 04:30:44.510
You must do [background
laughter] what you want to do.

04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:47.740
[ Laughter ]

04:30:47.740 --> 04:30:49.610
What can I do for you?

04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:52.700
I can push you steadily
with the kind of people

04:30:52.700 --> 04:30:54.540
who are your proper audience.

04:30:54.540 --> 04:30:56.980
I can put out good books
for you irrespective

04:30:56.980 --> 04:30:58.790
of whether they pay their way.

04:30:58.790 --> 04:31:00.870
And if you think you are
losing money with me,

04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:02.490
I'll see that you get that.

04:31:02.490 --> 04:31:04.360
What are Simon and
Schuster offering you?

04:31:04.360 --> 04:31:06.920
I'll meet anything they put up.

04:31:06.920 --> 04:31:08.240
Why do I care?

04:31:08.240 --> 04:31:10.970
Because I know that I need
you in order to do anything

04:31:10.970 --> 04:31:13.130
for the young ones coming on.

04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:15.120
I can print their books for them.

04:31:15.120 --> 04:31:18.100
But unless the name New
Directions stands for something,

04:31:18.100 --> 04:31:20.260 position:56%
they'll have a hell of a row to hoe.

04:31:20.260 --> 04:31:23.500
With you, New Directions
does stand for something.

04:31:23.500 --> 04:31:26.690
And the people it prints
will get a start and a break.

04:31:26.690 --> 04:31:28.730
This is not just monkeyshine.

04:31:28.730 --> 04:31:31.150
It's the way the things work.

04:31:31.150 --> 04:31:35.730 position:56%
But, again, you are absolutely
free, and you must do what you want.

04:31:35.730 --> 04:31:37.030
You mustn't think of me --

04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:38.330
&gt;&gt; Right.

04:31:38.330 --> 04:31:39.630
&gt;&gt; Leslie Morris: -- "but
I think you should think

04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:41.340
of the other writers whom
New Directions made strong

04:31:41.340 --> 04:31:44.510
by you could on their feet.

04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:47.560
Well, think it all over
a while and let me know.

04:31:47.560 --> 04:31:51.030
Best, Jim."

04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:57.020
Williams wrote back
[laughter], "Dear Jim, so be it.

04:31:57.020 --> 04:31:59.270
I frankly didn't think
you were interested.

04:31:59.270 --> 04:32:00.570
Now it's different.

04:32:00.570 --> 04:32:03.930
We'll go ahead together, not
any faster than is reasonable,

04:32:03.930 --> 04:32:07.670
but just as far and as
persistently as we are able.

04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:09.240
It isn't that I need money now.

04:32:09.240 --> 04:32:10.780
That's not the point.

04:32:10.780 --> 04:32:14.160
My sole thought was that sometime
or other, in the near future,

04:32:14.160 --> 04:32:17.480
I ought to try to make some sort
of connection which would enable me

04:32:17.480 --> 04:32:20.260
to get some sort of
return from my writing.

04:32:20.260 --> 04:32:24.630
I agree that my chances are slim,
but I felt that I had to try.

04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:27.410
I'm convinced that my
best chances now lie

04:32:27.410 --> 04:32:30.430
with you, looked at quite coldly.

04:32:30.430 --> 04:32:32.800
Nor do I expect the impossible.

04:32:32.800 --> 04:32:34.100
It was impossible for me

04:32:34.100 --> 04:32:37.900
to know before this last letter
what your plans could be.

04:32:37.900 --> 04:32:40.060
It's noon now and I have to eat.

04:32:40.060 --> 04:32:41.930
Let me have your reactions.

04:32:41.930 --> 04:32:44.580
Sincerely yours, W.C. Williams."

04:32:44.580 --> 04:32:49.180
A second exchange, this
one between Dylan Thomas,

04:32:49.180 --> 04:32:52.510
another core New Direction
writer, and Jay.

04:32:52.510 --> 04:32:55.840
Thomas of course was
perpetually short of money.

04:32:55.840 --> 04:32:59.560
In this letter, written in 1938,
and shortly after the exchange

04:32:59.560 --> 04:33:01.490
with Williams I've just read,

04:33:01.490 --> 04:33:04.750
Thomas concludes a densely
written five-page letter

04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:10.360
in which he describes his poverty
in graphic detail as follows.

04:33:10.360 --> 04:33:14.210
"I apologize for this recital,
but every one of my hopes is based

04:33:14.210 --> 04:33:16.930
on the possibility that
New Directions may be able

04:33:16.930 --> 04:33:19.460
to give me an advance on royalties.

04:33:19.460 --> 04:33:23.630
It's extremely irregular, I know,
and must be very annoying to you.

04:33:23.630 --> 04:33:26.910
For this unavoidably miserable
letter I again apologize.

04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:32.420
I had hoped to write all this in a
business-like manner but I failed.

04:33:32.420 --> 04:33:35.100
I failed because, although I
know nothing about the business

04:33:35.100 --> 04:33:38.110
of publishing or the agreements
that can be made between publisher

04:33:38.110 --> 04:33:42.050
and author, I know enough to
realize that my most sincere appeal

04:33:42.050 --> 04:33:44.060
for an immediate advance
on the work you wish

04:33:44.060 --> 04:33:48.530
to publish is unorthodox
and possible insolent.

04:33:48.530 --> 04:33:52.490
I am sorry I had to write this, but
I am forced to do away with dignity

04:33:52.490 --> 04:33:55.580
and formality and ask
you this question.

04:33:55.580 --> 04:33:59.360
Can you, at once, give
me money for which

04:33:59.360 --> 04:34:03.870
in return I promise you all the
work I have done and will ever do?

04:34:03.870 --> 04:34:05.170
&gt;&gt; Whoo.

04:34:05.170 --> 04:34:09.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leslie Morris: "I hope beyond
all things that you will answer me."

04:34:10.210 --> 04:34:13.120
Jay responded immediately.

04:34:13.120 --> 04:34:15.130
"Your letter had quite an
effect on me [laughter].

04:34:15.130 --> 04:34:19.770
When I got it in Paris I was
just on the point of going off

04:34:19.770 --> 04:34:21.920
to Spain to fight in the war.

04:34:21.920 --> 04:34:24.510
Then I thought about
your situation and --

04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:28.120
[ Laughter ]

04:34:28.120 --> 04:34:30.100
"-- then I thought about
your situation and that

04:34:30.100 --> 04:34:33.550
of two other young writers of mine
in America and I said, 'My, God.

04:34:33.550 --> 04:34:34.850
No, I can't do that.

04:34:34.850 --> 04:34:36.400
I've got a duty to do.'

04:34:36.400 --> 04:34:37.700
So I didn't go.

04:34:37.700 --> 04:34:41.990 position:56%
I can't get myself killed right now.

04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:45.860
As long as you stay good and write
the real thing you will never

04:34:45.860 --> 04:34:47.180
make money.

04:34:47.180 --> 04:34:48.680
I must tell you that.

04:34:48.680 --> 04:34:50.730
You must resign yourself to that.

04:34:50.730 --> 04:34:53.150
That is the state of
publishing today.

04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:56.290
But you can count on me
to do what I can for you.

04:34:56.290 --> 04:34:58.660
At this moment I have
almost no money at all.

04:34:58.660 --> 04:35:03.390
I'm living on $2 a day myself,
but in good times I have plenty.

04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:05.930
So I cannot promise you
very much right now.

04:35:05.930 --> 04:35:09.980
I can send you $20 now and
the same again next month.

04:35:09.980 --> 04:35:12.360
If business gets better,
I can do more for you.

04:35:12.360 --> 04:35:16.920
In the meantime, I'll do
my best to see you through.

04:35:16.920 --> 04:35:19.740
New Directions is the best
publisher for you in America

04:35:19.740 --> 04:35:21.910
because I fight for my books.

04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:25.150
None of the big houses will
fight for a poet these days.

04:35:25.150 --> 04:35:28.200
If they think he'll write a
novel, they'll play him along,

04:35:28.200 --> 04:35:30.930
but they won't fight
for him as a poet.

04:35:30.930 --> 04:35:33.410
I worry about you,
let me hear from you.

04:35:33.410 --> 04:35:37.980
Lockland. The correspondence
in the archive continues

04:35:37.980 --> 04:35:40.930
to be rich throughout Jay's
active involvement with the firm,

04:35:40.930 --> 04:35:43.160
even thought the telephone
was handy.

04:35:43.160 --> 04:35:46.620
It's my impression that perhaps
because he was a writer himself,

04:35:46.620 --> 04:35:48.100
he often wrote letters even

04:35:48.100 --> 04:35:52.520
when presumably a telephone
call would have been possible.

04:35:52.520 --> 04:35:54.910
But faced with such a
wealth of documentation

04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:58.550
in the New Direction's archive for
the poet and student interested

04:35:58.550 --> 04:36:02.770
in how writers write and how
writers survive as writers.

04:36:02.770 --> 04:36:06.460
I do lament the passing of the
tradition of letter writing.

04:36:06.460 --> 04:36:08.560
Certainly, much of the
author correspondence

04:36:08.560 --> 04:36:12.080
that I see these days is
not terribly revealing.

04:36:12.080 --> 04:36:15.440
The telephone has made serious end
roads [phonetic] in this record.

04:36:15.440 --> 04:36:19.800
Email does to me, at least offer
the possibility of reversing some

04:36:19.800 --> 04:36:23.960
of this loss, but only if poets
and editors keep their email

04:36:23.960 --> 04:36:27.130
and please not in electronic
form, but on good old paper,

04:36:27.130 --> 04:36:30.180
which at least we know
how to preserve.

04:36:30.180 --> 04:36:32.680 position:56%
I hope that this very brief overview

04:36:32.680 --> 04:36:36.510 position:56%
about New Direction's has given some
indication of a possible formula

04:36:36.510 --> 04:36:39.600
for eventual success as a
poetry publisher, although,

04:36:39.600 --> 04:36:42.850
to be honest I think that
Jay was nearly unique.

04:36:42.850 --> 04:36:45.950
He attracted and kept good
poets because he cared

04:36:45.950 --> 04:36:49.130
for the poet's interest
in every possible way.

04:36:49.130 --> 04:36:52.430
He also had the patience
to wait 10 to 20 years

04:36:52.430 --> 04:36:56.270
until the work was appreciated by
a broader public and to be ready

04:36:56.270 --> 04:37:00.160
with their books and
print when the call came.

04:37:00.160 --> 04:37:03.030
I also hope given that there
are publishers and poets

04:37:03.030 --> 04:37:05.350
in this audience, that you
will all think a little

04:37:05.350 --> 04:37:09.280
about future generations of
poets and student's of poetry.

04:37:09.280 --> 04:37:13.200
Keep your drafts, print out
your email, submit graciously

04:37:13.200 --> 04:37:15.300
to oral history interviews.

04:37:15.300 --> 04:37:17.380 position:56%
If you don't, yes, the printed books

04:37:17.380 --> 04:37:21.270
and your poetry may survive
for future generations.

04:37:21.270 --> 04:37:24.790
But those generations will have
lost the opportunity to appreciate

04:37:24.790 --> 04:37:28.130
that very personal passion for
poetry and the promulgation

04:37:28.130 --> 04:37:31.980
of poetry that comes through so
clearly in correspondence like that

04:37:31.980 --> 04:37:33.810
in the New Direction's archive.

04:37:33.810 --> 04:37:37.510 position:56%
And I think poetry and
scholarship will be poor without it.

after listening to Leslie,

04:37:51.400 --> 04:37:55.440
how can one doubt the importance
of archives and the kind

of archive actually that [inaudible]
building as well for the future,

04:37:59.410 --> 04:38:03.080
which is an important part of
the endeavor, as well as efforts

on the part of libraries
and archives

04:38:05.060 --> 04:38:09.810

&gt;&gt; Jack Shoemaker: On
one of the first pieces

04:38:19.620 --> 04:38:24.450
of advice he gave me was, get
good advisors, listen to them

04:38:24.450 --> 04:38:26.500
and ignore everyone else.

04:38:26.500 --> 04:38:31.070
A writer that Leslie didn't mention
that Laughlin died in despair

04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:35.390
over the lack of reading --
readership for was Kenneth Rexroth.

04:38:35.390 --> 04:38:40.950
In the early days, it was
clearly Pounds influence

04:38:40.950 --> 04:38:44.930
that ran the engine
that was New Directions.

04:38:44.930 --> 04:38:48.320
Shortly thereafter, a woman named
Barbara Guess was really the French

04:38:48.320 --> 04:38:53.470
informant to New Directions,
but when Pound returned

04:38:53.470 --> 04:38:56.750
after the Bollingen
fiasco, returned to Italy

04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:59.880
and really entered a
prolonged period of silence.

04:38:59.880 --> 04:39:01.550
It was Rexroth who stepped forward

04:39:01.550 --> 04:39:04.570
and taught Jay pretty
much everything he knew

04:39:04.570 --> 04:39:07.030
about Chinese writing,
about Japanese poetry,

04:39:07.030 --> 04:39:11.410
turned him onto a whole
generation of poets that he --

04:39:11.410 --> 04:39:14.190
Jay was not familiar
with, and was I think,

04:39:14.190 --> 04:39:18.590
in a way that people have not
appreciated, absolutely central

04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:20.810
to what we now think
of as the Beat Scene

04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:25.690
or the San Francisco Renaissance
or the New York School of Poetry.

04:39:25.690 --> 04:39:28.250
I also want to take a
chance for a short --

04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:32.100
we just shipped Herbert
Morrison's new book,

04:39:32.100 --> 04:39:34.850
so you can make your
way to a Border's.

04:39:34.850 --> 04:39:37.550
Because of the tyranny
of chain bookstores,

04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:40.530
we can now know precisely when
our book will be in their hands.

04:39:40.530 --> 04:39:42.930
It's 17 days from the day
it leaves our warehouse,

04:39:42.930 --> 04:39:49.420
so it should be there this
weekend -- fabulous book.

04:39:49.420 --> 04:39:51.880
Well, John was very kind,
really what I said to him was

04:39:51.880 --> 04:39:53.980
that I didn't think I
was going to be here

04:39:53.980 --> 04:39:56.190 position:56%
and I didn't have very much time to
think about what I was going to say,

04:39:56.190 --> 04:40:00.670
so I was just going to talk
about myself or my career.

04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:02.970
And I'm most anxious because I
thought that's what we were going

04:40:02.970 --> 04:40:04.820
to do to really respond
to questions.

04:40:04.820 --> 04:40:07.860
I have many responses to
what's been said already.

04:40:07.860 --> 04:40:11.630 position:56%
But I will give you a brief
overview of how I got to where I am.

04:40:11.630 --> 04:40:14.850
I've been involved with publishing
and selling poetry for a long time.

04:40:14.850 --> 04:40:18.640
The first thing I published
in 1965 was a broadside

04:40:18.640 --> 04:40:22.430
of Gary Snyder poem,
<i>The Bed in the Sky </i>.

04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:26.060 position:56%
The first book I published through a
press associated with my book shop,

04:40:26.060 --> 04:40:29.650
we called ourselves, The Bookshop
for Poets then, was a book of poems

04:40:29.650 --> 04:40:33.530
by the Vietnamese monk Thich
Nhat Hanh, <i>The Cry of Vietnam </i>.

04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:39.100
In 1966, Tye as he was
known at that stage had a --

04:40:39.100 --> 04:40:45.130
a singular job, he was the last
person Zen monks saw before they

04:40:45.130 --> 04:40:46.430
burned themselves.

04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:50.660
For a few of us, the late '60s

04:40:50.660 --> 04:40:54.000
and early '70s were the golden
age of poetry publishing.

04:40:54.000 --> 04:40:56.020
The counter culture
was in full bloom,

04:40:56.020 --> 04:40:58.410
poets were among the
leading scholars,

04:40:58.410 --> 04:41:01.790 position:56%
philosophers, activists and leaders.

04:41:01.790 --> 04:41:04.990
Donald Allen's [inaudible] <i>The New
American Poetry </i>introduces us all

04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:09.230
to the work of Charles Olsen,
Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov,

04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:13.920
Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg,
Gregory Corso and a dozen others.

04:41:13.920 --> 04:41:16.330
As a book seller, I could
easily recall the excitement

04:41:16.330 --> 04:41:20.290
as people would hear about and
look forward to new books of poems.

04:41:20.290 --> 04:41:24.020
I had a waiting list of all
things, of more than 30 customers

04:41:24.020 --> 04:41:27.230
for the first volume of
Ed Dorn's <i>Gunslinger </i>.

04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:29.120
As longhairs moved
into the countryside,

04:41:29.120 --> 04:41:30.420
they took along their copies

04:41:30.420 --> 04:41:33.040
of <i>Rip Rap </i>and <i>Cottish </i>[assumed
spelling] and to this day some

04:41:33.040 --> 04:41:36.030
of the largest audiences
for poetry are found

04:41:36.030 --> 04:41:38.860
in these back country locations.

04:41:38.860 --> 04:41:41.680
This was the golden age too
of small press magazines

04:41:41.680 --> 04:41:44.180
and journals and books.

04:41:44.180 --> 04:41:46.800
One could have an entire session
of this conference on the history

04:41:46.800 --> 04:41:48.930
and demise of the small
press movement.

04:41:48.930 --> 04:41:51.110
But let me just say that
nothing has been seen

04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:56.050
since that even approximates the
vitality of the scene at that time.

04:41:56.050 --> 04:42:00.130
It was in a direct way, government
support that managed to kill it.

04:42:00.130 --> 04:42:03.390
It is hard to remember
sometimes how visible poets were

04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:05.630
and what impact they had then.

04:42:05.630 --> 04:42:07.770
Press proceeded by the moderns,

04:42:07.770 --> 04:42:10.810
by the '60s Yates Pound
Elliot classes were taught

04:42:10.810 --> 04:42:13.470
in virtually every
university of the country.

04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:15.740
Frost was still in
everyone's memory,

04:42:15.740 --> 04:42:19.190
more his persona really
than his poetry.

04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:22.590
Stevens was -- Wallace Stevens was
the most influential unread poet

04:42:22.590 --> 04:42:23.890
since [inaudible].

04:42:23.890 --> 04:42:28.560
Marianne Moore was in Life
Magazine for God's sake.

04:42:28.560 --> 04:42:31.000
She worked on a project
with the Ford Motor Company

04:42:31.000 --> 04:42:32.790
that became the Edsel.

04:42:32.790 --> 04:42:37.210
I -- I once held in my
hands a long playing record

04:42:37.210 --> 04:42:40.450
of Cassius Clay [inaudible]
Muhammad Ali

04:42:40.450 --> 04:42:43.780
with the entire back cover
printing an extended [inaudible]

04:42:43.780 --> 04:42:46.920
by Marianne Moore, wherein she
[inaudible] Clay's couplets

04:42:46.920 --> 04:42:49.160
to Alexander Pope.

04:42:49.160 --> 04:42:51.540
The late '70s and '80s
were a desert.

04:42:51.540 --> 04:42:53.380
Poetry sales plummeted.

04:42:53.380 --> 04:42:57.460 position:56%
More importantly, the poets
themselves withdrew or so it seemed.

04:42:57.460 --> 04:43:00.740
And the decade of greed convinced
the literate audience in America

04:43:00.740 --> 04:43:04.820
to [inaudible] Calvinist
ancestors reading nonfiction;

04:43:04.820 --> 04:43:07.660
reading for profit
became the anthem.

04:43:07.660 --> 04:43:11.700
Small presses disappeared, poetry
sales dropped, so did the sales

04:43:11.700 --> 04:43:15.710
for serious work in translation,
serious experimental fiction

04:43:15.710 --> 04:43:17.730
and first and second novels.

04:43:17.730 --> 04:43:19.540 position:56%
There was, as this library named one

04:43:19.540 --> 04:43:22.710
of its own conferences,
a crisis in publishing.

04:43:22.710 --> 04:43:26.230
The poets who came after,
those of the late '70s

04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:28.360
and '80s were mostly invested

04:43:28.360 --> 04:43:32.550
in either a small minded personal
confession -- confessional poetry,

04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:35.470
sanctioned by the writing programs
that grew up like a cancer all

04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:39.560
over the country, or they veered
off into an opaque experimentalism

04:43:39.560 --> 04:43:42.350 position:56%
that essentially mocked the audience
with an arrogance that was more

04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:46.540
like academic writing than
poetry -- modernist or otherwise.

04:43:46.540 --> 04:43:49.250
It may be that these
matters are all cyclic.

04:43:49.250 --> 04:43:52.850 position:56%
I've begun to wonder what the impact
is of lyrics and popular songs

04:43:52.850 --> 04:43:57.180
on those most vulnerable,
listeners in their 20's.

04:43:57.180 --> 04:44:02.410
Frank Sinatra, Ira Gershwin,
Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan,

04:44:02.410 --> 04:44:10.260 position:56%
The Jefferson Airplane, The Beatles,
REM, Nirvana, Public Enemy, Dr. Dre,

04:44:10.260 --> 04:44:14.000
Tracy Chapman, Portishead,
Matchbook Twenty --

04:44:14.000 --> 04:44:16.180
each generation seems to
believe that the lyrics

04:44:16.180 --> 04:44:20.430
of their popular songs are
superior or in fact art

04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:23.420
and this leads those 20 something's
perhaps to an appreciation

04:44:23.420 --> 04:44:26.310
of the power of the heightened
language that is poetry.

04:44:26.310 --> 04:44:29.710
Maybe that's a seed,
but however it happened,

04:44:29.710 --> 04:44:32.520
the '90s was a time
of audience expansion.

04:44:32.520 --> 04:44:36.850 position:56%
From sales of poetry books to poetry
slams, the more accessible poets

04:44:36.850 --> 04:44:40.760
in their 40's and 50's and
very early 60's, show sales say

04:44:40.760 --> 04:44:44.510
above 20,000 copies that
their forebears might not have

04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:46.130
dared imagine.

04:44:46.130 --> 04:44:49.440 position:56%
A few of the old guard, Gary Snyder,
Wendell Berry, William Merwin

04:44:49.440 --> 04:44:52.290
and the like can match
the youngsters.

04:44:52.290 --> 04:44:54.340
This very week as we've
already heard,

04:44:54.340 --> 04:44:56.590
we have Seamus Heaney's
translation of <i>Beowulf </i>sitting

04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:58.910
on the New York Times
bestseller list with more

04:44:58.910 --> 04:45:02.770
than 45,000 copies shipped.

04:45:02.770 --> 04:45:06.740
Writing schools are crammed, so
are festivals and conferences,

04:45:06.740 --> 04:45:10.230
even the difficult work coming
out now causes response.

04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:12.700
News magazines will
actually devote articles

04:45:12.700 --> 04:45:15.450
to the difficulty of Jorie Graham.

04:45:15.450 --> 04:45:17.140
We must forgive them in
their apparent belief

04:45:17.140 --> 04:45:19.790
that she is America's
first difficult poet,

04:45:19.790 --> 04:45:23.550 position:56%
but I've actually had meals
interrupted when a poet I was dining

04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:26.170
with was recognized
by fellow diners.

04:45:26.170 --> 04:45:28.330
This is a time on fire.

04:45:28.330 --> 04:45:32.020
But lest we become too complacent,
let's insist on the long view

04:45:32.020 --> 04:45:34.700
and understand that
it was not always so,

04:45:34.700 --> 04:45:38.920
but it has been good before and
it will not always be this way

04:45:38.920 --> 04:45:41.970
and this probably won't
last very long.

04:45:41.970 --> 04:45:45.810
As poets and publishers, we can
enjoy ourselves for this moment.

04:45:45.810 --> 04:45:47.610
Thank you.

04:45:47.610 --> 04:45:54.300
[ Applause ]

04:45:54.300 --> 04:45:56.310
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: All right, first
I would like to ask panel members

04:45:56.310 --> 04:46:01.110
if anyone has any comment
or anything to add.

04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:03.450
All right, we all did our
-- yes, Bob, go ahead.

04:46:03.450 --> 04:46:04.750
Okay.

04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:06.050
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: Any
comments to the other people?

04:46:06.050 --> 04:46:07.350
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Yes.

04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:09.290
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: [Inaudible]
any comments for each other.

04:46:09.290 --> 04:46:10.590
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: You may.

04:46:10.590 --> 04:46:11.890
If not, let's go ahead
to the audience.

04:46:11.890 --> 04:46:13.970
All right, we're open.

04:46:13.970 --> 04:46:17.260
Again, if you have a question,
we'd appreciate if you would come

04:46:17.260 --> 04:46:21.580
to the mic so we could get it on
the recordings that we're making

04:46:21.580 --> 04:46:23.380
of this memorable occasion.

04:46:23.380 --> 04:46:25.880
May I have the first
comment or question

04:46:25.880 --> 04:46:27.180
from someone in the audience?

04:46:27.180 --> 04:46:28.480
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

04:46:28.480 --> 04:46:29.780
Yes, please.

04:46:29.780 --> 04:46:32.080
Sure, please.

04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:40.170
&gt;&gt; My name is Bob Stevens
and it's my understanding

04:46:40.170 --> 04:46:47.850
that through the Internet, anybody
can publish anything nowadays

04:46:47.850 --> 04:46:50.830
if they have the money to do it.

04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:56.220
And what this eliminates, at least
to some extent is screening --

04:46:56.220 --> 04:47:01.340
editorial screening and what it
does is disseminate what used

04:47:01.340 --> 04:47:06.180
to be a term of [inaudible]
vanity publishing.

04:47:06.180 --> 04:47:12.920
I wondered if the board would
like to comment on those things.

04:47:12.920 --> 04:47:14.220
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Anyone, Bob?

04:47:14.220 --> 04:47:15.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: Well, I guess I --

04:47:15.520 --> 04:47:19.320
I'd say that [inaudible] has always
been [inaudible] publishing --

04:47:19.320 --> 04:47:21.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

04:47:23.610 --> 04:47:28.740
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: [Inaudible] and
I suppose [inaudible] magazines

04:47:28.740 --> 04:47:34.230
of the sort much admired

04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:43.040 position:56%
by the [inaudible] other small
magazines imperative to [inaudible].

04:47:43.040 --> 04:47:46.230
So, [inaudible] magazines in
William's sense of them at least,

04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:51.040
wide open and not organized
around the exercise --

04:47:51.040 --> 04:47:57.130
the rigorous exercise of
editorial judgment and assessment.

04:47:57.130 --> 04:48:02.880 position:56%
There's always [inaudible] that we
should have a [inaudible] like this,

04:48:02.880 --> 04:48:07.190
lots of magazines, lots of
publications, publishing,

04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:17.880
all sorts of different people
with many different levels

04:48:17.880 --> 04:48:20.390
and that people who wanted to write
for those magazines and wanted

04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:22.100
to look around in them and discover
what people were doing would have

04:48:22.100 --> 04:48:23.400
access to them, would
[inaudible] those magazines.

04:48:23.400 --> 04:48:24.780
Alternatively, they have
all these [inaudible],

04:48:24.780 --> 04:48:29.450
at least in this century, of
the kinds of magazines organized

04:48:29.450 --> 04:48:34.160
around every [inaudible] apparently
of more rigorous principles

04:48:34.160 --> 04:48:36.040
of assessment than discrimination.

04:48:36.040 --> 04:48:40.060
And for better or for
worse, those --

04:48:40.060 --> 04:48:41.360
those magazines, many

04:48:41.360 --> 04:48:44.580
of them [inaudible] have been
rather long lived [inaudible].

04:48:44.580 --> 04:48:49.930
I said for better or for worse.

04:48:49.930 --> 04:48:56.170
I think we need both kinds of
magazines and I think the kinds

04:48:56.170 --> 04:48:59.970
of access that the Internet is
[inaudible] to large numbers

04:48:59.970 --> 04:49:05.950
of people whom -- many of
whom would not have access

04:49:05.950 --> 04:49:07.930
to widely circulated
little magazines.

04:49:07.930 --> 04:49:15.030
This [inaudible] in the same way,
you might mention that the --

04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:19.700
the development of [inaudible]
publishing has allowed lots

04:49:19.700 --> 04:49:24.520
of younger people to
create small magazines

04:49:24.520 --> 04:49:26.910
with very small sums of money.

04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:31.090
And with considerable ingenuity
to get them [inaudible],

04:49:31.090 --> 04:49:36.690
at least in some locations
where most people are likely

04:49:36.690 --> 04:49:39.320
to see them and to purchase them.

04:49:39.320 --> 04:49:44.220
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's a good thing.

04:49:44.220 --> 04:49:47.860
[Inaudible] that kind
of magazine, but I --

04:49:47.860 --> 04:49:53.460
I [inaudible] St. Lawrence Book
Store and Greenwich Village,

04:49:53.460 --> 04:49:55.790
I like to be able to look
around [inaudible] magazines

04:49:55.790 --> 04:49:59.530 position:56%
that have been published [inaudible]
by groups of young people

04:49:59.530 --> 04:50:00.830
who don't have access to the
[inaudible] or to [inaudible]

04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:02.590
to see what they're doing.

04:50:02.590 --> 04:50:05.030
So, I mean, in that sense,
it seems to me a measure

04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:09.740
of a vital literary scene, that it
creates access for lots of people

04:50:09.740 --> 04:50:14.340
to publishing -- different
kinds of publishing,

04:50:14.340 --> 04:50:15.640
different kinds of audiences.

04:50:15.640 --> 04:50:19.350
I think that's what [inaudible].

04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:21.320
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Jack?

04:50:21.320 --> 04:50:22.620
&gt;&gt; Jack Shoemaker: [Inaudible]
suggest that [inaudible] had money

04:50:22.620 --> 04:50:23.920
and I would suggest to you

04:50:23.920 --> 04:50:33.820
that in the late '60s it was a
lot more direct and less expensive

04:50:33.820 --> 04:50:37.380
to buy a cassette [inaudible]
machine, a stencil maker

04:50:37.380 --> 04:50:38.820
and you were in the business
that afternoon as a publisher.

04:50:38.820 --> 04:50:41.250 position:56%
You did not have to learn computers;
you did not have to spend $895

04:50:41.250 --> 04:50:42.550
to buy the basic equipment.

04:50:42.550 --> 04:50:47.240
And then, I was thinking
of the comments

04:50:47.240 --> 04:50:51.010
about the [inaudible] publishing,
I have to look at slate a lot.

04:50:51.010 --> 04:50:55.400
For a while, slate was
publishing poems [inaudible].

04:50:55.400 --> 04:51:00.160
Accompanied by their photograph
[inaudible] American poetry review

04:51:00.160 --> 04:51:03.040 position:56%
[inaudible], but also accompanied by
a reading, so that if you could --

04:51:03.040 --> 04:51:06.310
you clicked on the material
and you could get a reading

04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:07.610
of that poem by the poet.

04:51:07.610 --> 04:51:09.430
Well, the first time I tried that,

04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:11.440
it took me nearly four
hours [laughter].

04:51:11.440 --> 04:51:15.440
I never did get it.

04:51:15.440 --> 04:51:16.960
So, we're talking about
[inaudible] --

04:51:16.960 --> 04:51:18.520
you're really worried
about standards, I think.

04:51:18.520 --> 04:51:22.120
And standards in the literary
magazines will always remind me

04:51:22.120 --> 04:51:24.930
of Margaret Anderson,
<i>Little Review </i>,

04:51:24.930 --> 04:51:26.230
one of the most distinguished
magazines

04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:27.530
in the history of literary
magazines.

04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:31.080
She had the audacity to ship
her subscribers a blank issue

04:51:31.080 --> 04:51:37.450
because she could not find work
enough -- good enough [inaudible].

04:51:37.450 --> 04:51:41.760
Now you can't imagine that
happening these days [inaudible].

04:51:41.760 --> 04:51:43.100
I'm not too worried
about [inaudible].

04:51:43.100 --> 04:51:44.830
You know the writer Richard
[inaudible] many years ago,

04:51:44.830 --> 04:51:47.340
I published a little bit
of Richard [inaudible].

04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:52.310
Richard wrote a short
story about the --

04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:56.780
a library for unpublished work.

04:51:56.780 --> 04:52:03.030 position:56%
You would send your copy off to this
library where [inaudible] archived.

04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:06.020
And it was in fact,
[inaudible] library was opened

04:52:06.020 --> 04:52:07.320
[inaudible] principles.

04:52:07.320 --> 04:52:11.500
And they added one
interesting [inaudible],

04:52:11.500 --> 04:52:15.400
they refused to keep
records or to expose records

04:52:15.400 --> 04:52:17.410
of what was checked out [laughter].

04:52:17.410 --> 04:52:21.040 position:56%
It didn't take very long to discover

04:52:21.040 --> 04:52:24.320
that nothing had been
checked out [laughter].

04:52:24.320 --> 04:52:26.570
So [inaudible] material up
there on the web right now,

04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:31.770
it's easy to get it up there,
it's easy to maintain it up there.

04:52:31.770 --> 04:52:35.550
[Inaudible] I think one of the
most interesting of [inaudible]

04:52:35.550 --> 04:52:42.350
to develop is for us to understand
what is meant by a hit [inaudible].

04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:45.770
And once that's understood, I think
that we're going to see [inaudible]

04:52:45.770 --> 04:52:49.430
that is going to make all
-- all other [inaudible].

04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:53.400
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Thanks, Jack.

04:52:53.400 --> 04:52:54.800
One here and then I'll come to you.

04:52:54.800 --> 04:53:00.230
Yes, please -- would you
come up to the mic please?

04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:03.010
&gt;&gt; I just wonder [inaudible]
talked about,

04:53:03.010 --> 04:53:09.590
what are the necessary qualities
for a good poetry editor?

04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:19.110
&gt;&gt; Leslie Morris: Well, I suggested
what made Jay a good poetry editor.

04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:24.970
It was his passion for
poetry, his willingness

04:53:24.970 --> 04:53:29.270
to lend money -- that
was very important.

04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:34.120
And he was fortunate in having
family money to a certain extent.

04:53:34.120 --> 04:53:39.830
He had a trust fund, it didn't
generate that much income.

04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:44.080
He had an aunt, Lila, who would
constantly give New Directions

04:53:44.080 --> 04:53:46.130
infusions of new money.

04:53:46.130 --> 04:53:50.220
But this also had, and it's
something I didn't talk about,

04:53:50.220 --> 04:53:53.750
a somewhat dampening effect on
what New Directions published

04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:55.090
because Jay was always concerned

04:53:55.090 --> 04:53:59.070
that Aunt Lila might get
upset by some of the stuff.

04:53:59.070 --> 04:54:02.120
It had been submitted
to him to publish.

04:54:02.120 --> 04:54:03.870
So, for example, he
was offered Lolita

04:54:03.870 --> 04:54:07.860
by [inaudible] and
did not publish it.

04:54:07.860 --> 04:54:12.310
And there are other instances
of -- of big things that --

04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:15.270
that he turned down simply
because he was worried

04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:19.130
about his financial backer.

04:54:19.130 --> 04:54:22.100
I think the personal
involvement that Jay had

04:54:22.100 --> 04:54:26.350
with his authors was the thing
that they valued the most.

04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:30.810 position:56%
And as a quote from Denise Levertov,
I think made clear it was --

04:54:30.810 --> 04:54:34.300
it was a personal involvement and
an involvement with their work.

04:54:34.300 --> 04:54:37.490
Jay himself, although
Pound, was so cutting

04:54:37.490 --> 04:54:40.740
about his own poetry
was a good poet.

04:54:40.740 --> 04:54:46.760
And he understood what his poets
went through in their writing

04:54:46.760 --> 04:54:50.130
and tried in every way that
he could to support it.

04:54:50.130 --> 04:54:55.620
That was what made him I
think a good publisher.

04:54:55.620 --> 04:54:58.050
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Any other
-- yes, Jerry, please.

04:54:58.050 --> 04:54:59.350
&gt;&gt; Jerry W. Ward: If I -- if I
might address this very briefly,

04:54:59.350 --> 04:55:00.890 position:56%
[inaudible] there were various kinds

04:55:00.890 --> 04:55:04.000
of editors [inaudible] depends
upon whether we're just talking

04:55:04.000 --> 04:55:13.040
about magazines or anthologies
and I have some experience

04:55:13.040 --> 04:55:14.870
with the latter -- all
with both, I should say.

04:55:14.870 --> 04:55:20.530
But I think the -- the -- a good
editor does use time differently

04:55:20.530 --> 04:55:29.200
and does take time, not just on
the mimeograph or [inaudible],

04:55:29.200 --> 04:55:37.240
but actually even with the
worst [inaudible] establishes

04:55:37.240 --> 04:55:42.420
a communication.

04:55:42.420 --> 04:55:45.140
And if this -- this is a writer

04:55:45.140 --> 04:55:49.230
that US [inaudible] are extremely
interested in might even say,

04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:51.590
"Would you resubmit this if
you agree that certain kinds

04:55:55.320 --> 04:55:56.040
of changes ought to take place?"

04:55:56.040 --> 04:56:01.940
Now when you're doing
what few of us are doing

04:56:01.940 --> 04:56:04.280
with any [inaudible]
anymore anthologies,

04:56:04.280 --> 04:56:05.580
you have another problem
[inaudible].

04:56:05.580 --> 04:56:12.040
I think we all need
to know about this.

04:56:12.040 --> 04:56:19.750
There are many poets if you are
doing anthology, which you think

04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:24.540
of as being constructive
[inaudible] principles

04:56:24.540 --> 04:56:26.480
or your trying to [inaudible]
of time.

04:56:26.480 --> 04:56:29.600
Yet you would like to
have had [inaudible].

04:56:29.600 --> 04:56:31.900
Now those who have been
sufficiently [inaudible],

04:56:31.900 --> 04:56:41.100
because their work is usually in
the public domain, but all angels

04:56:41.100 --> 04:56:44.480
and saints had better help you with
living people who have [inaudible].

04:56:47.050 --> 04:56:52.780
When I was trying to do <i>Troubled
Water </i>, if I had not been able

04:56:52.780 --> 04:56:54.080
to figure out [inaudible] --

04:56:54.080 --> 04:57:00.080
when I had Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich asking me for $5000

04:57:00.080 --> 04:57:02.080
for one poem, I just
started cursing.

04:57:02.080 --> 04:57:11.300
And I said, although I like the
work of this person very much,

04:57:11.300 --> 04:57:15.940
if it means I only include one
poem that's going to be in it,

04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:21.410 position:56%
people are going to ask, "Why didn't
you have more of this writer?"

04:57:21.410 --> 04:57:28.520
And I'm going to [inaudible]
say, "The writer costs too much."

04:57:28.520 --> 04:57:32.670
So, we have to be aware
as editors I think,

04:57:32.670 --> 04:57:34.700
that very often our intentions
cannot be [inaudible] anthologies

04:57:34.700 --> 04:57:38.910
simply doesn't matter [inaudible]
publishers we have unless we were

04:57:38.910 --> 04:57:50.080
independently wealthy, not
willing to put up the kind of money

04:57:50.080 --> 04:57:54.710
that would get some of the work we
want because other publishers are

04:57:54.710 --> 04:57:56.400
out to line their pockets and
rightfully the pockets [inaudible].

04:57:56.400 --> 04:57:58.710
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: I think on this
question, we can march right

04:57:58.710 --> 04:58:01.810
down the table, Jack and then Bob.

04:58:01.810 --> 04:58:03.110
&gt;&gt; Jack Shoemaker:
[Inaudible] think for a minute.

04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:07.530
I think you should understand the
place that a subsidiary rights

04:58:07.530 --> 04:58:10.520
and anthology rights, [inaudible]
any given writer's income.

04:58:10.520 --> 04:58:15.800
A book like Robert Duncan
publishes well by New Directions

04:58:15.800 --> 04:58:19.800
for several books is because
of the class group [inaudible]

04:58:19.800 --> 04:58:24.330
for his work was making more
money on subsidiary rights

04:58:24.330 --> 04:58:25.630
than he was on royalties.

04:58:25.630 --> 04:58:27.990
And it's partly the
editor's responsibility

04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:33.400
because the editor gives a majority
of that money to the poet himself.

04:58:33.400 --> 04:58:37.380
The part of our job is to protect
them from their own benevolence

04:58:37.380 --> 04:58:43.270
and to help them maintain a certain
[inaudible] level via academic

04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:44.570
and anthology rights.

04:58:44.570 --> 04:58:46.650
Somebody's making money on those
books, whether it's the editor

04:58:46.650 --> 04:58:49.270
or the publisher, somebody's
making money on those books.

04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:51.970
They're very expensive and
somebody [inaudible] that --

04:58:51.970 --> 04:58:56.330
that that somebody ought to include
the writer's who are [inaudible].

04:58:56.330 --> 04:58:58.720
I think, an answer to
your question, I --

04:58:58.720 --> 04:59:02.450
I don't think there's
much difference

04:59:02.450 --> 04:59:07.110 position:56%
between what makes a good editor
and what makes a good poetry editor.

04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:11.800 position:56%
What makes a good editor in my view
is somebody who's capable of getting

04:59:11.800 --> 04:59:14.870
in the [inaudible],
discovering their voice

04:59:14.870 --> 04:59:17.160
and helping them do
the best job they can

04:59:17.160 --> 04:59:18.630
at what they've set out to do.

04:59:18.630 --> 04:59:23.920 position:56%
And that doesn't matter whether it's
fiction or poetry or nonfiction.

04:59:23.920 --> 04:59:27.870
Nonfiction manuscripts come forward
and they're exquisitely prepared.

04:59:27.870 --> 04:59:31.620
Some -- I had to publish a writer
who's [inaudible] as the writer

04:59:31.620 --> 04:59:33.490
of shitty drafts, Anne LaMott,

04:59:33.490 --> 04:59:35.910
she sends in the messiest
manuscripts you've ever seen.

04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:39.430
She's [inaudible], but it ranges
all the way through there.

04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:47.180 position:56%
I've edited Gary Snyder's
[inaudible] 1965, so what I gave him

04:59:47.180 --> 04:59:48.590
in essence when we were working

04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:51.220
on that long poem was a
single faithful reader

04:59:51.220 --> 04:59:54.720
over a long period of time.

04:59:54.720 --> 04:59:58.220
I also was able to point
out to him that the couple

04:59:58.220 --> 05:00:02.220 position:56%
of times he faced actual [inaudible]
and a couple of times he needed

05:00:02.220 --> 05:00:03.520
to double check his sources.

05:00:03.520 --> 05:00:05.670
So, you know, we do all kinds of --

05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:08.410
of things like that that I
can't imagine sitting there

05:00:08.410 --> 05:00:12.430
and writing a letter to every
submission that comes in,

05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:14.810
I would think of myself
as a therapist.

05:00:14.810 --> 05:00:17.240
I -- I cannot -- I --

05:00:17.240 --> 05:00:21.590
I spent [inaudible] 85%
of our [inaudible] writers

05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:25.400
that we have [inaudible]
and 15% of the --

05:00:25.400 --> 05:00:30.370
of the time trying to investigate
those who wished to be [inaudible].

05:00:30.370 --> 05:00:35.210
And it would be a terrible thing
if we weren't able to do that.

05:00:35.210 --> 05:00:38.060
I don't know about this
obligation for response is.

05:00:38.060 --> 05:00:42.090
Now if you're sitting at home one
morning and you're drinking a glass

05:00:42.090 --> 05:00:44.520
of milk and you think,
"Boy, I could do that."

05:00:44.520 --> 05:00:48.040
You go out and you buy
yourself a cow and a couple

05:00:48.040 --> 05:00:52.890
of weeks later you send a handmade
quart of milk to Berkley Farms

05:00:52.890 --> 05:00:54.970
and say, "See, I can do that,
you should publish my milk."

05:00:54.970 --> 05:00:59.420
I mean, it doesn't happen
in almost any other field.

05:00:59.420 --> 05:01:04.690
[Inaudible] we don't send stuff to
Chevy saying, "I figured out how

05:01:04.690 --> 05:01:08.040
to make a car [inaudible]."

05:01:08.040 --> 05:01:10.270
I think, you know, there's
a tremendous amount of --

05:01:10.270 --> 05:01:13.040
of what we've figured out after
[inaudible] was that those people

05:01:13.040 --> 05:01:15.510
who couldn't scientific,
couldn't be creative.

05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:17.510
Those of us who couldn't
carry a tune

05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:20.100
or [inaudible] virtually
born [inaudible].

05:01:20.100 --> 05:01:22.600
And so we then decided
we could be writers

05:01:22.600 --> 05:01:26.200
since we couldn't be anything
else, we could be writers.

05:01:26.200 --> 05:01:29.270
And there's a -- there's a
tremendous [inaudible] tremendous

05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:30.920
competency out there.

05:01:30.920 --> 05:01:35.890
But I remember two things
Lou Welsh once said,

05:01:35.890 --> 05:01:40.160
[inaudible] not very many people
do it very well, no one knows why.

05:01:40.160 --> 05:01:45.230
And [inaudible] is
no excuse [laughter].

05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:47.600
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Bob?

05:01:47.600 --> 05:01:48.900
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: Well, [inaudible]

05:01:48.900 --> 05:01:57.840
for the most part [inaudible]
just said would be --

05:01:57.840 --> 05:02:10.140
could be possible for anyone
[inaudible] could not be done.

05:02:10.140 --> 05:02:12.320
So there -- there is that.

05:02:12.320 --> 05:02:14.690
[Inaudible] sheer physical
impossibility [inaudible]

05:02:14.690 --> 05:02:17.910
and then I think also [inaudible]
trying to suggest the need to be

05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:22.060
in regular contact with the people

05:02:24.790 --> 05:02:28.490
that you have committed
yourself to [inaudible].

05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:33.250 position:56%
I will say, in response to
something that was mentioned earlier

05:02:33.250 --> 05:02:38.780
in this panel, that a surprising
number of the writers we publish,

05:02:38.780 --> 05:02:43.340
including many very
experienced writers,

05:02:43.340 --> 05:02:53.810 position:56%
but considerable [inaudible] that is
in [inaudible] editorial criticism

05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:57.560
and suggestions for
revision [inaudible].

05:02:57.560 --> 05:03:01.050
Some writers, in fact, when they
submit [inaudible] material,

05:03:01.050 --> 05:03:03.070
if they published [inaudible]
before,

05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:06.240
actually invites critical
assessment,

05:03:06.240 --> 05:03:12.220
share with you those feelings
[inaudible] poem they've sent

05:03:12.220 --> 05:03:16.080 position:56%
[inaudible] and we have those kinds
of editorial relationships with lots

05:03:16.080 --> 05:03:20.470
of writers, which of course,
absorbed an enormous amount of time

05:03:20.470 --> 05:03:26.280
and [inaudible] very important
time, it's time well spent.

05:03:26.280 --> 05:03:27.750
&gt;&gt; John Y Cole: Thank you.

05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:30.650
You're next.

05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:39.480
&gt;&gt; This is sort of a
two-part question too.

05:03:39.480 --> 05:03:43.810
One is addressed to [inaudible]
or Robert [inaudible].

05:03:43.810 --> 05:03:49.370
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: It's for the
whole panel, I guess, right.

05:03:49.370 --> 05:03:50.830
Okay.

05:03:50.830 --> 05:03:54.240
&gt;&gt; Robert, you said that the amount

05:03:54.240 --> 05:03:58.770
of unsolicited manuscripts
have skyrocketed

05:03:58.770 --> 05:04:07.290
and what I noticed is [inaudible]
of people who are having crisis

05:04:07.290 --> 05:04:12.060
as a way of getting manuscripts
and then that fee is attached.

05:04:12.060 --> 05:04:16.610
Could you discuss the trend

05:04:17.710 --> 05:04:20.760
that [inaudible] editors
feel about it [inaudible].

05:04:20.760 --> 05:04:24.100
This year's writer market
by the way, has pages

05:04:24.100 --> 05:04:26.960
and pages of literary crisis.

05:04:26.960 --> 05:04:32.930
I wonder if this is a trend
that is going to increase and --

05:04:32.930 --> 05:04:34.280
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: You
want to ask a second part

05:04:34.280 --> 05:04:35.850
of that now and then we'll --

05:04:35.850 --> 05:04:40.720
&gt;&gt; The second part is because
of the amount of work coming

05:04:40.720 --> 05:04:44.560
through your -- over your
[inaudible] should poets

05:04:44.560 --> 05:04:49.260
like fiction writers send
query letters or how to --

05:04:49.260 --> 05:04:59.400
how does unknown [inaudible]
press [inaudible]?

05:04:59.400 --> 05:05:03.380
&gt;&gt; Robert Pinksy: I've just
written a letter complaining

05:05:03.380 --> 05:05:04.680
about [inaudible].

05:05:04.680 --> 05:05:09.610
The first [inaudible] is a
Ponzi scheme, it's a [inaudible]

05:05:09.610 --> 05:05:13.000
that is organized also, and I
don't mean to be terribly cynical,

05:05:13.000 --> 05:05:14.300
but I think it's very clear

05:05:14.300 --> 05:05:17.890
that these people [inaudible]
charging $15 reading fees

05:05:17.890 --> 05:05:25.520
for poetry submissions where
first prize is $500 [inaudible].

05:05:25.520 --> 05:05:29.690
So I would be very [inaudible]
like I would be [inaudible].

05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:35.470
There are very few that do very few
legitimate [inaudible] will ask you

05:05:35.470 --> 05:05:38.160
for a so-called [inaudible]
fee or a submissions fee.

05:05:38.160 --> 05:05:42.330
And having said that, I think some
of the university [inaudible],

05:05:42.330 --> 05:05:45.990
oh it's [inaudible]
under significant prizes

05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:49.670
that are [inaudible]
by the institution

05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:51.660
and seem to have [inaudible].

05:05:51.660 --> 05:05:55.440
Those are accesses to
[inaudible] very important

05:05:55.440 --> 05:06:00.000 position:56%
from the previous [inaudible] Robert
Hess -- first book was [inaudible].

05:06:00.000 --> 05:06:06.220 position:56%
So, [inaudible] it's really a matter
of judgment, but I would stay away

05:06:06.220 --> 05:06:11.460
from [inaudible] associated
with a legitimate operation.

05:06:11.460 --> 05:06:16.360
&gt;&gt; Robert Boyers: I guess
typically what you do recognize

05:06:16.360 --> 05:06:25.810
or what you're expected to
recognize is the name of the judge

05:06:25.810 --> 05:06:34.320
or judges associated with
a particular competition

05:06:34.320 --> 05:06:36.500
for which they [inaudible].

05:06:36.500 --> 05:06:39.470
That automatically is
expected [inaudible].

05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:43.490
And I suppose it does.

05:06:43.490 --> 05:06:48.540
But you -- you [inaudible]
a personal [inaudible]

05:06:48.540 --> 05:06:52.910
in a new competition,
judged by [inaudible].

05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:59.340
It's genuine and -- and in that
sense, however skeptical you may be

05:06:59.340 --> 05:07:02.050
about being [inaudible],

05:07:02.050 --> 05:07:07.940
it's unlikely that [inaudible]
poet looking to make a place

05:07:07.940 --> 05:07:14.750
for themselves, you pass up
the opportunity to pay $15 here

05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:19.480
and $25 there [inaudible].

05:07:19.480 --> 05:07:21.440
So that's -- that's one thing.

05:07:21.440 --> 05:07:26.220
I would not -- I think
[inaudible] send my work out,

05:07:26.220 --> 05:07:31.780
send [inaudible] letters because
I don't think that managers

05:07:31.780 --> 05:07:38.240
at that time [inaudible] letters,
they just respond to manuscripts

05:07:38.240 --> 05:07:40.360
if they could do it [inaudible].

05:07:40.360 --> 05:07:44.820
There are plenty of
editors [inaudible].

05:07:44.820 --> 05:07:47.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

05:07:48.510 --> 05:07:51.970
&gt;&gt; I'd just like to add that
maybe we should remember some

05:07:51.970 --> 05:07:57.160
of the things that Paul Breslin
said this morning about slams

05:07:57.160 --> 05:07:59.050
and think very seriously
about the whole [inaudible].

05:07:59.050 --> 05:08:06.770
Because along with that, I
realized that many young people

05:08:06.770 --> 05:08:13.300
who would ordinarily [inaudible]
being published have turned away

05:08:13.300 --> 05:08:15.420
from that [inaudible].

05:08:15.420 --> 05:08:24.480
And now, you find that slams,
cybers and other kinds of things,

05:08:24.480 --> 05:08:33.200
a lot of young talented writers who
have simply bypassed the old route

05:08:33.200 --> 05:08:36.460
of getting published [inaudible]

05:08:37.760 --> 05:08:42.890
or they have used the laptop
publishing of something.

05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:50.980
[Inaudible], but I think the
world now has some of the choices

05:08:50.980 --> 05:08:56.700
that a number of people who are
not looking for the [inaudible]

05:08:56.700 --> 05:09:03.670
from the establishment have decided
that whether we think they're good

05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:07.430
or not, they are going to
get their voices [inaudible].

05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:10.320
&gt;&gt; John Y. Cole: Time
for another question.

05:09:10.320 --> 05:09:14.910
Well, if not, I'm going to
declare this panel over.

05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:17.180
I wish to thank the
audience and in particular,

05:09:17.180 --> 05:09:18.630
I'd like to thank our panelists.

05:09:18.630 --> 05:09:21.940
We're going to reconvene,
however, at 4:30, please join me

05:09:21.940 --> 05:09:23.740
in giving our panelists a hand.

05:09:23.740 --> 05:09:29.040
[ Applause ]

05:09:29.040 --> 05:09:31.970
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: We're going
from cyberspace to inner space.

05:09:31.970 --> 05:09:36.630
We've had a lot of
context for poetry today.

05:09:36.630 --> 05:09:40.800
We've had historical context
and interesting discussions

05:09:40.800 --> 05:09:45.650
of publishing context,
now we get the real thing.

05:09:45.650 --> 05:09:50.090
And we're getting poets
reading their own poetry,

05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:55.190
which is after all, a
foundation for it all.

05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:58.270
They're going to read in the order
that they are in the program,

05:09:58.270 --> 05:10:02.010
which is the order that you see
them here, progressing down.

05:10:02.010 --> 05:10:09.590 position:56%
Robert tells me, heroically that he
will read for three or four minutes.

05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:14.360
May I just say, at this point, just
remind the audience that there is

05:10:14.360 --> 05:10:19.560
at eight o'clock tonight in
Coolidge, a reading of <i>Dante </i>.

05:10:19.560 --> 05:10:23.090
I think under the circumstances,
Robert will not read,

05:10:23.090 --> 05:10:27.730
but William Merwin who is a
absolutely first rate reader will

05:10:27.730 --> 05:10:30.830
read for both Robert and himself

05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:32.780
from <i>The Inferno </i>and
<i>The [inaudible] </i>.

05:10:32.780 --> 05:10:35.950
I mean, excuse me,
<i>The Purgatorio </i>.

05:10:35.950 --> 05:10:39.460
All right now, my job
is to get out of the way

05:10:39.460 --> 05:10:41.610
and hand it over to Joshua.

05:10:41.610 --> 05:10:43.780
They will just go down the line.

05:10:43.780 --> 05:10:46.080
Joshua?

05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:58.890
&gt;&gt; Joshua Weiner: Well, okay,
I'm as excited to be here today,

05:10:58.890 --> 05:11:04.280
as I was last night, which means
my nerves are a little strained.

05:11:04.280 --> 05:11:13.610
I'm going to -- most of the
poems I'm going to be reading are

05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:18.820
from a book called
<i>The World's Room </i>.

05:11:18.820 --> 05:11:21.880
And this is the opening poem.

05:11:23.880 --> 05:11:33.710 position:56%
Bruno's night -- up the hill of
snoring, the father climbs in dream,

05:11:33.710 --> 05:11:40.280
the mother sinks in silence
and baby sucks its thumb.

05:11:40.280 --> 05:11:47.380
But struggling next door, boy Bruno
smells the dawn while the sick,

05:11:47.380 --> 05:11:53.390
the sad, the torn apart
quiet their song.

05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:57.820
Dropped curtains hide the
night's inspired fantastic pomp

05:11:57.820 --> 05:12:00.760
that liquidates with light.

05:12:00.760 --> 05:12:07.150
Don't oversleep, wake up,
run to the grimy window,

05:12:07.150 --> 05:12:09.160
press your nose to the dirt.

05:12:09.160 --> 05:12:15.970
Under the dawn, you follow
the mass of gathering earth.

05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:37.900
This next one is a -- is a poem in
couplets and it's in two voices.

05:12:37.900 --> 05:12:45.150
The -- the first voice is the
voice of a not yet conceived child.

05:12:45.150 --> 05:12:51.360 position:56%
The second voice is the poet's voice
and they're engaged in an argument.

05:12:51.360 --> 05:12:54.870 position:56%
The first voice here is the child's.

05:12:54.870 --> 05:13:01.950
The not yet child, why
won't you make me now,

05:13:01.950 --> 05:13:05.430
who wants a life inside your life.

05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:10.650
I fear you as a thief
stealing about the --

05:13:10.650 --> 05:13:17.260
stealing about the orchards of
my future, green fruit glistening

05:13:17.260 --> 05:13:19.400
above a starving creature.

05:13:19.400 --> 05:13:26.090
To increase the coin buried inside
yourself, you need exchange it

05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:30.840
for an alien wealth,
wealth being you.

05:13:30.840 --> 05:13:36.560
I need to spend my horde on public
conquests of a private world,

05:13:36.560 --> 05:13:41.540
take drugs and chances,
love recklessly and build.

05:13:42.810 --> 05:13:49.560
I promise, I'm your most
famous bright adventure.

05:13:49.560 --> 05:13:54.130
My stances will collapse,
mere rooms in nature.

05:13:54.130 --> 05:14:00.710
I understand you dwell on agony,

05:14:00.710 --> 05:14:06.600
but there you'll shape
your strongest poem, me.

05:14:06.600 --> 05:14:09.400
Your cry will play the
tune ending my work

05:14:09.400 --> 05:14:13.020
as health plays boss
over the art I serve.

05:14:14.440 --> 05:14:19.730
Not always helpless,
one day I'll help you

05:14:19.730 --> 05:14:23.800
and you'll be grateful
for what I give to you.

05:14:23.800 --> 05:14:29.520
Fever, high blood pressure,
sleeplessness, I've my beloved

05:14:29.520 --> 05:14:32.410
to cause me such distress.

05:14:32.410 --> 05:14:37.640
And in my distress,
I find again denial,

05:14:37.640 --> 05:14:44.010
if I'm the father how
can I stay the child.

05:14:44.010 --> 05:14:48.800
Make me and as your face grows old,

05:14:48.800 --> 05:14:55.010
you'll find in my face,
your face taking hold.

05:14:55.010 --> 05:14:58.040
That's vanity you call prosperity,

05:14:58.040 --> 05:15:03.800
afraid the future bears
what you want to see,

05:15:03.800 --> 05:15:08.590
of where I could become
but might not be.

05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:31.120 position:56%
The -- the poet lost the argument
and this next poem is my imagination

05:15:31.120 --> 05:15:37.020
of my son's voice at about 11
months, when he's just starting

05:15:37.020 --> 05:15:42.230
to discover a word
or two for himself.

05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:45.710
It's called <i>The World's Room </i>.

05:15:47.730 --> 05:15:53.980
Big meat, fur teeth picks
me up, puts me down.

05:15:53.980 --> 05:15:56.260
Do it, do it, do it now.

05:15:56.260 --> 05:16:04.540
Dotta, doggie, puppet God, he
will, he won't, the floor is cold.

05:16:04.540 --> 05:16:12.940 position:56%
I hunt my milk song, she titted
sweet for me, tongue in, tongue out,

05:16:12.940 --> 05:16:18.340
mister, mister, I can sniff them
at the household, wagging bye-bye.

05:16:18.340 --> 05:16:20.280
Bye-bye, why?

05:16:20.280 --> 05:16:31.030
Hi, hey where, hey how, a door, a
page, both swing first word, hello.

05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:33.510
I said it, hello.

05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:42.430
Hear it, they hear it, they heard
me, it grows to the room we're in.

05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:44.610
Next page please turn.

05:16:44.610 --> 05:16:47.040
Do it, do it, do it now.

05:16:47.040 --> 05:16:53.450
She will, she won't,
why, try, my, cry.

05:16:53.450 --> 05:16:57.160
I'll find a shape,
tongue in, tongue out,

05:16:57.160 --> 05:17:02.070
and be that shape I make obey me.

05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:11.780
I love it, big meat, warm arm,
I love it, wants me, milk song.

05:17:11.780 --> 05:17:15.680
The page opens, a phone opens to,

05:17:15.680 --> 05:17:18.860
I'll turn it on and
walk right through.

05:17:18.860 --> 05:17:23.820
Next page, please turn,
do it, do it, do it now.

05:17:23.820 --> 05:17:26.970
I'm in the page and now I'm gone.

Switching modes here.

05:17:40.510 --> 05:17:48.660
This is a -- this is a --
an ode to a former landlord

05:17:48.660 --> 05:17:56.370
and it gives me tremendous
to be able to read it here

05:17:56.370 --> 05:18:01.470
at The Library of Congress
[laughter].

05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:09.510
In -- in the poem, I -- I address
-- I address the landlord directly,

05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:14.610
but I've stolen a name, Crispis
Solistius [assumed spelling]

05:18:14.610 --> 05:18:20.790 position:56%
from a horse and this is a character
that horse speaks to directly

05:18:20.790 --> 05:18:24.720
in a poem of his own that
the poet, David Ferry,

05:18:24.720 --> 05:18:28.050
translates as Averis
[assumed spelling].

05:18:33.230 --> 05:18:38.180
Tempest, 3000 miles from this
outermost seaside province,

05:18:38.180 --> 05:18:42.970
sky darkening to a purple
amber wash across the harbor.

05:18:42.970 --> 05:18:48.250
You, Crispis Solistius, sit in
your house perched among hills

05:18:48.250 --> 05:18:50.930
of a western paradise and consult

05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:56.010
with your lawyer how
best to sue my ass.

05:18:56.010 --> 05:19:00.160
Lift your pen from the page
and look out your window.

05:19:00.160 --> 05:19:04.560
How the heavy light seeks the
world and warms it, drying the sod

05:19:04.560 --> 05:19:08.690
and earth and seducing
reluctant buds.

05:19:08.690 --> 05:19:14.000
Just weeks ago, rain that never
stopped would never stop it seemed,

05:19:14.000 --> 05:19:18.440
attacked the panes like buckshot
flying sideways with the wind.

05:19:18.440 --> 05:19:23.250
Bad news in the mail,
phone, fax, online,

05:19:23.250 --> 05:19:25.450
your enemy's triple headed barking

05:19:25.450 --> 05:19:29.550
on a river edge brimmed
over, plosive and cascading.

05:19:29.550 --> 05:19:34.320
The river of your ire, strangling
by submerging as dream --

05:19:34.320 --> 05:19:39.020
as dreams too filled up with
rain and banks refused to hold.

05:19:39.020 --> 05:19:46.910 position:56%
But here as there, despite all
precipitation, the rains rained out,

05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:50.130
while salt air and sun
yank the covers off

05:19:50.130 --> 05:19:53.170
in lick us to rise up and hum.

05:19:53.170 --> 05:19:57.570
Why waste your precious coins
in minutes on battle plans

05:19:57.570 --> 05:19:59.110
for some official dim interior?

05:19:59.110 --> 05:20:03.720
The polished wood and
balustrade reflecting back

05:20:03.720 --> 05:20:09.030
in brass are convicts likenesses,
as we prevail upon dignitary robes

05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:12.690
to judge us, who cannot
sit still in silence.

05:20:12.690 --> 05:20:17.880
What could satisfy your hunger?

05:20:17.880 --> 05:20:22.200
The starving adventurer, having
wandered lost in mountains drenched

05:20:22.200 --> 05:20:26.810
by rain, falls on a
shepherd's humble table and eats

05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:31.520
until he's sick, chucks it up to
force it down, bellying revolt

05:20:31.520 --> 05:20:35.090
against an agitating mind.

05:20:35.090 --> 05:20:39.900
Agitated to anger at my
mere figure on your step,

05:20:39.900 --> 05:20:42.050
you shouldn't have come here.

05:20:42.050 --> 05:20:46.750
You're responsible, you
owe, carbon pupils flaring,

05:20:46.750 --> 05:20:51.040
oh how I fucked you over,
over good, as I stood wooden

05:20:51.040 --> 05:20:56.380
and bewildered lost in panics wood
and you gathered breath to bellow

05:20:56.380 --> 05:21:00.640
like an actor on his final
stage, overcome for the finish

05:21:00.640 --> 05:21:05.130
by black fury's torn finding
its voice merging with your own.

05:21:05.130 --> 05:21:09.000
Your doubled voice enriched as
venting pleasure frothing over,

05:21:09.000 --> 05:21:14.470
under, all around, carried me
off in a ripping ugly rush.

05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:17.880
I'm not your father, your keeper.

05:21:17.880 --> 05:21:24.470
Well, I couldn't have agreed more.

05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:32.110
Though, months later, I'd reverse
that if I saw you now and try,

05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:41.240
no doubt failing, to bow to you, my
cheaper so close this long winter,

05:21:41.240 --> 05:21:45.120
I too gorge myself on
platters of revenge and tart -

05:21:45.120 --> 05:21:48.700
tart sorbets kept cold
in a metal dish of fear.

05:21:48.700 --> 05:21:55.960
Nights of revelry at the sink, each
plate congealed with meat juice,

05:21:55.960 --> 05:21:58.400
a model of my mind,
I tried scrubbing

05:21:58.400 --> 05:22:03.830
and scrubbing smooth,
or was I just a fool?

05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:08.240
My mind more water, pouring from
the faucet, seeking the basin

05:22:08.240 --> 05:22:12.960
to give it shape, contain
it, it finding only drain

05:22:12.960 --> 05:22:16.410
and a polluted route
to other larger waters.

05:22:16.410 --> 05:22:21.140
But your epic of triumph and
suffering need this minor book,

05:22:21.140 --> 05:22:26.590
take your pen to a blank
page of scrap, boot up

05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:29.390
and delete my name
from your databank.

05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:33.680
You have others to care for,
without taking care of me.

05:22:33.680 --> 05:22:37.930
Our fates mixed together, makes
more stormy weather and see,

05:22:37.930 --> 05:22:41.000
it's just stopped raining.

05:22:41.000 --> 05:22:46.460
So, step to you balcony and breathe
the new atmosphere thoroughly

05:22:46.460 --> 05:22:47.760
cleaned of me.

05:22:47.760 --> 05:22:51.290
That's life, egging
your heartbeat on.

05:22:51.290 --> 05:22:54.830
I want more of it too than
could ever fill me up,

05:22:54.830 --> 05:22:59.650
before the rain falls again,
this time falling with no end.

05:22:59.650 --> 05:23:04.620
Late seasons flood water,
sweeping out of cherished homes.

05:23:04.620 --> 05:23:06.420
Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Naomi Shihab Nye: Gratitude

05:23:32.870 --> 05:23:35.600
to all the eloquent stunning
speakers of the last two days.

05:23:35.600 --> 05:23:39.550
I don't know when I've heard
more exhilarating presentations

05:23:39.550 --> 05:23:43.910
and I have conquered my phobia
of panels forever having listened

05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:46.260
to the panels that have
been up here today.

05:23:46.260 --> 05:23:48.240
It's -- it's been a marvelous time.

05:23:48.240 --> 05:23:50.590
I want to thank everybody
who made this --

05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:54.700
this program possible and
special thanks to Robert Pinsky

05:23:54.700 --> 05:24:01.150
and Witter Bynner for this very
unexpected and kind support.

05:24:04.040 --> 05:24:08.650 position:56%
Since the topic is poetry in America
today, I just wanted to say a word

05:24:08.650 --> 05:24:12.810
for where I've been for the last
25 years, which is out in schools

05:24:12.810 --> 05:24:17.160
as an itinerant visiting writer.

05:24:17.160 --> 05:24:22.240
And never have I heard a
teacher say that her teacher --

05:24:22.240 --> 05:24:26.490
her students have spent significant
time with poetry in any way

05:24:26.490 --> 05:24:31.150 position:56%
and gained nothing from it -- never.

05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:35.900
This past season I was asked
at a conference of teachers,

05:24:35.900 --> 05:24:37.750
"But what have you
done over the years

05:24:37.750 --> 05:24:42.490
when the students made fun
of one another's poems."

05:24:42.490 --> 05:24:45.830
And I had think for a long
minute before answering, "Well,

05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:49.160
they never have, not
once have they."

05:24:49.160 --> 05:24:51.700
Once a teacher made
fun of a student,

05:24:51.700 --> 05:24:54.980
but I had never heard students
make fun of one another's poems,

05:24:54.980 --> 05:25:00.000
and how excited I am to think
of them seeing these videos.

05:25:00.000 --> 05:25:01.690 position:56%
How wonderful that will be for them.

05:25:01.690 --> 05:25:04.680
And I just wanted to
read two little stories.

05:25:04.680 --> 05:25:07.840
I've worked as an anthologist
for the past 10 years as well,

05:25:07.840 --> 05:25:14.700 position:56%
trying to create books that would be
friendly to students, bringing poets

05:25:14.700 --> 05:25:17.720
from around the world from
Mexico, from the Middle East,

05:25:17.720 --> 05:25:22.470
voices I wanted to see in more
American classrooms into the hands

05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:23.940
of teachers in this country.

05:25:23.940 --> 05:25:26.080
My most recent anthology
though that's just

05:25:26.080 --> 05:25:28.080
out is called <i>Salting the Ocean,</i>

05:25:28.080 --> 05:25:31.980
<i>100 Poems by Young Poets</i>
from people I've been with.

05:25:31.980 --> 05:25:35.120
And I just wanted to read two
little stories, which we sneaked

05:25:35.120 --> 05:25:39.170
into the index from
classroom experiences.

05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:44.340
And these were stories from
my journal working with them.

05:25:44.340 --> 05:25:46.890
Waiting for the coffee
pot to percolate,

05:25:46.890 --> 05:25:50.180
one teacher in the
lounge speaks to another.

05:25:50.180 --> 05:25:53.540
Does poetry have anything
to do with math?

05:25:53.540 --> 05:25:56.500
Her friend says, "What?"

05:25:56.500 --> 05:25:58.420
"Well," says the first teacher.

05:25:58.420 --> 05:26:00.900
"You know how I told
you about Benjamin

05:26:00.900 --> 05:26:03.330
who never does his assignments?

05:26:03.330 --> 05:26:08.160 position:56%
So then we started this poetry
workshop a month ago, he volunteered

05:26:08.160 --> 05:26:11.970
to read his poems, the
other kids cheered him on.

05:26:11.970 --> 05:26:14.530
Yesterday, he brings
his math homework

05:26:14.530 --> 05:26:19.610
in for the first time all
year and leaves it on my desk.

05:26:19.610 --> 05:26:21.180
I don't get it.

05:26:21.180 --> 05:26:25.030
What does poetry have
to do with math?"

05:26:26.330 --> 05:26:32.380
A fifth grade boy telephones the
poet who visited his class and asks

05:26:32.380 --> 05:26:35.410
if he could dictate a poem to her.

05:26:35.410 --> 05:26:39.940
She says, "Why don't you
just write it down yourself

05:26:39.940 --> 05:26:42.130
and give it to me next week?"

05:26:42.130 --> 05:26:47.130
He says, "I feel I need to
say it into somebody's ear

05:26:47.130 --> 05:26:49.300
or it won't come out right.

05:26:49.300 --> 05:26:52.690
There's nobody at home over here."

05:26:52.690 --> 05:26:55.300
So she writes down what he says.

05:26:55.300 --> 05:26:57.030
It's pretty great.

05:26:57.030 --> 05:27:00.420
She promises to give
him a copy next week.

05:27:00.420 --> 05:27:04.290
Two hours later her
phone rings again,

05:27:04.290 --> 05:27:06.900
"Do you have another
piece of paper?"

05:27:11.160 --> 05:27:16.110
And just one of the poet's voices,

05:27:16.110 --> 05:27:19.220
this was from a fourth
grader, Brenda Burmeister.

05:27:19.220 --> 05:27:23.480 position:56%
I have managed to keep in touch with
her over the years and she does say

05:27:23.480 --> 05:27:25.900
that this -- writing of
this poem, which she wrote

05:27:25.900 --> 05:27:31.140 position:56%
in approximately seven minutes,
staring into a broken compact mirror

05:27:31.140 --> 05:27:33.500
on her desk was very significant

05:27:33.500 --> 05:27:35.560
because it was the
first time she learned

05:27:35.560 --> 05:27:39.570
that you could find something
out while writing a poem.

05:27:39.570 --> 05:27:43.140
You didn't have to
know it in advance.

05:27:44.380 --> 05:27:47.160
Fourth grade, Brenda Burmeister.

05:27:47.160 --> 05:27:52.410
"Alone with my mirror, dreaming
of love, wishing for love,

05:27:52.410 --> 05:27:55.290 position:56%
thinking of my dear old grandmother.

05:27:55.290 --> 05:28:01.340
My eyes represent my grandmother,
my nose represents my grandmother.

05:28:01.340 --> 05:28:06.270
Suddenly my face turns into
my dear old grandmother.

05:28:06.270 --> 05:28:11.790
I start to speak, I hear my voice,
I hear my grandmother's voice.

05:28:11.790 --> 05:28:17.270
I say to myself, that can't be
my grandmother, she is dead.

05:28:17.270 --> 05:28:22.000
She says to me, it
is your grandmother.

05:28:22.000 --> 05:28:24.410
I had trust in my grandmother,

05:28:24.410 --> 05:28:31.400
so I believe my grandmother
lives beyond death in my mirror."

05:28:32.570 --> 05:28:36.450
And then a few from me.

05:28:36.450 --> 05:28:40.120
I wear this poetry advocate button
from poet's house in New York,

05:28:40.120 --> 05:28:44.700
not to announce myself, but to
invite people to tell me stories.

05:28:44.700 --> 05:28:46.000
And they do.

05:28:46.000 --> 05:28:49.680
In an airport two weeks ago,
a woman came up and said, "So,

05:28:49.680 --> 05:28:53.990
can I tell you about the
time a poem saved my life?"

05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:56.850
And she isn't the first
one who's done that.

05:28:56.850 --> 05:28:59.140
They also let you check
into hotels early and things

05:28:59.140 --> 05:29:01.980
if you wear a button
like this, feeling --

05:29:01.980 --> 05:29:04.610
feeling you've probably been
sleeping in lobbies until now.

05:29:04.610 --> 05:29:10.940
But I want to dedicate this
poem to The Library of Congress.

05:29:10.940 --> 05:29:14.360
Remembering my childhood library in
St. Louis and our exquisite library

05:29:14.360 --> 05:29:21.060
in San Antonio, because of
libraries we can say these things.

05:29:21.060 --> 05:29:24.350
She is holding the book close
to her body, carrying it home

05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:27.940
on the cracked sidewalk
down the tangled hill.

05:29:27.940 --> 05:29:33.110
If a dog runs at her again, she
will use the book as a shield.

05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:37.370
She looked hard among the long
lines of books to find this one.

05:29:37.370 --> 05:29:41.550 position:56%
When they start talking about money,
when the day contains such long

05:29:41.550 --> 05:29:44.880
and hot places, she will go inside.

05:29:44.880 --> 05:29:47.110
An orange bed is waiting.

05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:50.550
Story without corners, she
will have two families,

05:29:50.550 --> 05:29:53.620
they will eat at different hours.

05:29:53.620 --> 05:29:57.640
She is carrying a book past the
fire station in the five and dime.

05:29:57.640 --> 05:30:01.600
What this town has not given
her, the book will provide.

05:30:01.600 --> 05:30:05.400
A sheep, a wilderness
of new solutions,

05:30:05.400 --> 05:30:08.790
the book has already lived
through its troubles.

05:30:08.790 --> 05:30:13.510
The book has a calm
cover, a straight spine.

05:30:13.510 --> 05:30:16.830
When the step returns to itself
as the best place for sitting

05:30:16.830 --> 05:30:20.860
and the old men up and down the
street are latching their clippers,

05:30:20.860 --> 05:30:22.570
she will not be alone.

05:30:22.570 --> 05:30:29.860 position:56%
She will have a book to open and
open and open, her life starts here.

05:30:29.860 --> 05:30:37.810
Wedding cake -- once on
a plane, a woman asked me

05:30:37.810 --> 05:30:41.720
to hold her baby and disappear it.

05:30:41.720 --> 05:30:46.090
I figured it was safe, our
being on a plane and all.

05:30:46.090 --> 05:30:50.400
How far could she go?

05:30:50.400 --> 05:30:52.810
She returned one hour later,

05:30:52.810 --> 05:30:58.170
having changed her clothes
and washed her hair.

05:30:58.170 --> 05:31:00.950
I didn't recognize her.

05:31:00.950 --> 05:31:05.110
By this time, the baby and I
had examined each other's necks,

05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:10.160
we had cried a little, I had
a silver bracelet and a watch,

05:31:10.160 --> 05:31:12.940
gold studs glittered
in the baby's ears.

05:31:12.940 --> 05:31:18.610
She wore a tiny white dress, leafed
with layers like a wedding cake.

05:31:18.610 --> 05:31:21.820
I did not want to give her back.

05:31:21.820 --> 05:31:26.800 position:56%
The baby's curls coiled tightly
against her scalp, another alphabet.

05:31:26.800 --> 05:31:31.270
I read new, new, new,
my mother gets tired.

05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:34.120
I'll chew your hand.

05:31:34.120 --> 05:31:38.520
The baby left my skirt
crumpled, my lap aching.

05:31:38.520 --> 05:31:41.800
Now I'm her secret guardian,
that little nub of dream

05:31:41.800 --> 05:31:45.280
that rises slightly but won't
come clear, as she grows,

05:31:45.280 --> 05:31:51.100
as she feels ill at
east, I'll bob my knee.

05:31:51.100 --> 05:31:52.990
What will she forget?

05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:55.480
Whom will she marry?

05:31:55.480 --> 05:31:57.550
He'd better check with me.

05:31:57.550 --> 05:32:02.470
I'll say once she flew dressed
like a cake, between two doilies

05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:07.810
of cloud, she could slip the
card into a pocket, pull it out.

05:32:07.810 --> 05:32:16.450
Already she knew the small finger
was funnier than the whole arm.

05:32:16.450 --> 05:32:20.000
William Merwin and I were
talking at lunch about poems

05:32:20.000 --> 05:32:23.790
which we must write in response
to certain things in the news

05:32:23.790 --> 05:32:27.350
and I'll just read these.

05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:30.920
This is two -- two poems,
part -- one poem, two parts.

05:32:30.920 --> 05:32:37.840
Jerusalem headlines 2000, Holy
Land experiences biggest snowfall

05:32:37.840 --> 05:32:40.010
in 50 years.

05:32:40.010 --> 05:32:41.850
Having been there for
the previous two biggest,

05:32:41.850 --> 05:32:46.760
I felt a lot of images
coming over me.

05:32:46.760 --> 05:32:48.910
If your house is covered,

05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:52.620
if someone's small lemon tree
disappears under a drift,

05:32:52.620 --> 05:32:57.910
if your auto with the blue
license plates, if your goat

05:32:57.910 --> 05:33:01.970
or my aged donkey, if the clay jar
in which your mother hold water

05:33:01.970 --> 05:33:05.240
for 60 years, if the snow piles

05:33:05.240 --> 05:33:10.580
up past everyone's
windows, all of the windows.

05:33:10.580 --> 05:33:17.770 position:56%
Palestinians and Israeli's worked
together in the west bank to rescue.

05:33:17.770 --> 05:33:22.600
A sweeter sentence than
baklava, than all the oranges

05:33:22.600 --> 05:33:27.600
of Jericho offered up to God.

05:33:27.600 --> 05:33:36.190
Second headline, top Israeli
official hints at shared Jerusalem.

05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:39.470
After all this time, just a hint.

05:33:39.470 --> 05:33:44.830
He could sing it loudly,
gent from the top of a wall,

05:33:44.830 --> 05:33:48.030
he's a top official after all.

05:33:48.030 --> 05:33:51.510
Why whisper, why not stand
in the street bursting

05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:54.740
with syllables shocking taxi
drivers and bread sellers,

05:33:54.740 --> 05:33:58.780
why not, why not, why not?

05:33:58.780 --> 05:34:03.160
Does a mother hint that
she loves her child?

05:34:03.160 --> 05:34:09.130
Now, while we are fresh, while the
century is still a wide open page,

05:34:09.130 --> 05:34:15.370
now a new story to be made and
everyone with their fragrant nouns

05:34:15.370 --> 05:34:19.540
and muscular verbs to write it.

05:34:21.690 --> 05:34:25.900
And on behalf of the Internet, I
feel like I keep finding out a lot

05:34:25.900 --> 05:34:29.020
of intriguing things
from the Internet

05:34:29.020 --> 05:34:31.490
that I appreciate knowing about.

05:34:31.490 --> 05:34:37.310
And this was one of them, <i>The
Many Hats of William Yale </i>.

05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:43.380
I love odd collections, cookie
jars, light bulbs toothpaste tubes,

05:34:43.380 --> 05:34:47.390
the man who gathered sugar
packets for 37 years.

05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:52.480
So when I heard about the hats made
from rinds of lemons and limes,

05:34:52.480 --> 05:34:57.740
a century ago decorated
with bits of frill and cloth

05:34:57.740 --> 05:35:01.620
to represent the tribes and
occupations of the time.

05:35:01.620 --> 05:35:08.070
I loved William Yale, the strange
gift for his Jerusalem bride.

05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:12.060
I sent my Boston friends
to see those hats.

05:35:12.060 --> 05:35:13.390
They got lost driving there

05:35:13.390 --> 05:35:17.270
in a wild rainstorm,
more lost coming home.

05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:21.610
But they reported the hats
made by children's hands,

05:35:21.610 --> 05:35:27.430
lined up teeny tiny, displayed
on thimbles and walnuts,

05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:30.470
were withered only a
bit around the edges

05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:35.080
as any rind might be after so long.

05:35:35.080 --> 05:35:37.460
And they felt hypnotized.

05:35:37.460 --> 05:35:43.060
A sudden tangy hopefulness rose up
from those hats, a stunning wish

05:35:43.060 --> 05:35:47.080
for women and men with tinier heads

05:35:47.080 --> 05:35:50.520
to solve Jerusalem's
troubles [laughter].

05:35:52.120 --> 05:35:58.390 position:56%
And back to Poetry in America in the
schools, I'll close with <i>Valentine</i>

05:35:58.390 --> 05:36:04.050
<i>for Ernest Mann </i>for the boy who
stalked up to me in the hallway

05:36:04.050 --> 05:36:07.430
of his junior high school and said,

05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:13.480
"If you are the poet,
write me a poem."

05:36:13.480 --> 05:36:17.960
And it was February 14.

05:36:19.020 --> 05:36:23.120
You can't order a poem
like you order a taco.

05:36:23.120 --> 05:36:26.410
Walk up to the counter
and say, I'll take two,

05:36:26.410 --> 05:36:29.920
and expect it to be
handed on a shiny plate.

05:36:29.920 --> 05:36:32.870
Still, I like your spirit.

05:36:32.870 --> 05:36:38.970
Anyone who says, here's my
address, write me a poem,

05:36:38.970 --> 05:36:41.480
deserves something in reply.

05:36:41.480 --> 05:36:43.750
So I'll tell a secret instead.

05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:48.280
Poems hide, in the bottoms of
our shoes they're sleeping;

05:36:48.280 --> 05:36:49.580
they are the shadows drifting

05:36:49.580 --> 05:36:53.680
across our ceilings the
moment before we wake up.

05:36:53.680 --> 05:36:58.260
What we have to do is live in
a way that lets us find them.

05:36:58.260 --> 05:37:03.420
Once I knew a man who gave his
wife two skunks for a valentine,

05:37:03.420 --> 05:37:06.480
he couldn't understand
why she was crying.

05:37:06.480 --> 05:37:12.860
I thought they had such
beautiful eyes and he was serious.

05:37:12.860 --> 05:37:17.100
He was a serious man who lived in a
serious way; nothing was ugly just

05:37:17.100 --> 05:37:19.860
because the world said so.

05:37:19.860 --> 05:37:22.900
He really liked those skunks.

05:37:22.900 --> 05:37:25.220
So he reinvented them as valentines

05:37:25.220 --> 05:37:29.710
and they became beautiful,
at least to him.

05:37:29.710 --> 05:37:32.670
And the poems that had been
hiding in the eyes of skunks

05:37:32.670 --> 05:37:38.190
for centuries crawled out
and curled up at his feet.

05:37:38.190 --> 05:37:43.700
Maybe if we reinvent whatever
our lives give us, we find poems.

05:37:43.700 --> 05:37:47.860
Check your garage, the
odd sock in your drawer,

05:37:47.860 --> 05:37:54.540
the person you almost like,
but not quite and let me know.

05:37:54.540 --> 05:37:57.000
And I'd have to say to
all of you here today,

05:37:57.000 --> 05:37:58.680
you let us know in a big way.

05:37:58.680 --> 05:38:00.480
Thanks.

&gt;&gt; Robert Pinsky: I'm going
to try to read the first poem

05:38:21.570 --> 05:38:26.600
and the last poem from my brand
new book called <i>Jersey Rain </i>.

05:38:26.600 --> 05:38:29.800
They are short.

05:38:32.670 --> 05:38:40.110
Samurai song, when I had no
roof, I made audacity my roof.

05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:48.680 position:56%
When I had no supper, my eyes dined.

05:38:48.680 --> 05:38:51.680
When I had no eyes, I listened.

05:38:51.680 --> 05:38:57.010
When I had no ears, I sought.

05:38:57.010 --> 05:39:00.060
When I had no thought, I waited.

05:39:00.060 --> 05:39:06.700
When I had no father,
I made care my father.

05:39:06.700 --> 05:39:12.020
When I had no mother,
I embraced order.

05:39:12.020 --> 05:39:17.880
When I had no friend,
I made quiet my friend.

05:39:17.880 --> 05:39:24.130
When I had no enemy,
I posed my body.

05:39:24.130 --> 05:39:34.200
When I had no temple, I
made my voice my temple.

05:39:34.200 --> 05:39:35.500
[Inaudible] before.

05:39:35.500 --> 05:39:39.240
I have no priest, my
tongue is my choir.

05:39:39.240 --> 05:39:45.210
When I have no means,
fortune is my means.

05:39:45.210 --> 05:39:50.310
When I have nothing,
death will be my fortune.

05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:56.590
Need is my tactic,
detachment is my strategy.

05:39:56.590 --> 05:40:01.930
When I had to lover,
I courted my sleep.

05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:09.350
Last poem is the title
poem, <i>Jersey Rain </i>.

05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:20.310
Now near the end of the middle
of the road, now near the end

05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:25.290
of the middle stretch of
road, what have I learned?

05:40:25.290 --> 05:40:31.970 position:56%
Some earthly wiles that aren't, that
often I cannot tell good fortune

05:40:31.970 --> 05:40:38.860
from bad; they had once
seemed so easy to tell apart.

05:40:38.860 --> 05:40:44.020
The source of art and woe,
a slant in wind, dissolves

05:40:44.020 --> 05:40:47.740
or nourishes everything it touches.

05:40:47.740 --> 05:40:51.220
What [inaudible] doesn't mend;

05:40:51.220 --> 05:40:55.500
it carves the deeper,
boiling pony images.

05:40:55.500 --> 05:41:02.400
It spins itself regardless into
the ocean, it stains and scours

05:41:02.400 --> 05:41:06.350
and makes things dark or bright.

05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:10.670
Sweat of the moon, a
shroud of benediction,

05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:14.650
the chilly liquefaction
of day to night.

05:41:14.650 --> 05:41:20.120
The Jersey rain, my
rain, soaks all as one.

05:41:20.120 --> 05:41:25.550
It smites Metuchen, Rahway,
Saddle River, Fair Haven,

05:41:25.550 --> 05:41:30.250
Newark, Little Silver, Bayonne.

05:41:30.250 --> 05:41:33.620
I feel it churning
even in fair weather

05:41:33.620 --> 05:41:38.870
to craze distinction,
dry the same as wet.

05:41:38.870 --> 05:41:43.130
In ripples of heat, the August
drought still feeds vapors

05:41:43.130 --> 05:41:47.830
in the sky that swell
to drench my state.

05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:54.360 position:56%
The Jersey rain, my rain, in streams
and beads of indissoluble grudge

05:41:54.360 --> 05:42:01.400
and aspiration, original
milk, replenisher of grief.

05:42:01.400 --> 05:42:09.810 position:56%
Descending destroyer, [inaudible]
source of passion, silver and black,

05:42:09.810 --> 05:42:15.510

hear another round of applause

05:42:43.100 --> 05:42:47.500
for everything that Robert Pinsky
has done here at the library.

05:42:47.500 --> 05:42:51.110
It's been -- it's been
just a remarkable two days

05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:52.460
and a remarkable three years.

05:42:52.460 --> 05:42:54.260
I want to thank him.

[ Applause ]

05:43:07.930 --> 05:43:12.000
I'd like to start with a
poem for sentimental reasons.

05:43:12.000 --> 05:43:17.730
It's for my daughter and she
kind of grew up in these halls.

05:43:17.730 --> 05:43:20.580
She knew every elevator
here, between the --

05:43:20.580 --> 05:43:23.960 position:56%
and the tunnels between the Madison
Building and the Jefferson Building.

05:43:23.960 --> 05:43:31.780 position:56%
This poem took a long to write, it's
in my latest book, but it's a poem

05:43:31.780 --> 05:43:34.580
about her birth and now she's 17.

05:43:34.580 --> 05:43:37.030
And she's given me
permission to read it.

05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:41.070
You have to ask at a
certain age [laughter].

05:43:44.360 --> 05:43:47.330
She was born in Phoenix, Arizona

05:43:50.540 --> 05:43:54.580 position:56%
and we weren't sure exactly how this
experiment was going to come out.

05:43:54.580 --> 05:43:58.780
It came out pretty
well, but we took --

05:43:58.780 --> 05:44:01.400
we had a good omen in
our -- in our midwife.

05:44:01.400 --> 05:44:04.600
We did the safe way, we had
midwives in the hospital so that

05:44:04.600 --> 05:44:06.790
in case something goes
wrong, you can pretend

05:44:06.790 --> 05:44:08.610
that you were doing it naturally.

05:44:08.610 --> 05:44:12.140
But our midwife was
a remarkable woman,

05:44:12.140 --> 05:44:16.300
we could not quite
figure out what she was.

05:44:16.300 --> 05:44:18.350
And that'll become
clear in the poem.

05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:24.560
<i>Incarnation in Phoenix </i>--
Into this paradise of pain,

05:44:24.560 --> 05:44:29.230
she strives on the slim
tether of a nurse's bell.

05:44:29.230 --> 05:44:33.100
Her charcoal limbs
emerging from crisp whites,

05:44:33.100 --> 05:44:37.150
unlikely as an envelope
issuing smoke.

05:44:37.150 --> 05:44:42.610
I've rung because my breasts have
risen, [inaudible] I'm not ready

05:44:42.610 --> 05:44:45.300
for this motherhood stuff.

05:44:45.300 --> 05:44:50.340
Her name is Raven and she swoops
across the tiled wilderness,

05:44:50.340 --> 05:44:52.960
hair boiling thunder
over the rampart

05:44:52.960 --> 05:44:56.880
of bobby pins poking
her immaculate cap.

05:44:56.880 --> 05:45:01.490
She dips once for the baby
just waking, fists punching

05:45:01.490 --> 05:45:04.350
in for work, right on schedule.

05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:08.390
Bends again to investigate
what should be natural,

05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:13.880
milk sighing into one
tiny [inaudible] mouth.

05:45:13.880 --> 05:45:19.560
Ah, she whispers, ambrosia,
shaming me instantly.

05:45:19.560 --> 05:45:23.540
But no nectar trickles forth,
no mana descends from the vault

05:45:23.540 --> 05:45:26.960
of Heaven to feed this
pearly syllable,

05:45:26.960 --> 05:45:30.170
this package of leafy
persuasion dropped

05:45:30.170 --> 05:45:33.290
on our doorstep and
ripening before us.

A miniature United Nations just
like me, Raven says, citing the name

05:45:39.810 --> 05:45:42.770
of her mother's village
somewhere in Norway,

The -- I'd like to read one poem
from the title sequence of the book,

05:46:10.850 --> 05:46:14.010
<i>On The Bus With Rosa Parks</i>
, is the title of the book.

05:46:14.010 --> 05:46:19.260 position:56%
And this poem is about -- not about
Rosa Parks and that historic moment,

05:46:19.260 --> 05:46:22.600
but by about another
woman in a moment

05:46:22.600 --> 05:46:26.400
that by all rights could have
been the historic moment.

05:46:26.400 --> 05:46:32.020 position:56%
There were several women who refused
to give up their seats on the bus --

05:46:32.020 --> 05:46:36.660
on the buses in Montgomery,
Alabama in the year of 1955,

05:46:36.660 --> 05:46:40.060
which was the year that Rosa
Parks made her historic stand.

05:46:40.060 --> 05:46:44.500
And for various reasons, they
were not taken up as the test case

05:46:44.500 --> 05:46:48.000
for the anti -- for
the segregation laws --

05:46:48.000 --> 05:46:50.070
against the segregation laws.

05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:52.580
This woman's name was
-- that I'm reading

05:46:52.580 --> 05:46:56.020
about in this poem
is Claudette Colvin,

05:46:56.020 --> 05:46:59.920
who now works in a
nursing home in New York

05:46:59.920 --> 05:47:03.710
and she has been interviewed

05:47:03.710 --> 05:47:06.390
and people have asked her how
she felt not being Rosa Parks

05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:10.390
and she's truly bewildered
by this question as --

05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:16.100
as if what she is is
not something already.

05:47:16.100 --> 05:47:19.960
There's an epigraph for this
poem from the boycott flier

05:47:19.960 --> 05:47:24.810
that was distributed a few
days after Rose Park's arrest.

05:47:24.810 --> 05:47:29.050
And I quote, "Another Negro woman
has been arrested and thrown

05:47:29.050 --> 05:47:32.820
into jail because she refused to
get up out of her seat on the bus

05:47:32.820 --> 05:47:34.510
and give it to a white person."

05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:37.400
This is the second time since
the Claudette Colvin case,

05:47:37.400 --> 05:47:40.100
this must be stopped.

05:47:40.100 --> 05:47:42.820
Claudette Colvin goes to work.

05:47:44.240 --> 05:47:48.300
Menial twilight sweeps the
storefronts along Lexington,

05:47:48.300 --> 05:47:52.170
as the shadows arrive to take
their places among the scourge

05:47:52.170 --> 05:47:53.600
of the earth.

05:47:53.600 --> 05:47:57.540
Here and there, a fickle
brilliance, light bulbs coming

05:47:57.540 --> 05:48:01.240
on in each narrow residence,
the golden wattage

05:48:01.240 --> 05:48:05.290
of bleak interiors
announcing, anyone home

05:48:05.290 --> 05:48:09.090
or I'm beat, bring me a beer.

05:48:09.090 --> 05:48:15.480
Mostly I say to myself, still
here, lay my keys on the table,

05:48:15.480 --> 05:48:20.190
pack the perishables away
before flipping the switch.

05:48:20.190 --> 05:48:23.610
I like the sugary look
of things in bad light,

05:48:23.610 --> 05:48:26.080
one drop of sweat is
all it would take

05:48:26.080 --> 05:48:31.460
to dissolve an armchair
pillow into brocade residue.

05:48:31.460 --> 05:48:36.650
Sometimes I wait until it's dark
enough for my body to disappear,

05:48:36.650 --> 05:48:39.840
then I know it's time
to start out for work.

05:48:39.840 --> 05:48:44.380
Along the avenue, the cabs
start up heading toward midtown.

05:48:44.380 --> 05:48:49.780
Neon stutters into ecstasy as the
male integers light up their smokes

05:48:49.780 --> 05:48:53.040
and let loose a stream
of brave talk.

05:48:53.040 --> 05:48:58.390
Hey mama, souring quickly to
your mama when there's no answer.

05:48:58.390 --> 05:49:03.210
As if the most injury they can do
is insult the reason you're here

05:49:03.210 --> 05:49:06.970
at all, walking in your
whites down to the stock,

05:49:06.970 --> 05:49:09.100
so you can make a living.

05:49:09.100 --> 05:49:14.390
So ugly, so fat, so dumb,
so greasy, what do we have

05:49:14.390 --> 05:49:17.130
to do to make God love us?

05:49:17.130 --> 05:49:21.290
Mama was a maid, my daddy
mowed lawns like a boy

05:49:21.290 --> 05:49:24.150
and I'm the crazy girl off
the bus, the one who wrote

05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:27.690
in class she was going
to be president.

05:49:27.690 --> 05:49:31.880
I take the number six bus to
the Lexington Avenue train

05:49:31.880 --> 05:49:33.880
and then I'm there all night,

05:49:33.880 --> 05:49:38.100
adjusting the sheets,
emptying the pans.

05:49:38.100 --> 05:49:41.820
And I don't curse or
spit, or kick and scratch

05:49:41.820 --> 05:49:44.480
like they say I did then.

05:49:44.480 --> 05:49:48.090
I help those who can't
help themselves.

05:49:48.090 --> 05:49:50.630
I do what needs to be done.

05:49:50.630 --> 05:49:57.780
And I sleep whenever
sleep comes down on me.

05:49:57.780 --> 05:50:05.150
Two newish poems -- I've been
working a series about the painter,

05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:08.560
Albrecht Durer, for as long
as I think I've been writing.

05:50:08.560 --> 05:50:10.560
I can't seem to finish it.

05:50:10.560 --> 05:50:16.640
He intrigues me I think because he
was on the cusp of the Renaissance

05:50:16.640 --> 05:50:20.900
and it fascinated me to
think of someone who knew

05:50:20.900 --> 05:50:24.320
that something new was happening,
but didn't quite know what it was.

05:50:24.320 --> 05:50:26.330
He was early for his times.

05:50:26.330 --> 05:50:34.060
He wrote a painter's manual, which
is extremely post modern, actually.

05:50:34.060 --> 05:50:36.400 position:56%
I have a quote from it in which just

05:50:36.400 --> 05:50:38.820
to give you an idea of
how his mind worked.

05:50:38.820 --> 05:50:42.290
He said, I [inaudible] my
imagination throw a point high

05:50:42.290 --> 05:50:45.200
up in the air or drop
it into the depths

05:50:45.200 --> 05:50:47.460
where I cannot reach
it with my body.

05:50:47.460 --> 05:50:51.510
But in order to make it plausible,
I must draw it with a pen

05:50:51.510 --> 05:50:58.130 position:56%
and write the word point next to it,
so that the point will mean point.

05:50:58.130 --> 05:51:05.950
This man, I mean, 15th Century was
not for him, but he also thought

05:51:05.950 --> 05:51:09.750
that perhaps you could
quantify human beauty

05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:11.860
if you just measured it enough.

05:51:11.860 --> 05:51:14.460
And this became a lifelong
obsession.

05:51:14.460 --> 05:51:16.910
This poem takes place
right about at the turn

05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:22.320
of his millennium into the 1500s.

05:51:22.320 --> 05:51:25.260
And it's called <i>Weltschmerz</i>
, which is German for --

05:51:25.260 --> 05:51:30.050
well, it means world pain, but
that doesn't -- that's nothing.

05:51:30.050 --> 05:51:32.980
It means really, a longing
that you can't put a finger

05:51:32.980 --> 05:51:34.850
on that's bigger than the world.

05:51:34.850 --> 05:51:40.740
<i>Weltschmerz </i>, You who refer
to your wife as my good Agnes,

05:51:40.740 --> 05:51:44.390
and always in connection with
the maid, a simple girl who cried

05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:48.150
out in the midst of a miracle,
crosses dropped from the sky

05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:51.320
onto the clean white
shirts of her master.

05:51:51.320 --> 05:51:55.210
What could you say to a
creature so devoid of irony,

05:51:55.210 --> 05:52:00.110
she couldn't even laugh when you
yelled, come out of the rain.

05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:06.850 position:56%
Still, the centuries fresh, three
days journey to view a beached whale

05:52:06.850 --> 05:52:11.350
and by the time you arrive, the
whale has been swept to sea again.

05:52:11.350 --> 05:52:15.890 position:56%
You stay awhile anyway, collect
rocks, sketch a [inaudible] so plump

05:52:15.890 --> 05:52:20.410
and shy, she won't lift her
eyes from your hot nailed boots.

05:52:20.410 --> 05:52:23.330
Morosity, you write, is the penalty

05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:27.150
for too much thought
without exercise.

05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:31.660 position:56%
So you dig dame sorrow out of
metal, carve her slouched among orbs

05:52:31.660 --> 05:52:35.570
and compasses, swathed
in grim drapery and yet,

05:52:35.570 --> 05:52:38.110
it is your jaw etched in fury,

05:52:38.110 --> 05:52:44.320
our gaze you find burning
beneath her extravagant curls.

05:52:44.320 --> 05:52:46.560
What goes up, must come down.

05:52:46.560 --> 05:52:49.930
The maid saw that with
her own silly eyes.

05:52:49.930 --> 05:52:55.230
Throw up your hands, put it down
on paper, in ink, what can you say

05:52:55.230 --> 05:53:00.780
to a woman who refuses to pose
nude even for a famous artist?

05:53:00.780 --> 05:53:05.970
Gather up your stones, your crab
carapace's, your smudged equations

05:53:05.970 --> 05:53:10.400
for human perfection and
remember a green broach

05:53:10.400 --> 05:53:13.280
for the melancholy Agnes.

05:53:15.250 --> 05:53:23.260
This poem is -- I kind of date the
new poems as post-fire or pre-fire.

05:53:23.260 --> 05:53:26.400 position:56%
Some of you might know we had a fire
in our house, lightening struck it

05:53:26.400 --> 05:53:28.020
and burned quite a bit of it.

05:53:28.020 --> 05:53:32.100
And it -- contrary -- I
mean it was devastating,

05:53:32.100 --> 05:53:35.730
but contrary to what I always
imagined when I looked at disaster

05:53:35.730 --> 05:53:38.600
on television and you
think how unspeakably sad,

05:53:38.600 --> 05:53:41.250
it has been a process or recovery.

05:53:41.250 --> 05:53:44.150
What you do discover is
that you find things again

05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:48.020
and everything that
you find is a gift.

05:53:48.020 --> 05:53:50.220
As a consequence, I've
started writing poems

05:53:50.220 --> 05:53:53.310
which I guess some critic
will say predictably enough,

05:53:53.310 --> 05:53:58.450
are poems about paradise,
Adam and Eve.

05:53:58.450 --> 05:54:02.190
This is one of Eve's, of
a quote from the Bible,

05:54:02.190 --> 05:54:04.960
I have been a stranger
in a strange land

05:54:04.960 --> 05:54:07.500
and an epigraph from
Emily Dickenson.

05:54:07.500 --> 05:54:12.670
Life's spell is so exquisite,
everything conspires to break it.

05:54:12.670 --> 05:54:18.360
It wasn't bliss, what was
bliss but the ordinary life.

05:54:18.360 --> 05:54:22.690
She's spend hours in patter moving
through whole days touching,

05:54:22.690 --> 05:54:28.230
sniffing, tasting, exquisite
housekeeping in a charmed world.

05:54:28.230 --> 05:54:30.920
And yet there was always
more of the same,

05:54:30.920 --> 05:54:35.500
all that happiness, the
aimless being there.

05:54:35.500 --> 05:54:40.030
So she wandered for awhile,
bush to arbor, linger to look

05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:43.240
through upons rest of mirror.

05:54:43.240 --> 05:54:47.100
He was off cataloguing the universe
probably pretending he could

05:54:47.100 --> 05:54:51.660
organize what was clearly
someone else's chaos.

05:54:51.660 --> 05:54:55.550
That's when she found the tree,
the dark crabbed branches bearing

05:54:55.550 --> 05:54:57.920
up such speechless bounty.

05:54:57.920 --> 05:55:02.200
She knew without being
told, this was forbidden.

05:55:02.200 --> 05:55:06.520
It wasn't a question of
ownership, who could lay claim

05:55:06.520 --> 05:55:09.410
to such maddening perfection.

05:55:09.410 --> 05:55:13.930
And there was no voice in her head,
no whispered intelligence lurking

05:55:13.930 --> 05:55:17.120
in the leaves, just
an ache that grew

05:55:17.120 --> 05:55:22.620
until she knew she'd already
lost everything except desire.

05:55:22.620 --> 05:55:27.140
The red heft of it warming
her outstretched paw.

05:55:27.140 --> 05:55:29.510
Thank you.

05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:34.010
[ Applause ]

05:55:34.010 --> 05:55:36.010
[ Silence ]

05:55:36.010 --> 05:55:37.870
[ Applause ]

05:55:37.870 --> 05:55:42.670
&gt;&gt; Louise Gluck: Now a
foreseeable end, but it --

05:55:42.670 --> 05:55:50.540
it treats the different periods
of a life, youth, adolescence,

05:55:50.540 --> 05:55:58.590
theoretic life, domestic
life and old age.

05:55:58.590 --> 05:56:06.140
As a -- in a kind of swirl
of associative patterns,

05:56:06.140 --> 05:56:09.360
you won't be able to get
that from a smattering,

05:56:09.360 --> 05:56:12.670
but I'll read a few of these poems.

05:56:12.670 --> 05:56:22.210
The sensual world, I call to you
across a monstrous river or chasm

05:56:22.210 --> 05:56:26.330
to caution you, to prepare you.

05:56:26.330 --> 05:56:32.800
Earth will seduce you,
slowly, inperceptibly, subtly,

05:56:32.800 --> 05:56:35.320
not to say with connivance.

05:56:35.320 --> 05:56:42.170
I was not prepared, I stood in
my grandmother's kitchen holding

05:56:42.170 --> 05:56:49.020
out my glass, stewed plums, stewed
apricots, the juice poured off

05:56:49.020 --> 05:56:56.360 position:56%
into the glass of ice and the water
added patiently in small increments,

05:56:56.360 --> 05:57:03.250
the various cousins discriminating,
tasting with each addition.

05:57:03.250 --> 05:57:08.730
Aroma of summer fruit,
intensity of concentration,

05:57:08.730 --> 05:57:13.270
the colored liquid turning
gradually lighter, more radiant,

05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:16.740
more light passing through it.

05:57:16.740 --> 05:57:26.360 position:56%
Delight, then solace, my grandmother
waiting to see if more was wanted,

05:57:26.360 --> 05:57:31.390
solace then deep immersion.

05:57:31.390 --> 05:57:37.420
I loved nothing more, deep
privacy of the sensual life,

05:57:37.420 --> 05:57:42.180
the self disappearing into
it or inseparable from it,

05:57:42.180 --> 05:57:45.140
somehow suspended, floating,

05:57:45.140 --> 05:57:50.500
its needs fully exposed,
awakened, fully alive.

05:57:50.500 --> 05:57:58.330
Deep immersion and with
it, mysterious safety,

05:57:58.330 --> 05:58:02.550
far away the fruit
glowing in its glass bowls,

05:58:02.550 --> 05:58:06.700 position:56%
outside the kitchen the sun setting.

05:58:06.700 --> 05:58:14.200
I was not prepared, sunset, end
of summer, demonstrations of time

05:58:14.200 --> 05:58:20.220
as a continuum as something coming
to an end, not a suspension.

05:58:20.220 --> 05:58:23.990
The senses wouldn't protect me.

05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:27.800
I caution you as I
was never cautioned.

05:58:27.800 --> 05:58:32.400
You will never let go, you
will never be satiated,

05:58:32.400 --> 05:58:37.160
you will be damaged and scarred,
you will continue to hunger.

05:58:37.160 --> 05:58:40.750
Your body will age, you
will continue to need,

05:58:40.750 --> 05:58:48.450
you will want the earth then more
of the earth, sublime, indifferent,

05:58:48.450 --> 05:58:53.910
it is present, it will not
respond, it is encompassing,

05:58:53.910 --> 05:59:00.660
it will not minister, meaning it
will feed you, it will ravish you,

05:59:00.660 --> 05:59:07.630
it will not keep you alive.

05:59:07.630 --> 05:59:16.630
Solstice -- each year on the same
date, the summer solstice comes.

05:59:16.630 --> 05:59:21.590
[Inaudible] light, we plan for
it, the day we tell ourselves

05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:28.800
that time is very long indeed,
nearly infinite and in our reading

05:59:28.800 --> 05:59:36.250
and writing, preference is given
to the celebratory, the ecstatic.

05:59:36.250 --> 05:59:40.760
There is in these rituals
something apart from wonder,

05:59:40.760 --> 05:59:47.060 position:56%
there is also a kind of preening, as
though human genius had participated

05:59:47.060 --> 05:59:53.760
in these arrangements and we
found the results satisfying.

05:59:53.760 --> 05:59:57.020
What follows the light
is what precedes it.

05:59:57.020 --> 06:00:04.010
The moment of balance, of dark
equivalence, but tonight we sit

06:00:04.010 --> 06:00:09.920
in the garden in our canvas
chairs, so late into the evening.

06:00:09.920 --> 06:00:16.080 position:56%
Why should we look either forward
or backward, why should we be forced

06:00:16.080 --> 06:00:21.310
to remember it is in our
blood, this knowledge?

06:00:21.310 --> 06:00:27.960
Shortness of the days, darkness,
coldness of winter it is

06:00:27.960 --> 06:00:33.090
in our blood and bones,
it is in our history,

06:00:33.090 --> 06:00:38.170
it takes genius to
forget these things.

06:00:41.080 --> 06:00:47.780
Stars -- I'm awake,
I am in the world.

06:00:47.780 --> 06:00:55.710
I expect no further assurance,
no protection, no promise.

06:00:55.710 --> 06:01:05.800 position:56%
Solace of the night sky, the hardly
moving face of the clock, I'm alone.

06:01:05.800 --> 06:01:09.170
All my riches surround me.

06:01:09.170 --> 06:01:17.400
I have a bed, a room, I have a
bed, a vase of flowers beside it,

06:01:17.400 --> 06:01:20.950
and a nightlight, a book.

06:01:22.080 --> 06:01:26.270
I'm awake, I am safe.

06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:29.120
The darkness, like a shield.

06:01:29.120 --> 06:01:37.090
The dreams, put off, maybe
vanished forever and the day,

06:01:37.090 --> 06:01:43.650
the unsatisfying morning
that says, I am your future,

06:01:43.650 --> 06:01:47.190
here is your cargo of sorrow.

06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:49.640
Do you reject me?

06:01:49.640 --> 06:01:55.920
Do you mean to send me away
because I am not full in your word,

06:01:55.920 --> 06:02:01.180
because you see the black
shake already implicit.

06:02:01.180 --> 06:02:04.690
I will never be banished.

06:02:04.690 --> 06:02:06.500
I am the light.

06:02:06.500 --> 06:02:10.570
Your personal anguish
and humiliation,

06:02:10.570 --> 06:02:14.160
do you dare send me away
as though you were waiting

06:02:14.160 --> 06:02:17.130
for something better.

06:02:17.130 --> 06:02:23.590
There is no better,
only for a short space,

06:02:23.590 --> 06:02:31.470
the night sky like a quarantine
that sets you apart from your task.

06:02:31.470 --> 06:02:42.260
Only softly, fiercely, the star
is shining, here in the room,

06:02:42.260 --> 06:02:55.310
the bedroom, saying I was brave,
I resisted, I set myself on fire.

06:02:55.310 --> 06:03:03.180
Youth -- my sister and I at
two ends of the sofa reading,

06:03:03.180 --> 06:03:08.430
I suppose English novels,
the television on,

06:03:08.430 --> 06:03:14.670
various schoolbooks open or places
marked with sheets of lined paper.

06:03:14.670 --> 06:03:21.410
Euclid, [inaudible], as though
we had looked into the origin

06:03:21.410 --> 06:03:26.620
of thought and preferred novels.

06:03:26.620 --> 06:03:31.540
Sad sounds of our growing
up, twilight of cellos,

06:03:31.540 --> 06:03:37.950
no trace of a flute, a piccolo
and it seemed at the time,

06:03:37.950 --> 06:03:44.500
almost impossible to conceive of
any of it as evolving or malleable.

06:03:44.500 --> 06:03:52.200
Sad sounds, anecdotes that
were really still lives,

06:03:52.200 --> 06:03:58.990
the pages of the novels turning,
the two dogs snoring quietly

06:03:58.990 --> 06:04:03.940
and from the kitchen,
sounds of our mother,

06:04:03.940 --> 06:04:10.770 position:56%
smell of Rosemary, of lamb roasting.

06:04:10.770 --> 06:04:18.090
A world in process of shifting,
of being made or dissolved and

06:04:18.090 --> 06:04:21.230
yet we didn't live that way.

06:04:21.230 --> 06:04:28.690
All of us lived our lives as the
simultaneous ritualized enactment

06:04:28.690 --> 06:04:33.020
of a great principle, something
felt, but not understood.

06:04:33.020 --> 06:04:39.860
And the remarks we made were
like lines in a play spoken

06:04:39.860 --> 06:04:44.350
with conviction, but
not from choice.

06:04:44.350 --> 06:04:50.280
A principle, a terrifying familial
will that implied opposition

06:04:50.280 --> 06:04:57.030
to change, to variation, a
refusal even to ask questions.

06:04:57.030 --> 06:05:02.720
Now that world begins to
shift and eddy around us.

06:05:02.720 --> 06:05:08.920
Only now when it no longer
exists it has become the present,

06:05:08.920 --> 06:05:12.800
unending and without form.

06:05:12.800 --> 06:05:14.610
I'll read two more short ones.

06:05:14.610 --> 06:05:15.910
[Inaudible].

06:05:15.910 --> 06:05:26.270
I had drawn my chair to the
hotel window to watch the rain.

06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:37.550
I was in a kind of dream or trance,
in love, and yet I wanted nothing.

06:05:37.550 --> 06:05:44.940
It seemed unnecessary to
touch you, to see you again.

06:05:44.940 --> 06:05:50.530
I wanted only this,
the room, the chair,

06:05:50.530 --> 06:05:55.800
the sound of the rain
falling, hour after hour

06:05:55.800 --> 06:06:00.340
in the warmth of the spring night.

06:06:00.340 --> 06:06:02.770
I needed nothing more.

06:06:02.770 --> 06:06:06.470
I was utterly sated.

06:06:06.470 --> 06:06:09.760
My heart had become small.

06:06:09.760 --> 06:06:13.890
It took very little to fill it.

06:06:13.890 --> 06:06:19.450
I watch the rain falling in heavy
sheets over the darkened city.

06:06:19.450 --> 06:06:22.700
You were not concerned.

06:06:22.700 --> 06:06:26.460
I could let you live
as you needed to live.

06:06:26.460 --> 06:06:31.950
At dawn the rain abated.

06:06:31.950 --> 06:06:36.740
I did the things one does in
daylight, I acquitted myself,

06:06:36.740 --> 06:06:40.740
but I moved like a sleepwalker.

06:06:40.740 --> 06:06:46.290
It was enough and it
no longer involved you.

06:06:46.290 --> 06:06:54.310
A few days in the strange city, a
conversation, a touch of a hand,

06:06:54.310 --> 06:07:00.710
and afterward I took
off my wedding ring,

06:07:00.710 --> 06:07:06.170 position:56%
that was what I wanted, to be naked.

06:07:06.170 --> 06:07:15.390
Time, there was too much
always and too little.

06:07:15.390 --> 06:07:19.110
Childhood, sickness.

06:07:19.110 --> 06:07:22.980
By the side of the bed
I had a little bell.

06:07:22.980 --> 06:07:28.520
At the other end of
the bell, my mother.

06:07:28.520 --> 06:07:34.960
Sickness, gray rain, the
dogs slept through it.

06:07:34.960 --> 06:07:37.820
They slept on the bed,
at the end of it,

06:07:37.820 --> 06:07:41.870
and it seemed to me they
understood about childhood,

06:07:41.870 --> 06:07:45.720
best to remain unconscious.

06:07:45.720 --> 06:07:49.870
The rain made gray
slats on the windows.

06:07:49.870 --> 06:07:54.580
I sat with my book, the
little bell beside me.

06:07:54.580 --> 06:08:01.040
Without hearing a voice, I
apprenticed myself to a voice.

06:08:01.040 --> 06:08:04.280
Without seeing any
sign of the spirit,

06:08:04.280 --> 06:08:09.430
I determined to live in the spirit.

06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:12.000
The rain faded in and out.

06:08:12.000 --> 06:08:15.500
Month after month in
the space of a day,

06:08:15.500 --> 06:08:22.170
things became dreams,
dreams became things.

06:08:22.170 --> 06:08:24.010
Then I was well.

06:08:24.010 --> 06:08:27.210
The bell went back to the cupboard.

06:08:27.210 --> 06:08:28.920
The rain ended.

06:08:28.920 --> 06:08:34.280
The dogs stood at the door,
panting to go outside.

06:08:34.280 --> 06:08:41.030
I was well, then I was an
adult and time went on.

06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:45.650
It was like the rain,
so much, so much,

06:08:45.650 --> 06:08:49.010
as though it was a weight
that couldn't be moved.

06:08:49.010 --> 06:08:53.580
I was a child, half sleeping.

06:08:53.580 --> 06:08:55.010
I was sick.

06:08:55.010 --> 06:08:56.310
I was protected.

06:08:56.310 --> 06:09:02.440
And I lived in the world of the
spirit, the world of the gray rain,

06:09:02.440 --> 06:09:08.970
the lost, the remembered, then
suddenly the sun was shining

06:09:08.970 --> 06:09:15.230
and time went on, even when
there was almost none left.

06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:19.470
And the perceived became
the remembered,

06:09:19.470 --> 06:09:22.550
the remembered the perceived.

06:09:22.550 --> 06:09:24.350
Thank you.

06:09:24.350 --> 06:09:43.010
[ Applause ]

06:09:43.010 --> 06:09:52.050
[ Silence ]

06:09:52.050 --> 06:09:57.030
&gt;&gt; W.S. Merwin: I'm going to
begin in a conventional way

06:09:57.030 --> 06:10:01.840
by thanking everyone whose been
responsible for this program

06:10:01.840 --> 06:10:04.160
in every sense of the word.

06:10:04.160 --> 06:10:07.220
This particular program,
and the marvelous things

06:10:07.220 --> 06:10:12.990
that have been said here, Robert's
favorite poetry project program,

06:10:12.990 --> 06:10:21.220
and what they have both shown and
what I believe that [inaudible]

06:10:21.220 --> 06:10:27.500
in the 6th Century, the
poem said of the mules,

06:10:27.500 --> 06:10:31.020
it is natural to love her.

06:10:31.020 --> 06:10:33.430
I believe that this is something
that we're all born with,

06:10:33.430 --> 06:10:36.170
and that we get educated
out of ourselves.

06:10:36.170 --> 06:10:40.730
Why that great [inaudible]
is so important.

06:10:40.730 --> 06:10:46.980
The children naturally love
poetry, and if they don't love it

06:10:46.980 --> 06:10:48.280
by the time they're adolescents,

06:10:48.280 --> 06:10:50.770
it is because something
wrong has happened,

06:10:50.770 --> 06:10:53.270
some derailment has come about.

06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:57.730
And then I wanted to thank
everyone responsible for my being

06:10:57.730 --> 06:11:02.370
on the platform with these
other poets, many dear friends

06:11:02.370 --> 06:11:06.000
and poet's who's work
I've loved for years.

06:11:06.000 --> 06:11:08.290
It's a great pleasure
anytime that anything

06:11:08.290 --> 06:11:10.580
of any chance for that happening.

06:11:10.580 --> 06:11:14.470
I'm going to read a
few poems, beginning --

06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:19.890
they're all short poems,
and they're -- they --

06:11:19.890 --> 06:11:24.420
going back to the book published
several books back called,

06:11:24.420 --> 06:11:28.880
<i>The Vixen </i>, which all of
the poems are in the same form

06:11:28.880 --> 06:11:32.690
and they're all related to the same
place, a different length in time

06:11:32.690 --> 06:11:34.800
and in other various respects.

06:11:34.800 --> 06:11:40.270
But I noticed that the poems that
I've chosen to read this evening,

06:11:40.270 --> 06:11:41.820
many of them have to
do with animals,

06:11:41.820 --> 06:11:43.370
and I suppose that's no accident,

06:11:43.370 --> 06:11:46.030
that's one of the great
sympathies of my life.

06:11:46.030 --> 06:11:50.000 position:56%
And one of the things that one
shares with other poets, by the way,

06:11:50.000 --> 06:11:53.810
is not necessarily animals,
but passion, a passion.

06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:59.260
And a passion that
I realize is a part

06:11:59.260 --> 06:12:02.230
of a lifelong romanticism of mine.

06:12:02.230 --> 06:12:05.490
I suppose I am a romantic
in many respects.

06:12:05.490 --> 06:12:11.920
But I believe that the poets
owe each other generosity,

06:12:11.920 --> 06:12:14.320
as much generosity
as they can muster.

06:12:14.320 --> 06:12:18.880
It's not -- it's never total
and it's [inaudible] sometimes.

06:12:18.880 --> 06:12:24.500
But it's for the rise from the fact
that they recognize in each other

06:12:24.500 --> 06:12:32.410 position:56%
that passion and that -- that
concern and gratitude for being able

06:12:32.410 --> 06:12:38.370 position:56%
to touch something so remarkable and
so beyond our own use of language.

06:12:38.370 --> 06:12:42.400
That's something we also, I
believe, share with many animals.

06:12:42.400 --> 06:12:43.700
Substance.

06:12:43.700 --> 06:12:53.170
I could see that there was a kind
of distance lighted behind the face

06:12:53.170 --> 06:12:57.120
of that time and it's very
days as they appeared to me,

06:12:57.120 --> 06:13:01.250
but I could not think of any words
that spoke of it truly nor point

06:13:01.250 --> 06:13:03.710
to anything except what was there

06:13:03.710 --> 06:13:06.900
at the moment it was
beginning to be gone.

06:13:06.900 --> 06:13:11.560 position:56%
And certainly it could not have
been proven nor held however I might

06:13:11.560 --> 06:13:14.940
reach toward it, touching
the warm likens,

06:13:14.940 --> 06:13:18.660
the features of the stones,
the skin of the river.

06:13:18.660 --> 06:13:22.290
And I could tell then that
it was the animals themselves

06:13:22.290 --> 06:13:26.100
that were the weight and place
of the hour as it happened.

06:13:26.100 --> 06:13:31.130
And that the mass of the cows
neck, the flash of the swallow,

06:13:31.130 --> 06:13:34.680
the trout's flutter were
where it was coming to pass,

06:13:34.680 --> 06:13:38.560
they were bearing the sense
of it without questions

06:13:38.560 --> 06:13:46.270
through the speechless
cloud of light.

06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:56.110
Totally different kind of poem
next is one of several city poems

06:13:56.110 --> 06:13:59.980
in the book that followed <i>The
Vixen </i>, <i>The River Sound </i>,

06:13:59.980 --> 06:14:04.280
a book of short poems that
followed <i>The Vixen </i>.

06:14:04.280 --> 06:14:08.570
This is about an apartment
that I lived in

06:14:08.570 --> 06:14:12.070
and that represented a very
important part of my life

06:14:12.070 --> 06:14:16.330
for a great many years,
and that I lost.

06:14:16.330 --> 06:14:18.620
That's a story in itself.

06:14:18.620 --> 06:14:22.090
Sixth Floor Walk Up.

06:14:22.090 --> 06:14:24.730
I was born in New York City
and this is in New York City.

06:14:24.730 --> 06:14:28.500
New York to me is the
[inaudible] city.

06:14:28.500 --> 06:14:31.180
I mean, to me, it's
the core of history.

06:14:31.180 --> 06:14:34.090
I mean, we're not -- we don't
live entirely in history,

06:14:34.090 --> 06:14:38.620
but nor do I live entirely
in New York [laughter], but.

06:14:38.620 --> 06:14:41.620
And sometimes I felt there was a
friend of mine who was also born

06:14:41.620 --> 06:14:43.870
in New York, said -- someone said,

06:14:43.870 --> 06:14:47.320
"Why if you notice all
these terrible things

06:14:47.320 --> 06:14:49.890
about it all the time, and
complain about it so much,

06:14:49.890 --> 06:14:51.190
why do you keep coming back?"

06:14:51.190 --> 06:14:53.510
And he said, "I hate it
better than anywhere else."

06:14:53.510 --> 06:14:58.730
[ Laughter ]

06:14:58.730 --> 06:15:02.660
Sixth Floor Walk Up.

06:15:02.660 --> 06:15:06.500
Past 4:00 in the afternoon,
the last day here,

06:15:06.500 --> 06:15:10.380
the winter light is draining out of
the sky to the east over the grays

06:15:10.380 --> 06:15:15.740 position:56%
of the roofs, over the tiered bricks
and dark water tanks, clock towers,

06:15:15.740 --> 06:15:19.700
aerials, penthouse
windows, rusted doors,

06:15:19.700 --> 06:15:22.730
bare trees and terrace gardens.

06:15:22.730 --> 06:15:27.500 position:56%
In the distance a plane is coming
in, lit by the slow burn of the sun,

06:15:27.500 --> 06:15:30.540
sinking two weeks before
the Solstice.

06:15:30.540 --> 06:15:35.040
And the lingering perfect autumn
still does not seem to be gone.

06:15:35.040 --> 06:15:40.110
The walls of the apartment and the
long mirrors are becoming shadows.

06:15:40.110 --> 06:15:44.570
The latest telephone already cut
off is huddled against the wall,

06:15:44.570 --> 06:15:46.870
with it's deaf predecessors.

06:15:46.870 --> 06:15:50.440
The movers have not
showed up for what is left.

06:15:50.440 --> 06:15:56.840 position:56%
Bare bed, bare tables, and the sofa,
the piled LP's, the great chair

06:15:56.840 --> 06:16:01.470
from which at this hour once I
called up a friend on Morton Street

06:16:01.470 --> 06:16:04.350
to tell him that all
the windows facing west

06:16:04.350 --> 06:16:08.200
down the avenue were
reflecting a red building flaming

06:16:08.200 --> 06:16:12.430
like a torch somewhere over
near the old post office

06:16:12.430 --> 06:16:14.530
on Christopher Street.

06:16:14.530 --> 06:16:18.560
The sirens were converging,
all the bells clanging,

06:16:18.560 --> 06:16:22.700
and the sky was clear as it is now.

06:16:22.700 --> 06:16:26.380
They're stacking Christmas
trees along the fence again

06:16:26.380 --> 06:16:29.640
down at the corner to
the music of the Subway

06:16:29.640 --> 06:16:33.340
under the avenue, on
it's way to Brooklyn.

06:16:33.340 --> 06:16:43.930
25 years. And then another -- one
other poem from <i>The River Sound </i>,

06:16:43.930 --> 06:16:50.320
and this is -- [inaudible] said
that for a poem to be real,

06:16:50.320 --> 06:16:52.270
this doesn't necessarily
mean it is true,

06:16:52.270 --> 06:16:54.320
but it's very interesting
to think about.

06:16:54.320 --> 06:16:58.370 position:56%
For a poem to be a real poem you had
to know what time of year it was.

06:16:58.370 --> 06:16:59.750
This is called Waves in August,

06:16:59.750 --> 06:17:06.470
so you cheat with the
title, you see [laughter].

06:17:06.470 --> 06:17:08.080
Waves in August.

06:17:08.080 --> 06:17:15.420
There is a war in the distance,
with the distance growing smaller.

06:17:15.420 --> 06:17:20.320
The field glasses lying at hand
are for keeping it far away.

06:17:20.320 --> 06:17:25.670
I thought I was getting better
about that returning childish wish

06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:30.130
to be living somewhere else
that I knew was impossible.

06:17:30.130 --> 06:17:35.930
And now I find myself wishing
to be here, to be alive here,

06:17:35.930 --> 06:17:40.600
and is it possible enough to
still be the wish of a child.

06:17:41.830 --> 06:17:45.430
In youth I hid a [inaudible]
under the bushes beside the water,

06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:51.540
knowing I want it later, and come
back and would find it there.

06:17:51.540 --> 06:17:56.870
Someone else took it and left me
instead the sound of the water

06:17:56.870 --> 06:18:00.880
with it's whisper of
vertigo, terror,

06:18:00.880 --> 06:18:05.620
reassurance, and old, old sadness.

06:18:05.620 --> 06:18:10.590
It would seem we knew
enough always about parting.

06:18:10.590 --> 06:18:15.960
But we have to go on learning
as long as there's anything.

06:18:17.950 --> 06:18:25.270
The rest of the poems that
I want to read are all

06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:29.490
from a new manuscript that's
just gone to the publisher.

06:18:29.490 --> 06:18:38.710
And there are a number -- quite
a few poems in the early part

06:18:38.710 --> 06:18:44.590
of that poem that have to do with
the night sky and day and night,

06:18:44.590 --> 06:18:46.690
light and darkness, time.

06:18:46.690 --> 06:18:54.970
And I want to read a short one
of those called Glassy Sea.

06:19:01.200 --> 06:19:04.920
As you see each of
the stars has a voice,

06:19:04.920 --> 06:19:09.470
and at least one long syllable
before words as we know them

06:19:09.470 --> 06:19:14.800
and can recall them later one by
one with their company around them.

06:19:14.800 --> 06:19:18.090
After the sound of them
has gone from its moment,

06:19:18.090 --> 06:19:21.110
even though we may say
it again and again,

06:19:21.110 --> 06:19:25.210
it is gone again, far
into our knowledge.

06:19:25.210 --> 06:19:30.230
There were words as we know for
whatever does not die with us,

06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:34.990
but the sound of those words
lasts no longer than the others.

06:19:34.990 --> 06:19:37.710
It is heard only for
part of the length

06:19:37.710 --> 06:19:42.510
of a breath among those
clear syllables never heard

06:19:42.510 --> 06:19:46.540
from which the words were
made in another time.

06:19:46.540 --> 06:19:50.650
And the syllables themselves
are not there forever.

06:19:50.650 --> 06:20:00.650
Some may go all the way to the
beginning, but not beyond it.

06:20:00.650 --> 06:20:08.770
I want to read a difficult
kind of poem.

06:20:08.770 --> 06:20:19.810
This evening Robert and I were
going to, but Robert is indisposed,

06:20:19.810 --> 06:20:23.760
his voice has left him, and
I'm going to have to do it.

06:20:23.760 --> 06:20:26.960
I'm going to have to
read [inaudible].

06:20:26.960 --> 06:20:33.420
And I think probably
the hardest subject --

06:20:33.420 --> 06:20:37.820
one of the hardest subjects to
get into poetry, to write about,

06:20:37.820 --> 06:20:42.730
properly and make a
poem of is anger.

06:20:42.730 --> 06:20:48.470
Dante [assumed spelling] was a
person who traveled through life

06:20:48.470 --> 06:20:53.550
with terrible anger, a great deal
of anger, and he dealt with it

06:20:53.550 --> 06:20:59.150
in various ways, some of them we
would think quite successfully

06:20:59.150 --> 06:21:00.450
in the [inaudible].

06:21:00.450 --> 06:21:05.890 position:56%
He dealt with it both in the inferno

06:21:05.890 --> 06:21:10.870
and in the purgatorial
quite differently.

06:21:10.870 --> 06:21:14.750 position:56%
He dealt with -- he was dealing
with his own anger at the same time.

06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:17.760
I will deal with mine as
well as I can in a minute

06:21:17.760 --> 06:21:19.560
if I can possibly find his poem

06:21:19.560 --> 06:21:23.700
[ Laughter ]

06:21:23.700 --> 06:21:25.830
I thought I knew where
it was, but --

06:21:25.830 --> 06:21:27.130
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

06:21:27.130 --> 06:21:31.130
No, I'm not, but [laughter]
I'm getting desperate.

06:21:31.130 --> 06:21:32.500
I know it's here.

06:21:32.500 --> 06:21:38.030
And I've said all I
wanted to say about it,

06:21:38.030 --> 06:21:40.950
so you'll [laughter]
have to bear with me.

06:21:40.950 --> 06:21:44.920
I'll just end up by reading
something else instead.

06:21:44.920 --> 06:21:47.440
I do want to read this one.

06:22:02.080 --> 06:22:04.980
It's a poem about something
that's actually happening,

06:22:04.980 --> 06:22:07.000
and I'll tell you a little
bit about it, because --

06:22:07.000 --> 06:22:09.900
and the reason I want
to read it here is

06:22:09.900 --> 06:22:15.020
because I think it
concerns all poets.

06:22:15.020 --> 06:22:20.390
However you may care or
not care about animals,

06:22:20.390 --> 06:22:25.330
poets and the marginal aspect, I've
been hearing about the mainstream

06:22:25.330 --> 06:22:28.400
and about computers and so on in
all this time and I've never felt

06:22:28.400 --> 06:22:32.660
that I belonged to the
mainstream in a lot of ways.

06:22:32.660 --> 06:22:35.520
I felt that my life was
marginal and there's a part --

06:22:35.520 --> 06:22:37.450
there's a thing about poets

06:22:37.450 --> 06:22:42.440
that is deliberately
marginal and always has been.

06:22:42.440 --> 06:22:45.720
We speak from the edges
of things and that's

06:22:45.720 --> 06:22:49.710
where we recognize a place there.

06:22:49.710 --> 06:22:57.860
When poets -- when -- in the
beginning of the romantic period

06:22:57.860 --> 06:23:06.340
from which Dante came, the line
between those who wrote poems

06:23:06.340 --> 06:23:12.320 position:56%
and those who recited them in public
was vague and it kept dissolving.

06:23:12.320 --> 06:23:19.050 position:56%
And the [inaudible] were -- the
[inaudible] were the people who used

06:23:19.050 --> 06:23:26.720
to sing the poems -- this
poem has just disappeared.

06:23:26.720 --> 06:23:30.830
The [inaudible] were associated
with people who did all sorts

06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:37.420
of juggler acts and dancing
acts, and with people

06:23:37.420 --> 06:23:42.880
who had dancing bears, dancing
bears, a strange figure.

06:23:42.880 --> 06:23:49.680
Bears sometimes have been
taught to dance kindly,

06:23:49.680 --> 06:23:51.280
but that's been seldom the case.

06:23:51.280 --> 06:23:56.130
Bears don't generally want
to perform for human beings,

06:23:56.130 --> 06:23:58.190 position:56%
unless they've been taught to do it,

06:23:58.190 --> 06:24:01.630
and usually they've been
taught in terrible ways.

06:24:01.630 --> 06:24:04.800
Well that's what's been going on
in Pakistan and is still going

06:24:04.800 --> 06:24:07.810
on in Pakistan, and it's been
going on until quite recently

06:24:07.810 --> 06:24:12.090
in northern India, Greece, Turkey.

06:24:12.090 --> 06:24:16.520
One -- I won't -- I'll spare
you some of the horrible details

06:24:16.520 --> 06:24:23.400 position:56%
about how they're been trained to do
-- well, this is very embarrassing.

06:24:23.400 --> 06:24:25.510
Here we are.

06:24:25.510 --> 06:24:26.810
Here we are.

06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:32.440
Sooner or later, you see, patience,
your patience, not mine [laughter].

06:24:32.440 --> 06:24:36.970
Founded. This will tell you why
I think poets should concern

06:24:36.970 --> 06:24:39.200 position:56%
themselves with this terrible thing.

06:24:39.200 --> 06:24:41.960
There's an association
called the World Society

06:24:41.960 --> 06:24:43.270
for the Protection of Animals.

06:24:43.270 --> 06:24:46.190
You can look that up
if you get concerned

06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:50.530
about what I've been telling
you, and what I'm going to read,

06:24:50.530 --> 06:24:57.020
this poem, which is an angry poem
called Fieste [assumed spelling].

06:24:57.020 --> 06:25:00.630
Almost at the end of the
Century, this is the time

06:25:00.630 --> 06:25:03.250
of the pain of the bears.

06:25:03.250 --> 06:25:06.310
They're agony goes on at
this moment for the amusement

06:25:06.310 --> 06:25:10.250
of the wedding guests, though the
bears are harder to find by now

06:25:10.250 --> 06:25:13.270 position:56%
in the mountain forests of Pakistan.

06:25:13.270 --> 06:25:18.220
They cost more then they used to,
which makes it all the more lavish.

06:25:18.220 --> 06:25:21.190
And once they are caught,
their teeth are pulled out,

06:25:21.190 --> 06:25:23.120
and their claws pulled out.

06:25:23.120 --> 06:25:26.510
And among the entertainments after
the wedding, one of them is hauled

06:25:26.510 --> 06:25:32.520 position:56%
in now and chained to a post and the
dogs let loose to hang on it's nose

06:25:32.520 --> 06:25:36.830
so that the guests laugh at
the way it waves and dances.

06:25:36.830 --> 06:25:41.210
And those old enough to have
watched this many times compare it

06:25:41.210 --> 06:25:44.270
with other performances,
saying they can tell

06:25:44.270 --> 06:25:48.400
from the way the bear screams,
something about the children

06:25:48.400 --> 06:25:52.400
to be born of the couple
sitting there, smiling.

06:25:52.400 --> 06:25:56.760
You may not believe
it, but the bear does.

06:25:59.530 --> 06:26:05.180
And I want to read
one small, very small,

06:26:05.180 --> 06:26:15.940
another animal poem called The
Name of the Air, about a dog.

06:26:15.940 --> 06:26:20.350
It could be like that, then, the
beloved old dog finding it harder

06:26:20.350 --> 06:26:23.800
and hard to breathe, and
understanding but coming

06:26:23.800 --> 06:26:27.710
to ask whether there is something
that can be done about it.

06:26:27.710 --> 06:26:32.680
Coming again to ask and then
standing there without asking.

06:26:32.680 --> 06:26:42.290
I'll read two more poems, and
one of them is also about dogs.

06:26:42.290 --> 06:26:50.780 position:56%
When the great South African writer,
one of the greatest writers alive,

06:26:50.780 --> 06:26:57.120 position:56%
in my opinion, [inaudible], was
invited to give a series of lectures

06:26:57.120 --> 06:27:00.320
at Princeton recently
on any subject he chose.

06:27:00.320 --> 06:27:03.230 position:56%
He said he would like to do it about
[inaudible] in the form of fiction,

06:27:03.230 --> 06:27:05.730
and they said that
would be all right.

06:27:05.730 --> 06:27:10.550

woman novelist of some age,

06:27:10.550 --> 06:27:13.350 position:56%

American university to give a series

06:27:13.350 --> 06:27:18.510 position:56%
of lectures on any subject she
chooses, and she chooses not to give

06:27:18.510 --> 06:27:21.550
on the topic of literature, but
on the human treatment of animals,

06:27:21.550 --> 06:27:23.290
which is a taboo subject.

06:27:23.290 --> 06:27:26.070
You don't mention that
in polite company.

06:27:26.070 --> 06:27:29.000
It's a very interesting book
called, <i>The Lives of Animals </i>,

06:27:29.000 --> 06:27:33.140
this [inaudible] most recent book.

06:27:33.140 --> 06:27:36.820
Why are taboo subjects
taboo subjects?

06:27:37.830 --> 06:27:39.230
Home Tundra.

06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:46.440
It may be that the hour is
snow, seeming never to settle,

06:27:46.440 --> 06:27:51.440
not even to be cold now,
slipping away from underneath it.

06:27:51.440 --> 06:27:54.400
Past, slip -- sorry.

06:27:54.400 --> 06:27:56.900
Slipping away from
underneath into the past

06:27:56.900 --> 06:27:59.960
from which no sounds follow.

06:27:59.960 --> 06:28:03.900
What I hear is the dogs breathing
ahead of me in the shadow.

06:28:03.900 --> 06:28:10.830
Two of them have already gone far
on into the dark of closed pages,

06:28:10.830 --> 06:28:13.460
out of sight and hearing.

06:28:13.460 --> 06:28:19.160
Two of them are old already,
one cannot hear, one cannot see.

06:28:19.160 --> 06:28:24.940
Even in sleep they are running,
drawing me with them on their way,

06:28:24.940 --> 06:28:28.630
wrapped in a day I found today.

06:28:28.630 --> 06:28:33.770
We know where we are because
we are together here, together,

06:28:33.770 --> 06:28:36.570
leaving no footprints in the hour.

06:28:36.570 --> 06:28:46.200
Whatever the diary's say, nobody
ever found the [inaudible].

06:28:46.200 --> 06:28:51.800
Past stream, the chipped lake, gold
strokes on the high clawed hollows

06:28:51.800 --> 06:28:53.620
where you never set foot.

06:28:53.620 --> 06:28:57.320
What would you see from there?

06:28:57.320 --> 06:29:04.820
Not the past, which is fiction,
nor the present, which is the past.

06:29:04.820 --> 06:29:09.070
You would stand there shaken in
the presence of Vertigo, the God,

06:29:09.070 --> 06:29:16.350
clutching the air, hearing that
one note you keep forgetting.

06:29:16.350 --> 06:29:18.150
Thank you.

could say would be superfluous.

06:29:49.290 --> 06:29:57.370
We've been taken into six different
visions of human possibility,

06:29:57.370 --> 06:30:02.480
six different sets
of sound and sense.

06:30:02.480 --> 06:30:07.280
It's been a marvelous
end to a very full day.

06:30:07.280 --> 06:30:12.640
There is a reception outside where
you can mingle with our poets.

06:30:12.640 --> 06:30:17.010
And thank you for being with us,
and thank them for being with us.
