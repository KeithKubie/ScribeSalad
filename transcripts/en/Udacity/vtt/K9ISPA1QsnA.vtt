00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.720
Now that we have discussed means and

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.170
analysis in problem production, let's
revisit one of the problems that we

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.990
would encounter when we were talking
about the Raven's test of intelligence.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.940
So imagine that this is A and this is B.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.830
We can think of this as an initial
state and this as a goal state.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.950
We know that A has been
transformed into B.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.780
Now we can think in terms of
a sequence of operations,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.810
that will transform this initial
state into the goal state.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.410
It is one sequence.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.470
Delete it out,
then move the diamond out of the circle.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.192
Then expanded out.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:41.600
Let us now see, we can think of this
as an outward or means of analysis

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.022
because each move here, brings us
a little closer to the goal state.

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:49.730
The advantage of doing this analysis and
coming up with a sequence of

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.460
transformations that will take us from
the initial state of goal state as that.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.160
We cannot in [INAUDIBLE] of applying
the same set of transformations

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.270
to the image free, let's do that.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.810
We'll apply one transformation at
a time, so we'll apply delete.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.200
We delete the dot.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.010
Now we apply move to this state, and
it can give rise to several states.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.160
We have shown two here.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.710
Both of these spheres fulfill the
requirements of this move operation of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.900
taking the diamond outside the circle.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.560
And now for each of the states,
we can apply the operation of expand.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.030
Here we are expanding the circle,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.190
here too we are expanding the circle,
although with different amounts.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.310
Once again the question here is,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.900
what in the image A corresponds
to what in image C?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.720
How do we know that
the diamond inside here

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.535
corresponds to the circle
inside the triangle here?

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:42.150
We'll discuss this in detail when we
discuss analogical reasoning, but for

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480
now, here is a partial answer.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.600
Remember that we had a semantic
network representation of the image A.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.110
And in that representation, we said
that the diamond is inside the circle.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.580
Now, we also have a semantic
network representation of image C.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.820
And that semantic network representation
says that the circle is inside

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.730
the triangle.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.290
But it's that inside
relationship that hints that

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.389
this circle must
correspond to the diamond.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.270
Because here the diamond is inside and
here the circle is inside.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.110
So note then, that their presentation
allows us to answer several questions

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.990
about similarity, about correspondence
and when we have metals, like means and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.900
analysis then we can do a systematic
analysis of this transformations, and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.250
try to transfer this set of
transformations to the new problem.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.770
&gt;&gt; What's interesting is we can also see
this as an example of problem reduction.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.160
We initially just had a big
problem that we had to solve.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.230
But here,
we've reduced it to three subgoals.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.106
Our first subgoal is to find
the transformation between A and B.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:49.070
Our second subgoal, is to transfer
that transformation to C and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.270
find some candidate states for D.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.290
And our third subgoal, would be to
compare those candidate states for

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.930
D to each of the choices in our problem.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.580
&gt;&gt; That's good analysis, David.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.490
Let's go one step further.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.850
This also has generated.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.500
We are generating solutions that we can
then test against the various choices

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.199
that were given to us.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.777
So in this particular problem,
you can see means and analysis working,

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:16.580
problem reduction working,
and the Raven's test working.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.450
Often, solving the complex problem
requires a combination of AI techniques.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.830
At one point,
one might use problem reduction.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.832
At another point, one might use
the Raven's test, and at a third point,

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.249
one might use means and analysis.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:34.540
Notice also, that the one single
knowledge representation of semantic

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.910
network supports all three
of these strategies.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.190
The coupling between the knowledge
representation of semantic network, and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.238
any of these three strategies,
problem reduction, means and analysis,

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:46.850
and generating test is weak.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.430
Later on we'll come across
methods in which knowledge and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.560
the problem solving method
are closely coupled.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.650
The knowledge affords
certain inferences, and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.970
inferences demand certain
kinds of knowledge.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.810
This is why these methods
are known as Weak Methods.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.350
Because the coupling between
this universal method and

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.130
the knowledge representation is weak.
