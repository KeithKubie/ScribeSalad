Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So, um, the second part of the last lecture introduced the idea of Alkenes and we were talking about the stability of Alkenes sis versus trans, uh, and the effect of substitution. Uh, we'll go on with that today and then go on to addition mechanisms, which is the characteristic reactivity of alkenes. So if we look at the, uh, stabilities of these, uh, c six alkene isomers that we talked about last time, we showed how you could get the numbers for those from the Nis t website. Uh, it's also possible, uh, to get them from this, uh, uh, book by Pedley. That's the one that, uh, Professor Weinberg, who's a big expert on this, I recommended to me as a good source. So here's the heat of formation of the, uh, of the, the, the, uh, straight chain with the double bond and that number one position, uh, what does he to formation? What's that? The heat relative to the energy of this molecule compared to what

Speaker 2:          01:17          the heat of formation you read,

Speaker 1:          01:21          rehearse from last semester.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Mary, it's not the heat of battle

Speaker 1:          01:27          causation. How do you measure such things? How do you measure the heat of a molecule? Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Yeah, yeah. No, that's, that's how

Speaker 1:          01:40          that was the way that you got the heat of formation of carbon atoms from graphite and Lebron, but that only needed to be done once to get where carbon atom is relative to graphite. Then you need to know the Ma, the energy of molecules relative to graphite. How do you do that?

Speaker 2:          02:08          But that's a very difficult thing to do with them. Do to

Speaker 1:          02:10          break the bonds of graphite, Matt, do you have an idea? Combusts graphite. You burned them, right? You compare them to see oh two so you take your molecule and burn that. We talked about this last semester, you burn graphite, you also burn h two so you can get a hydrocarbon. How much, what's the energy of your compound compared to the amount of energy that was in hydrogen and carbon of graphite? Okay, so anyhow, the heat of formation is, is a minus a 10 or a little bit more kilocalories per mole. That means it's that much more stable than the elements would be in their defined standard state. Okay. Now, if you'll look at it for the CIS three Hex, seen the double bond beginning on the third carbon, it's a little bit more stable. Right? And that doesn't surprise you because we've talked about having a more carbons as opposed to hydrogens on a, on a double bonded carbon, uh, makes the, makes the compound more stable. That is that the ch bonds are not as, don't profit as much from the change in hybridization to cc bond seemed to do okay. Now if you have the Trans Isomer, it's still more stable by about one and a half kilo calories. I don't know whether you had a chance to look at the problems yet. Probably not. They were for Wednesday, uh, to look at the generalities, but you find that, uh, the Trans isomer is about one and a half kilocalories more stable than this. This, can you think of any explanation for that, Amy?

Speaker 3:          04:02          Right, right.

Speaker 1:          04:02          That they run, the groups run into one another. It's a stearic effect when they're assist. That's worth about one and a half kilocalories per mole. Okay. Now if you, if you make three carbon carbon bonds from the double bond, uh, incidentally there's a table that has those in it too. In the, in the Jones book, if you put three carbons on the double bond, then it's more stable still. And obviously if you put four, it's a little bit more stable still. Now, if we come back and look at the, at the, uh, at correcting for strain, which would, which was what we attributed the difference between CIS and Trans, uh, two, we find that there's 3.6 kilocalories of molecular mechanics strain in the sis and 2.5 and the trans. So it's what you said Amy, that's the melt. Like molecular mechanics explains it in terms of a stearic effect.

Speaker 1:          04:58          Okay, so the average then for those two is about there. And now if we make strain corrections for the other molecules as well, calculate the strain by molecular mechanics. There's 2.8 kilocalories of strain calculated there, 2.6 and 7.7 and the one that has four carbons on the double bond. And now you notice something interesting about the trend. Once you've corrected for strain, what do you notice? All right, it's almost exactly linear according to the number of CC bonds, right? So you get, you gain in stability about two and a half kilocalories per mole every time you substituted the Cah with a CC, right? Keeping the same number of carbons and hydrogens in the molecule discussing isomers of one another. Cause of course it makes no sense to compare heats of formation for molecules that are not isomers from one of one another, right? You're comparing apples with oranges.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Okay? So you get, so that could be due to this hybridization, it could in part be due to hyper conjugation that we talked about before the, uh, and we'll talk a little bit more about it later. Now let's think about the thermo chemistry involved in Alkie hcl reaction. So here's Hcl plus and how keyed to give the edition product where h is added the one carbon and cl to the other. So notice we've converted a single bond and a double bond on the left into three single bonds on the right. Is that likely to be favorable or unfavorable? What's the energy of a double bond compared to two single bonds? That's what we've done here.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Do you remember from our table and we looked at in the first semester, how much? The second is the second bond of a double bond worth as much as the first, more or less, it's worth less. Okay. So if we look back at that table that we looked at last semester, uh, and, and put actual numbers to these, to these, uh, bonds that we've drawn here, uh, we see that the hydrogen chloride bond is worth 103 kilocalories per mole. The double bond carbon carbon double bond is 146 so there's 249 that we're losing in the starting material. So how much do we gain in the product making the three single bonds? So there's 104 and [inaudible] 83 and 81 okay, so two 68 in other words, it's profitable by 19 kilocalories per mole to do this edition. And we talked about this before when we were talking about chain reaction, addition of Hcl, right?

Speaker 1:          08:06          Or, or Hbr, Ahi and so on, all of the war exothermic by about that much. So it's favorable by 19 kilocalories per mole. Uh, now we could also look more specifically at these compounds by using that data that's in a table that we access last time from National Institute of Science and technology to look at the actual heats of formation of these, of these particular molecules in the gas phase. That is, uh, before we were just looking at average bond energies to get an order of magnitude idea of what's going on or better than an order of magnitude. But these, these now will give us the precise values and where we said it was 19 before, now we see that for this specific set of compounds, it's 14 a half. But we were about right, it was a good guest before. Now suppose that, uh, so this reaction should go to the right, but we've already talked about a reaction that goes to the left. What reaction would that be? The one that starts on the right and he goes to the left. That's the elimination reaction. And he two reaction goes from right to left. What's the difference?

Speaker 1:          09:26          Why could we talk if this, if this equilibrium lies to the right, how could we have spent all this time in the last quarter of the course? Talking about reactions going the other way is not uphill and energy.

Speaker 1:          09:43          What reagents do you use to do the elimination phase? A strong base, right? Like hydroxide. So let's see what happens if we put hydroxide into the mix. Okay, so we had it acid, we get addition, right? And it's favorable by 14 kilocalories per mole in this particular case. But if we put hydroxide in there, now what will it react with? Well, it it, we, we know we talked about how it pulls off the Proton at the same time chloride leaves and the two reaction. But if all we're doing is study in Thermo Chemistry, we could look at where it is in the product, in the balance of the, of the two sides of the equation. So what it does on the left is take the proton awaits wage away from HCL, right? To give water and chloride. Now, hcl is a much stronger acid than water is. So that's a very favorable process to take the proton away from hcl and to put it on hydroxide. And in fact, we could, uh, find out how different it is by looking up at that same table, the proton affinities of o, h minus and chloride. And we find they differ by 19 kilocalories per mole. So adding hydroxides stabilizes the left side of this equation by 19 kilocalories per mole, and now it's favorable to go the other way by four and a half kilo calories per hole.

Speaker 1:          11:17          Okay, so we had base, you do elimination, you go the other way. Now are these really the reverse of one another? Do we just run the machine backwards to get, uh, elimination as a PA as or to get addition as compared to the elimination we talked about before? Or is it a different mechanism? Because the conditions are different. This is done. The, the elimination was done in the presence of strong base. The addition has done in the presence of acid. So you might not be able to run the machine backwards. Right? So incidentally, here's a problem for you to look out for Wednesday to use the PKA values for hcl in h two o to estimate here. Here I looked it up actually the proton affinities and I s t and got 19 kilocalories per mole. But you could have done the same thing out of your head or out of a simple table. Does anybody remember what the PKA of Hcl is?

Speaker 1:          12:23          The exam is Friday. I realize that. Scrub that now anybody remember about what it is? It's about, I think it's minus eight, isn't it? And how about the PKA of water? Negative 16 so from that difference you can calculate what the, what the energy of that reaction would be. So try it from that difference and see if you can do it. That's a good exercise for you. But other than the rate, we have the question of the addition to the back of aneurysm. Is it the reverse of the two or Iwan mechanism? Okay. So we're going to talk about addition to Alkenes and we've already done that to a certain extent. We talked about the SOMO mechanism, the free radical chain edition of Hbr. And you remember what that is, that a bromine atom ads to give the more stable radical, which then attacks HBR taking off the hydrogen atom to give the the product, it gives that product and there's a reference in the textbook, gives that product not the one above.

Speaker 1:          13:32          Right. And it doesn't give that one, it's Riggio selective. And remember we called this anti Markovnikov, right? Markovnikov had the idea as we talked about last time, that the carbon that has more substituents gets more, right. So if you had, if you had two methyl groups already on one of the double bonded carbons, it would be the one that gets the bromine that, uh, that the hydrogen goes to the other one. But this is anti Markovnikov. It does the, does the opposite. Okay. So we've already talked about that. And the key feature in the regio selection is getting the more stable carbon radical. Okay. But it's also conceivable that there could be a homo Lumo mechanism, a concerted one where the new group comes up to the double bond. And the part the partners just exchange like this. Suppose you had h two to react with with the carbon carbon double bond. A very exothermic reaction, right? So you could just shift electron pairs like that and perform the edition. Right. Now let's look at the orbitals that would be involved in that. Uh, what's, what's the homo of the CC? Double Bond.

Speaker 2:          14:58          Ellen. Hi. Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:03          And the, and the Lumo is Pi Star now. So let's try to bring the whole, the Lumo in the homo of the h two down on top, right. Looked good to mix homo and Lumo. What do you call that situation?

Speaker 2:          15:28          Ro.

Speaker 1:          15:31          They're out of phase. They're, in fact, there's a specific word to talk about things that don't overlap for this cemetery kind of reason. Remember what it is? They're orthogonal on her access, right? So there could be no, there's no mixing of Homo, of one with Lumo or the other. Of course, you could shift them right? So that they mix, right? But then there's nothing to be gained because on the left you're mixing, filled with filled. That's repulsive. And on the right, the orbitals are empty. There's nothing that has that, whenever energies are available for those orbitals. So you can't do this reaction, you can't just bring a B signal bond down on top of a double bond and change partners cause the symmetry is wrong of the orbitals. They won't mix that way. You can't draw those two arrows. However, it turns out that if you use certain catalysts in particular metals like platinum, they make it possible to do this because the platinum gets involved, it gets its orbitals involved in there can be favorable overlap.

Speaker 1:          16:35          And we'll be talking about that pretty soon. You see that in the Jones book? That's in chapter 10. Okay. So that would be a concerted reaction where you make and break bonds at the same time. But it's also possible to do it step wise. That's why the reactions are called electrophilic because you have, uh, an acid, for example, HBR and the homo attacks, the sigma star Lumo attacks the Proton to give off bromide, right? And then the bromide can attack the, uh, can attack the intermediate cad I. And so it's a two step reaction. So the initial reaction is the reaction of an electro file, something that wants the electrons a low Lumo. The sigma star of Hbr is the reagent that reacts with the Double Bond. Okay. And notice that that one works for any hydrogen. Hey, do you remember all the hydrogen halides where exothermic for their addition to the double bond, but only HBR would work by the top mechanism here, the Somo because both steps are exothermic to compete with termination, right?

Speaker 1:          17:48          Whereas any of the hydrogen hail lights we'll do, we'll do this step wise electrophilic or reaction. And notice in this case that it does follow Mark Cuban to Coffs rule. It's not that one. It's the, it's the Markovnikov where bromide goes to the more substituted carbon and it goes there because that carbon is more stable in the inner, that carbon cat die in this more stable as an intermediate. Okay. So that's stuff that mostly we've mentioned before. Now let's think about the orbitals and where they should get attacked. So here's ethylene and alkeen and we can look at the surface potential to see the energy of a proton on the Vanderwall surface. So a proton likes to be up above where the double bond is and it doesn't like to be around where the hydrogens are, right? So this, this electrostatic, a feature of the surface of the molecule is important in positioning the fragments before they begin to react.

Speaker 1:          18:53          But new bonding requires mixing or, but also not just positioning things electrostatically hey, so we should look at the homo and the Lumo. So the Lumo is, is this a Pi Star or a beetle? And the homo is the Pi orbital, right? So the addition, as we've said to alkenes is electrophilic. It goes after the Pi electrons, the high homo. So the proton with its low vacant orbital electrostatically likes to be up on top. That's the best place to be. If you're on the surface of the molecule and when it's there, it can overlap, uh, with this, uh, uh, Pi Star that, but this Pi orbital. So in the various textbooks you have, you can read about this electrophilic addition to alkanes. I guarantee you there are all these sections in there, one about hydrogen haylight edition by our plus by the cat eye. And intermediate what we just talked about on the previous slide, there'll be discussion of the regio chemistry, which end the h plus adds two to give the more stable cad I and intermediate and there'll be discussion of hydration where instead of the x minus being the things adds to the h plus it's the solvent water, right?

Speaker 1:          20:11          The, the unshared pair on oxygen can attack the cat eye on as well and then lose a proton so that it's Oah that goes on instead of x minus. So you can be reading that in your texts. And this just to show an example is from the uh, uh, lecture that I mentioned was given by Professor Siegel last year where he talks about how you can do this Markovnikov addition chloride going into the more substituted hi. Ooh. Going into the more substituted are going to the more substituted when it's clean, right? That is when you don't have free radical initiators there. Okay. So all of these form by Proton first going here, right to get this more stable cad on intermediate. Uh, and in this case with dilute sulfuric acid, it was water that came on to do this. Okay. And that mechanism is shown here incidentally, a on the exam, the, remember the last question was to draw very careful curved arrows and everything I give, I put this up in part to give you fellow feeling because we graded that very rigorously.

Speaker 1:          21:24          When you draw a curved Arrow where due to denote electron pair shifts, where do you start the Arrow, where the electrons are in the starting material and where do you end the, the point of the Arrow, where are those electrons are in the product? Sometimes they will be on and Adam become an an eye on or become an unshared payer. Sometimes they will be between two atoms because you're forming a new bond and if you want to be thinking really clearly about it, you should draw those arrows clearly. That's why I asked it that way in the question. But notice that professor Siegel here in drawing some of these arrows, drew it going onto the hydrogen, he drew the x minus going onto the carbon where I would expect you to draw this curved Arrow ending between x and the carbon and to position those two things that are going to react with one another in the, in your drawing such that they're close enough to one another that that makes sense to end the Arrow between them, not to have it off here in the Arrow terminating in space just because it's halfway between.

Speaker 1:          22:31          So that's a lesson that I hope that will become clear. Okay, so this shows the case of water intervening. Okay. So, uh, there, there are sections of the books about the addition to hydrogen highlights about regio selectivity, about the intermediate cat ions that are involved about cad and stability and about cad. I and rearrangements, and I'll talk about a few of those things here, but you can review them in your book as well. Okay. First about cad I and stability. I took this from the text we use a couple of years ago by Loudon, so he shows primary, secondary and tertiary cad ions. How many carbons are substituted on them and says of the stability of Carbo cat ions that tertiary is more stable than secondary is more stable than primary. This of course is the explanation for Markovnikov cough orientation.

Speaker 1:          23:25          Now we can look at the rationale for that. A rehearse it once again, hyper conjugation says if you have high, it's better to have a carbon on the carbon cad ion with its hydrogen or whatever else it's bonded to. Then to have just the hydrogen and the reason it's better is that there's some kind of Hobo, it's in position to have its electron stabilized by that unusually low energy Lumo the one associated with the positive charge, the vacant orbital on carbon and in the case of hydrogen there are no electrons to be stabilized. Those are our thoughts funnel to this. But in this case, the bought the sigma electrons that are in the bond, even though they aren't particularly high, can interact with a really unusually low orbital and, and get some stabilization. So we've talked about this before, this hyper conjugation. And it can be denoted by writing a resonance structure, which has a double bond between the carbons and an h plus or are plus if it's an art group out there.

Speaker 1:          24:29          The other rationale for this order of cad ions stability is bond energies. And we've talked about this several times, changing ch to CC bonds when they, when you have this specially, uh, advantageous sp square hybridisation of the carbon. But those are theory and it's different to, to know what the evidence is that they actually have that order tertiary more stable than primary. So the first part is the rationalization. Now we have to say, where do we actually get the evidence that their stability is that way? Right? And several people on the exam, uh, when asked for evidence, provided theory, rationale like this rather than actual numbers they have where, where the evidence comes from. So to get evidence you have to compare something. So you could compare, uh, products or, or transition states that is, you could look at reactivity if you have a very unstable cat die and you would expect it to be more reactive.

Speaker 1:          25:39          Right? So that would be one way that you could do it. Another way would be, uh, compare with the starting alkene you, if it's easier to put a proton on that will for that would indicate that the cat died and you're leading to is more stable, right? The cat ions uphill and energy typically. But if it's a more stable cat eye and it should be easier to form. So the reactions where you protonate the alkene and should be easier or in the reactions, we were just talking about the, the sn one substitutions, the ease of losing the anti in order to generate the leaving group. That is to say in order to generate the carbon cat eye, it should be easier when the cat ion is more stable. So we could do either of those or we could compare directly, compare the cat ions with one another, right. To see which one is more stable. Now here's a table taken from the textbook, uh, which gives a table of the heats of, of carbon cad ions, uh, in the gas phase. So they're very hard to make in the, in the gas phase. And it says secondary vinyl cad ions are more stable than primary vinyl cat ions. Now what's the basis for that here

Speaker 1:          27:03          in the table? What's the basis for saying that secondary vinyl cat ions are more stable than primary vinyl cad ions?

Speaker 4:          27:10          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:14          well, we look up there and we see a primary vinyl cad ion is in fact that the highest energy of any of these right. And the secondary vinyl cad iron is also pretty high. I mean, it's, it's, it's substituted, which, you know, it's, it's secondary, which should make it better and indeed it is better. Okay. So it says it's better by 54 kilocalories per mole in the gas phase.

Speaker 4:          27:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:40          No, there's a problem with this, with using this table in this way. And the problem is compared to what?

Speaker 4:          27:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:49          Is this really saying that a primary vinyl cad ion is more stable than a secondary vinyl cat on compared to what these heats of formation? What are they compared to?

Speaker 4:          28:09          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:10          so this is the energy of the vital cat eye and compared to what?

Speaker 4:          28:17          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:18          what's the heat of formation? Hello? Th th that's the heat of combustion. It could have been heat of combustion. We would add something to these to get heat of combustion. Right. But it's actually what's given as a heat of formation.

Speaker 4:          28:32          Perfect.

Speaker 1:          28:34          Yeah. Compared to carbon and graphite and hydrogen and h two gas at standard temperature and pressure and so on. That is compared to the elements in their standard states. But notice that there are different numbers of atoms in these things. They're not ice of one another. So it's not that you can convert one to the other and say that that, that the heat, that this heat difference shown here takes one to the other. There you're comparing apples and oranges, they're just not the same thing. If you want to compare with heats of formation, they have to be things that are ice verse of one another where you know their energy relative to one another rather than relative to something completely different. Different numbers of Adams. Okay, so this particular table doesn't help you at all directly in figuring out except that there might be some cases here like this one.

Speaker 1:          29:28          Notice that this was is a c four h nine and this one is also c four h nine so here's a primary and a secondary which differ by 20 kilocalories per mole in the gas phase. And that really does show that secondary is more stable than primary. But this table definitely doesn't show that secondary vinyl cat ions are more stable than primary vinyl cat ions. So you have to think carefully about compared to what here you're comparing two different numbers of Adams in their standard states, not relative to each other, nor are relative to their respective starting materials or products as we talked about last time. So this table in general is irrelevant to the question of I and stability in the sense that we were talking about it in the previous slide. Now on the other hand, and it allowed near table 4.2 gives the heats of formation of ISO Merrick, butyl cad ions, right?

Speaker 1:          30:27          So the same atoms they're being compared to the same thing. So differences between them now do tell us the difference between primary, secondary, and tertiary cat ions. So here are the, here are the, they got it from the same numbers, heats of formation, although in fact you'll find that these numbers are slightly different from those in the previous table. So one, one, neither books says what the source of these numbers is. So, uh, these NIST values have been pretty carefully gone through. So if I, if push comes to shove, I often look at those or ask Professor Weinberg, what's the best value is okay. But here you see that that uh, the relative energy of the tertiary beautiful cat ion is, is taken a zero, the most stable and now the others are 16 or 32 or 37 kilocalories, a less stable, right? So tertiary is more stable than secondary is more stable than primary.

Speaker 1:          31:25          And here are two different primaries. Now if we look at that too, those two, we see that going from primary to secondary is a heat of, is a difference of 21 kilocalories per mole. 37 to 16 primary is, is less stable by 21 kilocalories per mole, okay? Now remember that the reason for this could be things like hyper conjugation or the number of carbons bonded to the SP squared carbon, right? The same factors that we talked about in the case of alkenes making more substituted owl Keaton's more stable here, more substituted cad ions are more stable, but the difference is much bigger here. 21 kilocalories per mole versus two and a half kilocalories per mole. From the slope of that plot we made for the alkenes at the beginning of the lecture. So it's ever so much more important for cad ions than it is for alkenes whatever the factor is that's doing this.

Speaker 1:          32:28          Okay. So it could be hyper conjugation. Would you expect that to be more stable, more important for the cat ions shown here or for the alkenes where the carbon is carbon carbon double bond. You have the same factor that the carbon carbon double bond here would have a low Lubo. This has, uh, that, uh, p orbital on carbon that has a Pi star, orbital Alo Lumo and the same deal here. Right. Would you expect the, the, uh, effect of that mixing Homo Lubo mixing in hyper conjugation to be the same as, as when you have a double bond,

Speaker 1:          33:09          which would be if one is bigger than the, once that stabilization as bigger than the other, which, so here we have, uh, here we have the electrons in a sigma bond and here we have a vacant orbital. In the case of the cat aisle, we have just a vacant p orbital. In the case of the double bond, we have Pi star orbital, right plus minus, which one's going to give more stabilization of these electrons? What determines that? What determines how much stabilization you get out of mixing horribles there you good overlap is one thing now, so it's a p orbital on carbon in either case here in one case that p orbital is also associated with another PR battle. So each of them is one over the square root of two, so it's smaller in one case. So there deed would be less overlap in the case of of uh, of the carbon carbon double bond rather than just a full fledged p orbital. So that's one factor. How about another factor, Reagan?

Speaker 2:          34:16          How about the energy match when you have a positive, think about that carefully. Say that again. Yeah. The positive charge,

Speaker 1:          34:29          it makes the energy fabulously low for the cad ion. The Pi's stars is, is low compared to sigma star, but it's not really all that low compared to the vacant orbital. So both on the basis of overlap and on the basis of energy match, you expect a much bigger factor for the cat I and the data for the alkene. And in fact, that's what you see. It's worth a heck of a lot more, right? Uh, and but the bond energy factor might be more or less similar between the two because in both cases you're changing c h DSCC single bonds. But this is the one that should make a really big difference. But there's another factor as well actually, which is that these are measured in the gas phase. Alright? So we have this positively charged carbon in the gas phase in, so we saw when we talked about the ionization of water, how much difference, how much of a effect salvation has on the ability to form ions. So here we're trying to form an eye and on this carbon, right? Could you see something that, another difference among about stables, about stabilization by this positive charge, other than hyper conjugation and bond energy

Speaker 4:          35:53          haven,

Speaker 1:          35:56          it's the other stuff in the molecule. The other three carbon atoms in there, hydrogens are polarizable. But remember that there's a very strong distance dependence. You have to be really close to get a lot of advantage out of that. So with t butyl, you have all the other atoms really close to the positive charge to be stabilized by polarization here. Uh, here, you have that one much further away. Here you have two of them significantly further away. And here you have this one significantly further away. And this one off in left field, right? So we can see that there's going to be in trauma, molecular salvation that you might call it, that nobody else calls it that. But this effect from polarizability that's going to in the gas phase is going to be very important. But if you go into solution, it's just the reverse, right?

Speaker 1:          36:52          Because the, the, the one that the primary one up here has the positive charge, very exposed. So neighboring molecules can get very close to that. So in the gas phase, it's the molecules within, that's the Adams within the molecule that are solid aiding the positive charge and are electrons being stabilized. But if you go into regular solution, it turns around. So, so these, these, uh, so these differences in the gas phase are much bigger than the effects that you would actually see in a solution reaction where the primary car cad ions are more stabilized by the surrounding molecules. So for example, if you do sn, one reaction t beautiful bromide is only about five kilocalories per mole, easier to ionize than ice appropriate bromide that we saw in that, that, uh, remember where a methyl ethyl ice appropriate t butyl, right? T butyl was unusually easy to do to substitute because it went by sn one, right?

Speaker 1:          38:01          But if you looked at the ice of propyl, it also, uh, was going partly by sn one. And it turns out that it's about five kilocalories harder for ice appropriately. But here, the difference between a t butyl and, and ice and the ice of the, the equivalent of ice appropriately is, uh, is, is 16 kilocalories per mole, right? Or even more so. So it's very strongly attenuated and solution. So, uh, people often talk about gas phase being intrinsic values for four things you could measure like the heats of formation of these things that that's the ideal. The reason it's ideal is you could compare it with calculation, right? But it's not an ideal reference if what you're interested in is predicting reactions and solution where that salvation is going to make a lot of difference. Okay. Now here's addition of, uh, of Hcl to an Alkane. Okay. So is this mark off in the car for Anti Markovnikov addition? Natalie, what? Do you remember what mark called [inaudible]?

Speaker 4:          39:23          Have you mark off the cough means? Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:29          Does the an eye on the non hydrogen thing go to the more substituted carbon in this case? Yeah, it did. And why? Of course, what we would expect is that it would be attacked. Right? And this would give the more substituted cad I on rather than attacking the central carbon and having the primary cad I is the intermediate, right? Then chloride goes over and forms a new bond and you have the product. So that's Mark Hoffman a cough edition by however, that's only 17% of the product. The 83% of the product is that. Can anybody see what's funny about that product is that the anti Markovnikov addition, Natalie,

Speaker 4:          40:24          awesome. Right? I can't hear very well that part of it is equally substituted. Ah,

Speaker 1:          40:33          the, the substitution of the carbons is different. What has happened, we saw this before,

Speaker 4:          40:45          Chris will shit,

Speaker 1:          40:47          a vessel is shifted. It's rearranged. In fact, what shifts is a muscle group, but it's a methyl with its electrons. It's a meth. I'd shift that. What you're talking about, cad ions as you will see here. So it's, it's shifted the methyl across. So what's happened is that those pair of the electrons, it's like hyper conjugation, right? That those sigma electrons are stabilized by the vacant orbital on the carbon, but they're stabilized so much that the methyl with its electrons, with those bonding electrons, the method shifts across. Right? And often if you want to have fun when you, sometimes when you a rearrangement, you pro draw a little loop in the Arrow in that cute. Okay. So the, the meth I'd has shifted across to give this more stable cat I, and this was secondary. This one is tertiary. Okay. And then that gives 83% of the product.

Speaker 1:          41:51          So what this says is that the rearrangement, the Meth, I'd shift competes with reaction with the collapse of the ions, chloride attacking the positive carbon. So both things happen, right? And they have similar rates. Now suppose you didn't have, suppose you had a lot of some other nucleophile. They're like water right now. The unshared pair of water could fill the role that chloride filled here and then lose protons that you've got h o t a h two o plus than it loses a proton. So you could get this alcohol or you can get the rearranged alcohol. So the fact of this rearrangement is of course, additional evidence that you had the cat eye and intermediate as it was in a sn. One reactions where, where the, uh, rearrange skeleton showed that there had been a cat eye and intermediate.

Speaker 1:          42:49          Uh, so when you do, uh, uh, acid catalyzed hydration of a double bond, addy, h and o h, uh, you have to be aware that there's the possibility of rearrangement. If the skeleton is one where you would form one cat ion, but then, uh, uh, some of method shift could get, or a hydride shift could give a more stable one. Now let's look at the influence of Halogen in, in these, uh, cat ions. So here we start with a settling and at Hcl, right? So we've started to give the more substituted vinyl cad ion. Remember the table we talked, it said primary vinyl cat ions are less stable than secondary vinyl cat ions, even though the data didn't, was not the appropriate data to support that. It's absolutely true that vinyl cat ions are very hard to make, right? So this is not such an easy process, but then it can add chloride.

Speaker 1:          43:56          So you have, uh, this, uh, this product, which is the Markovnikov product, the, the Proton added to the terminal carbon to make the more stable secondary rather than adding to the central carbon to make the less stable primary cad. I, and so the chloride ends up there and this is perfectly reasonable. Okay. But it went by way of this unstable vinyl cad I, and so it turns out that this, that audition, this kind of, uh, electrophilic addition to alkenes is a hundred to a thousand times slower than it to alkanes is 102 party to al kinds is a hundred to a thousand times slower than to alkenes. It's much harder to add to triple bonds the double bonds because you get these unfavorable vinyl cat high and intermediate. Well, fine, but now we have a double bond. Okay, so you could do, and we had Markovnikov for ego chemistry, but you, if you have excess hcl you can, you can add it again and yet a second Markovnikov addition. Okay. Uh, now suppose you didn't have an excess of HCL. Suppose you just had one equivalent of HCL. What products would you expect? What products would you expect to get

Speaker 4:          45:24          Jack? Pardon? It's still bad.

Speaker 1:          45:27          Why still that double bond? The double bond is easier to attack from the triple bond. So if you didn't have enough hcl, still this would be much more reactive than this. After you formed any of that, it will be reacting a hundred to a thousand times faster per molecules and that did, so you're still going to get this product Jack's right. Okay. Uh, now these were on under certain conditions. These are the, uh, the yield you got. It was 56% and 44%. I suspect that if the reaction had been carried on longer, you would get do what Jack did. You get, well, you'd go all the way there, but under certain conditions at least the reaction was interrupted and that was the product distribution. Now it went obviously by way of this cat eye and intermediate. The second step protonated to give this substituted cat. Now we have a question. Is the halogen as a substituent favorable or unfavorable for purposes of forming the cad? I am.

Speaker 4:          46:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:50          Jack helped us out again here. What does this say was this seconds, was the second step what you expected it to be in terms of rate? Is it usually faster, unusually slow compared to what you expected? Fast slow. What did you say before you said the product that this should react to a hundred to a thousand, be in a double bond, should react to a hundred to a thousand times faster than this. Did it react to 100,000, a hundred to a thousand times? No, it didn't react any faster at all. Right? Or roughly the same. Right. So for some reason this was slowed down by, you know, some, several powers of 10, right? What could have slowed it down?

Speaker 2:          47:46          Exploring?

Speaker 1:          47:49          It could be because of the chlorine. It could be hard to stay to get a cat. I did that. Would that make sense to you?

Speaker 2:          47:55          Why? Cause the, uh, has a lecturer.

Speaker 1:          48:01          Now the question is how hard is it going to be to form this cat? I'd write that which was was, which we did by putting a proton on that carbon, right? The alkene carbon gets a proton, gets that cat eye it. So is it harder that Sebastian, what do you say?

Speaker 2:          48:22          What effect do you think the chlorine, sorry.

Speaker 1:          48:27          The sigma bonds is electron withdrawing, right? Fewer the electrons around the carbon are lower in energy because they've been sucked away by the chloride, so it's harder to form the cad ions. So that's what we, that that would explain why we get this ratio here. Okay. That this second step, even though it's an alkene and should be enormously faster, is not any faster because this chlorine slowing it down by pulling electrons away. It can't provide electrons to the Proton. Now Sebastian, keep going for us. How about the regio chemistry? So the second step is slow, right? That's what we were just talking about. How about the regio chemistry of the second step,

Speaker 2:          49:14          and this isn't Markov in the Coffer Anti Markovnikov

Speaker 1:          49:19          that is the proton could have added here to give this cat ion or it could have added to the central carbon to give the other cat island, which did it do. Did the new chlorine go on? The more substituted or the less substituted other more substitutes. So it, the chlorine slows it down, but it's still Markovnikov this cat die and is better to get than the other cad I am,

Speaker 2:          49:50          yes. Right now you might

Speaker 1:          49:54          say, Aha, the choice here is between a secondary, whatever the chlorine is and a primary and primaries are bad to get. You don't want to protonate the set in the center of one cause it'd be a primary cad ion. But notice here with Hbr when it the outlet symmetrical, right? Still the two bro means go to the same place.

Speaker 1:          50:19          So the, it looks like the chlorine is welcoming the formation of a cad. I am or the at least bromine in this case as welcoming formation of that cad ion rather than cat I in it then that cat ion and add in the second proton. Right? So the answer is yes. Right? Is it favorable or unfavorable? It's both, right? It's hard to make the cat eye and because of the single sigma electron withdrawal, but if you form the cad ion, where do you want to form it next to the chlorine? Why Chris? Do you have an idea? If you're going to get a car, if you're forced to make a cat eye. And he say in this case when you put that second bromine and you could have made the cat eye on either here or here, both of them with respect to the carbon would be secondary.

Speaker 1:          51:13          But this one, the one you actually form where the bromide comes in has a bromine on it. Why? It's hard to form it, right? Because of the sigma bonds or electron withdrawing. But if you form it format next to the bromine, why it makes it even more. The polarizability is a good point and that wasn't what I was thinking of, but it's a good point. What else? Lone pairs on the halogen can be stabilized by overlapping, right? So you get resonance stabilization. So if you're going to make it, make it where you can get help in the Pi system. Okay. So that's really I think interesting about about the halogens that they could be deactivating but still want to have the cat eye and next to them because of the different role of the sigma electrons and the pile electrons. Okay. Thanks for sticking around here.
