into four different groups and I call

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
into four different groups and I call
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
into four different groups and I call
this the four way voter split what

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
this the four way voter split what
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.610
this the four way voter split what
happens is they're loving loyalists they

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
happens is they're loving loyalists they
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520

and I want the same thing we know and
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.320
and I want the same thing we know and

believe in all of that it's really
 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.120
believe in all of that it's really
calculated because most of these

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130
calculated because most of these
 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.910
calculated because most of these
politicians shift all over politically

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
politicians shift all over politically
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.780
politicians shift all over politically
to see what works to get them power so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
to see what works to get them power so
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.940
to see what works to get them power so
they say to the loving loyalists what

they say to the loving loyalists what
 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.329
they say to the loving loyalists what
the loving loyalists want to hear and so

the loving loyalists want to hear and so
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.040

the loving loyal is just go
 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.380
the loving loyal is just go
we love this person and then they change

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
we love this person and then they change
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940
we love this person and then they change
their politics it's alright we're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
their politics it's alright we're
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.880
their politics it's alright we're
already in love so that's maybe thirty

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
already in love so that's maybe thirty
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.120
already in love so that's maybe thirty
percent of people then on the other side

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
percent of people then on the other side
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.550
percent of people then on the other side
of that they trigger the riled up

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
of that they trigger the riled up
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.110
of that they trigger the riled up
resistors and the riled up resistors are

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120
resistors and the riled up resistors are
 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.580
resistors and the riled up resistors are
emotionally hooked and they're angry

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
emotionally hooked and they're angry
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890
emotionally hooked and they're angry
they don't like this person they see

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
they don't like this person they see
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.920
they don't like this person they see
this person as very dangerous and a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
this person as very dangerous and a
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.620
this person as very dangerous and a
threat to society and we've got to do

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
threat to society and we've got to do
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570
threat to society and we've got to do
something about this person but they're

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580
something about this person but they're
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.320
something about this person but they're
emotionally engaged as well then there's

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330
emotionally engaged as well then there's
 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.740
emotionally engaged as well then there's
the mild moderates and to some extent

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
the mild moderates and to some extent
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050
the mild moderates and to some extent
they're kind of stuck they don't know

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
they're kind of stuck they don't know
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910
they're kind of stuck they don't know
well is this different or is this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
well is this different or is this
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760
well is this different or is this
politics and they generally view it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
politics and they generally view it
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160
politics and they generally view it
through the lens of this is politics so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
through the lens of this is politics so
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.190
through the lens of this is politics so
if they're on our side politically we'll

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
if they're on our side politically we'll
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899
if they're on our side politically we'll
support them but we don't like the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
support them but we don't like the
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359
support them but we don't like the
personality we wish the person would

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
personality we wish the person would
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.910
personality we wish the person would
stop talking so much and if they're on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
stop talking so much and if they're on
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700
stop talking so much and if they're on
the other side they go we don't like his

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
the other side they go we don't like his
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920
the other side they go we don't like his
personality but we really don't like his

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
personality but we really don't like his
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.440
personality but we really don't like his
politics but they're kind of mild

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
politics but they're kind of mild
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.649
politics but they're kind of mild
moderate so they're not really

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659
moderate so they're not really
 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.199
moderate so they're not really
emotionally activated in fact they may

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
emotionally activated in fact they may
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.800
emotionally activated in fact they may
actually

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
actually
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.630
actually
emotionally intimidated because they

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
emotionally intimidated because they
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.610
emotionally intimidated because they
don't want to get fired upon by the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
don't want to get fired upon by the
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.880
don't want to get fired upon by the
verbal tongue-lashing that HCPs are

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
verbal tongue-lashing that HCPs are
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.970
verbal tongue-lashing that HCPs are
always putting out but then the fourth

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
always putting out but then the fourth
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.729
always putting out but then the fourth
group is the distant chanted dropouts

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
group is the distant chanted dropouts
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.690
group is the distant chanted dropouts
and these folks feel emotionally pushed

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
and these folks feel emotionally pushed
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.390
and these folks feel emotionally pushed
away it's like just leave me out of this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
away it's like just leave me out of this
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.610
away it's like just leave me out of this
I'm not political I don't want to be

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
I'm not political I don't want to be
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.070
I'm not political I don't want to be
involved and in all the countries where

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
involved and in all the countries where
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.430
involved and in all the countries where
we see high conflict politicians rising

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
we see high conflict politicians rising
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.190
we see high conflict politicians rising
to leadership there's a huge percent of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
to leadership there's a huge percent of
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.490
to leadership there's a huge percent of
people that emotionally drop out and so

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
people that emotionally drop out and so
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.030
people that emotionally drop out and so
they don't need a majority of people

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040
they don't need a majority of people
 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.410
they don't need a majority of people
typically they may have forty percent

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
typically they may have forty percent
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.830
typically they may have forty percent
maybe forty five percent of the vote but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
maybe forty five percent of the vote but
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.890
maybe forty five percent of the vote but
these high conflict politicians rarely

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
these high conflict politicians rarely
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.860
these high conflict politicians rarely
get over fifty percent but because

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
get over fifty percent but because
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.809
get over fifty percent but because
they're able to divide these other

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819
they're able to divide these other
 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.199
they're able to divide these other
groups that they push away the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209
groups that they push away the
 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.550
groups that they push away the
disenchanted dropout so they just don't

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
disenchanted dropout so they just don't
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.759
disenchanted dropout so they just don't
vote and the riled up resistors go with

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769
vote and the riled up resistors go with
 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.130
vote and the riled up resistors go with
maybe extreme candidates who don't have

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
maybe extreme candidates who don't have
 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.100
maybe extreme candidates who don't have
a chance and the mild moderate softn

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
a chance and the mild moderate softn
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.470
a chance and the mild moderate softn
have a candidate that has a chance but

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480
have a candidate that has a chance but
 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.449
have a candidate that has a chance but
the moderates and the resistors are

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
the moderates and the resistors are
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.240
the moderates and the resistors are
opposing each other mostly because the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250
opposing each other mostly because the
 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.430
opposing each other mostly because the
high conflict politician has divided

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440
high conflict politician has divided
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.150
high conflict politician has divided
them and so what we see over and over

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
them and so what we see over and over
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.699
them and so what we see over and over
again around the world is they're

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709
again around the world is they're
 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.949
again around the world is they're
getting into power with less than a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
getting into power with less than a
 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.440
getting into power with less than a
majority of people because they're able

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
majority of people because they're able
 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.110
majority of people because they're able
to divide this four-way vote or split

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120
to divide this four-way vote or split
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.380
to divide this four-way vote or split
