00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.070
Okay kids, it does not get much better than this.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.680
I hope you didn't think I was leading you on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.015
because I was not joking about this tata box. The

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:12.730
t-a-t-a-a-a sequence, otherwise known as the tata box, is a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.660
real thing, and it's also real in the lactase gene.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.580
Here we have the plus one transcription start sign, the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.120
lactase gene That's why I started capitalizing the letters. In

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.880
green here, we have the ATG, which would be transcribed,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.540
right, to the AUG in the mRNA. This would be where translation would start for

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.420
the lactase coding region, and we'd get our

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.410
protein. But how does this transcript even start?

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.390
We need this tata sequence in front. This consensus tata squence is a core piece

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.700
of the promoter region, of the lactase gene.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.100
Without this TATA region, the correct proteins can't

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.970
bind and facilitate the initiation of transcription

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.450
which begins right here. Everything that happens for

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.440
transcription depends on sequences like this TATA sequence

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.810
in the promoter region. Now what you're about

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.420
to hear is not made up. It's not

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.710
hypothetical. This is reality. In the lactase gene,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.600
if we zoom out, right, we'll see that this tata region is about minus 30, right.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.860
It's 30 base pairs, 30 letters in front of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.240
the transcription initiation site for the lactase gene. And

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.040
if we zoom out and look at the whole

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.630
chromosome where the lactase gene is sitting, We can

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.210
put this in context. The TATA-box in this sense

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.370
is right next to the transcription start site. It

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.210
turns out that some people in the human population

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.290
have a letter difference, a letter change, in the non-coding

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.380
region, in front of the lactase gene,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.560
that significantly affects the expression of lactase. Its

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.280
own transcription And the amazing thing is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.910
that this letter, this single letter variation in

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.010
humans, that affects transcription of the lactase

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.380
gene, is more than 20,000 letters, or base

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.030
pairs away from the transcription initiation site. This

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.780
is not just like that tata region, right?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.250
Minus 30 in front. We are 20,000 letters away and we're

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.870
effecting transcription right here. Now, that's going to take some explaining.
