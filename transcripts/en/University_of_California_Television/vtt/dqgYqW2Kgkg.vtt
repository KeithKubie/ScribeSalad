00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.285
(loud whoosh)
(click)

00:00:01.285 --> 00:00:03.452
(beeping)

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.423
(cheerful piano music)

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:12.569
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.069
bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.722
lone the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.139
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:30.153
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:34.707
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:37.435
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:39.518
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:42.237
We shape the future

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:46.482
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:50.201
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:54.368
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:58.056
an exploration made possible

00:00:58.056 --> 00:01:01.139
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.763
(techno music)

00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:30.457
(synthesizer music)

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:45.485
- So, some of you know my
interest in anthropology,

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:47.992
and it originated from
studies in sialic acid,

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:51.696
biology changes, and human evolution.

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:53.286
And my background as a physician

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:57.518
led me to explore human-specific diseases.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:59.212
So, what then am I doing here

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:02.879
talking about death
awareness and mortality?

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.739
In 2005, I lectured at
the University of Arizona

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:08.560
and ventured beyond my expertise

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.205
opining about the evolution
of human cognition.

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:13.185
At the lunch that followed,

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:16.486
a local professor sat next to me and said,

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:20.192
"You are all asking the wrong question!"

00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:21.794
Danny Brower's point was

00:02:21.794 --> 00:02:25.458
perhaps we should not be
asking how human minds evolved.

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:26.291
There have been

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.280
highly intelligent,
warm-blooded, social creatures

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.084
around for tens of thousands of years,

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.514
elephants, Corvid birds,
apes, and dolphins.

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:35.958
So, why are we not having to compete

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.944
with these other species?

00:02:37.944 --> 00:02:39.962
Danny suggested that it was not just that

00:02:39.962 --> 00:02:43.726
something unusual happened
during human evolution,

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.464
but also that all these other species

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:49.456
were blocked in progression
by a cognitive barrier

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:51.509
that only we had broken through.

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.735
So, I was really intrigued
by this contrarian view,

00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:56.770
and we talked a long time
after everyone was gone,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.745
and I strongly recommended
that he publish.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.004
Seeing nothing in print
after more than a year,

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.236
I followed up with emails.

00:03:03.236 --> 00:03:05.212
Got no responses.

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:07.504
Looked up his phone number on the Internet

00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:09.671
only to find his obituary.

00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:13.646
Danny had died very suddenly

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.533
of an unusual disease
called aortic dissection.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.773
I contacted his friend
Sean Carroll who said

00:03:18.773 --> 00:03:21.005
Danny had indeed been
working on some novel idea

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:22.720
but never published.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.171
After more than two decades
of exploring anthropogeny,

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.477
I could see some real important
potential in Danny's idea

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:31.705
and I just could not let it die with him.

00:03:31.705 --> 00:03:33.991
Fortunately, the editor of
Nature, Phillip Campbell,

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:36.226
allowed me to write a
letter about Danny's idea

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:37.511
with some embellishments.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.887
I thought I had done my duty

00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:41.461
and could leave it to
experts to follow up.

00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:42.941
But, a week later, I got an email

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.525
from Danny Brower's widow, Sharon,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:46.974
thanking me for writing the letter.

00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:49.166
Told me that Danny had started a book

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.938
and asked if I would like to read it.

00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:53.190
Looking at his draft, I
realized that his thinking

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.463
had progressed very much
in the way mine had,

00:03:55.463 --> 00:03:58.805
and we'd come to very similar
conclusions independently.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.939
But, there were great challenges
in completing this book.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.973
First, one author was dead,

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.418
(audience laughs)

00:04:05.418 --> 00:04:06.760
and the other wanted to preserve

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.208
the original intent and prose.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:12.407
Second, I really had no time
to do full justice to it

00:04:12.407 --> 00:04:16.519
because of my lack of expertise,
and also lack of time.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.052
And last, but not least,
who would care about a book

00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:23.039
by a dead insect geneticist and
a living physician scientist

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.441
who claimed to have
explained the human mind?

00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:27.448
(audience laughing)

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:28.939
So, I sat on this for a while,

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.574
but fortunately a friend of mine,

00:04:30.574 --> 00:04:31.989
Abraham Verghese, an author,

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.703
put me in touch with
his agent, Mary Evans,

00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:36.811
who saw the potential in the book

00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.706
and called Miss Cary
Goldstein at Twelve Books

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:41.690
to help me with it.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.523
And so, I went on.

00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:47.725
Strike four, which I won't talk
about, is Superstorm Sandy.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:50.066
Strike five was poor
follow through on my part

00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:53.027
because of lack of
expertise and lack of time.

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:54.762
(audience laughs)

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:55.740
And last but not least

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.977
was a book title that the
publisher insisted on,

00:04:58.977 --> 00:05:00.431
which was Denial.

00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.208
(audience laughing)

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:03.704
So, for a while I thought that this was

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:06.521
a hackneyed old phrase
that had so many meanings

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.485
that it didn't really
say what I wanted to say.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.458
And, in fact, if you looked in Amazon,

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.757
you would find not only
the famous important book

00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:16.904
related to this topic Denial of Death,

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:19.101
but numerous books with
the word denial in them.

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.184
(audience laughing)

00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:22.953
The more I thought about it, I realized

00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:27.674
that actually the publisher
and agent were right.

00:05:27.674 --> 00:05:29.067
All these books are talking really

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:32.212
about various versions
of the same phenomenon,

00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:35.747
the human penchant for denying reality.

00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:37.436
And, in fact, as you read more,

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:41.469
I found other books by
many famous authors,

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.287
all of which are on different topics,

00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:45.696
but all contain pieces of the same story,

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:48.939
our human ability to ignore reality.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.270
Let me give you some practical examples.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.751
As a physician, I'm
acutely aware of the fact

00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:55.987
that lack of exercise, unhealthy diet,

00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:59.041
tobacco use, ignoring
obesity, high blood pressure,

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:03.102
sleep apnea, poor hygiene,
and excessive red meat

00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:05.927
are bad for you, but I'm not going to ask

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:07.901
for a show of hands because,

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:10.434
(audience laughing)

00:06:10.434 --> 00:06:14.412
physicians like myself are equally guilty.

00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:17.025
Then we have massive denial
of scientific reality,

00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:19.566
biological evolution, climate change,

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:22.453
magical cures, vaccines don't work,

00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:25.504
worse still, they cause autism
despite it being debunked,

00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:30.413
UFOs, of course, weird cancer
risks, not the real ones.

00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.936
And here in San Diego,

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:34.197
fluoride in the water is a communist plot.

00:06:34.197 --> 00:06:37.741
(audience laughing)

00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.712
And then there are many
examples of societal denial

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:41.874
of practical reality, national debt.

00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:44.041
Each of you owes $150,000.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.676
Healthcare costs, end of life costs,

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:51.363
covert racism, population growth,

00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:54.233
and insistence on rebuilding
in exactly the places

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:55.760
where the worst of earthquakes, floods,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.867
and hurricanes have occurred.
(audience laughs)

00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:01.437
And then, of course, the examples

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:03.184
of political distortion of reality.

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:05.415
(audience laughing)

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:06.786
I'm not going to read this slide.

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:07.955
You know what I'm talking about.

00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:09.798
(audience laughing)

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:12.220
But to be fair, there
are plenty of examples

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.671
of distortion of reality at the other end

00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:16.764
of the political spectrum.

00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:19.211
I think Calvin puts it well to Hobbes.

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.938
"It's not denial.

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:23.983
"I'm just very selective about
the reality that I accept."

00:07:23.983 --> 00:07:27.233
(audience laughing)

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:30.275
So, after writing the
book, I had much difficulty

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:31.926
finding a single word or phrase

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:33.788
that encompasses phenomenons.

00:07:33.788 --> 00:07:36.463
I'm going to a phrase I
didn't find in the dictionary,

00:07:36.463 --> 00:07:39.248
reality denial, as I'm defining as

00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:41.738
some kind of subconscious
defense mechanism

00:07:41.738 --> 00:07:44.406
characterized by refusal to acknowledge

00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:47.237
or rationalization of
unwanted or unpleasant facts,

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:49.685
realities, thoughts or feelings.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.436
Now, so I think we have
to add reality denial

00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:55.005
to the long list of
unusual and exaggerated

00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.737
cognitive features of humans,

00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:58.706
some of which are listed here.

00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:00.456
But, for most of these other features,

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:03.200
we can think of good reasons
why they might have evolved

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.668
in terms of benefiting humans.

00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:07.681
But the reality denial, there's a mystery.

00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:10.729
Excessive reality denial of
the kind that humans practice

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:13.281
should be an evolutionary maladaptation.

00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:14.739
Excessive reality denial

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:16.177
should result in excessive risk taking

00:08:16.177 --> 00:08:17.416
and the individuals who have

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:20.513
the genetic ability to
do that should disappear.

00:08:20.513 --> 00:08:22.775
(audience laughing)

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:25.422
So, how and why did
excessive reality denial

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.026
and risk taking evolve in humans?

00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:32.446
And what benefits outweighed
those negative consequences?

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:35.450
So, this brings me another
extension of Danny's idea

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.766
that the independent
evolution of self-awareness

00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:40.751
in the very same intelligent creatures

00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:42.269
that we've discussed before,

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.547
although, there are lots of arguments

00:08:43.547 --> 00:08:46.288
about the techniques used
and the real conclusions,

00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:48.998
it's reasonably clear that chimpanzees

00:08:48.998 --> 00:08:52.559
and perhaps elephants,
dolphins and magpies

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:54.500
can recognize themselves in the mirror

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.522
and have some kind of sense of self.

00:08:56.522 --> 00:08:59.016
It's hard to define exactly what it is,

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:01.308
but they certainly do have this.

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:05.223
So, are animals and birds with
awareness of their own self

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:07.218
also aware of the self-awareness

00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:09.183
of others of their own kind?

00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:11.235
I asked myself that question
and did some reading

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:13.794
and realized I was
thinking about something

00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:16.720
that's been well-studied
called Theory of Mind.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.995
The ability to attribute mental beliefs,

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.703
desires, intentions and perspectives

00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:23.249
to oneself and to others

00:09:23.249 --> 00:09:24.928
and to understand that others also have

00:09:24.928 --> 00:09:27.216
beliefs, desires,
intentions, and perspectives

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:30.416
that are similar or
different from one's own.

00:09:30.416 --> 00:09:32.062
There are many other related terms,

00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:34.529
intentionality, et cetera,
that I won't go through,

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:36.537
but they're all overlapping terms.

00:09:36.537 --> 00:09:38.918
But after reading further, I realized

00:09:38.918 --> 00:09:41.062
there's a continuum in
the cognitive development

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.448
of Theory of Mind and Intentionality.

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:46.493
A two-year-old human
passes the mirror test.

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:47.979
A three to four-year-old human has

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:51.457
a more rudimentary theory
of mind that emerges.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.025
A five-year-old human
has a full theory of mind

00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:56.210
and can tell excellent lies.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.210
(audience laughing)

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:02.318
But, adult humans have something

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:04.193
that I might call extended theory of mind

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:06.429
or multi-order intentionality,

00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:09.171
the ability to do what
we're doing right now.

00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:11.522
You're reading my mind,
I'm reading your mind,

00:10:11.522 --> 00:10:13.775
and there are 100 people
or several hundred people

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:16.007
across the world on the live Internet

00:10:16.007 --> 00:10:17.947
watching and thinking what you're thinking

00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:19.740
or perhaps something different.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.508
And with the Internet,
of course, we can have

00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.726
millions of minds melted across
the world at the same time.

00:10:24.726 --> 00:10:26.786
So, the question, and this
is of course a continuum,

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:29.790
the question arises, why is
this extended theory of mind

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.437
so well-developed in adult humans

00:10:31.437 --> 00:10:33.603
and apparently not in other species?

00:10:33.603 --> 00:10:36.692
So here's my expansion of Danny's idea.

00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:40.438
I suggest that it was a
psychological evolutionary barrier

00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:43.595
that held back all these
other intelligent species

00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:46.888
at about this point in the
evolution of theory of mind.

00:10:46.888 --> 00:10:48.977
What might that barrier be?

00:10:48.977 --> 00:10:51.025
We can now come back to
the theme of this symposium

00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:52.897
and suggest there's also a continuum

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:54.287
in awareness of death risk

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.505
and understanding a person's mortality.

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.763
I may not have my numbers exactly correct,

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.870
but it seems to me that you first have

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.678
an automated reaction to death risk,

00:11:04.678 --> 00:11:06.470
which, as Joe pointed out,

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.312
many species, or all species should have

00:11:09.312 --> 00:11:11.771
some kind of awareness of death risk.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:14.988
And if some kind of self-awareness
is enhanced at that time,

00:11:14.988 --> 00:11:18.735
you'd maybe become aware of the
death of another individual.

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:21.916
But, if I substitute
crows for magpies here,

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:24.436
it's the very same
animal, birds and birds,

00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:26.928
that seem to have evolved some
of kind of awareness of death

00:11:26.928 --> 00:11:29.514
you heard about earlier in the symposium

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:33.986
that seems right on the
cusp of what humans have,

00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:36.251
and yet, just short of it.

00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:38.938
So the operative word here
is mortality salience,

00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:41.224
conscious understanding and realization

00:11:41.224 --> 00:11:43.681
of one's personal mortality.

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.287
So, if you go down this continuum,

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:50.206
well, death anxiety may require
extended theory of mind.

00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:53.692
Truly understanding the
death of another individual

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:55.666
would result in
understanding the mortality

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:57.429
of other individuals.

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.712
And this conscious
awareness would exaggerate

00:11:59.712 --> 00:12:01.331
the systems we've heard about

00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.196
that extends to not just actual events,

00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:05.697
but even thinking about it

00:12:05.697 --> 00:12:08.281
at the level of
consciousness, as Joe said.

00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:09.822
Such individuals would then have

00:12:09.822 --> 00:12:12.822
a reduction in reproductive fitness.

00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:16.180
Evolution doesn't care if you survive.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.774
Evolution cares if you reproduce,

00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:20.435
and I suspect that those individuals

00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:22.044
who first ran into this barrier,

00:12:22.044 --> 00:12:25.038
and maybe it happened many
times in many species,

00:12:25.038 --> 00:12:26.753
had a reduction in reproductive fitness

00:12:26.753 --> 00:12:29.248
and could not transmit their genotype.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:31.500
So then the emergence of
extended theory of mind

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.483
would result in awareness of mortality

00:12:34.483 --> 00:12:38.283
and, again, a failure to fix
the genotype into species.

00:12:38.283 --> 00:12:41.236
We've already said that reality
denial should be negative,

00:12:41.236 --> 00:12:44.652
so what if these two unusual
cognitive features emerged

00:12:44.652 --> 00:12:47.223
in the same minds at the same time,

00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:50.498
the rare double negative,
which would could result

00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:53.032
sufficient tolerance of death anxiety

00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:55.916
to establish the combination in a species.

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:57.655
Thus, perhaps, two rare

00:12:57.655 --> 00:13:00.963
evolutionary maladaptations or
negatives could've coincided

00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:05.286
to allow this mind over
reality transition.

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.040
I have a much more extended view of this

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.510
that we don't have time to discuss.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.343
(audience laughs)

00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:14.450
I need to talk to them experts, too,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.436
before I go any further with that.

00:13:17.436 --> 00:13:19.222
But any theory that makes progress

00:13:19.222 --> 00:13:21.928
is bound to be initially counterintuitive.

00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:23.776
So I'd like to suggest that

00:13:23.776 --> 00:13:26.740
this hypothetical singular
phase in human evolution

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.455
in which mortality salience
and maladaptive death anxiety

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:34.042
were triggered by acquiring
extended theory of mind,

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:37.551
which resulted in understanding
personal mortality,

00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:40.054
but then when one time only was stabilized

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:43.672
by simultaneous acquisition
of general reality denial

00:13:43.672 --> 00:13:44.692
in the same minds.

00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:45.972
I remember asking Danny.

00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:48.949
There couldn't be a death denial module.

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:51.320
Well, he came to the
same conclusion I have.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.173
We just deny anything we don't like.

00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:55.023
(audience laughs)

00:13:55.023 --> 00:13:56.722
So there are other consequences,

00:13:56.722 --> 00:13:59.710
afterlife myths,
superstitions, religiosity,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.478
self deception, over
confidence, risk taking,

00:14:02.478 --> 00:14:05.512
and last but not least, the optimism bias.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:08.693
Humans are well known to
be irrationally optimistic.

00:14:08.693 --> 00:14:12.275
Many studies have shown
this, even fMRI studies.

00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:13.776
And evolutionary modeling

00:14:13.776 --> 00:14:16.991
(audience laughs)

00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.208
shows that reacting in
an over confident manner

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.210
can have fitness benefits,

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.201
as long as the contested
resource is sufficiently large

00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:26.426
compared to the cost of competition.

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:28.002
Now, if you combine over confidence

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:31.991
with extended theory of
mind, you've got big success.

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.016
(audience laughs)

00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:34.944
Of course, here is a case, I believe,

00:14:34.944 --> 00:14:37.920
of initially successful
but eventually fatal case

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.420
of reality denial.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.482
So, how important is reality denial?

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:46.512
Let's do a thought
experiment and delete it.

00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:48.957
Well, some other features of humans

00:14:48.957 --> 00:14:51.672
would get dimmed or partially eliminated.

00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:55.023
But let's now dim theory
of mind and eliminate that,

00:14:55.023 --> 00:14:56.272
and you'd find that most of these

00:14:56.272 --> 00:14:58.946
unusual exaggerated
cognitive features of humans,

00:14:58.946 --> 00:15:01.976
while they could still be
present, would be greatly dimmed,

00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:04.483
so I suggest that this combination

00:15:04.483 --> 00:15:06.752
could give you this transition,

00:15:06.752 --> 00:15:09.461
which is consistent so
far with all known facts,

00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:11.480
compatible with other theories,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.787
not negated by currently known facts,

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:17.239
but is not directly testable
by experimental reproduction

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:20.733
or directly falsifiable by
experimental approaches.

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.765
Now, the great tragedy of science

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:25.944
is the slaying of a beautiful
hypothesis by an ugly fact.

00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:28.501
(audience laughs)

00:15:28.501 --> 00:15:30.188
And I've been searching for that fact

00:15:30.188 --> 00:15:31.718
(audience laughs)

00:15:31.718 --> 00:15:33.188
to destroy this hypothesis.

00:15:33.188 --> 00:15:34.934
If you can find it, let me know.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.291
But it can't just be, "I don't like it."

00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:39.930
(audience laughs)

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.245
So when did this occur in
human evolution, finally?

00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:45.229
We know that about two million years ago,

00:15:45.229 --> 00:15:47.661
our ancestors from
Africa, some stayed behind

00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:49.934
and some spread all across the Old World

00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:53.011
to give rise to Neanderthals
and many other species.

00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:56.501
This went on for almost two million years,

00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.757
leaving behind many
species and subspecies.

00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:02.461
But the types of things
that you might think

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:06.253
might be related to theory of
mind, reality denial leaves

00:16:06.253 --> 00:16:09.005
no signal in the record I can think of.

00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:11.244
But symbolic art, complex tool making,

00:16:11.244 --> 00:16:15.745
personal ornamentation,
burials with added materials,

00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:18.942
all occur around 100 to
200 thousand years ago.

00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:22.917
Again, the experts will be
much more precise than I am.

00:16:22.917 --> 00:16:25.959
This happens to be about the
time that the human migration

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:27.680
and the peopling of the world occurred

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.529
in which our species evolved in Africa

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:32.494
and gradually spread across the world

00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:35.210
and essentially took over the planet.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.278
And we are now,

00:16:36.278 --> 00:16:39.182
unlike most of the subspecies
or the multiple species,

00:16:39.182 --> 00:16:43.478
we are the lone survivors and
the masters of the planet.

00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:46.212
So, while we can't be sure,
I'd like to speculate that

00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:49.433
the evolution of
anatomically modern humans

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.989
into behaviorally modern humans,

00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:53.992
which is seen in the archeological record,

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:56.465
although that's quite incomplete,

00:16:56.465 --> 00:17:00.469
may have at least partly
involved this transition.

00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:03.504
So, it so happens this theory

00:17:03.504 --> 00:17:06.264
can provide a unifying explanation

00:17:06.264 --> 00:17:09.002
for several unusual
exaggerated features of humans,

00:17:09.002 --> 00:17:11.961
such as theory of mind, which
is beneficial for many things,

00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.705
reality denial, strong
tendency for self deception

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:17.745
and false beliefs,
overarching optimism bias,

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:20.685
risk taking behavior,
recent emergence, perhaps,

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:24.953
as a dominant species, and
replacement of everybody else.

00:17:24.953 --> 00:17:28.445
Remember, this would have
to have a genetic basis.

00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:30.178
There are some examples
of supporting evidence

00:17:30.178 --> 00:17:32.165
I don't have time to talk about,

00:17:32.165 --> 00:17:34.491
and issues arising in future directions

00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.244
I don't have time to talk about, but

00:17:36.244 --> 00:17:37.520
(audience laughs)

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.467
I would point out that
some of the brain regions

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:42.505
in modern optimism
bias, anxiety, and so on

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:45.988
are related to some of these things.

00:17:45.988 --> 00:17:49.518
So finally, let me close by
coming back to Danny Brower.

00:17:49.518 --> 00:17:53.688
From Danny Brower's 2007 draft manuscript.

00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:56.731
"We are polluting the Earth
and changing the climate

00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.757
"in ways that we can't predict

00:17:59.757 --> 00:18:02.529
"and likely at some point
can't easily reverse.

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:04.987
"If we're so smart, why do we continue

00:18:04.987 --> 00:18:08.018
"to sow the seeds for
our eventual destruction?

00:18:08.018 --> 00:18:09.719
"Perhaps because we are
saddled with a brain

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:11.190
"that is designed by selection

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.195
"to cope with the
ultimate disaster, death,

00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:14.991
"by denying it will occur,

00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:16.972
"and so we treat all
the impending disasters

00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:19.512
"by denying they will ever happen.

00:18:19.512 --> 00:18:21.073
"Indeed, it is arguable that

00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:24.214
"we are destined to destroy
ourself as a species."

00:18:24.214 --> 00:18:25.743
2007.

00:18:25.743 --> 00:18:27.753
You don't have to listen
to climate scientists.

00:18:27.753 --> 00:18:30.486
Just look at the HSBC bank's projection

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.282
for what they're gonna run into

00:18:32.282 --> 00:18:34.743
in terms of extreme weather events.

00:18:34.743 --> 00:18:36.760
Personally, I think this is the case

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.916
where legitimate fear
mongering is appropriate.

00:18:39.916 --> 00:18:41.196
(audience laughs)

00:18:41.196 --> 00:18:43.729
It's global and local climate disruption,

00:18:43.729 --> 00:18:45.763
not just climate change, affecting you

00:18:45.763 --> 00:18:48.477
and everybody else that
you know in your backyard.

00:18:48.477 --> 00:18:50.995
Again, this quote I found
in Danny's manuscript,

00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:53.871
"A man who carries a cat by the tail

00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:56.703
"learns something he can
never learn in any other way."

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:59.536
(audience laughs)

00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:05.629
We have caught the
climate tiger by the tail,

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:07.926
and we better let go soon.

00:19:07.926 --> 00:19:09.773
Finally, from Danny's manuscript,

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:11.927
he had a lot of cartoons I
couldn't reproduce in the book

00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:13.266
for copyright reasons,

00:19:13.266 --> 00:19:15.297
but I'm just showing one of them.

00:19:15.297 --> 00:19:16.956
Doctor to Earth.

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:20.499
"The bad news is you've
got advanced stage humans.

00:19:20.499 --> 00:19:22.511
"The good news is they've
just about run their course

00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:24.177
"and you should be on the mend soon."

00:19:24.177 --> 00:19:27.507
(audience laughs)

00:19:27.507 --> 00:19:29.661
So with that, I'd like to
close with the idea that

00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:31.909
two rare evolutionary maladaptations,

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:34.205
this is just a theory for discussion,

00:19:34.205 --> 00:19:35.740
might have coincided to allow

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.523
the mind over reality transition.

00:19:37.523 --> 00:19:38.731
Thank you.

00:19:38.731 --> 00:19:41.753
(audience applauds)

00:19:41.753 --> 00:19:44.336
