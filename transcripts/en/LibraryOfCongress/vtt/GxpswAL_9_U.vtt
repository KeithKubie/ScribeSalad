00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.270
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.840
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, chief of the
African-Middle East Division,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.720
and I'm really happy
to see you all here.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.160
We always thought with a little
commercial about our division,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.010
and as this is a program that
is recorded and that is going

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.910
to be seen and will
be able to be seen

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.320
in different parts of the world.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.950
So the African-Middle
East Division,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.130
in which you are
all seated here,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.880
is made up of three sections;

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.100
the African section covers
the whole continent of Africa,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.940
the whole continent,
subcontinent of Africa.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.320
North Africa is included
in the Near East division,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.450
and the reason being
language, because we're divided

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.700
by language more than by
geopolitical districting,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.560
if you want.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.730
The second division,
therefore, I've already started,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.480
is the Near East division, which
includes the countries starting

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.400
from Morocco and going
through to Afghanistan.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.830
It also includes
all the countries

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.540
of Central Asia and
the Caucasus.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.310
And then the third section
is the Hebraic section,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.810
for which we collect worldwide.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.020
We're divided by language,
which means that the collections

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.230
in the vernacular are here in
our custody, and the collections

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.230
in Western languages are part
of the general collection.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.300
So with respect to Angola, most
of the materials will be found

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.070
in the general collection,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.230
although the specialists
are here

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.210
in the African-Middle
East Division.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.550
We have, as all the
librarians of the library,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.410
have three goals, three
missions, if you want.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.510
One is to collect materials
from all over the world,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.970
and when I say materials I mean
not just books and journals

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.570
and newspapers, but
also films and music

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.500
and photographs and maps.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.400
We have the largest
collection in the world of maps.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.350
And we collect broadly
from all over the world.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350
Our second mission is then to
preserve these collections,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.730
and the library has
one of the best centers

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.280
for preservation of materials.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.860
We preserve the rare
materials in boxes, in cases,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.280
in areas in which temperature
and humidity is controlled.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.760
We preserve more recent books,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.790
sometimes by washing
them, believe or not.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.300
We de-acidify the paper because
we receive a lot of materials

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.110
that are on acidic paper and
that are self-destroying.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.800
And so we collect
these materials,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.200
preserve them, shelve them.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.850
And the third mission
is actually

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.260
to serve these materials to our
patrons, and our patrons come

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430
from the whole world,
from our 78 countries

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.310
in this particular reading
room, but they come from all

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250
over the world for
the whole library.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.930
They're accessible, those
materials are available free

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.060
to everyone and can
be used for research.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.760
We do not take a stand,
political or otherwise,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.060
on what we collect,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.110
and we collect materials
in all formats.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.890
So, however, in order
to make the countries

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.430
that we're responsible for and
the materials better known,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.930
we invite scholars,
as we have today

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.870
with Professor Linda Heywood.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.740
We invite scholars to
discuss their research.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.090
So what happens after we
have served our patrons,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.590
we have given them the books?

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.720
Well, those patrons use
those materials, write books,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.600
go out on lecture tours,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.290
talk about the research
they have conducted,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.060
and we invite them here to
talk about their research

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:05.880
and to get us all informed and
enlightened, both other patrons,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.830
other researchers and
we librarians as well.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.080
We learn from our guests, we
learn from the scholars who come

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.690
and who talk about
their research.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.120
And so it's very exciting for me
to have Professor Heywood here

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.080
to talk about a subject
close to her heart and for

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.110
which we have a significant
collection.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.330
And to introduce her is our
area specialist for Africa

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.570
and who is responsible
for Angola, and the person

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.230
who actually invited
Professor Heywood,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.580
and that is Laverne Page who
will introduce the speaker.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.380
Thank you.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.220
[ Applause ]

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.520
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Thank you.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.240
Again, welcome to the Library
of Congress and to the African

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.940
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.030
Our speaker is Professor Linda
Heywood, author of "Njinga

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.820
of Angola, Africa's
Warrior Queen," published

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.120
by Harvard University
Press in 2017.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.480
After the lecture
she will sign --

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.940
well, after the lecture
there are copies available

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.270
of this book and Dr. Heywood
can sign them for you.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.220
I'll give you a very
brief overview

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.340
of Professor Heywood's
writings and other activities.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.940

of America," published

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.770
by Cambridge University
Press in 2017.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.900
This book was also the winner

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.420
of the 2008 Melville
Herskovits Award

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.650
for the best book
published in African studies.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.740
She is also one of the coeditors
of the 2015 published book

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.260
"African Americans in U.S.
Foreign Policy, From the Era

of Frederick Douglass to
the Age of Obama," published

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.970
by the University
of Illinois Press.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.340
Okay.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.170
This book was published
by the University

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.350
of Illinois Press in 2015.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.560
Her articles on Angola and the
African diaspora have appeared

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.460

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.430
and the "Journal of
Southern African Studies".

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:25.620
She has served as a consultant
for numerous museum exhibitions.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.160
She has also served as a history
consultant, and has appeared

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.780

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:40.050
such as "Finding
Oprah's Roots" in 2007,

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:46.360
and the "African Civilizations,"
and that was for 2017.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.610
And so now, Professor Heywood,
could you come to the podium

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.640
and talk to us about
Queen Njinga?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.440
Thank you.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.560
[ Applause ]

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.370
&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood:
Well, thank you very much

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.920
for the introduction and for
that overview of the scope

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.410
of the library, both in
terms of its holdings as well

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.720
as its public engagement.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.220
I'm really honored to be here.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.280
I have been sort of carrying
Queen Njinga in my head

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.870
since I taught at
Howard University,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.550
of course, on Central Africa.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.480
I had to teach Central
Africa before 1800

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.360
and then Central
Africa since 1800,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.870
as well as the African diaspora,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.330
and I did not know what impact
I had had on the students.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:47.970
They had a name which they
called me, which I'm not going

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:53.780
to repeat, but when Ta-Nehisi
Coates, who happened to be

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.870
in that Central African history,
as well as in the class I taught

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.360
on writing the African
diaspora at Howard University,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.670
when they published his book
"Between the World and Me,"

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.970
I picked up the book and I said,
oh, Ta-Nehisi, another book,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.600
you know, his Atlantic articles,
and I put it on my desk

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.000
because I was very
busy at the time.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.930
Well, just soon afterwards
I got emails and calls

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:26.040
from former students who said,
Dr. Heywood, did you know that,

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.950
you know, your name is
on page 54 of Ta-Nehisi's

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.390
"Between the World and Me".

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.740
So the book was right on my desk
waiting for time, so I opened it

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:43.520
and there he revealed to me how
impactful my teaching his first

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.750
exposure to Queen Njinga was,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:52.460
and I guess it was meeting
Queen Njinga, was also impactful

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.530
to me, but I did not start
off my career, you know,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.330
thinking I'm going
to write a biography

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.460
of a famous African ruler.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.910
I had no idea.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.310
And so it's really been a
journey that I've taken,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.120
and I have published the book,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.260
the book is here,
as you can see.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.400
So I'm not going to give you
a summary of the book, or so.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.110
There were things in the book
that I could not develop as well

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.660
as I hoped I could
develop in articles.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.690
One of those was
Njinga's diplomacy,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.950
and I want to explore
that with you.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.940
So this is a paper that
I'm putting together,

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.600
but a lot of it is informed
in my engagement with Njinga

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.690
in writing her biography.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.060
So I'll start with Angola.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:47.250
And all of you, I don't
know how to point this out,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:53.460
but you see Angola on this
modern map, and we're going

00:11:53.460 --> 00:12:00.650
to now give you some
information on Queen Njinga

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.170
and her background,
important dates.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.260
You can get that in the book.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.930
But, you know, 1582,
born sometime in 1582.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.230
We know that.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.490
We know she was baptized
in 1622.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:20.060
She was the ruler of Ndongo,
the kingdom that her father,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.560
her brother and other, you know,

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.050
older rulers had controlled
before the Portuguese, you know,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.290
began their wars
against Ndongo in 1575

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.660
and it ended in the 1570s.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.850
We call that the
Hundred Years War.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.960
So the Hundreds Year War did
not only happen in Europe,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.750
it also happened in Angola.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:54.860
Then we had Njinga being thrown
out of her kingdom between 1626

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.560
and 1627, and she did
not just fade out.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.670
She, in fact, continued
the struggle.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:09.560
Her famous alliance with
some very ruthless Imbangala,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.590
or Jagas, we call
that the Jaga phase.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.600
Njinga's Dutch alliance is a
major point in her life as well.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.940
And then at the end of her life
she returns to Christianity

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.670
and becomes the Christian
ruler of Matamba

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.200
until 1663, when she died.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.580
The date of her death, we
have very detailed information

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.370
because the Capuchin
missionary who served

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:43.430
in her court was there
recording every iota of movement

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.630
that she did until
her last breath.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.480
And you will see in my
description of that,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.570
that I tried to recreate.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.400
I even tried to find out
exactly what she died from.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.280
You can read the book and see.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.330
And so in 1622, when
Njinga first appeared

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.100
in official documentation
systematically, you will see

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.010
that the Portuguese had already
taken a big slice of Ndongo,

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:18.110
going from the base in Luanda,
the capital, where they had come

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.930
and conquered in 1575 -- oh, no.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:31.480
They come in 1575, and then
increasingly Ndongo would lose

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.780
its territory.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.990
So you see this in 1622.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.280
But because of Njinga,
she actually,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.310
by the end of her
life, she actually --

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:47.270
the Portuguese increased their
holdings, but she actually added

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.270
to her kingdom, Matamba.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.270
Ndongo, she kept a little part
of Ndongo, the eastern part.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.390
And as you can see this
region, the eastern borders

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.250
of Njinga's territory, actually
went across the Congo River.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.290
It went down into areas we
now know as the Lunda area.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.940
So it's very, very interesting

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.470
that Njinga made
her mark on Angola.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.910
No other leader has done that.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.290
So I said, okay, since
I'm doing, you know,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.280
an overview of diplomacy, a
written as well as performed

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.450
and oral, I said let me tell
you who are the recorders

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:38.070
and receivers of Njinga's, you
know, diplomatic, you know,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.940
openings of Portuguese
officials.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.620
Njinga outlived 11 Portuguese
governors, and there were some

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.630
that she dealt with
systematically

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.900
who recorded her
letters and her actions.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.050
Fernao de Sousa and Luis
Martins de Sousa Chichorro.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.140
Portuguese soldier,
this one individual,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.160
Antonio de Cadornega,
he lived in Angola.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.940
He came as a teenager and went
through these various phases

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:12.330
of his career, dying in 1690,
he was a recorder of Njinga.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.140
He was on the scene, talked to
her, had arguments with her.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.970
Also we have Italian
Capuchin missionaries

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.390
who arrived in 1654.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.540
Others would come, but I just
wanted to identify the two

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.330
that were really important;
Father Antonio Gaeta

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.040
and Father Antonio
Giovanni Cavazzi.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.630
You'll hear me only speaking

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.400
about their last names
instead of going over.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.220
And they did not come from
just anyplace in Europe.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.080
They came from Rome,
from the Vatican.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.540
Also, Njinga had contact
with, sent letters

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.030
to Portuguese rulers
and the two kings

00:16:55.030 --> 00:17:00.130
who ruled during Njinga's
time was King Joao, IV,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.090
as well as King Afonso.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.170
And last, but not least,
Njinga wrote letters

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:13.150
to Pope Alexander VII, and
he was Pope 1655 to 1667.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.770
So Njinga had in her scope --

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.210
you know, she was not just
confined to an African land.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.950
This was a person who was
playing global politics

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.420
and global diplomacy.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.080
So I wanted to sort of
thinking about, okay,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.630
if I'm thinking about, you
know, diplomacy and writing and,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.430
you know, what's the nature
of, you know, diplomacy,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.670
so I just wanted to
introduce you to a couple

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.080
of the scholars I've
been looking at,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.550
you know, and what is writing.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.210
And I like this, As a vector
conveying words, a writ,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.880
a written document, and we are
here with written document,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.750
is performative of an
action in a given territory.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.480
So it combines the both things.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.040
You have a written document,
but you have a performance,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.370
and that's what intrigues
me about Njinga.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.530
And then I wanted to say,
well, what are people thinking,

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.230
you know, in the past, really
in antiquity, you know,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.650
Rome and before Rome
and the classical world,

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.000
how did people communicate?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.020
Wow. In antiquity, only face
communication would guarantee

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.000
the reliable transmission
of the words and opinions

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.630
of one person to another.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.080
This is really fundamental.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.440
And you know we live in
a capital where politics

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.950
and all the diplomats are here,
so I don't have to explain

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.580
to you that when you really
want to get things done,

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.530
you go in person, you
know, you send that person

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:44.840
who is your right arm
to deliver your message

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.140
and to be persuasive.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.170
I also said, okay, Njinga is
living in a world in Europe,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.910
you know, there's
the Medieval Period.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.250
This is Tudor Period in England.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.620
And I said what was
Elizabeth doing.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.070
Because, in fact, we had
a play on Queen Njinga,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.370
"Queen Njinga, The Queen King".

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:06.350
It was shown, it opened
at Folger some years ago,

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.710
and I said, look, it's -- you
know, this is the Tudor world,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.360
this is the Medieval world,
this is Elizabeth's world.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.740
I think in some respects
Elizabeth and Njinga,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.570
Catherine the Great
of, you know, Russia,

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.990
all of these women rulers
were very much, you know,

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.170
in the scope of performing.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:32.060
So here I have "Elizabeth I of
England, Dance and Diplomacy".

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.690
This is an article I ran across.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.990
I said, wow.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.040
So I got another entry
into how diplomacy is done.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.610
Diplomacy could be danced,
it could be performed.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:44.910
It's a performance.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.610
Communication is a
performative act.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.720
And I also said, well, what
else is this writer telling me,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.020
and I like this.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.410
Ben Johnson's 1603 Masque.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.930
You know, if you go to
France, you'll see the masques.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.380
All the courts of
Europe had this.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.460
I came out of Europe in
history, so I'm not afraid to go

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.970
in European history
and find our parallels,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.520
you know, with Njinga's world.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120
So the "Satyr".

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.790
"They came to see
and to be seen,

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.370
and though they dance before
the queen, they're none of those

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.470
that hope to come by/Wealth

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.960
to build another
Hombly/Hatton's estate."

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.270
And it tells you that people in
England, in Europe as a whole,

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.230
you know, that performance,
how you appeared in court,

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.970
your ability to dance and
move and know the moves

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.990
and know the etiquette, is
something that is just --

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.960
you know, we forget this.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.720
You know, we are gross now.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.950
But there was a time when, you
know, knowing how to appear,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.200
how the etiquette, you
know, of speak, of speech,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.080
of movement was very crucial

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.590
to indicate your intentions,
and people read you.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.780
So the first thing I want to
introduce you to is Njinga.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:10.100
Some people have seen this
picture, but it is, in fact,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.580
Njinga in her first
performance, you know,

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.570
her diplomacy, you know.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.740
She went to negotiate
with the Portuguese

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.610
on behalf of her brother.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.950
And the Portuguese governor,
you know, sits on his chair,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.700
you know, and as
usual, they gave the --

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.230
put on the floor a carpet
for the defeated African

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.320
to sit lower and show
their subordination.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.470
And Njinga calls one
of her attendants,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.070
you could call her
slave, client,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.610
I don't care what you
call her, but Njinga had

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.020
to show her status was
equal to the Portuguese

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.380
and she negotiated
getting up and down,

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.120
and the Portuguese are just
blown away, is this what --

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.140
and she was so persuasive
they sealed a deal.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.040
Now, the Portuguese
would renege,

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.080
but in Njinga's presence
they sealed that deal,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.130
that the Portuguese would
remove their fort in Ambaca.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.140
Okay. When they didn't do it,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.950
Njinga will take
up the struggle.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.560
Another thing that Njinga
performed was that, you know,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.260
they persuaded her -- or Njinga
persuaded herself, I will say,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.920
that, you know, what
is strategic.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.710
The Portuguese had something.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.710
They had Christian, a
religion, and Njinga was staying

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.640
in the house of one
of the wealthy,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.820
you know, families in Luanda.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.710
And yes, six months
there she did convert.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.920
Well, she did allow
herself to be baptized

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.510
and to learn the catechism.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.810
And here she is very
-- you see this

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.830
and you say this is
Cavazzi's drawing.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.200
It doesn't come from today,
we are not creating things,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.610
this is from the time period.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.950
And Cavazzi was speaking
to people who, in fact,

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.930
lived in Njinga's court.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.670
He got all these traditions,
how she was born, everything.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:03.060
So I believe this, even though
he is a, oh, European outsider,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.820
but you have to weigh how you
take those written documents

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.690
that come to you, and
there's some things, you know,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.270
that you can question
and there are some things

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.570
that are genuine.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.330
So you look and see what's the
environment in which the scholar

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.510
or this observer's taken
down that material.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.410
And we know that when
Njinga left the court,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.790
when she left Luanda, she was
given all sort of Christian,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.690
you know, crosses, and so
on, to take back with her.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.640
And once Njinga reached
outside of the --

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.370
you know, she was accompanied
up to the end of the city.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.940
There was, imagine, you
know, the bush and the urban.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.590
So once she got back to Omatu
[phonetic], the Angolans were

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.660
on the side of the
bush, you know,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.470
she just called her own
religious, you know, supporters

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.440
and had them do the
ritual so that

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.060
when she could get back safe,

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.930
back to her Ambaca,
back to her lands.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.080
Okay. So I'm just saying,
I believe that these two,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.010
even though the Portuguese
might indicate for this

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.800
that Njinga was baptized
and genuine,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.260
I think it was all
strategic diplomacy.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.970
This was the first
evidence of her diplomacy.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.300
So here I begin with Njinga's
strategic diplomacy, the writ,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.070
you know, the written document.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:28.510
And her father had died and, you
know, they're reporting this,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.040
but he said Dona Ana Sousa
-- her brother had died.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.120
Dona Ana Sousa, his
sister, who is baptized,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.640
you see again the Portuguese
say this, she's baptized, right,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.630
has been nominated, but
she's not named queen,

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.240
only Lady of Angola.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.060
Oh, but the thing about
diplomacy, Njinga strategically,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.650
I have received a letter of hers
in which she says that as soon

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.690
as the fort is removed,
she will immediately come

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.810
out of the lands where she is.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.460
So Njinga continued
her brother's struggle,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.120
and she wanted to negotiate.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.320
She wanted to make sure
that the Portuguese played

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.660
by the rules of diplomacy.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.000
And if they wanted war,
she will get to war,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.550
and that war could be
prolonged, she'll prolong it

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.090
until she overcame,
or show the Portuguese

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.040
that she was not going to
subordinate herself to them.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.070
So here, Njinga's
oral diplomacy,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.830
not only is she sending
letters, she sends --

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.940
you know how Njinga
returned to the islands,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.370
right, she called the sobas.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.760
She is negotiating
with the supporters.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.350
Some of these sobas are
all on the Portuguese side.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.720
Njinga is going to bring
them in alliance with her

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.280
against the Portuguese.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.580
All right.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.710
With this intention, she
sent her mani lumbo --

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.480
and all of these
negotiators have diplomats,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.050
her emissaries, they
have titles.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.110
This is not just bush.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.580
This is a state.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.760
Her mani lumbo from the lands of
Ambaca to open the slave trade.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.300
Okay. She trade some slaves.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.380
That's what the Portuguese
have taken.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.740
The Portuguese themselves
are trading in slaves.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.030
So don't bring anything
to me to tell me, oh,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.110
but Njinga's trading in slaves.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.650
I will just tell you,
oh, the Portuguese

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.960
and the Europeans were
trading in slaves also.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.230
Now, I'm a descendent of these
slaves so I should be hurt.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.530
No, I'm not hurt.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.830
History is history.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.130
You go beyond that.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.430
You go forward.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.190
You look backward to understand
it and you know you don't want

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.020
to stay there or be
that, so you go forward.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.240
So that's what you have
to understand with Njinga.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.710
She always was looking to the
future, to the future for her

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.980
to maintain her autonomy so
that the Portuguese would never

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.910
control her land.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.850
Okay. And we have not
only the mani lumbo.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.720
I'm not going to
read all of these.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.160
But each of these are
titled, you know, mani lumbo,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.310
her privado, her
macunzes, her pungas.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.590
All of these are officials that
again and again Njinga sends,

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.280
you know what I mean,
with letters,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.610
you know, with performance.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.360
And the Portuguese, sometimes
you see this [inaudible] I cut

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.660
off his head.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.020
I don't know if I told you that.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.350
Right. I ordered him seized
as a spy and slit his throat

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.380
in the fortress where
he came to negotiate.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.720
Okay. So Njinga knows that.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.300
Right. So she is never going
to trust the Portuguese,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.840
but she sends people
to negotiate,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.290
but she's always
thinking look behind

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.110
because they're not
to be trusted.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.700
I'm sorry for the Portuguese
that I'm presenting it

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.330
like this, but this is history.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.690
I'm not against the Portuguese.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.570
I love Portugal, but this
is really exciting history.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.410
Okay. So they said how
was this performed.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.710
Look at this.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.190
You know, Cadornega, he
said, look, these people,

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.130
this queen is Njinga
Ana de Sousa,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.940
she's very conscious
of her high status.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.090
This guy was there
as a young man.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.630
He has seen her grow.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.040
He has grown with the wars.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.880
He has grown with her.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.460
You know, so when
he's reflecting,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.770
he knows her, you know.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.680
And the nation of Angola,
which is really Mbundu

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.610
and the word Kimbundu --
and I spell Njinga, N-j,

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.210
that's the Kimbundu spelling.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.570
Okay. So my book
is "Queen Njinga,"

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.070
right, "Njinga of Angola".

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.130
It's the Kimbundu spelling.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.440
There's several other
spellings, Z-i-n or, you know,

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.810
S-i-n, Italian spelling.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.910
In fact, I am doing now another
book on Njinga, the second book

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.430
on her memory, and she's in
America, and she is in America

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.540
in the 19th century,
in the 18th century.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.730
I'm going to show you that,
not now, but Z-i-n-g-h-a.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.150
Right. Fascinating.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.250
Anyhow, so you see, the people
from which she originate,

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.000
you know, they take
great pleasure, right,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.930
they think their
lands are extensive.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.530
These are proud people.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.900
But what get me, she sends her
ambassadors, right, they spoke

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.730
and gave her embassy in
their own Mbundu language.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.030
Absolutely.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.330
Pride in the language.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.340
In fact, turning the Colonial
Period, late Colonial, 1900s,

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.880
the Portuguese are
contesting with Njinga still,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.720
and they said -- they call the
Mbundu language dog language,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.220
and the Njingas -- this
is in the 20th century,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.630
this is in 1950s,
and the Njingas,

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.470
they said Portuguese is,
in fact, the language of --

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.040
I'm not going to say what it is.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.820
But if you insult me,
I'm going to insult you.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:39.460
Up to today that tendency
of resistance and authority

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.940
and sort of belief in your
language, your people,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.690
your land, it's very strong.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.730
So she said they spoke,
right, and it was explained

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.520
by an interpreter -- by the
way, every Portuguese governor,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.580
every Portuguese [inaudible]
their post at this time,

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.660
they had to hire an interpreter
who spoke in Kimbundu.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.620
So as I've shown in
an article I wrote,

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.000
Kimbundu was the lingua franca
of Luanda, not Portuguese.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.210
In fact, "Portuguese
into Africa,"

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.630
I called an article I wrote

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.100
because I can see
that sort of melding.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.490
You have a new society
being created in Luanda,

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.470
not in Ndongo, not in Matamba.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.190
That's still, you
know, Mbundu land,

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.950
Kimbundu land, Njinga's land.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.500
Right. Their speech
is well rehearsed.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.850
This is the interpreter.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.370
Right. They're well-rehearsed.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.270
And there are people who will
stand a whole day speaking

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.870
in their language without
resting, and speak at times

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.830
so obscurely that even
native-born person

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.130
can't understand.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.100
These are trained, you know,
speakers, oral speakers.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.920
This is not oral
tradition I'm talking about.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.400
This is negotiating politics.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.080
Okay. So, you know, you go
to Africa and you say, oh,

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.070
I want to learn the
African tradition.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.810
No. These people, the tradition
is a living tradition, you know,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.500
and they're proud of it.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.760
Njinga Ana de Sousa, her
diplomacy, every new governor

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.010
who arrived, Njinga gets
all her messages from Luanda

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.890
with her spies, and
she then sends letters,

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.190
or sends ambassadors.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.940
It's just incredible, you know,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.150
tenacity of this
incredible woman.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.920
Njinga sent an embassy
to the city with letters

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.960
that she dictated asking
for a respectful settler

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.870
to discuss matters of
importance to the two crowns.

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.620
Right. So Njinga, every time
she hear a new governor comes,

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.860
she tries to start over.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.550
You know, she said look, I've
given you so many slaves,

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.260
so many bundles of things
that you have asked for,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.010
and you're just cheating me,
I know you're cheating me,

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.970
so I'm going to look
for another way.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:57.190
I am not going to let any
Portuguese priest come

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.050
in my land.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.830
She doesn't want a
Portuguese priest.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.810
If you are sending
an interpreter,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.250
if you're sending a
negotiator, guess what,

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.010
they got to speak Kimbundu.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.990
They're not coming in my
land and speak Portuguese.

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.080
That's what she -- she
determined what her, you know,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.140
the way in which she would
negotiate with the Portuguese.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.590
Right. Guess what.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.150
So it's not only the
Portuguese she is dealing with.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:29.110
The Dutch took over
Luanda, Angola 1641 to 1648.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.130
The first thing Njinga
does is what,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.900
send her people to the Dutch.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.440
She said, look, we
can work together.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.290
I don't want the
Portuguese here,

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.910
you don't want the
Portuguese here, let's ally.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.260
And, in fact, up to
the very end Njinga

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.550
and the Dutch would
have controlled Angola,

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.940
but there's in Europe another
negotiation had taken place

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.350
where the Dutch decided that
they had to leave Luanda

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.620
because their crowns
had come together

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.470
and Njinga brings
down her troops.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:01.770
You'll see all this.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.150
Exciting. They're waiting
for her, right, they're going

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.840
to end the Portuguese.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.910
She comes down and sees
the Dutch ship leaving.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.210
Right, leaving.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.100
So another group of
Europeans have reneged

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.630
on the negotiations
they made with her.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.670
So you ask me why Njinga
went Imbangala, ballistic.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.700
She did because she had been --

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.440
time and time again the
Europeans, the Portuguese

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.750
and now the Dutch
had disappointed her.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:39.360
Okay. We state here in
the reports that we have

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.600
yet to find the occasion to send
our letters to Queen Ana Njinga.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.960
From the reports in
question you would learn

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.340
that you have received
letters from this queen,

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.320
again showing you that
Njinga took the initiative,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.100
you know, to send letters.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.560
Okay. Njinga was
also very much alert

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.000
to the new missionaries
who were coming in.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.420
So it's 1652, you know,
missionary, right, I want to get

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.400
to the lands -- this is
in her Imbangala stage.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.040
I want to get to the
lands of this woman.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.840
We heard that she's
a barbarian, wow,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.300
the Portuguese have thrown her
out, right, and now she lives

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.330
like a captive bird, right, but
she had said this captive bird,

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.110
right, knows what is
going on in Luanda.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.410
Guess what.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:26.930
She sends an ambassador.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.610
She sends an ambassador, right,
and then he sends a letter

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.690
to her in which I ask her
please give up your ways,

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.460
come back to the church.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.610
Njinga knows what she's doing.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:44.180
So she's invaded Congo and
the Congo eastern area Wandu

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.480
[phonetic], and there are
two missionaries were there

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.770
in Congo, and guess what,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.500
her army captured the two
missionaries and brings them

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.180
to Njinga, Father
Cordella and Father Veas,

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.940
and they're shaking, because
all they've heard of Njinga is

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.370
that she's an Imbangala,
they are cannibals,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.540
they eat their [inaudible]
children, all this stuff.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:14.810
So they're there and her
captain brings them to her.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.110
And she's just calm then.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.610
She said, calmer.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.990
Like the Portuguese told me,
when the Angolans told me

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.630
when I got, you know,
excited and I got sick,

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:30.110
they'll just say calmer
Linda, calmer Linda, calmer,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.310
because I get excited sometimes.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.610
It's fascinating.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.490
And I could see Njinga saying,
calmer, Capuchinos, calmer.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.870
And she sets to make
them at ease.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.100
You're not going to be eaten.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.060
You're not going
to eat human flesh.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.950
She tells them in conversation,
she has long conversations

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.900
with them in the time that they
are, you know, in her, you know,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.590
present in her kilombo,
military,

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.130
you know, marooned outpost.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.430
She said, [foreign language].

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:08.650
We people don't eat human
flesh, but my soldiers,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:16.570
who are Imbangala, who comes
from a different ethnicity,

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.520
we have to satisfy them
because we need to use them,

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.500
and guess what, she
didn't say that,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.440
but I'm adding she could have
said the Portuguese are doing

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.760
the same thing, they're
using the Imbangalas

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.830
and they know they eat human
flesh or have all this thing,

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.020
you know, cannibalism,
that's what they write.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.070
Many people question that
now, but I'm just saying

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.520
that that was the world.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.640
The more you could
intimidate your enemy,

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.700
is an upper hand you have.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.420
Leaders do horrible things.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.660
They make sometimes choices
that we consider horrible,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:54.060
but sometimes survival of the
fittest fits in and our leaders

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.570
that we -- and we didn't
even elect these leaders.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:00.430
These leaders gained their
prominence from lineage,

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.520
from inheritance, like
Queen Elizabeth II today.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.820
I admire her.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.570
She's lived so many
years, you know,

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.290
and she's continuing
the monarchy.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.020
That's what Njinga wanted to do.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.600
So what? We are democrats
and we don't like people

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.820
with inheritance, but
we're, oh, we tolerate them.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.910
Okay. We don't let them vote.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:26.270
Okay. So Njinga has
peace negotiations.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.010
An ambassador of Njinga
arrived in Luanda.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.420
He appears at the
palace, accompanied --

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.390
the Portuguese had, in
fact, imprisoned her sister.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:36.630
I can't go into all the details.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.110
It's in the book.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:44.400
But Njinga sends a letter to
her sister who is in prison

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.790
in Luanda to negotiate
the release of her sister.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.110
Why? Njinga does not
want any Imbangala,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.770
any Jaga to inherit the kingdom.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.730
She wants a family [inaudible].

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.680
She said I wish I had a son.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.710
Her brother had killed her son,
according to the tradition,

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.280
and she had killed
her brother's son.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.290
You know, these royal intrigues,

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:10.220
if you do European history,
you see all of that.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.380
Remember Richard III, you
know, killing all those --

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.960
you know, I can tell you
all the gory details.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.100
I love them, I love
history like that.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.760
I'm glad we don't have it now,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.380
but history's really
interesting if you go back.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.030
The ambassador verbally details
the contents of the letter.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.910
During the speech the
ambassador presented ten slaves

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.910
that Njinga sent as a gift
to the Queen of Portugal.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:38.600
The king had died and the
queen was just in transition

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.400
as the king's son took
over, Afonso [inaudible].

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.890
So Njinga's already
strategizing I'm going to get

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.410
on the good side of the
queen in terms of diplomacy,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.720
and you'll see her
working through that.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.020
Right. Here's a letter.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.850
I found this letter.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.790
It gave me goose pimples.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.250
Oh, my gosh, a letter that
would actually -- you see that?

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.840
You know what that is inside
there, what we call it?

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.970
Yeah. Seal.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.690
The seal we say, you know.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.990
Impressa [phonetic].

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.790
You know, is that genuine, man.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:18.790
And look at her, right, and
she had her Congo secretary.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.710
And this is going because --
you know, I mean, so we have --

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.240
I can't go into all the details,

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.890
but it's just an incredible
set of documentation.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.750
The peace negotiations
always send bearing letters,

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.530
they sent it to Njinga's court.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.090
She performs the receipt
of the letter, you know.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.030
Father Gaeta, you
know, she has them

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.610
as her allies men,
spiritual diplomacy.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.910
Go to Luanda.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.210
I'm going to send an
ambassador straight to Rome

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.450
so that they can talk and
kiss the feet of the Pope

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.470
so he can send me missionaries.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.240
Don't let the Portuguese know
because Portuguese has a law

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.200
that no African could
leave as an ambassador

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.790
on their own to go to Europe.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:10.170
And you're telling me why
Njinga should not be suspicious

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.470
of the Portuguese.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:16.130
So she used these spiritual
diplomats who are working

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.820
on her soul, you know,
as her emissaries.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.350
She said if my representatives
cannot go,

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.450
then you go on my behalf.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.090
And we have several letters to
that, you know, [inaudible],

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:38.580
with the excuse that I'm sending
my ambassador with the excuse

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.510
to send the condolences
for the death of King John.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.170
Right. After this
embassy then he'll go on.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.800
He'll be kept in a
Capuchin, you know --

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.730
you know, he will be
upkept by the Capuchins

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:57.110
and then they will safely
send him on to Rome.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.260
Okay. And we have all the
intrigue of the letters.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.340
I can't go into all
of that, the time.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.420
Okay. Finally, I
have to stop, okay.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.720
I want to show you this.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.940
So it's got a lot of
secrecy with this.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.030
She gets a letter from the Pope.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.390
Right. She sends the Pope the
letter, she gets a letter.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.510
She gets letters.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.080
Njinga performs.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.810
I can't go into all the details.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.470
She performs when she
gets these letters,

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.190
big parade that she
was a performer.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.480
She wore around her neck
beautiful gold brocade.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.510
All of this, this is a
description of a woman

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.800
who is a woman, she's gendered,
but she's also just a leader,

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.310
a diplomat, a [inaudible],
one of the best,

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.600
right, one of the best.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.580
And she thanks him, even at the
end of her life, by the way.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.880
This is in April.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.650
Njinga's going to
be dead by December.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.950
Right. Because she wants
to protect the autonomy

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.170
of her kingdom, she still
sends we are lacking,

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.940
we don't have enough
Capuchins, send Capuchins.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:13.140
Okay. And this letter
arrived after Njinga had died,

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.910
a letter from the Pope.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.710
"To our Dear Daughter in
Christ Regina Ana Njinga."

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.920
Okay. So this is the woman
that we are dealing with.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.500
This is no, you know,
fly-by-night, you know, leader.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.680
This is a leader who had
an impact on her people.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.370
That is why her memory
is retained.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.660
You know, people carrying
me to see footsteps,

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.850
this is where Njinga stepped.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.430
Amazing. So I have to
do the second book.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.230
Thank you very much.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:52.230
[ Applause ]

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.700
If you have any questions,
I'm open to --

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.700
you know, I know I went over
things very quickly, but.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.000
Yes.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.840
&gt;&gt; Where did you find
this documentation,

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.140
such as the letters?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.670
&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Well,
some of the letters are embedded

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.800
in Cadornega's book,
for instance.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.820
Some of them are embedded
in Cavazzi's manuscript.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.810
Some of them I found --
the letter I showed you,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:27.480
I found this in Lisbon at the
Arquivo Historico Ultramarino,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.370
that's the overseas archives,
which is the main archive.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:38.280
I also visited Venice, Florence,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.880
because the Capuchin has
an archive in Venice,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:49.370
and some of the Capuchins, there
was a Capuchin Secado [phonetic]

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.830
who came to Angola I think
in 1950s, but in any case,

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.250
in '57 he actually found --

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:01.890
he went to visit the site that
people said was Njinga's grave,

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:05.350
and he actually measured
it and he had --

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.500
the Capuchin had all
the specifications

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.150
of the hasidi [phonetic]

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.830
and he stipulated that
that was the grave.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.670
So we had collected
all the archives.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.960
I also went to the
Papacy, you know,

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.550
in Rome to look for documents.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:29.590
And sometimes I got documents
from the Dutch, you know,

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.360
the West India Company.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.480
So it's all over.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.620
Not in America though.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:42.400
It's in 17th and
18th, but mostly 17th

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.280
and late 16th century
documentation.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.320
The writing is pretty
horrible, some of it,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.380
so sometimes I had really
nice, supportive students

00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.630
who were Italian speakers or
were from, you know, Portugal,

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.890
Portuguese speakers who checked
out things and then I checked it

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:12.020
and I did a lot of -- the poem
from Cavazzi that I quoted

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.120
at the end of the book, where
he's -- it wasn't published,

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.580
it was in his manuscript.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.340
The first time it's
published is in my book.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.550
And he says that Njinga is --
you know, he compares Njinga --

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.340
in fact, I could
actually, just a minute --

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.120
yeah, I know I'm going
on, but this is important.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.970
So just it will take a sec.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:44.680
Okay. "Under this rice cloth,
fielded cloth, in the dark tomb

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.970
that you see, Njinga, who
made herself queen of Ndongo

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:53.030
and Matamba, lies
buried, a dry corpse.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:55.940
In this dark tomb that you see,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.290
here lies the one
who lived to die.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:02.440
Here lies the one
who by dying lives.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.100
In this dark tomb
she hid herself.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.130
Because of Agrippa
Rome repelled.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.270
Because of Helen
Greece rebelled.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:17.430
Because of Yusodonia
[phonetic] Germany rebelled.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.610
Because of Hecuba,
Spain rebelled.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:24.370
But Ethiopia did not
rebel for Njinga.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:29.970
Instead, Njinga overturned,
destroyed and ruined Ethiopia.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.040
Njinga in death stole
from Heaven's treasure.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.530
In this tomb her
body is locked up.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:42.060
Therefore, we can sing
to a most cunning thief.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.980
A most cunning thief has stolen
from the treasury of Heaven.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.960
Njinga outsmarted even death."

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.180
And that's why her
memory lives on.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.630
So I wanted to contextualize.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:58.010
So this letter is in
the manuscript section.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.160
It was never published
in Cavazzi's book.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.650
So that's the type of thing.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:05.160
You have to really
compare what is, you know,

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.200
the translated version and
then go back to the original

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.120
to make sure you're
not missing anything.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.820
And there are a lot of
interesting sections of details

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.740
that go into give you
insight into the mind

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:24.070
of this incredible
woman that assisted me.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.370
Yes.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.970
I mean, this is very exciting.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.270
She really is.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:33.780
You know, I had always
figured, without any doubt.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.360
You mentioned a couple of
issues [inaudible] before.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.160
What were some of the other
issues which she was negotiating

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.320
with the Portuguese, and then

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.670
with the Dutch, again
the Portuguese?

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:46.970
What were some of the --

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.270
&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Well,

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:49.670
the main thing was she
wanted the Portuguese

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:55.880
to let her retain
the whole of Ndongo,

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.950
the parts that they had taken.

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:02.320
She wanted them to -- the
Portuguese had put in her place,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:08.460
after they had expelled her or
created conditions where she had

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.770
to go into resistance.

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:16.150
She wanted them to
get rid of the king

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.620
that they had nominated.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.920
The Portuguese had said

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.010
that Njinga was not
legitimate because --

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.310
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:23.720
Yeah. Yes, the Angolans

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.230
and Ndongo never,
you know, had women.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.010
In the book I tried to show
that in this sort of --

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:35.130
in the traditions of this area
that women were very crucial

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.910
as central players
in the kingship.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:42.950
So the thing was to
recognize her legitimacy,

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:48.490
recognize her rights
to the areas of Angola

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:53.230
that her brother had left
and her father had left.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.530
Up to her father's --

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.460
the Portuguese had
moved in up to Ambaca.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.790
She wanted them to
get, you know, removal.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.720
Yes. With the Dutch, she hoped

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.010
that the Dutch would just
help her get totally, push --

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.560
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.270
No Portuguese presence
in Angola.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:13.010
She also -- I didn't mention
this in the article I'm going

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.340
to write on this diplomacy,
she also had a lot of diplomacy

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.280
with Africans, especially the
King of Congo, and she would,

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.220
in fact -- she was planning --

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:28.550
she said the only rulers I
respect is the King of Congo.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.770
So that there were a lot of
things that Njinga was a --

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.980
if there was a -- I'm not
talking about protonationalist.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.970
She was a nationalist
from the beginning.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.160
We have these terms
protonational.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.530
She knew what nationalism was.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.770
She was the, you know,
ruler of her land.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.950
So those types of things.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:54.290
And she did not want the
Portuguese to come into Matamba

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.990
and -- but through Portuguese
speaking missionaries

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.000
who would be spies
for the Portuguese

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.600
and undermine her rule.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.510
But she did not mind
using the Portuguese,

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:10.130
so that she would send them
gifts, she would also send

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.290
to get the church
that she built.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:13.950
It was all -- all the interior

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:19.170
of the church design was all
done by Portuguese and mulatto,

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.430
mixed people, skilled
craftsmen who were in Massangano

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.000
and Luanda, and she paid them.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.260
So she did not mind, you
know, learning all the new

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.300
or adopting all the new styles,
whether it was in a dress,

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.870
she asked the governor to send
her earrings, she does this.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.040
She's very woman here.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.310
But she also was
a strategic ruler.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.410
It didn't mean that she wanted
-- because she was, you know,

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.900
dealing with you and
trading with you,

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.720
that she would let
the [inaudible] be

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.640
that you could come and
take over her territory

00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:01.880
because she had --
Njinga was born in 1582.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.590
The Portuguese, a few
maybe months after her --

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:10.410
her family had to
flee from the capital.

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:16.050
So she grew up in a situation
of, you know, being a refugee,

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:18.150
coming back and,
you know, survival.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.810
Yeah. It was instinctive
to survive for Njinga.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:24.110
Yes. Yes, sir.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:30.920
&gt;&gt; Could you say a little more
about the memory of Njinga

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.220
in America [inaudible]?

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.520
&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Okay.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.700
I'm going to give
you some teasers.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:43.080
When I sort of -- the book I'm
writing on her, "Njinga Memory,

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:49.250
Culture and History," I
had, in fact, done research

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.610
in Angola, interviewed people.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:56.820
I had read all the Portuguese
references after Njinga's death,

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.270
all the different, you
know, publications,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:06.440
and I had also followed Njinga
to Brazil where she's remembered

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:12.840
in the con gatas and the
only named person in any

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.830
of the con gatas, this is
an Afro-Brazilian festival,

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.130
is Njinga.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.540
So I have quality stuff there.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.030
Then I decided, because I'm
a modern African specialist,

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:27.220
you know, I decided I have
to follow Njinga and see

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:33.010
if she appears in Cuba because
of the Cuban connection.

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:36.100
And one day I was walking
down the street in Havana --

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.540
I've gone to Havana five times.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.210
This is my sixth, you know,
sixth time I'll be going.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:48.520
And I saw on the street
a children's magazine

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.160
and I saw this picture with
this, you know, Nzinga.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.340
I said, oh, my gosh,
Njinga's here.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:58.490
So I've been collecting research

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.230
of all the captains
of the Cuban Army.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:06.740
They're writing their memos
now and everybody has to start

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.340
with the history of Angola, the
resistance history of Angola

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.760
and it's right, they
start with Njinga

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.300
because that's [inaudible],
you know, history of Angola.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.600
That's what it is.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.460
So I sort of had said
I would stop there,

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:28.590
and after the book came out
in February, I gave a talk

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:33.130
at my old institution,
Boston University,

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:38.470
and the question I invariably
got from the three speakers

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:41.880
who were commenting on it, where
is the second book, you know.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.650
So I said, well, I have part of
it and then I decide, you know,

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.560
I had collected some
things on Njinga.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.280
I had worked with BSA,
Black Sisterhood in Action,

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.490
in the '90s who every year
celebrate a famous African queen

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:02.710
or ruler, and the year I worked

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:04.960
with them they celebrated
Queen Njinga.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.890
So I had done that, but it was,
you know, it was 20th century.

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:12.770
And if I were to do a
chapter on Njinga in America,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.090
I have to push it back to see.

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.390
So that's when I started.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:21.790
I came to LC just last summer,
just to begin, you know,

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.660
seeing if there's
anything in the newspapers.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.390
And I'm finding it.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:30.110
Abolition is literature,
you know.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.680
I'm finding it in the first
encyclopedia published

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.210
in America, you know,
having references to Njinga.

it's going to be incredible.

I can't go into it, but
I'm just so excited.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:48.590
I am just so excited
to finish that chapter,

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.190
so I'm collecting
the material now.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:54.720
I'm teasing out the
way I'm going to do it.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.920
It's going to be great,
so that's the American.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.720

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:42.560
What I hope to do in the --
if it's published in America,

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.380
and I've picked up some things
that were published in America,

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.770
I hope to address this in
the last part of the chapter

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:52.810
on America because there
are things now being --

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.190
a lot of stuff being
published on Njinga in America.

00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:00.600
And as I said, I did not want
to start with the contemporary,

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.130
so I now have fleshed
out the 19th century.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:08.350
I'm doing that, 18th and
19th century, and when I come

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:11.910
to the last part of the
book, you know, the chapter,

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.380
I'll be addressing the
distortions that I see

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:19.220
in the published
literature on Angola,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.920
especially children's books.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.430
I'll definitely.

And I'd like you to give me that
reference because I don't know

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.050
if I have the same as yours.

but I remember I went

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.220
to the Northeast Public
Library in [inaudible].

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.520

I'll get them.

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:39.720
I'll have a graduate

at all the children's

have a question.

I just wanted to make
a comment, if I can.

around and be part of this.

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.210
You talked about aspersions.

a lot to be said.

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Yeah.

should always remember is

that Njinga is known

but as a [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Yeah.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.130

talking about [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Yes.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:16.330
&gt;&gt; And there's something
really interesting about her

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:17.630
because the new generation
are thinking most

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:18.930
of the time things
that [inaudible].

I remember that when
we were growing up,

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:25.430
we used to read that
in a primary --

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:26.730
&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood:
Secondary school.

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.030

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Yes.

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:30.630
&gt;&gt; It only made sense later.

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Right.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.230

calling our kids --

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.330

&gt;&gt; Professor Heywood: Oh,
it's just part of the chapter.

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:57.930
And I have interviewed
lots of Angolans in Luanda.

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.230
I went up to Malange.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:00.530
I interviewed some of the
sobas and just ordinary people.

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:04.520
I took the 11-hour trip from
Malange to Marimba so that

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.910
on each, you know, part
of the travel it was tough

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:09.790
because the roads are --
you know, we had to stop

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:13.520
and build bridges and so -- but
it was absolutely incredible.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.090
And I have that, you
know, the perspective

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:20.380
of the different Angolans
from different regions

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.600
because I also collected
questionnaires from Mawambo

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.630
and from the Congo area.

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:31.300
And so it will be represented in
the last of the Angolan chapter

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.840
because I do Njinga in
contemporary Angola.
