00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.959
Do you ever find yourself wishing that you
could speed up time or slow down time?

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.640
Guess what, you totally can!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.440
Kind of.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.780
Hey everyone, Laci Green here and this is
Dnews.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.250
Time is a fixed dimension.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.560
One second for me is one second for you.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.450
But even though one second is fixed, how we
experience it and perceive it can vary hugely.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.840
And that's because our brains aren't just
keeping track of time, watching it go by,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.050
our brains are actively constructing time
- creating time.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.160
I know, "Whoa dude that's so crazy!"

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.510
That tidbit comes from David Eagleman, a neuroscientist
and director of the Eagleman Laboratory for

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.040
Time and Perception.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.960
He says he became fascinated with time when
as a child he fell off a roof.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.780
And he kept falling, and falling, and falling.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.210
And in those moments, it felt like time had
completely slowed down.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.470
Mid-air he thought to himself, "This is what
Alice must have felt like falling down the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.630
rabbit hole."

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.290
There are a few things that we know about
our mind's perception of time.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.700
Unlike our senses like touch and taste, time
doesn't have a specific part in the brain

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.170
that controls the perception of it.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.790
Time comes down to a whole complex network
of areas within the brain.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.869
We also know that when we're in a life threatening
situation, time seems to slow down.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.430
And as we get older, time seems to speed up.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249
Neuroscientist have pieced together why this
is so.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:27.490
The more information your brain has to process,
the slower time seems.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.530
When you're in a life threatening situation,
all of your brain's resources have become

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.749
intensely focused on survival.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.399
You're paying really close attention.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.649
The more attention to detail there is, the
longer time seems to last because all of that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.400
information takes longer for your brain to
process.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
On the flipside, time goes faster when you
don't have much information to process.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
If you're not taking in much that's new, your
brain is on autopilot.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.569
Less resources required, and time feels faster.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.459
This explains why time seems to get faster
as we get older.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.759
As you age, there isn't as much new information
for your brain to take in, which creates shortcuts

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.939
in your brain.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:01.939
Ok.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.939
Cool.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.950
So what about when time goes really slow when
you're bored?

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.680
A study in the Journal of Consumer Psychology
found that without enough stimulation, the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.129
brain concentrates its resources on monitoring
the time.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.129
You're like, "Come on, tick tock."

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.220
And because it consumes your brain, you perceive
it as slower.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.099
On the flipside, a study published by The
Association For Psychological Science found

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.950
that people don't actually perceive time as
shorter when they're having fun.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.590
But people did report more enjoyment when
they were lied to and told the task they performed

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.480
took half the time than they actually took.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.360
So what this all means is that we do have
some control over our perception of time.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.819
We can make it seem faster by finding ways
to distract ourselves from the passage of

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.190
time, and we can slow it down when things
seem too fast, by giving our brains lots of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.890
new things to process.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.930
Continuing to learn new things and chewing
on new ideas and immersing yourself in new

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.930
environments.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.500
So, there you go time benders.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.510
Go do your thing.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.359
