00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.310
So right here I have
two potential solvents

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.450
that you might see some type
of reaction take place in.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.760
The one on the right is a
very typical one, probably

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.420
the most common of all solvents.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.670
This is water.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.990
And this right over
here is diethyl ether.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.720
And we'll talk
about naming things

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.470
like this in the
future dates, but you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.340
can see what's going
on right over here.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.230
You have two ethyl
groups attached

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.790
to this oxygen
between diethyl ether.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.670
But the important point
here is to realize

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.679
where are these two
solvents similar?

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.220
Where are these two
molecules similar

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.549
and where are they different?

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.600
The places that they are
similar is in both cases oxygen,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.580
which is one of the most
electronegative of all

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.550
of the atoms, that
in both cases,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.400
it's bonded to things that
are less electronegative.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
And so that allows oxygen to
hog the electrons more often.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.170
It has a higher
electron affinity.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.220
And so you'll have a
partial negative charge

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.710
for both of these molecules
on the oxygen side.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.930
And you'd have a
partial positive side

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.060
from the thing that's
getting to spend

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.510
less time with the electrons.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.850
So both of these we could
call them polar solvents.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.500
And a general idea
throughout chemistry

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
is that polar solvents are
better at dissolving ions.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.876
Because a polar
solvent you have kind

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.250
of positive negative charges,
things are flipping around,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.580
they're partially attracted
to the other positive ends

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.800
of the other molecule.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.680
You could imagine that
it's very easy for an ion,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.790
for something that is positively
or negatively charged here,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.840
to kind of get mixed
in to the fray.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.480
Now the difference
between these two

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.320
is obviously what the
oxygen is attached to.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.090
Here the oxygen is
attached to some carbons.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.730
Here it is attached
to hydrogens.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.212
And oxygen is far
more electronegative

00:01:58.212 --> 00:01:59.170
than the hydrogens are.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.044
It's a much bigger
differential than the case

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:03.590
between oxygen and carbon.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.172
So in this situation
you will see scenarios

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:07.880
where it is possible
where in a mixture--

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.929
remember these things
get really, really messy.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.720
There's a lot of just
random bumping that's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.540
going on over here-- that oxygen
is so electronegative that it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.690
can often times take
this pair that's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.580
in this bond right over there.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.920
And if it did that you would be
left with the oxygen now having

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.020
a negative charge.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.920
Before this-- let's
see if I can draw

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.128
all of its valence electrons.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:36.730
It was one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.549
So now it's going to
have one, two, three,

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.840
four-- actually maybe I can
draw them a little bit more

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.810
carefully.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.960
So you still have, you could say
half of this bond to hydrogen.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.840
Now you have these two pairs.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.010
So one, two, three, four.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.800
And now it gains another pair.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
It got both of these electrons.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200
It was already kind of
sharing half of this bond

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.960
but now it has the whole bond.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.420
It has a negative charge.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.720
And then you have the hydrogen.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.810
Well if you strip
it of its electron,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.910
hydrogen is just a
proton floating around.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.660
So let me draw that.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.850
So this hydrogen is now just
a proton floating around.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.740
So when you have water,
water is actually

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.209
called a protic solvent.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.750
And then maybe
another water molecule

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.910
might pick this up
and take it someplace

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.440
forming a hydronium cation.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.430
But this right over
here, water is protic.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.260
Which means that you might have
these protons floating around,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.690
these hydrogen protons.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.960
While diethyl ether
is not protic.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.540
Even in the case that
somehow one of the bonds--

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.360
you don't just have
little hydrogen protons

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.667
floating around in this.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.250
And so what I want
to now think about,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.320
now that we know about polar
solvents, why they're polar.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.130
But we also know examples of
protic and nonprotic solvents.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.830
Let's think about
which might be better

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.950
when we're talking about
the types of reactions

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.220
we're studying.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.375
So right over here you
might recognize-- in fact,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.250
it's a good exercise.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.890
Pause this video and
tell me these top three

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.750
steps, what type of
reaction is this,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.150
and these bottom two what
type of reaction is this.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.730
Well, in this top one we see
that this leaving group leaves

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.010
first, and that this is
the rate determining step.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.924
And then a nucleophile
comes in here

00:04:19.924 --> 00:04:22.600
and attacks the
carbocation and attaches.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.050
So this is a
substitution reaction,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
but the rate that with a
nucleophile, but the rate

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.410
determining step involves
only one of the reactants.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.200
The leaving group's
got to leave.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.176
So this right over here is an
SN1 reaction, only involving

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.050
one of the reactants.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.080
The leaving group leaving is
the rate determining step.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.550
This, on the other hand,
both the nucleophile attacks

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.350
and the leaving group
leaves in one step.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.850
So this is a substitution
involving a nucleophile,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.490
but both reactants are involved
in the rate determining step.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.870
Now since both SN1
and SN2 reactions

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.430
need these ions
floating around you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.400
can imagine that they both
benefit from polar solvents.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.310
So polar solvents
are good for both.

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:16.980
Now let's think
about whether it's

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.860
good to have protic or
nonprotic environments

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.210
for either one of
these reactions.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.960
Well to think about
that a little bit more

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.751
let's think about the
types of nucleophiles

00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:30.160
and the types of molecules
we're dealing with.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.265
SN2 reactions, in order
for this to happen you

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.140
have to have a reasonably
strong nucleophile.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.380
And the SN1 reaction,
well you already

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.290
have the carbocation
set up here,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.520
the leaving group leaving
was actually the hard part.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.725
So this could even work
with a weak nucleophile.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.270
The real thing you have to do
is to get this leaving group

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.986
to leave.

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:01.610
And also if we want
to remind ourselves

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.609
of some of the other kind
of the stereochemistry

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:07.320
of the reactions,
in an SN1 reaction,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.130
it's actually nice to
have a tertiary carbon.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.470
If these are also carbons, these
little circles I drew here,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.720
that helps stabilize
the carbocation.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.920
So if this was a tertiary
carbon this would favor SN1.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.470
We also know that tertiary
carbon would not be good.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.390
If this is a tertiary carbon
that would not be good for SN2.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.580
Because if these were
carbon chains of some

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.100
form-- these three,
this purple, this blue,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.834
and this orange
thing-- then they

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:33.000
would have steric hindrance.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.300
The nucleophile would
have trouble getting in.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.920
So this would be
more likely to happen

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.300
if you're dealing with a methyl
carbon or a primary carbon,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.640
maybe a secondary carbon.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.830
So here the nucleophile
is reasonably strong.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.760
Here it can even work
with a weak nucleophile.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.220
Polar solvent in either case.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.130
And the SN1 the key is
stabilizing the leaving group,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.810
making it OK for the
leaving group to leave.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.940
So what's going to help
a leaving group to leave?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.523
Especially when a
leaving group leaves

00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:02.590
it typically has
a negative charge.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.370
Well if there were a bunch
of protons flying around that

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.790
could help stabilize
this negative charge,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.590
that would help.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.760
In fact, this could then form a
bond with one of those protons.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.800
It could donate electrons
to one of those protons.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.220
And so a protic environment
is good for the SN1.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.006
While on the SN2 since you
have these strong nucleophiles,

00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:28.130
if you had protons flying
around, instead of trying

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.000
to attack the substrate
right over here,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160
the nucleophile would
attack the protons.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.980
So you don't want that, then
this thing won't happen.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:42.911
So you want nonprotic
for the SN2.

00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:44.410
So hopefully that
gives a little bit

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.520
of the basics of the
solvents and also

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.530
allows us to compare these two
reactions in interesting ways.
