00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.800
Photosynthesis! It is not some kind of abstract
scientific thing. You would be dead without 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.269
plants and their magical- nay, SCIENTIFIC
ability to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.480
and water into glucose and pure, delicious
oxygen.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.619
This happens exclusively through photosynthesis,
a process that was developed 450 million years

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.550
ago and actually rather sucks.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.949
It's complicated, inefficient and confusing.
But you are committed to having a better,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.050
deeper understanding of our world! Or, more
probably, you'd like to do well on your

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.399
test...so let's delve.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.399
There are two sorts of reactions in Photosynthesis...light
dependent reactions, and light independent

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.430
reactions, and you've probably already figured
out the difference between those two, so that's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.850
nice. The light independent reactions are
called the "calvin cycle"

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.280
no...no...no...no...YES! THAT Calvin Cycle.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.949
Photosynthesis is basically respiration in
reverse, and we've already covered respiration,

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.359
so maybe you should just go watch that video
backwards. Or you can keep watching this one.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.880
Either way.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.109
I've already talked about what photosynthesis
needs in order to work: water, carbon dioxide

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.829
and sunlight.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.520
So, how do they get those things?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.869
First, water. Let's assume that we're
talking about a vascular plant here, that's

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.789
the kind of plant that has pipe-like tissues
that conduct water, minerals and other materials

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.130
to different parts of the plant.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.279
These are like trees and grasses and flowering
plants.

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:29.560
In this case the roots of the plants absorb
water

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.959
and bring it to the leaves through tissues
called xylem.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.639
Carbon dioxide gets in and oxygen gets out
through tiny pores in the leaves called stomata.

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.479
It's actually surprisingly important that
plants keep oxygen levels low inside of their

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.919
leaves for reasons that we will get into later.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:51.139
And finally, individual photons from the Sun
are absorbed in the plant by a pigment called

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.450
chlorophyll.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.599
Alright, you remember plant cells? If not,
you can go watch the video where we spend

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.229
the whole time talking about plant cells.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.669
One thing that plant cells
have that animal cells don't... plastids.

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:02.299
And what is the most important plastid?

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.469
The chloroplast! Which is not, as it is sometimes
portrayed, just a big fat sac of chlorophyl.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.780
It's got complicated internal structure.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.170
Now, the chlorophyll is stashed in membranous
sacs called thylakoids. The thykaloids are

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.689
stacked into grana. Inside of
the thykaloid is the lumen, and outside the

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.040
thykaloid (but still inside the
chloroplast) is the stroma.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.250
The thylakoid membranes are phospholipid bilayers, which, if you remember

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.810
means they're really good at maintaining
concentration gradients of ions,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.280
proteins and other things. This means keeping
the concentration higher on one side

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.879
than the other of the membrane. You're going
to need to know all of these things, I'm sorry.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.780
Now that we've taken that little tour of
the Chloroplast, it's time to get down to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.269
the actual chemistry.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.700
First thing that happens: A photon created
by the fusion reactions of our sun is about

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.040
to end its 93 million mile journey by slapping
into a molecule of cholorophyll. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.730
This kicks off stage one, the light-dependent reactions proving

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.420
that, yes, nearly all life on our planet is
fusion-powered.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.709
When Chlorophyll gets hit by that photon,
an electron absorbs that energy and gets excited.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.069
This is the technical term for electrons gaining
energy and not having anywhere to put it and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.980
when it's done by a photon it's called
photoexcitation, but let's just imagine,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.909
for the moment anyway, that every photon is
whatever

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.879
dreamy young man 12 year old girls are currently
obsessed with, and electrons are 12 year old girls. 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.019
The trick now, and the entire trick
of photosynthesis, is to convert the energy

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:23.909
of those 12 year old-

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.620
I mean, electrons, into something that the
plant can use.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.459
We are literally going to be spending the
entire rest of the video talking about that.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.480
I hope that that's ok with you.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.030
This first Chlorophyll is not on its own here,
it's part of an insanely complicated complex

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.239
of proteins, lipids, and other molecules called
Photosystem II that contains at least 99 different

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.430
chemicals including over 30 individual chlorophyll
molecules.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.359
This is the first of four protein complexes
that plants need for the light dependent reactions.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.120
And if you think it's complicated that we
call the first complex photosystem II instead

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.629
of Photosystem I, then you're welcome to
call it by its full name, plastoquinone oxidoreductase.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.810
Oh, no? You don't want to call it that?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.889
Right then, photosystem II, or, if you want
to be brief, PSII.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.760
PSII and indeed all of the protein complexes
in the light-dependent reactions, straddle

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.229
the membrane of the thylakoids in the chloroplasts.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.569
That excited electron is now going to go on
a journey designed to extract all of its new

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.889
energy and convert that energy into useful
stuff. This is called the electron transport

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.080
chain, in which energized electrons lose their
energy in a series of reactions that capture

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.440
the energy necessary to keep life living.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.940
PSII's Chlorophyll now has this electron
that is so excited that, when a special protein

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.300
designed specifically for stealing electrons
shows up,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.580
the electron actually leaps off of the chlorophyll
molecule onto the protein, which we call a

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.389
mobile electron carrier because it's...

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.380
...a mobile electron carrier.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.800
The Chlorophyll then freaks out like a mother
who has just had her 12 year old daughter

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.270
abducted by a teen idol and is like "WHAT
DO I DO TO FIX THIS PROBLEM!"

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.110
and then it, in cooperation with the rest
of PSII does something so amazing and important

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.520
that I can barely believe that it keeps happening
every day.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.550
It splits that ultra-stable molecule, H2O,
stealing one of its electrons, to replenish

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.910
the one it lost.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.099
The byproducts of this water splitting?

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.930
Hydrogen ions, which are just single protons,
and oxygen. Sweet, sweet oxygen.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.580
This reaction, my friends, is the reason that
we can breathe.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.610
Brief interjection: Next time someone says
that they don't like it when there are chemicals

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.300
in their food, please remind them that all
life is

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.210
made of chemicals and would they please stop
pretending that the word chemical is somehow

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.650
a synonym for carcinogen!

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.740
Because, I mean, think about how chlorophyll
feels when you say that! It spends all of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.080
it's time and energy creating the air we
breathe and then we're like

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.490
"EW! CHEMICALS ARE SO GROSS!"

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.759
Now, remember, all energized electrons from
PSII have been picked up by electron carriers

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.919
and are now being transported onto our second
protein complex

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.199
the Cytochrome Complex!

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.860
This little guy does two things...one, it
serves as an intermediary between

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.699
PSII and PS I and, two, uses a bit of the
energy from the electron to

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.419
pump another proton into the thylakoid.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.580
So the thylakoid's starting to fill up with
protons. We've created some by splitting water,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.539
and we moved one in using the Cytochrome complex.
But why are we doing this?

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.780
Well...basically, what we're doing, is charging
the Thylakoid like a battery.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.360
By pumping the thylakoid full of protons,
we're creating a concentration gradient.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.280
The protons then naturally want to get the
heck away from each other, and so they push

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.319
their way through an enzyme straddling the
thylakoid membrane called ATP Synthase, and

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:46.169
that enzyme uses that energy to pack an inorganic
phosphate onto ADP, making ATP: the big daddy

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.000
of cellular energy.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.389
All this moving along the electron transport
chain requires energy, and as you might expect

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.610
electrons are entering lower and lower energy
states as we move along. This makes sense

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.439
when you think about it. It's been a long
while since

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:02.030
those photons zapped us, and we've been
pumping hydrogen ions to create ATP and splitting

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.330
water and jumping onto different molecules
and I'm tired just talking about it.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.509
Luckily, as 450 million years of evolution
would have it, our electron is now about to

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.259
be re-energized upon delivery to Photosystem I!

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.879
So, PS I is a similar mix of proteins and
chlorophyll molecules that we saw in PSII,

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.699
but with some different products.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.030
After a couple of photons re-excite a couple
of electrons, the electrons pop off, and hitch

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.289
a ride onto another electron carrier.

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:33.199
This time, all of that energy will be used
to help make NADPH, which, like ATP, exists

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.060
solely to carry energy around.
Here, yet another enzyme

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.460
helps combine two electrons and one hydrogen
ion with a little something called NADP+.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.819
As you may recall from our recent talk about
respiration, there are these sort of

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.500
distant cousins of B vitamins that are crucial
to energy conversion. And in photosynthesis,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.479
it's NADP+, and when it
takes on those 2 electrons

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.139
and one hydrogen ion, it becomes NADPH.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:59.879
So, what we're left with now, after the
light dependent reactions is chemical energy

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.639
in the form of ATPs and NADPHs. And also of
course, we should not forget the most useful

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.009
useless byproduct in the history of
useless byproducts...oxygen.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:12.419
If anyone needs a potty break, now would be
a good time...or if you want to go re-watch

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.009
that rather long and complicated
bit about light

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:19.810
dependent reactions, go ahead and do that...it's
not simple, and it's not going to get any

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.849
simpler from here.

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.120
Because now we're moving along
to the Calvin Cycle!

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.539
The Calvin Cycle is sometimes called the dark
reactions, which is kind of a misnomer, because

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:33.040
they generally don't occur in the dark. They
occur in the day along with the rest of the

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.820
reactions, but they don't require energy
from photons. So it's more proper to say

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.930
light-independent. Or, if you're feeling
non-descriptive...just say Stage 2.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.920
Stage 2 is all about using the energy from
those ATPs and NADPHs that we created in

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.480
Stage 1 to produce something
actually useful for the plant.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.460
The Calvin Cycle begins in the stroma, the
empty space in the chloroplast, if you remember

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.720
correctly. And this phase is called carbon
fixation because...yeah, we're about to

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.100
fix a CO2 molecule onto our starting point,
Ribulose Bisphosphate or RuBP, which is always

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.950
around in the chloroplast because, not only
is it the starting point of the Calvin Cycle,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.180
it's also the end-point...
which is why it's a cycle.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:19.310
CO2 is fixed to RuBP with the help of an enzyme
called ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:26.310
oxidase, which we generally
shorten to RuBisCo.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.900
I'm in the chair again! Excellent!

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.400
This time for a Biolo-graphy of RuBisCo.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.380
Once upon a time, a one-celled organism was
like "Man, I need more carbon so I can make

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.700
more little me's so I can take over the
whole world."

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.400
Luckily for that little organism, there was
a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere, and so it

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.630
evolved an enzyme that could suck up that CO2 and convert inorganic carbon into organic carbon.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.880
This enzyme was called RuBisCo, and it wasn't
particularly good at its job, but it was a

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.900
heck of a lot better than just hoping to run
into some chemically formed organic carbon,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.810
so the organism just made a ton of it to make
up for how bad it was.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.430
Not only did the little plant stick with it,
it took over the entire planet, rapidly becoming

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.050
the dominant form of life.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.210
Slowly, through other reactions, known as
the light dependent reactions, plants increased

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.260
the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. RuBisCo, having been designed in a world with

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.870
tiny amounts of oxygen in the
atmosphere, started getting confused.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.800
As often as half the time RuBisCo started
slicing Ribulose Bisphosphate with Oxygen

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.450
instead of CO2, creating a toxic byproduct
that plants then had to deal with in creative

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.670
and specialized ways.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.000
This byproduct, called phosphogycolate, is
believed to tinker with some enzyme functions,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.450
including some involved in the Calvin cycle,
so plants have to make other enzymes that

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.280
break it down into an amino acid (glycine),
and some compounds that are actually useful

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.240
to the Calvin cycle.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.670
But plants had already sort of gone all-in
on the RuBisCo strategy and, to this day,

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.150
they have to produce huge amounts of it (scientists estimate that at any given time there

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.970
are about 40 billion tons of RuBisCo on the planet) and plants just deal with that toxic byproduct.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.090
Another example, my friends, of unintelligent
design.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.100
Back to the cycle!

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.110
So Ribulose Bisphosphate gets a CO2 slammed
onto it and then immediately the whole thing

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.670
gets crazy unstable. The only way to regain
stability is for this new six-carbon chain

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:26.020
to break apart creating two molecules of
3-Phosphoglycerate, and these are
the first stable products of the calvin cycle.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.780
For reasons that will become clear in a moment,
we're actually going to do this to three

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.440
molecules of RuBP.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.170
Now we enter the second phase,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.610
Reduction.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.710
Here, we need some energy. So some ATP slams
a phosphate group onto the 3-Phosphoglycerate,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:45.050
and then NADPH pops some electrons on and,
voila, we have two molecules of Glyceraldehyde

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.200
3-Phosphate, or G3P, this is a high-energy,
3-carbon compound that plants can convert

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.700
into pretty much any carbohydrate. Like glucose

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.190
for short term energy storage, cellulose for
structure, starch for long-term storage.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.960
And because of this, G3P is considered the
ultimate product of photosynthesis.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.810
However, unfortunately, this is not the end.
We need 5 G3Ps to regenerate the 3 RuBPs that

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:15.690
we started with. We also need 9 molecules
of ATP and 6 molecules of NADPH, so with all

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.710
of these chemical reactions, all of this chemical
energy,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:24.110
we can convert 3 RuBPs into 6 G3Ps but only
one of those G3Ps gets to leave the cycle,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.550
the other G3Ps, of course, being needed to
regenerate the original 3 Ribulose Bisphosphates.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.860
That regeneration is the last phase of the
Calvin Cycle.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.040
And that is how plants turn sunlight, water,
and carbon dioxide into every living thing

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.480
you've ever talked to, played with, climbed
on, loved, hated, or eaten. Not bad, plants.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.390
I hope you understand. If you don't, not only
do we have some selected references below

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:54.110
that you can check out, but of course, you
can go re-watch anything that you didn't get

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.510
and hopefully, upon review, it will make a
little bit more sense.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.970
Thank you for watching. If you have questions,
