undergraduate Capstone's and so on and
 

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.000
undergraduate Capstone's and so on and
so we needed to confront the question of

so we needed to confront the question of
 

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.290
so we needed to confront the question of
what kinds of librarians we would need a

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:20.300
what kinds of librarians we would need a

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:25.460
research and teaching and we realized
 

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.630
research and teaching and we realized
that new hires could explicitly be

that new hires could explicitly be
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.560
that new hires could explicitly be

our closest to that event in terms of
 

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.580
our closest to that event in terms of
their function within the library so

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:52.590
their function within the library so
 

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.800
their function within the library so
what we found just as an aside we're

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:55.810
what we found just as an aside we're
 

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.140
what we found just as an aside we're
doing a major assessment project which

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:58.150
doing a major assessment project which
 

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.010
doing a major assessment project which
I'll mention later but out of that we've

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.020
I'll mention later but out of that we've
 

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.410
I'll mention later but out of that we've
discovered that the kinds of activities

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.420
discovered that the kinds of activities
 

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.300
discovered that the kinds of activities
we anticipated having happen in their

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:06.310
we anticipated having happen in their
 

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.340
we anticipated having happen in their
collaborative research projects and so

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:08.350
collaborative research projects and so
 

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.650
collaborative research projects and so
on actually happened when there aren't

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:10.660
on actually happened when there aren't
 

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.510
on actually happened when there aren't
very many people there which means they

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520
very many people there which means they
 

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.030
very many people there which means they
happen after five o'clock at night and

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:15.040
happen after five o'clock at night and
 

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.180
happen after five o'clock at night and
they happen on the weekends so we

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.190
they happen on the weekends so we
 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.100
they happen on the weekends so we
actually weren't aware of those trends

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:20.110
actually weren't aware of those trends
 

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.170
actually weren't aware of those trends
until we started doing some assessment

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:22.180
until we started doing some assessment
 

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.350
until we started doing some assessment
over space and now we're starting to do

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360
over space and now we're starting to do
 

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.120
over space and now we're starting to do
things differently like offering instead

really enriched our activities for all
 

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.060
really enriched our activities for all
of us in the department and

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.070
of us in the department and
 

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.799
of us in the department and
incorporating these two new roles in our

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:23.809
incorporating these two new roles in our
 

00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:26.240
incorporating these two new roles in our
department has prompted a change in the

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:26.250
department has prompted a change in the
 

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.700
department has prompted a change in the
culture and I think that cultural

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:28.710
culture and I think that cultural
 

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.620
culture and I think that cultural
influence is spreading beyond the

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:30.630
influence is spreading beyond the
 

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.570

of the of the library and that's from a
 

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.690
of the of the library and that's from a
culture of perfectionism to a culture of

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700
culture of perfectionism to a culture of
 

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.500

implementation that's been really
 

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.170

important because we're having to try

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:45.180
important because we're having to try
 

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.480

out so much and we're having to find out

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:47.490
out so much and we're having to find out
 

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.750
out so much and we're having to find out
where we fail and what that signals what

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760
where we fail and what that signals what
 

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.160
where we fail and what that signals what
kind of learning can come out of that

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.170
kind of learning can come out of that
 

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.220
kind of learning can come out of that
failure and this is really important

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:55.230
failure and this is really important
 

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.530

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:06.230
fits into a very particular
 

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:10.250
fits into a very particular
institutional culture of MIT and share

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260
institutional culture of MIT and share
 

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.780

with you the timeline about how long

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:11.790
with you the timeline about how long
 

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.510
with you the timeline about how long
such a thing took us and may take other

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520
such a thing took us and may take other
 

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.340
such a thing took us and may take other
institutions longer or shorter I don't

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.350
institutions longer or shorter I don't
 

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.860
institutions longer or shorter I don't
know and then specifically how we

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:18.870
know and then specifically how we
 

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.240
know and then specifically how we
changed and I'll give a glimpse into how

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.250
changed and I'll give a glimpse into how
 

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.940
changed and I'll give a glimpse into how
the thought about the liaison librarian

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:23.950
the thought about the liaison librarian
 

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.800
the thought about the liaison librarian
role since I know that one the best of

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:25.810
role since I know that one the best of
 

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.320
role since I know that one the best of
all and then where we stand today and

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:28.330
all and then where we stand today and
 

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.490
all and then where we stand today and
how some of the changes play out okay so

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:32.500
how some of the changes play out okay so
 

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.590
how some of the changes play out okay so
a little bit of context about MIT

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600
a little bit of context about MIT
 

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.330
a little bit of context about MIT
because that is a big factor in the

how work gets done and the way people

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:22.410
how work gets done and the way people
 

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.580
how work gets done and the way people
work together in fact the work is

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:25.590
work together in fact the work is
 

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.010
work together in fact the work is
incredibly multi-discipline

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:27.020
incredibly multi-discipline
 

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.790
incredibly multi-discipline
right and overlapping and it organizing

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800
right and overlapping and it organizing
 

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.890
right and overlapping and it organizing
by school made no sense and we could see

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:32.900
by school made no sense and we could see
 

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.790
by school made no sense and we could see
that in our use patterns so we could

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800
that in our use patterns so we could
 

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.920
that in our use patterns so we could
tell from survey and collections use

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:38.930
tell from survey and collections use
 

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.040
tell from survey and collections use
patterns that in fact many people use

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.050
patterns that in fact many people use
 

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.900
patterns that in fact many people use
many libraries because the materials

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:43.910
many libraries because the materials
 

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.490
many libraries because the materials
they needed standing span many

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:45.500
they needed standing span many
 

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.020
they needed standing span many
disciplines and you know we had we knew

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:50.030
disciplines and you know we had we knew
 

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.480
disciplines and you know we had we knew
from our survey that sixty-five percent

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:52.490
from our survey that sixty-five percent
 

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.820
from our survey that sixty-five percent
visited two or more libraries and even

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:54.830
visited two or more libraries and even
 

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.700
visited two or more libraries and even
forty percent visit three or more and

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.710
forty percent visit three or more and
 

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.500
forty percent visit three or more and
that it's our survey told us

00:35:59.500 --> 00:35:59.510
that it's our survey told us
 

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.040
that it's our survey told us
eighty-eight percent of our users access

information from outside the library I
 

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.710
information from outside the library I
would argue that was a hundred percent

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720
would argue that was a hundred percent
 

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.290
would argue that was a hundred percent
and they can say no those twelve percent

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:08.300
and they can say no those twelve percent
 

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.520
and they can say no those twelve percent
just didn't know they were using the

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.530
just didn't know they were using the
 

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.460
just didn't know they were using the
library resources so we had that

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:12.470
library resources so we had that
 

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.370
library resources so we had that
catalyst for change also it's true in so

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.380
catalyst for change also it's true in so
 

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.620
catalyst for change also it's true in so
many places this is the change our our

this this was quite helped by budget

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:27.590
this this was quite helped by budget
 

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.250
this this was quite helped by budget
cuts let me tell you but that will

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:30.260

prefer electronic materials and we
 

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.190

preference is for different kinds of
 

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.240
preference is for different kinds of
materials so we can focus our

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.250
materials so we can focus our
 

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:57.580

with space mapping we use GIS software
to map where the use of our libraries

were my keeper and what they were doing
 

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.960
were my keeper and what they were doing
in those spaces and it was a lot of

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:50.970
in those spaces and it was a lot of
 

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.760
in those spaces and it was a lot of
great research but we know that the

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:52.770
great research but we know that the
 

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.110
great research but we know that the
spaces were important and they are

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:54.120
spaces were important and they are
 

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.870
spaces were important and they are
highly used and our surveys support that

highly used and our surveys support that
 

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.850
highly used and our surveys support that
by showing you know sixty-four percent

of the people who responded do use our
spaces at least weekly but we knew that

the the space what we offer in our space

the the space what we offer in our space
is actually doesn't match with what's

is actually doesn't match with what's
 

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.150
is actually doesn't match with what's
needed so we have some work to do and we

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160
needed so we have some work to do and we
 

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.450
needed so we have some work to do and we
needed our organization to sip like that

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:13.460
needed our organization to sip like that
 

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.340

so sadly at the same time as we were

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:16.350
so sadly at the same time as we were
 

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:17.870
so sadly at the same time as we were
getting ready to do this whole system

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880
getting ready to do this whole system
 

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.400

reorg we hit 2008 and the financial

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:22.410
reorg we hit 2008 and the financial
 

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.740
reorg we hit 2008 and the financial
crisis came upon us and we were facing a

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:26.750
crisis came upon us and we were facing a
 

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.420
crisis came upon us and we were facing a
15-percent budget reduction over to the

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.430
15-percent budget reduction over to the
 

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.230
15-percent budget reduction over to the
next two fiscal years which was both a

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240
next two fiscal years which was both a
 

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.510
next two fiscal years which was both a
blessing and a curse is a blessing in

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520
blessing and a curse is a blessing in
 

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.790
blessing and a curse is a blessing in
the fact that we were already in the

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800
the fact that we were already in the
 

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.500
the fact that we were already in the
process of reorganization so we were

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:39.510
process of reorganization so we were
 

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.240
process of reorganization so we were
already being very thoughtful about how

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.250
already being very thoughtful about how
 

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.210
already being very thoughtful about how
we wanted to spend our how we wanted to

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220
we wanted to spend our how we wanted to
 

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.160
we wanted to spend our how we wanted to
use our staff resources and collections

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.170
use our staff resources and collections
 

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:49.910
use our staff resources and collections
resources and it was a curse and that

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920
resources and it was a curse and that
 

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.610
resources and it was a curse and that
forevermore the reorganization and the

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:52.620
forevermore the reorganization and the
 

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.920
forevermore the reorganization and the
budget cuts were completed in people's

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:54.930
budget cuts were completed in people's
 

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.800
budget cuts were completed in people's
mind so there's a lot of recovery you

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:57.810
mind so there's a lot of recovery you
 

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.730
mind so there's a lot of recovery you
have to do with that because

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740
have to do with that because
 

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.890
have to do with that because
reorganization is painful even though I

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900
reorganization is painful even though I
 

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.140
reorganization is painful even though I
feel very positive about it it's a

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.150
feel very positive about it it's a
 

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.670
feel very positive about it it's a
painful process for many people because

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680
painful process for many people because
 

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.570
painful process for many people because
it's a wholesale change for everybody so

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:07.580
it's a wholesale change for everybody so
 

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.940
it's a wholesale change for everybody so
the process the timeline be followed is

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:10.950
the process the timeline be followed is
 

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.010
the process the timeline be followed is
that in 2008 we started the process

that in 2008 we started the process
 

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.650
that in 2008 we started the process
right before you know everything kind of

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660
right before you know everything kind of

blew up in the fall and and we started
 

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.610
blew up in the fall and and we started
the strategic planning process with the

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:22.620
the strategic planning process with the
 

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.620
the strategic planning process with the
intention of starting a new plan with a

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:24.630
intention of starting a new plan with a
 

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.820
intention of starting a new plan with a
reorganized system so the creating the

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:28.830
reorganized system so the creating the
 

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.170
reorganized system so the creating the
plan helped us create the new

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180
plan helped us create the new
 

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.800

awful year we started into the changes

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:22.530
awful year we started into the changes

we really wanted to see and we created

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:24.630
we really wanted to see and we created
 

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:25.940
we really wanted to see and we created
some new departments and of course I'm

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:25.950
some new departments and of course I'm
 

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.250
some new departments and of course I'm
starting with my own the liaisons for

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260
starting with my own the liaisons for
 

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.660
starting with my own the liaisons for
departments labs and centers where we

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:29.670
departments labs and centers where we
 

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.310
departments labs and centers where we
brought together all the subject

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320
brought together all the subject
 

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.320
brought together all the subject
specialists into a single department and

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:36.330
specialists into a single department and
 

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.270
specialists into a single department and
i'll talk about them specifically more

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280
i'll talk about them specifically more
 

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.940
i'll talk about them specifically more
specifically later we also created two

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:40.950
specifically later we also created two
 

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.070
specifically later we also created two
departments that support the work of

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:43.080
departments that support the work of
 

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.050
departments that support the work of
liaisons so we have one per instruction

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060
liaisons so we have one per instruction
 

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.000
liaisons so we have one per instruction
and reference services and one for

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.010
and reference services and one for
 

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.500
and reference services and one for
collection strategy and management and

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:48.510
collection strategy and management and
 

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.270
collection strategy and management and
their small departments and their

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280
their small departments and their
 

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.109
their small departments and their
purpose is to create policy and practice

00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119
purpose is to create policy and practice
 

00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:56.300
purpose is to create policy and practice
around those activities and to support

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:56.310
around those activities and to support
 

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.070
around those activities and to support
the liaison librarians and carrying them

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:58.080
the liaison librarians and carrying them
 

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.580
the liaison librarians and carrying them
out so the instruction and reference

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:01.590
out so the instruction and reference
 

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.020
out so the instruction and reference
services group came up with an

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.030
services group came up with an
 

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.330
services group came up with an
instruction plan and then we're working

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:05.340
instruction plan and then we're working
 

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.130
instruction plan and then we're working
together to implement that plan so that

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140
together to implement that plan so that
 

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.140
together to implement that plan so that
we have a common framework from which

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:09.150
we have a common framework from which
 

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.960
we have a common framework from which
liaisons can then individually you know

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:11.970
liaisons can then individually you know
 

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.520

liaisons and how we've been changing it
over time and I would say our old way of

00:46:31.299 --> 00:46:31.309
over time and I would say our old way of
 

00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:33.759
over time and I would say our old way of
thinking about liaisons I think of it as

00:46:33.759 --> 00:46:33.769
thinking about liaisons I think of it as
 

00:46:33.769 --> 00:46:37.089

was a quite a wide range and different

00:47:09.519 --> 00:47:09.529
was a quite a wide range and different
 

00:47:09.529 --> 00:47:10.749

the traditional reference and
 

00:47:17.779 --> 00:47:21.130
the traditional reference and
instruction so we changed the model to

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:21.140
instruction so we changed the model to
 

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.799
instruction so we changed the model to
be much more networked collaborative

administrations and we broke that apart

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:02.309
administrations and we broke that apart
 

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:05.720
administrations and we broke that apart
really and we only have the same

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:05.730
really and we only have the same

so at this point we need to figure out

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:15.630
so at this point we need to figure out
 

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:18.140
so at this point we need to figure out
how to build that in more appropriately

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.150
how to build that in more appropriately
 

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.309
how to build that in more appropriately
and and and get back to some of that

hard to know exactly where the breakdown
happens there and there could be a lot

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:05.940
happens there and there could be a lot
 

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.729

they really didn't program and we asked

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:08.320
they really didn't program and we asked
 

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.780
they really didn't program and we asked
each liaison to think about their

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:09.790
each liaison to think about their
 

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:13.260
each liaison to think about their
program and doing the self-evaluation

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:13.270
program and doing the self-evaluation
 

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:15.030
program and doing the self-evaluation
really of where they thought their

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:15.040

brought them together and created some
 

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:33.570
brought them together and created some
help for them to do that we had a Chris

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:33.580
help for them to do that we had a Chris
 

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.820

department retreat soon after I became
the head and we did a lot of the reorg

01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:39.369
the head and we did a lot of the reorg
 

01:02:39.369 --> 01:02:43.290
the head and we did a lot of the reorg
work together to figure out we already

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:43.300
work together to figure out we already
 

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.839
work together to figure out we already
had been given a new leadership model

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:45.849
had been given a new leadership model
 

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.839

before we had had one unit head with

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:48.849
before we had had one unit head with
 

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.940

everybody in the department reporting

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:50.950
everybody in the department reporting
 

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:53.430
everybody in the department reporting
directly to the head and then we created

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440
directly to the head and then we created
 

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.060
directly to the head and then we created
a team structure within so in the course

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.070
a team structure within so in the course
 

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:59.609
a team structure within so in the course
of the retreat we talked a lot about who

01:02:59.609 --> 01:02:59.619
of the retreat we talked a lot about who
 

01:02:59.619 --> 01:03:02.460
of the retreat we talked a lot about who
had expertise in what areas and and how

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:02.470
had expertise in what areas and and how
 

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:03.960
had expertise in what areas and and how
could we work together to kind of

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:03.970
could we work together to kind of
 

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.849
could we work together to kind of
maximize what we were able to accomplish

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:05.859
maximize what we were able to accomplish
 

01:03:05.859 --> 01:03:08.910
maximize what we were able to accomplish
together but then bringing in new

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920

librarians we tried to come up with
 

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.839
librarians we tried to come up with
training series orientations but also

01:03:18.839 --> 01:03:18.849
training series orientations but also
 

01:03:18.849 --> 01:03:21.480

both talked quite a bit about big change

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:03.510
both talked quite a bit about big change
 

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.600
both talked quite a bit about big change
but you each also mentioned incremental

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:05.610
but you each also mentioned incremental
 

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:07.280
but you each also mentioned incremental
change and so is wondering if you could

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:07.290
change and so is wondering if you could
 

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.440
change and so is wondering if you could
talk a bit more about how you're

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:09.450
talk a bit more about how you're
 

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:11.090
talk a bit more about how you're
approaching incremental change what kind

01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:11.100
approaching incremental change what kind
 

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.280
approaching incremental change what kind
of support you're getting from above and

from below to do incremental change and
 

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.850
from below to do incremental change and
sort of where that's going and how your

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:29.030
sis systematically approaching
incremental change well um we're trying

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040
incremental change well um we're trying

research reference services on the desk
 

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.710
research reference services on the desk
we tried it out in the research Commons

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720
we tried it out in the research Commons
 

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.010
we tried it out in the research Commons
and you know tried sitting in one

01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020
and you know tried sitting in one
 

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.680

didn't have much uptake but we learned
 

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.790
didn't have much uptake but we learned
out of that um you know we could observe

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:19.800
out of that um you know we could observe
 

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.560
out of that um you know we could observe
while we were sitting there we could

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.700
do maybe you actually don't need to be
here maybe what you need is the

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:31.710
here maybe what you need is the
 

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.280
here maybe what you need is the
librarian who's sitting at the desk over

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:34.290
librarian who's sitting at the desk over
 

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:36.890
librarian who's sitting at the desk over
there or or you need me right now so we

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900
there or or you need me right now so we
 

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.200
there or or you need me right now so we
did learn a lot in that process so we've

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:39.210
did learn a lot in that process so we've
 

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:41.870
did learn a lot in that process so we've
been trying to encourage that I guess my

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880
been trying to encourage that I guess my
 

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.280
been trying to encourage that I guess my
role is the unit head has

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:43.290
role is the unit head has
 

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.770
role is the unit head has
to really get people to try things out

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780
to really get people to try things out
 

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.380
to really get people to try things out
and there's been a lot of fear of I

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:48.390
and there's been a lot of fear of I
 

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:51.560
and there's been a lot of fear of I
think in the past because of that

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:51.570
think in the past because of that
 

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:53.990
think in the past because of that
culture of perfectionism people had

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000
culture of perfectionism people had
 

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.280
culture of perfectionism people had
ideas but they didn't end up going

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:55.290
ideas but they didn't end up going
 

01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:57.590
ideas but they didn't end up going
anywhere and they got discouraged and

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:57.600
anywhere and they got discouraged and
 

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.720
anywhere and they got discouraged and
stopped and so I've been trying to

01:05:59.720 --> 01:05:59.730
stopped and so I've been trying to
 

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:01.730
stopped and so I've been trying to
foster more of that go ahead give it a

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740
foster more of that go ahead give it a
 

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.620
foster more of that go ahead give it a

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:06.630
try you know let's see what works mm et
 

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.770

the incremental change has been we've

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780
the incremental change has been we've
 

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.800
the incremental change has been we've
been encouraging staff to put forward

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:12.810
been encouraging staff to put forward
 

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:17.050
been encouraging staff to put forward
proposals and ideas that come to them

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:17.060
proposals and ideas that come to them
 

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.380
proposals and ideas that come to them
through various user interactions or

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:21.390
through various user interactions or
 

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:24.680
through various user interactions or
whatever and bring them to me or to

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:24.690
whatever and bring them to me or to
 

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:27.110
whatever and bring them to me or to
upper management and and see what

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:27.120
upper management and and see what
 

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.610
upper management and and see what
happens and actually there's been a lot

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:28.620
happens and actually there's been a lot
 

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.860
happens and actually there's been a lot
of success with moving proposals through

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:30.870
of success with moving proposals through
 

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:35.420
of success with moving proposals through
to completion the other way is you know

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:35.430
to completion the other way is you know
 

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:37.790
to completion the other way is you know
anytime there's a vacancy is another way

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:37.800
anytime there's a vacancy is another way
 

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.120
anytime there's a vacancy is another way
that we're content the department head

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:41.130
that we're content the department head
 

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.630
that we're content the department head
level for sure but any vacant position

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640
level for sure but any vacant position
 

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.580
level for sure but any vacant position
and enables us to think differently

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:46.590
and enables us to think differently
 

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.860
and enables us to think differently
about how we accomplish various things

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:48.870
about how we accomplish various things
 

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:51.230
about how we accomplish various things
and to implement change at that time and

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240
and to implement change at that time and
 

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.530
and to implement change at that time and
there is regular attrition so um we have

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:54.540
there is regular attrition so um we have
 

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.480
there is regular attrition so um we have
ample opportunity to do that and one

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:56.490
ample opportunity to do that and one
 

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.100
ample opportunity to do that and one
other thing that I didn't mention looks

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:58.110
other thing that I didn't mention looks
 

01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.600
other thing that I didn't mention looks
like families trying to cut a sock see

01:06:59.600 --> 01:06:59.610
like families trying to cut a sock see
 

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:03.050
like families trying to cut a sock see
um is we're trying to also focus a lot

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:03.060
um is we're trying to also focus a lot
 

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.300
um is we're trying to also focus a lot
more on community building rather than

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:05.310
more on community building rather than
 

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.060
more on community building rather than
at building an individual's expertise so

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:08.070
at building an individual's expertise so
 

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:11.720
at building an individual's expertise so
we hired a librarian who also came from

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:11.730
we hired a librarian who also came from
 

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:14.780
we hired a librarian who also came from
a faculty position into a subject

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:14.790
a faculty position into a subject
 

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:16.400
a faculty position into a subject
specialist position and she's an

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:16.410
specialist position and she's an
 

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.380

award-winning teacher and so we put her
 

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.320
award-winning teacher and so we put her
to work offering pedagogy workshops a

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:21.330
to work offering pedagogy workshops a
 

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:23.870
to work offering pedagogy workshops a
stage series of pedagogy workshops

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880
stage series of pedagogy workshops
 

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.080
stage series of pedagogy workshops
designed for librarians that could

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.090
designed for librarians that could
 

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.460
designed for librarians that could
really get us to think about what's your

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:28.470
really get us to think about what's your
 

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.410
really get us to think about what's your
teaching philosophy how you identify

01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420
teaching philosophy how you identify
 

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.930
teaching philosophy how you identify
learning outcomes how do you know if

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940
learning outcomes how do you know if
 

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.480
learning outcomes how do you know if
you've actually achieved those learning

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:35.490
you've actually achieved those learning
 

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:38.030
you've actually achieved those learning
outcomes in the course of a class and so

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:38.040
outcomes in the course of a class and so
 

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.710
outcomes in the course of a class and so
on and that's been really new and

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720
on and that's been really new and
 

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.040
on and that's been really new and
building a lot of community around these

building a lot of community around these
 

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:46.370
building a lot of community around these
things yeah we had one question down

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380
things yeah we had one question down
 

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:49.580
things yeah we had one question down
front here so I was I knew Zoe borovsky

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:49.590
front here so I was I knew Zoe borovsky
 

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:50.840
front here so I was I knew Zoe borovsky
actually at the University of Oregon

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:50.850
actually at the University of Oregon
 

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:51.859
actually at the University of Oregon
when when

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:51.869
when when
 

01:07:51.869 --> 01:07:53.509
when when
we were both on the faculty there years

01:07:53.509 --> 01:07:53.519
we were both on the faculty there years
 

01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:54.890
we were both on the faculty there years
ago so it was very interesting to hear

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900
ago so it was very interesting to hear
 

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.019
ago so it was very interesting to hear
about the the I mean I remember when she

01:07:57.019 --> 01:07:57.029
about the the I mean I remember when she
 

01:07:57.029 --> 01:08:00.859

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:00.869
first left and this reminds me of is in
 

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.630
first left and this reminds me of is in
the humanities in general and also quite

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640
the humanities in general and also quite

specifically in history and in
 

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:06.470
specifically in history and in
literature there's a lot of attention in

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480
literature there's a lot of attention in
 

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.049
literature there's a lot of attention in
graduate education on thinking about how

01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:09.059
graduate education on thinking about how
 

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:11.509
graduate education on thinking about how
graduates with PhDs can go on to non

01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:11.519
graduates with PhDs can go on to non
 

01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:13.970
graduates with PhDs can go on to non
teaching positions not simply because oh

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980
teaching positions not simply because oh
 

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.980
teaching positions not simply because oh
there aren't enough jobs but actually

looking at as a half-full glass not a
 

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.240
looking at as a half-full glass not a
half-empty glass of thinking about the

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:20.250
half-empty glass of thinking about the

half-empty glass of thinking about the
wide range of careers that are that are

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380
wide range of careers that are that are
 

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.680
wide range of careers that are that are
actually accessible and appropriate for

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:24.690
actually accessible and appropriate for
 

01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:26.840
actually accessible and appropriate for
people with a PhD in the humanities so

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:26.850
people with a PhD in the humanities so
 

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.490
people with a PhD in the humanities so
what it makes me wonder about is since

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500
what it makes me wonder about is since
 

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.939
what it makes me wonder about is since
you just mentioned two different staff

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:30.949
you just mentioned two different staff
 

01:08:30.949 --> 01:08:34.579
you just mentioned two different staff
librarians who are now who have who do

01:08:34.579 --> 01:08:34.589
librarians who are now who have who do
 

01:08:34.589 --> 01:08:36.890
librarians who are now who have who do
not have MLS's do you see this then as a

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900
not have MLS's do you see this then as a
 

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.930
not have MLS's do you see this then as a
possible major development of the future

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940
possible major development of the future
 

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.249
possible major development of the future
do you see it as a sort of a temporary

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259
do you see it as a sort of a temporary
 

01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:41.689
do you see it as a sort of a temporary
anomaly because of the digital

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699
anomaly because of the digital
 

01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:44.570

the Academy or I mean have you did other
people on campus think about this kind

01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859
people on campus think about this kind
 

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.010
people on campus think about this kind
of general perspective that I'm

01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020
of general perspective that I'm
 

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.669
of general perspective that I'm
mentioning yeah I'm a third one I don't

01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679
mentioning yeah I'm a third one I don't
 

01:08:55.679 --> 01:08:57.740
mentioning yeah I'm a third one I don't
have an MLS myself I came in as a

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:57.750
have an MLS myself I came in as a
 

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:01.099
have an MLS myself I came in as a
postdoc and yeah we talk about this all

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:01.109
postdoc and yeah we talk about this all
 

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:03.740
postdoc and yeah we talk about this all
the time and and for me it's less about

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:03.750
the time and and for me it's less about
 

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:07.399
the time and and for me it's less about
the whether or not you have an MLS or or

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:07.409
the whether or not you have an MLS or or
 

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:10.370
the whether or not you have an MLS or or
oh I would rather not hire people with

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380
oh I would rather not hire people with
 

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.260
oh I would rather not hire people with
mlss I think that's the wrong way to

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:12.270
mlss I think that's the wrong way to
 

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:15.530
mlss I think that's the wrong way to
look at it it's more we're all better if

01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540
look at it it's more we're all better if
 

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.010
look at it it's more we're all better if
we have more variety and diversity of

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020
we have more variety and diversity of
 

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:23.149
we have more variety and diversity of
expertise and so you know for one

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159
expertise and so you know for one
 

01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:24.620
expertise and so you know for one
position it might be really attracted to

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:24.630
position it might be really attracted to
 

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:27.559
position it might be really attracted to
look for somebody who has a JD because

01:09:27.559 --> 01:09:27.569
look for somebody who has a JD because
 

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:30.950
look for somebody who has a JD because
we need legal expertise in in libraries

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960
we need legal expertise in in libraries
 

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.680
we need legal expertise in in libraries
now for another position it might be

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:33.690
now for another position it might be
 

01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:37.220
now for another position it might be
coming with an MBA because we also need

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:37.230
coming with an MBA because we also need
 

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:39.649
coming with an MBA because we also need
to really think about ourselves in the

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:39.659
to really think about ourselves in the
 

01:09:39.659 --> 01:09:41.300
to really think about ourselves in the
way we present ourselves and market

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:41.310
way we present ourselves and market
 

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.640
way we present ourselves and market
ourselves in ways that we're not strong

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:43.650
ourselves in ways that we're not strong
 

01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:46.399
ourselves in ways that we're not strong
in if we only hire people that have the

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:46.409
in if we only hire people that have the
 

01:09:46.409 --> 01:09:49.970
in if we only hire people that have the
same credentialing so so that's the way

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980
same credentialing so so that's the way
 

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.970
same credentialing so so that's the way
we've really approached it at UCLA so I

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980
we've really approached it at UCLA so I
 

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.830
we've really approached it at UCLA so I
would say then as you deal with the

01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840
would say then as you deal with the
 

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.540
would say then as you deal with the
graduate populations which of course are

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:56.550
graduate populations which of course are
 

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.360
graduate populations which of course are
at ample at UCLA that that thought might

01:09:59.360 --> 01:09:59.370
at ample at UCLA that that thought might
 

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:00.920
at ample at UCLA that that thought might
come across to them as

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:00.930
come across to them as
 

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.600
come across to them as
in their graduate education to keep on

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:02.610
in their graduate education to keep on
 

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:04.550
in their graduate education to keep on
horizon as one of the things that are

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560
horizon as one of the things that are
 

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.680
horizon as one of the things that are
open there better possible for them in

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:32.730
specialists that you know the library is
 

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:37.580
specialists that you know the library is
incredibly important because of the you

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:37.590
incredibly important because of the you
 

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:40.660
incredibly important because of the you
know the physical and tactile and

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:40.670
know the physical and tactile and
 

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:43.550
know the physical and tactile and

working with original materials whereas
 

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.900
working with original materials whereas
the two scientists had a kind of a

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:47.910
the two scientists had a kind of a
 

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.510
the two scientists had a kind of a
wistful attitude to torture to the

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520
wistful attitude to torture to the
 

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.220
wistful attitude to torture to the
library as something of the pass

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:52.230
library as something of the pass
 

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.630
library as something of the pass
something that was incredibly important

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640
something that was incredibly important
 

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.700
something that was incredibly important
to them as students and at least one of

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:55.710
to them as students and at least one of
 

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:57.470
to them as students and at least one of
them said well it's really important for

01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480
them said well it's really important for
 

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.820
them said well it's really important for
students or maybe someone else said that

01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:58.830
students or maybe someone else said that
 

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:02.630
students or maybe someone else said that
but you know kind of where are we going

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640
but you know kind of where are we going
 

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.970
but you know kind of where are we going
and think of some of the data-driven

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980
and think of some of the data-driven
 

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.890
and think of some of the data-driven
social scientists let's you know just to

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900
social scientists let's you know just to
 

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.740
social scientists let's you know just to
name one economists maybe they're going

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:09.750
name one economists maybe they're going
 

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.050
name one economists maybe they're going
to be more like the

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060
to be more like the
 

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.480
to be more like the
the scientists and maybe in a little

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:14.490
the scientists and maybe in a little
 

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.790
the scientists and maybe in a little
while almost all of the humanists will

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800
while almost all of the humanists will
 

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800
while almost all of the humanists will
will also be in that and I'll leave it

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:18.810
will also be in that and I'll leave it
 

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:23.360
will also be in that and I'll leave it
at that and throw it to you both I can I

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:23.370
at that and throw it to you both I can I
 

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:27.440
at that and throw it to you both I can I
can start um I one of the benefits of

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:27.450
can start um I one of the benefits of
 

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.720
can start um I one of the benefits of
having a department that brings together

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:29.730
having a department that brings together
 

01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:32.120
having a department that brings together
all the liaison librarians together is

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.130
all the liaison librarians together is
 

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.040
all the liaison librarians together is
that I get to see the kind of range of

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:34.050
that I get to see the kind of range of
 

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.340
that I get to see the kind of range of
needs that are in existence out there in

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:37.350
needs that are in existence out there in
 

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.160
needs that are in existence out there in
the community and like Roger pointed out

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:40.170
the community and like Roger pointed out
 

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:42.230
the community and like Roger pointed out
there's some common needs across very

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:42.240
there's some common needs across very
 

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.710
there's some common needs across very
disparate disciplines that they may

01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:45.720
disparate disciplines that they may
 

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.120
disparate disciplines that they may
manifest themselves a little different

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:47.130
manifest themselves a little different
 

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.480
manifest themselves a little different
but at the core there's some similar

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:49.490
but at the core there's some similar
 

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:56.180
but at the core there's some similar
needs so so we're reacting to some of

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:56.190
needs so so we're reacting to some of
 

01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:58.370
needs so so we're reacting to some of
that in a way like our research data

01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380
that in a way like our research data
 

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.930
that in a way like our research data
management services group now contains

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940
management services group now contains
 

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.790

not only the social science data

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800
not only the social science data

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.940
librarian who we've had for a long time
you have some science and engineering

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:10.950
you have some science and engineering
 

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.040
you have some science and engineering
librarians in there who are focusing on

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:13.050
librarians in there who are focusing on
 

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:15.290
librarians in there who are focusing on
data for part of their time we are now

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300
data for part of their time we are now
 

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.610
data for part of their time we are now
working on bringing in a digital

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620
working on bringing in a digital
 

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.720

different communities so I think there's

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:28.110
different communities so I think there's
 

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:30.650
different communities so I think there's
a variety of ways to think about it yeah

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:30.660
a variety of ways to think about it yeah
 

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:33.110
a variety of ways to think about it yeah
I guess I'll mention this North Campus

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120
I guess I'll mention this North Campus
 

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.850
I guess I'll mention this North Campus
research community study that we're

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860
research community study that we're
 

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.790
research community study that we're
doing North Campus being on on UCLA

sciences and one of the things that

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500
sciences and one of the things that
 

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.210
sciences and one of the things that
we're doing is interviewing faculty

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:49.220
we're doing is interviewing faculty
 

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.850
we're doing is interviewing faculty
individual faculty members and asking

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860
individual faculty members and asking
 

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.040
individual faculty members and asking
them how do you train your graduate

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:55.050
them how do you train your graduate
 

01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:57.320
them how do you train your graduate
students in your field to become you to

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:57.330
students in your field to become you to
 

01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:00.440
students in your field to become you to
hop like what do scholars in your field

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:00.450
hop like what do scholars in your field
 

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:03.200
hop like what do scholars in your field
need and what are you doing within your

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:03.210
need and what are you doing within your
 

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.840
need and what are you doing within your
own departments to train them and then

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:05.850
own departments to train them and then
 

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.090
own departments to train them and then
what role do you see the library having

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100
what role do you see the library having
 

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.000
what role do you see the library having
an asst but we always ask them how are

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:11.010
an asst but we always ask them how are
 

01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:13.040
an asst but we always ask them how are
you trained and how is that different

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:13.050
you trained and how is that different
 

01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:15.020
you trained and how is that different
than what your ski runs using and that

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:15.030
than what your ski runs using and that
 

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:16.220
than what your ski runs using and that
gives them enough

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:16.230
gives them enough
 

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:18.740
gives them enough
you need to reflect on well things were

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:18.750
you need to reflect on well things were
 

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.290
you need to reflect on well things were
so different but well now how I do my

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300
so different but well now how I do my
 

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.050
so different but well now how I do my
research is this or that or I actually

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060
research is this or that or I actually
 

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.350
research is this or that or I actually
wish that I had time to think about this

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360
wish that I had time to think about this
 

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.780
wish that I had time to think about this
or that so so that's been a really

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:29.790
or that so so that's been a really
 

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.580
or that so so that's been a really
productive conversation for us to have

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:31.590
productive conversation for us to have
 

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:33.680
productive conversation for us to have
and as you said different disciplines

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:33.690
and as you said different disciplines
 

01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:35.000
and as you said different disciplines
are going to have different answers to

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.010
are going to have different answers to
 

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:37.340
are going to have different answers to
that and so if anything is clear.its

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:37.350
that and so if anything is clear.its
 

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.479
that and so if anything is clear.its
that there's not a one-size-fits-all

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:38.489
that there's not a one-size-fits-all
 

01:14:38.489 --> 01:14:41.900
that there's not a one-size-fits-all
kind of way to do outreach so I think

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:41.910
kind of way to do outreach so I think
 

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.770
kind of way to do outreach so I think
it's very similar to what you're saying

01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:44.780
it's very similar to what you're saying
 

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.510
it's very similar to what you're saying
hi I just had a question about the

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520
hi I just had a question about the
 

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.750
hi I just had a question about the
proliferation of online universities

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760
proliferation of online universities
 

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.010
proliferation of online universities
that we were talking about this morning

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020
that we were talking about this morning
 

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.070
that we were talking about this morning
um I know that some of them have been

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080
um I know that some of them have been
 

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.170
um I know that some of them have been
considered like diploma mills and I was

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:57.180
considered like diploma mills and I was
 

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.120
considered like diploma mills and I was
wondering if employers are familiar with

01:14:59.120 --> 01:14:59.130
wondering if employers are familiar with
 

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:01.250
wondering if employers are familiar with
which online universities are less

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260
which online universities are less
 

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.470
which online universities are less
reputable and does it present a

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480
reputable and does it present a
 

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.600
reputable and does it present a
disadvantage or vonage for the workforce

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:05.610
disadvantage or vonage for the workforce
 

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.600

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860
university degree versus a more
 

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:18.700

traditional degree we can get a mic too

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:18.710
traditional degree we can get a mic too
 

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:23.750
traditional degree we can get a mic too
I don't know how to talk about the

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760
I don't know how to talk about the

I don't know how to talk about the
Pullman Mills so much because the online

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:26.070
Pullman Mills so much because the online
 

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:27.800

post-secondary education so I think I

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:35.730
post-secondary education so I think I
 

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:37.400
post-secondary education so I think I
think what's happening i think one of

we see over the past several years is a
 

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.140
we see over the past several years is a
new legitimacy for online education a

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:57.150
new legitimacy for online education a
 

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.610

01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620
matter of fact we've been delivering
 

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.650
matter of fact we've been delivering
online education for a long time even

going back as far as correspondence

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:02.250
going back as far as correspondence
 

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.380
going back as far as correspondence
courses we've been doing it at a

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:03.390
courses we've been doing it at a
 

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:05.810
courses we've been doing it at a
distance so I think the big ship is that

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:05.820
distance so I think the big ship is that
 

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.580
distance so I think the big ship is that
it's become more legitimate it's become

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:07.590
it's become more legitimate it's become
 

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:11.150
it's become more legitimate it's become
more seemly if you will to look down

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:11.160
more seemly if you will to look down
 

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.979
more seemly if you will to look down
these paths and see how can we actually

01:16:12.979 --> 01:16:12.989
these paths and see how can we actually
 

01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:15.140
these paths and see how can we actually

institution with the many graduate
 

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.930
institution with the many graduate
programs we have and so I wondered what

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940
programs we have and so I wondered what
 

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.530

obviously with undergraduate education
 

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:26.600
obviously with undergraduate education
and let's see with graduate education

and let's see with graduate education
 

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:31.700
and let's see with graduate education
itself but I think I one thing that we

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:31.710
itself but I think I one thing that we
 

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.320
