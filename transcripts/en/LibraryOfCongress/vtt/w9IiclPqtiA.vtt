&gt;&gt; BARD Express: Transferring
materials to cartridge

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.740
&gt;&gt; Judy: Hi, I'm Judy Dixon
Consumer Relations Officer at NLS.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.170
In this edition of the
BARD Express How-To Series,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.130
I'm going to cover
transferring audio materials

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.010
to a cartridge or other
storage device.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.740
From the BARD Express Main
Menu select bookshelf.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.340
You will be presented with a list
of the types of materials that are

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.250
on your computer that you
have downloaded from BARD.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.340
The contents of your bookshelf can
be sorted by Subject or Author.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.390
Note that the default organization
is by Type, in alphabetical order,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.250
followed by the number of titles
in each category: All Books

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.620
and Magazines, Audio
Books, Audio Magazines,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.420
Read items, and unread items.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.660
To sort your titles by subject,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.960
select Subject from
the drop down menu.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.200
All the titles on your
bookshelf will resort

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.210
by subject in alphabetical order.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.450
To sort by author, select
Author from the drop down menu.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.360
All your titles will resort

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.050
by author's last name
in alphabetical order.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.310
In this demonstration we will go
back to titles sorted by type.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.930
Select Unread items to access
the titles on your bookshelf

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.980
which you have not
transferred to a cartridge.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.300
Choose the title you wish to read

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.660
and select the Copy
to Cartridge button.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.130
A dialog box will open.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.330
Choose the drive letter
that your cartridge

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.390
or USB flash drive is connected
to, and select the Ok button.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.470
While the book is transferring,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.670
BARD Express is locating
the downloaded title,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.940
unzipping the file, and copying
the title to your cartridge.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.500
No more unzipping files, no more
lost books on your computer.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.640
BARD Express handles
all of this for you.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.740
When the transfer is complete,
BARD Express will ask you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.020
if you would like to
eject the drive.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.370
Just say Yes and simply disconnect
the cartridge from your computer,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.430
connect it to a digital
player, and enjoy your book!

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.200
