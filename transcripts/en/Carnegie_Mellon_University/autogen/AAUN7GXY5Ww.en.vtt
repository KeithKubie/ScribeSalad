of these sort of location check-ins may
be better visualized in a different way

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
be better visualized in a different way

maybe they should be on a map

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
maybe they should be on a map
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.570
maybe they should be on a map
that's going to be a better

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
that's going to be a better
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.190
that's going to be a better

this apply to all Twitter users you know

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910
this apply to all Twitter users you know
 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.550
this apply to all Twitter users you know
what different types of communities and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
what different types of communities and
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.199
what different types of communities and
use would exist and how do they value

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
use would exist and how do they value
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.660
use would exist and how do they value
and how do those values change we also

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
and how do those values change we also
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.330
and how do those values change we also
want to think about how end users could

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
want to think about how end users could
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.650
want to think about how end users could
use this information maybe we had a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
use this information maybe we had a
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.140
use this information maybe we had a
Twitter client that as people are

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
Twitter client that as people are
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.490
Twitter client that as people are
reading their tweets that liking and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
reading their tweets that liking and
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.080
reading their tweets that liking and
disliking stuff so how could we as

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
disliking stuff so how could we as
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.240
disliking stuff so how could we as
researchers use that but also how could

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
researchers use that but also how could
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.790
researchers use that but also how could
use as a you know Twitter user use that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
use as a you know Twitter user use that
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.700
use as a you know Twitter user use that
information as well
