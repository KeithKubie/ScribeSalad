00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.206
What questions do you have for students throughout the world?

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.104
Well, I happen to be a person

00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:08.278
that believes a lot in questions

00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:11.601
because I really feel that actually questioning

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:16.180
is all we can really use as teachers

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.191
and inspire questioning in students,

00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:21.854
in designers,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.095
in creative people,

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:27.543
in people that try to promote change

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:29.435
is really all we can do.

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:32.376
My best question to students around the world

00:00:32.376 --> 00:00:34.333
would really be,

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.477
"How do they inspire themselves

00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:38.647
to question everything around them

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:42.310
as a starting point for creative processes,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.312
for innovation,

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:49.586
for enabling to take their environment,

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:50.320
their world,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.470
their class,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.806
their surrounding

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.700
to the next step?"
