00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.599
Hey guys

00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.969
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop, you know that here at the King of Random we like weapons and we love weapons you can

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.250
build yourself but we especially love weapons that you can build yourself with supplies that you probably already have.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.799
The purpose of today's video is to learn how we can make some darts with stuff we might already have lying around the house

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:24.453
What we're going to use to build these darts today is some toothpicks a little bit of tape some large needles a ball of string and some post-it notes.

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:26.639
If you don't have any large needles you can try

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.660
substituting them for other types of straight pin or even a small nail if you cut the head off

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.119
to start let's grab four of our toothpicks.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.239
Next let's get a little bit of our tape, i'm using electrical tape and i like it because it's stretchy which makes it really bind

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.819
things together well if you've pulled it tight. You don't have to use electrical tape you should be able to just use masking tape or

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.689
duct tape let's take one of our toothpicks and stick it onto the end of our tape

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.600
we want the tape to be much closer to one end than the other leaving everything from about the middle of the toothpick down

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.108
Untaped with the toothpick stuck to the tape roll at once so the tape is going all the way around the toothpick at least once

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.439
once it's well wrapped in the tape let's take our other three toothpicks

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.869
bundle them right next to that first toothpick and then wrap the tape around all four together

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.649
we want to make sure we pull the tape really nice and tight around these toothpicks that will help them stay together a lot better

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.309
let's just set down our tape two toothpicks for a second and get some of our string what i'm using is just some basic cotton

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.500
string it's nice and strong and pretty lightweight

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.110
let's cut off a piece about a foot maybe a foot and a half long it doesn't really matter because i'm giving myself

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
extra that i'll end up cutting off later

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.250
now that we have our string let's place the end of the string

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.490
In the tape next to the toothpicks with our string attached to our tape we want to wrap it around the toothpicks one or two

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.519
More times to really secure it in place now let's cut off the tape

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.979
seal the edge down there we go we've got four toothpicks all well taped together

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.189
with a little over a foot of string taped into the bundle as well at this point let's grab our large needle and fit the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.129
wide end into the gap in the middle of the four toothpicks

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.989
press it in as far as you can get it to go without breaking the toothpicks

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.059
It should push down until the widest part of the needle is just starting to go into where the tape is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.180
with the needle in place now we need to start wrapping the string

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.459
around the ends of the toothpick we want to pull the string quite tight as it goes up the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.730
Toothpicks near the points it will pull them together and that will secure our needle in place so it can't pop out

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.690
you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.389
Can see that the four tips of the toothpicks have all started to taper inward and are resting up against the body of the needle

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.939
Once we reach the tip of the toothpicks let's wrap the string back down it doesn't have to be quite as tight

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.149
So i'm just going down much faster than a wind pop you can see that the string is a lot more spaced out

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.549
moving away from the point of the toothpicks

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.029
our string which is attached to the toothpicks by the tape in the middle is now wrapped around the tips of the toothpicks and then

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.309
back down around the string and the tape

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.589
We now want to take a little bit more tape and wrap it around the string once again to secure it all in place

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.349
This part of the string is extra so let's snip it off

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.320
Most of the body of our dart is now built but it needs some fins on the back to stabilize it as it flies through

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.849
the air to make our fins let's grab one post-it note fold the post-it note in half

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.119
so that one end meets up perfectly with the other end

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.139
Crease the paper and then unfold it we now want to fold it the exact same way in the opposite direction

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.739
our paper has now been folded lengthwise and widthwise

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.260
Although on a square piece of paper the length and width are the same thing so now what we want to do is flip our

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.399
paper over and fold it two more times but this time along the diagonal

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.320
And because it is opposed to note it's sticking, to itself a little bit but that's fine we just peel it apart

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.030
fold it the other direction

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.570
there we go our paper has now been folded four times which is giving us eight lines radiating from the center

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.470
what

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.209
We want to do is take the four concave folds and bring them down to meet each other in the center

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.300
we now have this nice pyramid shape made out of our folded paper

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.399
let's take the toothpicks and put one toothpick into each quadrant of our folded paper

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.949
at this point our dart should be ready to fly but these fins are a little big for my taste at this size they're going

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.410
to add a noticeable amount of drag which will limit how far our dart will fly so let's take them off trim the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.910
and put them back on to trim your fins just fold any two of them together

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.429
until you have a triangle now let's just cut off a strip of paper from the bottom of our triangle

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.029
Fins are smaller so we can put them back in between the toothpicks

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.830
there you have it just like that you have a dark that should fly nicely and stick right into your target

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.109
these little homemade darts should be able to fly a pretty good distance

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.640
i'm not a great shot i think we've already established that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.369
hmm not bad i got an eight beautiful

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.919
Nice attach a few balloons to a board and you have yourself a homemade carnival game

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:39.319
well

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.458
if that doesn't win me a prize nothing will these are full-size

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:46.479
balloons which i've only blown up halfway which means the very bottom of the balloon isn't

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:48.879
Stretched very much so i was actually able to puncture

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:50.659
The balloon

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.618
without it popping i'm just gonna leave that dart there for now

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.349
I don't know if anyone has ever pulled that off before in the history of darts and balloons oh?

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:07.779
No a very small hole in it now and it's just slowly eking out gasps a dead man walking

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.998
Ha now there is one more thing i want to try let's

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:17.919
See if this will work and yes i'm intentionally not saying what it is quite yet start the same way

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.449
or bundle together

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.009
let's give ourselves a little bit more string this time this is a little

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.148
Over two feet out guests tape that on the same way we did before

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360
make sure it's on there nice and tight

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:36.039
wide end of the needle goes in between the four toothpicks

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.838
press it down till it's really on there now we wrap our string make sure it's nice and tight

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:47.499
working our way up the toothpicks but this time instead of turning around once we get to the tip and just

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.289
Wrap it a little bit more out onto the needle

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.738
A fair amount for an eel covered

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:01.369
there go now quickly work my way back of tape hold that down again just

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.939
like before let's cut off our extra string

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.459
now, you can see that the body of this dart is a little bit different we've got string just wrapping all the way up to

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.450
near the tip of it one other little change let's take some metal tape and

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.230
wrap that around all but the very end of our wrap string

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.649
we don't need to keep wrapping after that so let's cut off the extra

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.239
let's reattach these fins just the same as they were before

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.660
Now quick test to see if this dart will still fly

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.610
it does

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.750
wonderful so now with our specialized dart we're going

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.750
To see if we can light it on fire?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:47.239
i've got this excessively large container of lighter fluid let's see if we can pour just a little bit of it onto the cotton wrap

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.240
tip of our dart oh

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.309
Okay well that's completely soaked and i only dripped about one drip down onto the table so i'm gonna call that pretty good

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.890
Now i have applied a piece of aluminum foil to our foam board and that's what i'm gonna try and hit so that if it

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:06.259
Does stay on fire all the way to the board it doesn't immediately try and catch the styrofoam on fire

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.220
Here goes nothing let's see if this will actually stay lit all the way to the board

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.429
You have a fire dart here goes oh?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.300
went out

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.319
it lit on fire that part was good try this one more time

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.490
it doesn't stay lit

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.199
All right basically my last idea is i tied a whole bunch more string on to the end of this so

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.700
this doesn't work

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.169
I'm giving up and won't even you'll never even see this

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:51.250
It worked it worked or dewart it's on fire still ha i'm just gonna blow it out

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.359
so don't just melt off boards probably melting behind it

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.169
fire dart ah fire dart was working it was on fire when i hit the board yes

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.900
behind a dot

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.080
fire dark fire dart ha ha ha

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.100
Sorry i have to blow it out really quick just because it's i'm

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:16.270
fairly certain it's just melting the foam behind the foil immediately practical applications that i can think of zero

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.900
entertainment factor i don't know what's the scale

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.060
99.5, is fantastic i'm doing it again fire dog to the rescue

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.650
not sure what you're rescuing with fire dart

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.720
fired are

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.720
out it's really warm

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.539
It heated up the metallic tape around it so it's now maybe a little too hot to hold but fire dart it worked

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.900
Ha ha ha ha

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.200
There you go that's how you can make some darts using supplies you might already have around the house and with a little bit of

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.789
modification you can also make yourself a fire dart which is a ton of fun although not very practical

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.359
