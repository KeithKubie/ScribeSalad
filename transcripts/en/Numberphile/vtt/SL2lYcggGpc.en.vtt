00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.410
Well Euclid had the straight edge and the compass that those are the tools that

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.420
he had available. He didn't have very
good paper. A completely different

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.880
approach that you can take to construction which is well it's much less classical and so it's less talked about

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.360
is to use folding paper, instead of a straight edge and a compass

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.480
Now, if you think about it, folding paper uses nothing.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.780
First of all, you can't ever do circles.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.420
You'll never be able to fold a circle onto a paper.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.800
So, all you have, ever, is straight lines.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.560
If you think about, is this stronger or weaker?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.420
than this set of tools that Euclid was using, then the intuitive answer

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.230
is that it must be weaker, but sometimes

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.899
the intuitive answer is not the right
answer. Let me just jump right in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.510
and show you how to trisect an angle by
folding paper. What i'd like you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.770
to realise is that essentially you
have a straight edge

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.469
because if you have two points that you
previously constructed somehow

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.950
then you can fold the paper so that those
two points are on the crease

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.299
this is exactly the same thing as
connecting them by a straight edge.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.869
Even better you can do perpendicular
bisector

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.189
in a single step because you can fold
the paper

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.430
so that these two points cover each other

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.220
and when you do that, that created crease

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.860
will be perpendicular to the line
segment connecting those points and it will

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.640
cut it exactly in half because they covered each other

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.079
so to trisect an angle first we have to create an angle. A right angle

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.259
is not very interesting You can trisect a
right angle with straight edge and compass

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.340
which is probably an important point
to make. It's not that there's no angle

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.880
whatsoever that you can trisect

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.729
it's that you can trisect an arbitrary angle
so ninety degrees you can trisect

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.989
because you can construct a thirty degree angle.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.400
So we want to create an
arbitrary angle

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.079
so that our job is not so easy

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.630
so I'll just fold the paper so that the bottom

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.300
of this crease is right at that corner

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.220
So this is the angle. We created it arbitrarily. We don't know how big it is.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.900
So I'll try to draw a line just inside the crease. Ok.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.410
Brady: you're gonna trisect that?
Zsuzsanna Dancso: I am going to trisect that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.600
First we fold the paper in half so I just
fold the bottom

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.220
up to the top so that they match exactly

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.480
then I fold the bottom up to the half

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.540
so now I have this crease at the
halfway

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.870
so now I have these two creases one
up here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.200
and one down here

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.100
Now, here's the trick. I'll mark two points

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.670
one is this bottom of the angle

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.030
Brady: Yep
ZD: the tip and the second one is this

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.080
point on the edge of the paper that's halfway up. I will fold

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.500
the paper so that this point at the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.230
tip of the angle lines up/matches

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.400
this line this crease that I created
before

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.709
and this point halfway up the paper

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.140
matches this line which is the angle
itself

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.280
so I'm going to fold it and fiddle it around

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.060
now once I've found that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.049
alignment, I'm going to put my hand down
and

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.530
crease the line

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.470
and then I take a pen and mark this point right where the tip got

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.790
okay open it up

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.910
and another important point to mark is
where this

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.860
crease that I just created with this last fold

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.600
where that intersects the bottom line

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.780
so you might already see where this is going
Brady: yes

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.239
ZD: I will fold to connect

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.370
the tip of the angle with this marked point

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.960
and then fold again to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.960
connect the tip of the angle with the other marked point

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.880
and magic ... 
Brady: that's it, is it?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.700
ZD: that's it. Since we are folding

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.370
we can check that, not prove it, but check it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.330
by folding the crease and see that it
matches up

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.190
folding this crease and see that it matches up for the three

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.450
so if you want to prove that ...
it's an exercise

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.450
it's doable if you remember your
congruent triangles

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.610
Brady: What power does origami have that

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.220
the straight edge and compass didn't have?
ZD: exactly

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.040
very good question.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.760
So the trick was this one step that I did which was

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.520
taking these two points and lining them up 
with two lines.

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.860
So if you allow that step which is

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.900
a reasonable step, I mean if I have a paper

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.910
it's very easy to do so the key

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.690
is that if you translate this step to
what it does to coordinates

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.130
the same way that I told you about it in
the context of straight edge and compass

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.130
what it does is this crease

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.350
that it creates is a shared

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.800
tangent of two parabolas, and to solve this

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.029
equation to find the shared tangent of two parabolas

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.669
you need to do something cubic. 
Brady: So that was the one thing that was beyond Euclid

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.370
ZD: That was the one thing that's beyond Euclid

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.719
and it turns out that with origami

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:34.339
phrased in terms of what are the constructible numbers what are all

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.939
the coordinates that we can construct we
can do

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.139
addition, subtraction, multiplication,
fractions

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.680
square roots, and cube roots.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.400
Brady: So, origami is more powerful than Euclidean geometry!
ZD: It's more powerful than Euclidean geometry.

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:53.620
even better if I give you any cubic equation

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.060
you can construct by origami the solution

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.349
so you could solve a cubic equation
which is

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.120
the formula is is really really

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.499
big and ugly and hard to plug into

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.500
and you can solve it just by a simple
folding mechanism and then measuring the solution

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.760
so I for example I showed you how to do
square root two, I showed you how to do three

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.300
I show you how to do one-third it turns
out that you can do

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.470
all numbers that just involve fractions
and square roots

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.510
and addition and subtraction but there's
a problem with cube roots

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.940
so what this guy proved is that

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.950
you will never be able to do cube roots
