00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
In all of the torque problems
I've done so far in the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.910
physics playlist, we only just
figured out the magnitude of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.610
torque, frankly because that's
what normally matters, but

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.500
torque is actually
a vector and it's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.380
direction can be found.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.160
And that is because torque is
defined as the cross product

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.330
between the radial distance from
your axis of rotation and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.370
the rotational force
being applied.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.810
So these are both vectors.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.350
So let's take a look at how I
taught you vectors the first

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.300
time, and then I'll show you
how that's really the same

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.860
thing as what we're doing here
with the cross product.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.570
Except now with the cross
product, besides just the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.590
magnitude for torque, we're also
getting the direction.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.850
But then we'll also see that
direction is a little bit--

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.080
it's just the definition of
the direction of torque.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.300
I don't know how intuitive
it really is.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.950
But what did I teach you
before about torque?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:02.410
Well, let's say I had some arm,
and let's say this could

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.269
be the hand of a clock or it's
pinned down to the wall there.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.690
So it would rotate around
this object.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.070
Let's say it's some distance,
r, from the pivot.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.350
Let's say that distance is 10.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.670
This is the same thing as r,
and the magnitude of r is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.870
equal to 10.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.290
At some distance 10 from the
pivot, I apply some force F,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.260
and F I will do in yellow.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.370
I apply some force F.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.190
Let me draw it straight.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.360
I apply some force
F at some angle.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.530
That's my force F.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.390
It's also a vector.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.610
It has magnitude
and direction.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.280
Let's say that this is 10
meters, and let's say that I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.120
apply a force of 7 newtons.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.669
Let me make it more
interesting.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.120
Let's say I apply a force of
square root of 3 newtons.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.840
And I just threw that out there
because I think the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.450
numbers will all work out.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.790
And let's say that the angle
between my force and the lever

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.550
arm, or the arm that's
rotating-- let's stick to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.720
radians this time.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.950
Let's say it's pi over 3, but if
you need to visualize that,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.480
that's 60 degrees.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.920
pi over 3 radians is
equal to theta.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.870
And so just based on what we
already know about moments or

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.120
torque, what is the torque
around this pivot?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.600
Or how much torque is being
applied by this force?

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.420
And when we learn torque or we
learn moments, we realize

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.180
really the only hard part about
these problems is that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.410
you don't just multiply the
entire rotational force times

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.910
the distance from the
axis of rotation.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.230
You have to multiply the
component of that force that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.660
is actually doing the rotation,
or the component of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.860
the force that is perpendicular
to this rotating

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.090
arm, or perpendicular
to this moment arm.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.260
So how do we figure that out?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.480
Well, the component of this
force that is perpendicular to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.465
this arm-- I can visually
draw it here.

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:24.850
Let's see, it would look
something like this.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.160
I could draw it there.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.150
I could also draw
it here, right?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.310
This would be the component, or
this would be the component

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.620
that is perpendicular to this
rotating arm, and the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.570
component that is parallel would
be this, but we don't

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.210
care about that.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.970
That's not contributing
to the rotation.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.350
The only thing that is
contributing to the rotation

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.890
is this component
of the force.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.880
And what is the magnitude of
this vector right here?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.200
The component of vector F that
is perpendicular to this arm.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.560
Well, if this angle--
let me draw a little

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.810
triangle down here.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.140
If this is square root of 3,
this is pi over 3 radians, or

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.770
60 degrees, and this is a right
angle, it's pi over 3.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.250
I know it's hard to read.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.740
What is this length
right here?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.970
Well, it's a 30-60-90 triangle,
and we know that

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.510
this length here-- I mean,
there's a couple of ways you

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.410
can think about it.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.420
Now that we know trigonometry,
we know that this is just the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.170
square root of 3 times the sine
of pi over 3, or the sine

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.020
of 60 degrees, and so that
equals the square root of 3.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.790
Sine of pi over 3, or sine
of 60 degrees, is square

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.820
root of 3 over 2.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.190
So the square root of 3 times
the square root of 3 is just

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.110
3, so that equals 3/2.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.190
So the magnitude of this force
vector that is perpendicular,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.660
the component that is
perpendicular to the arm, is

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.580
3/2 newtons, and now we can
figure out the magnitude of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.135
the torque.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.700
It's 3/2 newtons times
10 meters.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.970
So we know the magnitude of the
torque, and I'm being a

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.200
little bit more careful with
my notation right now to

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.680
remind you that torque actually
is a vector, or you

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.520
can almost view it as, they use
this term pseudovector,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.330
because it's kind of a-- well,
anyway, I won't go into that.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.060
So what is the magnitude
of the torque vector?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.930
Well, it's 3/2 newtons times the
distance, and remember, I

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.830
just drew this vector
here just to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.450
show you the component.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.400
I could just shift the vector
here because this is actually

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.550
where the force is
being applied.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.810
You could draw that same vector
here because you can

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.730
shift vectors around, so this is
also 3/2 newtons and maybe

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.950
that makes it a little
bit clearer.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.600
So it's 3/2 newtons times the
distance that you are from

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.960
your pivot arm, so times
10 meters, and so

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.770
that is equal to what?

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.590
15 newton meters.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.940
So the magnitude of the torque
is 15 newton meters.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.720
But all we did now-- and
hopefully this looks a little

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.180
bit familiar.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.530
This is what we learned when we
learned moments and torque,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.690
but all we did now is we figured
out the magnitude of

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.010
the torque.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.470
But what if we wanted to
know the direction?

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.300
And that's where the cross
product comes in.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.080
So what was the definition
of the cross product?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.610
Cross product: r cross F, that
is equal to magnitude of r

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.910
times the magnitude of F times
sine of the smallest angle

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.400
between them times some vector
that is perpendicular to both.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.070
And this is really where it's
going to help, because all of

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.660
these right here, these are all
scalar quantities, right?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.380
So these don't specify
the direction.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.990
The direction is completely
specified by this unit vector,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.420
and a unit vector is just a
vector of magnitude 1 that's

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.750
pointing in some direction.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.250
Well, look, this cross product,
this part of it, the

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.000
part that just gives us
magnitudes, we just calculated

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.200
that using what we knew
before of torques.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.730
The magnitude of our force
vector times sine of theta,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.110
that gave us the component of
the force vector that is

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.110
perpendicular to the arm.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.430
And we just multiply that times
the magnitude of r, and

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.110
we got the magnitude of the
torque vector, which was 15.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.960
We can leave out the newton
meters for now.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.910
15, and then its direction
is this vector that we

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.880
specified by n.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.500
We can call it the
normal vector.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.560
And what do we know
about this vector?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.590
It's perpendicular to both r--
this is r, right-- and it's

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.960
perpendicular to F.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.780
And the only way that I
can visualize in our

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.990
three-dimensional universe, a
vector that's perpendicular to

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.120
both this and this is
if it pops in or out

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.960
of this page, right?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.690
Because both of these vectors
are in the plane that are

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.650
defined by our video.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.320
So if I'm a vector that is
perpendicular to your screen,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.350
whatever you're watching this
on, then it's going to be

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.050
perpendicular to both
of these vectors.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.150
And how do we figure out if that
vector pops out or pops

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.240
into the page?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.035
We use the right hand
rule, right?

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:14.340
In the right hand rule, we
take-- r is our index finger,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.410
F is our middle finger, and
whichever direction our thumb

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:23.340
points in tells us whether or
not we are-- the direction of

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.980
the cross product.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.930
So let's draw it.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.350
Let me see if I can do a
good job right here.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:43.409
So if that is my index finger,
and you could imagine your

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.130
hand sitting on top
of this screen.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.160
So that's my index finger
representing r, and this is my

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.610
right hand.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.850
Remember, it only works
with your right hand.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.440
If you do your left hand, it's
going to be the opposite.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.220
And then my middle finger is
going to go in the direction

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.460
of F, and then the rest of my
fingers are-- and I encourage

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.570
you to draw this.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.300
So if I were to draw it-- let
me draw my nails just so you

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.200
know what this is.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.470
So this is the nail on
my index finger.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.470
This is the nail on
my middle finger.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.960
And so in this situation, where
is my thumb going to be?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.550
My thumb is going to
be popping out.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.380
I wish I could-- that's
the nail of my thumb.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.400
Hopefully, that makes
some sense, right?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.870
That's the palm of my hand.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.940
That's the other side of my--
and I could keep drawing, but

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.250
hopefully, that makes
some sense.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.220
This is my index finger.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.080
This is the middle finger.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.440
My thumb is pointing out of
the page, so that tells us

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.280
that the torque is actually
pointing out of the page.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.780
So the direction of this unit
vector n is going to be out of

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:49.080
the page, and we could signify
that by a circle with a dot.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.950
And I'm almost at my time limit,
and so there you have
