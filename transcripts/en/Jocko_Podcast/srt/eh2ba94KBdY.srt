1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,440
Trust only your own leaders trust them

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,080
and question everything.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,750
Be Wise. Question everything. Question
your leaders don't follow people blindly.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,280
You can put your trust in them. Sure.
But at the same time you have to be wise,

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,490
be wise to question them, be wise to
try and understand their decisions.

6
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:31,491
Be Wise enough to disobey them should
they choose to lead in a manner that is

7
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,500
detrimental to the mission and to
common sense. And you don't want,

8
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,490
you got to be why not just about
your leaders behind everything.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,190
Seek to understand people,

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,200
which you do by watching and by observing
them and by listening to then you know

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,760
we spend a lot of time on output.
We are sending all the time.

12
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,410
We are talking all the time. We are
putting information out all the time,

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,930
received mode a little bit more.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,470
I've learned to listen a little bit
more to learn to capture and absorb and

15
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,460
utilize what other people revealed.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,210
And when you do that and you garner a
better understanding of them, of yourself,

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,950
of your team, of your hand. To me,

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,850
the nature of the battle itself
and the nature of humans.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,960
So listen inward and understand so that
you can be calm wise if you become wise,

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,350
that you can win.
