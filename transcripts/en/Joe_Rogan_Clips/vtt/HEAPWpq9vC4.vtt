WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.530
The Joe Rogan experience.
We both been busy.
It's crazy.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.570
And in the meantime we'd became legal.
Yes,
you guys were at the forefront,
man,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.640
you guys were way ahead.
You were ahead of everybody.
You know,
we took a shot,

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.010
he took a shot,
you know,
it's donors and advocates and whatnot.
You know,

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
we were stoners it first.
Right.
You know,
that's how you start.
Like,
you know,

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.890
your friend says,
hey man,
try this.
Or you're the one who says try this.
Right?

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.680
It's one or the other.
And you know,

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.790
eventually you start getting into the high times magazines and stuff like that

9
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.790
and looking at the,
you know,
the centerfold pictures of the weed.

10
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:40.860
But also we like,

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360
we like to read too easily.
So,
you know,

12
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.660
we'd get into some of the activism aspect of it as well.

13
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.970
And that's when we heard names like Jack Herrera,

14
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.230
who pretty much opened our eyes to everything.
And then,
you know,

15
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.400
I think we became real advocates.
You know,
at first,
you know,
we thought we were,

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.980
you know,
sort of,
we read the high times magazines that we were stoners,

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.250
so we thought we were advocates,

18
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:09.960
but like in reading what other freedom fighters were actually doing out there

19
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.200
and protest and rallies and all that stuff.
You know,
we,

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.720
we really weren't advocates.
Like we thought we became that later for sure.
Yeah.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.780
Jack was way,
way,
way ahead of the curve.
He's in such an interesting story.
Uh,

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.570
rest in peace because he was a Goldwater Republican,
you know,

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.410
he was just a button down old school republican.

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
Then he got a girlfriend and then her girlfriend and got him smoking weed and

25
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.290
then all of a sudden he's like,
man,
this is fucking amazing.
God.

26
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:41.880
Why am I such a Dick?
What's wrong with me?
Who am I?
What am I doing in my life?

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.230
Absolutely.
It totally flipped his life around.
The emperor wears no clothes.

28
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.420
The fucking great book,
man.
Yeah,
it holds,

29
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.960
it holds strong to this day because everything that he said in the book is sort

30
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.350
of happening right now.
All the stuff that they,
you know,
they,
they,
uh,

31
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.380
tried to prevent from happening through all the anti cannabis propaganda.

32
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.380
Yeah.

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.940
You see it now and now you see those very companies tried to get into the

34
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.450
industry if they were always on the outside of the waiting,
you know,

35
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:13.500
there is only good at the launching block,
not quite ready to run,
but uh,

36
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.040
any minute now it's going to get legal.
Yeah,
exactly.
I mean,
you know,
they're,

37
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:22.041
they're lying in wait with fields like acreage that no one can ever come close

38
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.300
to probably.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean,

39
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.230
the thing I heard maybe like five years ago before it was legal in Denver or a

40
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
bit longer than that before we got legalization here,
um,
that,
you know,

41
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.350
companies like Philip Morris and you know,

42
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.550
companies like that we're already buying land in already.

43
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.820
I'm trademarking names,
you know,

44
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:52.680
for some of the cannabis that we know today so that when they come into the
game,

45
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.880
you know,

46
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.880
they have ownership on some of the names in some of the brands and trademarks

47
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.820
and stuff like that.
To that end,
obviously the acreage to,

48
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.310
you know,
grow vast sums of cannabis.
Yeah.
You know,

49
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.500
who knows how true that is,
but I don't doubt some of that.

50
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.220
I don't doubt it either.
As sneaky as shit was Ohio,
Ohio was,

51
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.940
they were trying to make it legal,
but if they were going to make it legal,

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.780
there was only like it was took two companies that were on Jamie's from Ohio,

53
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.230
think like four.
But I think that is how it went.

54
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.170
They were the only ones going to be allowed to grow it and sell it.
Like fuck,

55
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.500
fuck,
fuck you monopoly.
That is not legal weed.

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.450
That is you being a cunt.
That's monopoly.
Yeah.
And it's crazy,
you know?

57
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.830
Yeah.
Because you know,
you had like people that got those uh,

58
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.070
licenses or permits or whatever that had no knowledge on,

59
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.500
on,
on the cannabis culture or,
or business how to cultivate and,

60
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.000
and how to run retail stores or any of that.

61
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.460
They didn't have any of that knowledge.
And you know,

62
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.480
Dell usually give it to an insider because they know how much money they stand.

63
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.770
To me that's like if there was just one distribution center,
right,

64
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.880
and everybody has to go through that distribution center,

65
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.100
how much money does that distribution center make me?

66
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:13.780
Cause he got to pay for your shit to go there.
And then you know,
who knows if it,

67
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.890
well you know,

68
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.891
if it passes because you know as a cultivator what you did so you'll know it'll

69
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.280
pass cause it's clean,

70
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.540
but you still got to pay that fee every time and it's got to go through them.

71
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.510
Fortunately here in California,
you know,

72
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.440
they allowed people to have distribution licenses so that there's not one

73
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.700
distribution center because that would be a monopoly for sure.

74
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:41.020
And that's what they wanted to supposedly,
you know,
the lobbyists that,

75
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:42.640
that put 64 together,

76
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:46.180
we're trying to stop it from Vienna Monopolian uh,

77
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.900
corporations coming in and taking over and stuff like that.
You know,

78
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:50.711
so interesting.

79
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:55.711
Because pot is such a non corporate drug and it's such a non corporate thing

80
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.490
that these corporations were trying to get a grip on weed.
It just,

81
00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:05.290
it seemed,
it seemed obscene.
You know,
it seemed,

82
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.240
it seemed disgusting.
Yeah.
It's a little out of place,
you know,
a lot on a place.

83
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:12.600
Right.
You know,
because you,
you,

84
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.480
you think about where it comes from and it's been outlawed for so long.

85
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.170
It's kind of like,
you know,
the way out alcohol was for,
for so long,

86
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.660
but longer than alcohol,
but it's been demonized longer.
Yes.
And now,

87
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.340
you know,
you have people trying to come in and throw money into it and they got,

88
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:30.701
you know,

89
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:34.420
in some of these guys don't realize it's not just about the money into it.

90
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.090
You got to do the diligence on what this business is.

91
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.420
You can't cut corners on the cultivation,
you know,

92
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.070
you can't cut corners on quality because people,
you know,
they're,

93
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:49.750
they're,
um,
there's more information out there.
Yeah.

94
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.280
You know,
so people know,

95
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.620
even if they're not a connoisseur as a consumer,
you know,
they can,

96
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.210
they can read about shit,
they could learn about stuff.

97
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.690
So if you're getting over on a more,
if you're putting some shit,

98
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:07.000
quality product out there,
I mean people are going to know it.
And,

99
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:11.420
and all that money that these guys put into to try and get into the cannabis

100
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.970
business,
they're just throwing it into the fire.
Yeah.

101
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.240
Some of them will come out of it,
you know,
they'll partner up with,

102
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:21.860
brands did exist and people did have knowledge,
but you know,

103
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.690
it's,
it's the corporations that come in,
in the next five years.

104
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.680
It's gonna be,

105
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.130
it's gonna be interesting because I do think that it's set up for them to come

106
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.310
in.

107
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.240
The taxes are so high right now for the consumer and for the cultivator and for

108
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:43.241
the retail shop that you got to survive this wash right now that's happening in

109
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.640
order to still be,
you know,

110
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.510
doing business when the corporate structure comes in because please believe

111
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.511
they're gonna lobby so that those taxes come down because the margins are not

112
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.980
right.
You know,
as a 40% tax.
Is that what it is now?

113
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:05.190
It was 39 in Denver,
right?
Yeah.
But in here in California,
it's,
you know,

114
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.900
40% into the consumer,
the consumer's life.
Who gives a fuck?

115
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.710
If I could just pull in and get some weed,
row should give a fuck.

116
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.920
But in comparison to alcohol,
like how much it costs,

117
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.370
if you go out for a night for some drinks that causeway more,

118
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.740
you get high for a month.
Yeah.

119
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.000
And what it takes to get pretty much few drinks in a night.

120
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.690
It depending where you go,
those fucking drinks or even doubled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
