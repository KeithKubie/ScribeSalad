00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; Qi Qiu: Hi, good afternoon.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.440
So, before we begin today's
program I would like to ask you

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.080
to please take a moment
to check your cell phones

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.940
and other electronic devices
and set them to silent.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.390
Thank you.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.340
And for your reference,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.620
this afternoon's program is
being filmed for placement

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.870
on the Kluge Center website.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.720
As well as our YouTube
and ITunes channels.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.190
And today's lecture is
presented by the Asian Division

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.730
and the John W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.730
The Asian Division was
founded in 1928 as the division

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.570
of Chinese literature.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.940
So, this year actually
marks 90 years anniversary

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210
of the Asian Division.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.980
Even though it was
firstly named the Division

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.710
of Chinese Literature, it
had started collected Chinese

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.140
and Japanese materials
and received Mongolian

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.550
and Tibetan gifts as early
as the late 19th century.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.230
And from 1869 presentation of
933 volumes to the United States

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.820
by the Emperor of
China, the collections

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.040
of the Asian Division have
grown to represent one

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.070
of the most comprehensive
collection

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.650
of Asian language
materials in the world.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.170
Housed in the John Adams
building across the street,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.120
as well as off site locations.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.400
The collection of the division
include most subject fields

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.360
and covering an area ranging

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.910
from the south Asian
subcontinent

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.770
and Southeast Asia to East Asia.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.980
The John W. Kluge Center at
the Library of Congress exists

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.180
to help address the
challenges facing democracy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.430
in the 21st century
by bridging the gap

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.220
between scholarship
and policy makers.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.270
It does this by hosting
top thinkers from the world

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.380
to conduct research at the
Library's massive collections

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.830
and engage national leaders.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.040
So for more information
about the Kluge Center,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.750
please visit loc.gov/kluge.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.380
So on today's program
the program is titled,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.620
"Reading Lu Xun Through Carl
Jung: Psychological "Truth"

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.750
in Lu Xun's "The
True Story of Ah Q."

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.310
So, here is a cover
of the new book

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.040
that Dr. Carolyn Brown
has just newly published.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.780
Brown is a former director

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.330
of the Kluge Center
from 2006 to 2014.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.310
She held multiple positions
during her nearly 24 year career

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.460
at the Library, including
that of associate librarian

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.070
for cultural affairs, director
of area studies collections

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.110
and director of collections
and services.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.730
Prior to coming to the Library,
she served as the associate dean

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.080
for the humanities
at Howard University.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
She holds BA and MA
degrees in Asian studies

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.550
and Chinese literature
respectively

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.960
from Cornell University.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.110
And earned a PhD in literature
at American University.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.410
During her academic career she
published in several journals,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.940
including "Clear and
Modern Chinese Literature

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.480
and edited Psycho-sinology:
The Universe

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.380
of Dreams in Chinese Culture."

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.350
She currently serves as a
trustee of the Fetzer institute.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.730
Today Carolyn will discuss
her just published book

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.190
as shown here, "Reading
Lu Xun Through Carl Jung,"

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.620
which offers a unique
approach to the short stories

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.740
of the most famous modern
Chinese writer, Lu Xun.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.830
Brown uses foundational elements
of the psychology of Carl Jung,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.350
who with Freud was the founder
of modern western psychology,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.130
to illuminate key structures in
the works of this great writer.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.140
Approaching this works
from a unique direction,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.330
Brown's lecture will
shed new light

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.370
on the psychological patterns

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.380
within Lu Xun's most famous
story, "The True Story of Ah Q."

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.510
Now please join me in
welcoming Dr. Carolyn Brown.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.490
[ Applause ]

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.620
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Brown: Well,
thank you very much, Qi Qiu.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.650
It's a real pleasure
to be invited to talk

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.010
about my new book, "Reading
Lu Xun Through Carl Jung,"

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.330
here at the Library of Congress.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.460
Where as you know I spent most
of my professional career.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.230
And especially to talk
about insights that arose

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.150
from viewing his most famous
story through a Xun Jung lens.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.260
If you decide after the
lecture that you would

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.920
like to have the book or you
might decide you don't want

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.590
to have the book, but
if you decide you want

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.190
to have the book, please take
a minute to see my husband,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.560
Tim Eastman, who can give you a
code the publisher's provided,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.470
that will give you
a 25% discount.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.150
So, that's definitely worth it.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.950
Before I forget -- begin,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.070
I would like to thank a
few people who've made the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.370
book possible.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.050
No book comes into
fruition on its own.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.530
First, [foreign name] and
the staff of the staff

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.660
of the Asia Division, including
our wonderful introducer today.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.650
The staff of the Kluge
Center that were wonderful

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.740
in helping me transition
from being a director

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.140
to being a scholar
in the center.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.530
I must say being a scholar
in the Center turned

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.670
out even better than I said all
the years that I was director.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.160
Really fabulous, fabulous place.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.300
Of course, thanks
to James Billington

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.700
who granted me the office,
the former librarian.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.430
I'd also like to thank
Mary Jane Dee and the staff

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.770
of the African Middle
eastern Division,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.650
who offered special
accommodations

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.200
over the last year or so.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.380
And to the other
scholars and friends

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.530
who helped bring the
book to fruition.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.980
And I want to mention two people
who were there at the beginning

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.810
and are here at the end, my good
friend Victoria Ronna Robinson,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.330
who just crept in the
back and my son, Michael,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.340
who many decades ago
it seems said to me,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.970
"If you don't finish this
book, you won't die happy."

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.370
So, I have finished it, but
I'm not planning to die.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.160
And, of course, my
husband, Tim Eastman,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.840
who did way too many things that
I couldn't even mention them,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.260
but there would be
no index without Tim.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.450
My presentation today
will follow this outline.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.830
First, for those of you not
familiar with the author,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.400
I will briefly introduce Lu Xun,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.260
who really is the most important
early Chinese intellectual --

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.690
early 20th century Chinese
intellectual and writer.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.850
Then explain what makes my
approach unique among ways

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.220
of interpreting his
modern short stories.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.250
For those of you
unfamiliar with Carl Jung,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.030
I will briefly sketch a
few of the fundamental,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.470
psychological insights I've used

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.690
that are necessary
to my interpretation.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.900
Number four, I'll draw some
examples from the true story

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.200
of "Ah Q," as a way

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.770
of demonstrating why a
psychological reading deserves a

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.680
place among the multiple more
familiar historical cultural

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.640
and biographical readings
of this masterpiece.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.110
And finally, I will point to
other dimensions of this story,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.650
which I argue is a deeply
insightful reflection

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.260
on the psychological
phenomena of scapegoating.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.690
And then briefly suggest
the power that comes

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.070
from using Jung's concepts
as an interpretive lens

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.820
for delivering new insights
into Lu Xun's stories.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.380
And we should have
time for questions.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.720
So, first a brief introduction.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.890
Lu Xun is a major
Chinese intellectual

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.940
of the early 20th century, he's
generally considered the founder

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.270
of modern Chinese literature

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.380
and certainly the greatest
writer of that period.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.980
He was a central figure in
the tumultuous early decades

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.980
of that century, both a product
of the time and a person,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.850
an agent who shaped it.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.500
He was born in 1881,
died in 1936.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.600
He was of that pivotal
generation that lived

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.240
through the singular
historical moment

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.810
when China was transforming

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.430
from an ancient kingdom
to a modern state.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.910
He was a scholar, a
teacher, a journal editor

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.280
and an active participant
in the intellectual life

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.830
of Beijing and then Shanghai.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.230
His two collections of modern
short stories, "Call to Arms"

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.380
and "Wandering,"
broke new ground

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.410
in their content and form.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.740
And along with his essays,
addressed contemporary concerns

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.900
with penetrating insight.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.120
Living at a time when
China was under assault

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.150
by western imperial
powers, he searched for ways

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.880
to make China stronger.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.850
With a focus on asking what
Chinese patterns and thought

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.580
and perception might account

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.210
for what he believes was
China's insufficient response

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.940
to the challenges arising
from encounter with the west.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.310
He is still deeply appreciated
for his penetrating critiques

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.720
of social norms and
conditions of Chinese society.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.020
He took what was
known, familiar,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.190
accepted without question,
looked at them in new ways

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.890
and exposed these practices
as cruel and inhumane.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.710
He opened his reader's
eyes to seeing

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.150
and understanding in new ways.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.740
He is still appreciated,
and this is important,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.490
a 100 years later, he
hasn't gone out of --

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.890
his insights have not
gone out of style.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.490
He's still appreciated for his
insights into Chinese society,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.440
his dedication to ending the
Chinese people suffering,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.140
his deep moral integrity and
his commitment to self-scrutiny.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.800
Fundamental elements of his
critique still resonate today,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.330
which is exactly 2018,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.130
a 100 years since he
published his very first modern

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.090
short story.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.560
His legacy is enormous.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.230
He's -- and this is --
it's really extraordinary.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.890
He's memorialized in museums,
his works are read in schools

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.880
across the nation, at least
they were until recently.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.260
They've inspired paintings,
prints, drawings, plays, operas,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.410
ballets, films and so
forth and literary sequels.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.460
His enormous reputation
has commandeered --

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.250
has been commandeered from
the political spectrum

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.550
on both sides.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.810
On the left, Chairman
[inaudible] praised him

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.040
as a harbinger of the
communist revolution.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.950
And on the right, commercial
interests have created Aleutian

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.660
theme park in Beijing.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.260
I really have to go some
time and meet, I'm sure,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.020
the characters are
walking around in costume.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.910
Research on Lu Xun would
fill a small library

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.390
and undoubtedly occupy a
great deal of shelf space

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.540
in the Asian division stacks.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.700
However, the sensitivity
and complexity

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.300
of the writer himself are
frequently lost in the uses

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.550
that others have made of him.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.410
He belonged to that
pivotal generation,

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.530
one foot in each world,
the old and the new.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.270
Trained in the classical
tradition

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.460
and as a teenager embracing
western knowledge as it flooded

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.050
in from China -- into
China from Japan.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.400
Japan had opened up
the western 1868.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.390
And by 1902 when Lu Xun went
to Japan to study was well

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.840
on his way to becoming a
power in its own right.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.760
Going to Japan thrust Lu Xun
outside of his own culture.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.430
And I think that is what
probably enabled him to see

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.100
with an analytic eye and at
the same time from the inside

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.540
with deep understanding
of the culture

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.540
and intense moral commitment.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.250
In Japan he enrolled in medical
school, but in his second year

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.530
and this is familiar to
anyone in Chinese studies,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.870
his second year he
abandoned the career,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.700
that career, for literature.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.890
Explaining what the Chinese
people most needed was not

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.130
to have their bodies healed, but
to have their spirits changed.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.540
And many scholars have
perceived this medical metaphor.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.940
So, the second part of
my lecture is to talk

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.710
about how my work asked a new
question about this metaphor

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.930
and what is it that makes my
interpretation and my approach

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.950
to these stories rather unique?

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.130
Of enumerable scholars who
have addressed the issue

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.900
of his diagnosis of the
Chinese spiritual illness

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.760
and his crisis, his
analysis of its causes.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.680
Almost without exception
they focus on his critiques

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.100
of Chinese society and
its Confucian roots.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.060
This is a logical outcome

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.400
of his explicit social concerns
is an essential line of inquiry,

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.890
but it also has some
limitations.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.930
My work asks this,
"If Lu Xun thought

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.230
that he could change the
spirits of the Chinese people

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.240
with literature, did he have
an implicit psychological model

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.000
of healing?"

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.620
Does the concept -- doesn't
the concept spirit also have

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.660
inner dimensions.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.590
I have asked, "Did
he have a diagnosis,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.510
an etiology that is an
analysis of the causes,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.420
a notion of the therapeutic
process?

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.820
If he thought he could make
changes in the spirits,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.230
he must have had
some idea of how.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.750
And a vision of the cured state.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.450
And what might one discover
by thinking of spiritual cure

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.750
as having a psychological
dimension."

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.620
Not surprisingly, if
you pose a new question,

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.950
you usually get new insights.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:39.800
But nevertheless I do want to
say that my work is in addition

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.740
to a lot of other wonderful
work that's been done and on

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.090
which it certainly depends.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.360
So how am I going to answer
my question about the,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.400
you know, the methodology?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.080
Why this is different.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.670
And I start with a
personal experience.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.190
This study began when I was a
college sophomore in a course

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.160
in modern Chinese
literature in translation.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.850
I think we probably read
his most iconic stories,

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.940
certainly true story of
Ah Q. Undoubtedly "Regret

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.080
for the Past," I don't remember.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.840
But I do know that when I
read one of his stories,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.540
"The New Year Sacrifice,"
[inaudible] it was

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.790
as someone had like hit me
in the stomach and I thought,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.110
"What has happened here?"

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:36.020
I had never been to China and I
don't think I really knew anyone

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.320
who was Chinese or
certainly not well.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.860
But I do answer that
question, but I'm not going

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.160
to answer it here today.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.460
I do answer it in the book.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:52.710
But the question, my own
reaction asked me to think both

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.350
about my reaction and in a
psychological sense and then

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.420
to begin to wonder about what
might be the psychological

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.950
dimensions within the stories.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:06.330
Thus I was moved to ask
about the psychological model

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.450
by personal experience and I
admit, as a former director

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.590
of the Kluge Center,
it wasn't driven

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.950
by intellectual curiosity,

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.840
essentially, but
by my experience.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.370
So therefore naturally the
study dwells very little

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.680
on Chinese history and culture
per se, although there's enough

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.280
to help a reader who's
not familiar with it.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.850
Also, unlike most
studies, it's not primarily

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.820
about the man himself,
it's a study of text.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.470
Of course we know the
man wrote the text,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.580
so they obviously trace
back to the author himself,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.270
but that's not the
central concern.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.160
Similarly the work
decent is the content

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.470
and focuses on the structures.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.200
That is, I look at the
patterns that repeat

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.540
in foremost of the stories.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.160
And, in fact, it shows up
in all the famous ones.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.820
But I'm not focuses primarily
on the content and content is

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.860
where most of the critics
direct their attention.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.410
So my focus is elsewhere.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.290
Lu Xun was known
for experimenting

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.860
with a variety of
narrative forms.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.810
And so my attention to
structure and commonalities

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.440
in structure is not
exactly intuitive.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.640
Nevertheless, careful
attention to structure reveals

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.280
that his stories are
very architectural.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.720
There's an identifiable pattern
that repeats and attention

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.680
to this pattern turns out
to be highly productive.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.090
Having identified the structure,
which I name, and here's sort

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.660
of the title, "A Bi-Polar Closed
System Viewed from the Outside."

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.770
Won't mean much in the
abstract, but there it is.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.790
I tried to name the
structure in the context

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.350
of my two psychological
questions.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.780
What did Lu Xun mean by
wanting to cure the spirits

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.320
of the Chinese people and
why did these stories move me

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.450
so deeply?

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.250
And that is where
the third element

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.220
in the presentation comes in.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.340
The work of Carl Jung, who
along with Sigmund Freud,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.270
who's much better known
in China, was the founder

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.100
of modern Chinese --
modern Western psychology.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.430
You might be appropriately
suspicious

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.200
and it really is appropriate,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.170
to wonder whether I might have
imposed a western framework

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.920
on a Chinese writer,
which would be a kind

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.490
of literary critical
cultural imperialism.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.770
My answer to that, before you've
asked the question perhaps,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.520
is that the pattern emerged
from close reading of the text,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.630
which is another
distinctive feature.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.620
Although I understand close
reading is coming back

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.110
into fashion.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.790
But I used Carl Jung to
name what was immerging

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.090
from the text.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.110
Not to impose a structure
that wasn't there.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.690
And it's interesting, Carl Jung
and Lu Xun were contemporaries.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.110
Jung was six years older.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.470
But I'm not arguing influence.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.540
I don't think there was
any direct influence.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.530
They did participate in the same
sort of international zeitgeist,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.790
but this is not a
study of influence.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.030
I'm using Jung's concepts
of the psyche as a model

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.460
to explain what I was
finding in the text.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:28.350
So I'll say my sort of third
element here, a word about Jung.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.240
Jung viewed the human psyche
or the self as comprised

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.370
of the conscious mind
and the unconscious mind

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.620
in dynamic interaction.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.980
The conscious mind is
primarily comprised of the ego.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.020
The unconscious has two parts.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.040
The personal unconscious and
the collective unconscious.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.180
And needless to say
I'm simplifying

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.810
to be able to use this.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.520
And we're not even interested
in the collective unconscious

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.180
for this talk, just the
personal unconscious.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.760
According to Jung, the ego
is that part of the self

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.150
that we generally mean when
we say, "I is responsible

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.010
for the individual's
adaptation to the world

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.430
and is often mistaken and
sometimes mistakes itself

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.150
as being the whole,
which it is not."

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.200
Anyone who thinks about
their dreams is well aware

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.760
that there are other parts
of the mind that are not part

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.320
of the ego of a conscious mind.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.430
The shadow, that is that
element of the unconscious,

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.310
is primarily made up of parts
that the psyche or the ego,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:38.300
I'm sorry, the psyche -- the
parts that the ego has rejected.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.850
It's in normal development some
parts of the self are favored,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.270
approved and others
are rejected.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.540
And what is favored tends
to be what, you know,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.980
what your family likes,
what society favors.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.760
Although not inevitably.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.990
I think one reason that
adults find children

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:03.920
so charming is they say what
they think and what they mean

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.320
and they don't know
that some things are not

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.620
socially accepted.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.980
They haven't learned that yet.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.950
In normal human development the
shadow tends to go underground

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.910
out of awareness and
may even be forgotten.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.670
But it can't be destroyed,
because it's part

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.960
of the whole person,
the whole self.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.880
Being aware of the shadow
normally isn't a problem,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.530
unless it intrudes on the ego,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.820
perhaps by undermining
the egos conscious intent.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.380
I'm sure this has
happened to all of you.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.890
The ego may be surprised,
puzzled, angry,

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.470
when the shadow suddenly
speaks up or does something

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.490
that the ego was not aware
of or didn't approve.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.180
And you're all probably familiar

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.130
with that example of
the Freudian slip.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.130
When something pops
out of your mouth

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.860
and you think, who said that?

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.830
Couldn't have been me,
I didn't mean that.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.130
Meant to hide it.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.240
Well, that's sort of
your shadow speaking.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.210
One way that the
disowned or shadow side

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.140
of the self may appear is

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.810
through what is called
projection of the shadow.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.190
The psyche splits
off or disowns a part

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.060
of the self it considers
negative and then it tributes

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.440
that characteristic
to another person.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.150
And then it may in
anger attack the other

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.680
as something outside of itself.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.070
That is the psyche tries to
destroy the unwelcome part

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.070
of itself by embodying it in
some other person or object

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.120
out there and then attacking.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.130
An amusing version of
this, I'm sure many

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.340
of you have heard this, is
the young child who comes

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.420
to school not having done
her homework and says

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.970
to the teacher, "The
dog ate the homework."

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.280
Right? The dog, who cannot
defend himself becomes the

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.810
scapegoat for the fact that
the child was negligent

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.980
and failed to do the assignment.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.660
More seriously this image can
be projected onto entire groups.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.880
Where the community contributes
some evil that has befallen it,

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.320
to a group usually with
insufficient power to fight back

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.030
and tries to contain it.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.890
The internment of Japanese
Americans during World War II is

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.180
one very clear example

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.170
of political scapegoating
of an entire group.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.640
And I'm sure it doesn't take
much imagination for you to look

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.080
around our current world
and see it still happening.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.660
But although a part of
the self can be forgotten

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.950
and rendered unconscious,
it cannot be destroyed,

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.620
because it is part of the self.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.430
Japanese Americans
were Americans,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.390
not citizens of Japan.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.600
And further Jung argued
and here he departed

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.640
from Freud significantly,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.360
the psyche has a natural
impulse towards reintegration,

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.460
towards healing and
that some part of it,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.390
some part of the psyche actually
wants the reintegration,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.770
wants wholeness.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.250
And I'm happy to say, as you
all know, that the wrong done

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.710
to Japanese Americans
was finally recognized

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.010
and the government
extends an apology.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.600
That doesn't always
happen of course.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.900
My book argues that one way
of viewing the spiritual

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.950
or psychological illness
that Lu Xun defined

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.280
as undermining China, is to
view his analysis as the split

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.880
of the shadow from the
ego within the whole self.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.330
And healing as the reintegration
of these two parts.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.460
He investigates this, this
idea in multiple domains,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.990
that of the nation, the
community, the family

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.330
and the individual self

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.080
and imagines different
outcomes in each domain.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.960
So one way to understand
the psycho dynamics

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.300
in the true story of Ah
Q, is to view the story

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:50.310
as an investigation into what
happens when the ego splits off

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.050
and expels the unwanted,
unacknowledged,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:59.950
despised shadow side of the self
and then tries to destroy it?

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:06.170
Analyzing the true story of Ah Q
as a meditation on scapegoating,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.690
defined in terms of these union
concepts, reveals dimensions

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.290
of the stories, the story
not previously noted.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.130
So, I get to the fourth
part of my presentation.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.990
I want to provide a few examples

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.280
that reveal how viewing the true
story of Ah Q as a medication

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.920
on scapegoating furthers our
understanding of the story.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.600
The historical context
depicted in the stories

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.440
in 1911 revolution,
which is the revolution

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.700
that needed the last dynasty

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.280
and established the
Chinese republic.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.170
The story was written ten years
after this event, so it was kind

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:49.880
of recent history, it depicts
incidents in the life of Ah Q,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.180
that's the name of
the character.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.110
A day laborer in a
small Chinese village.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.530
A man who has a tendency
to get into fist fights,

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.710
which he usually loses.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.890
But then he recasts his losses
as psychological victories.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:09.140
When he oversteps the
boundaries of sexual propriety,

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.450
he's forced to leave
the village for town.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.600
There he participates as
a low level accomplice,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.520
in an act of petty thievery and
returns later to the village.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.830
When ripples from the
coming revolution arrive

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.210
in his village he wants to
enlist in the revolution,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.080
but the village elite
will have none of it.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.350
They co-op the revolution,
claim it as their own.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.930
The real social disruption
arrives in the form of a theft

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.430
of a very powerful
person's goods.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:43.120
The authorities needing to
hold somebody responsible,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.310
accuse Ah Q of the
crime and execute him.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.280
Actually they shoot
him, not cut his throat.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.660
Ah Q's signature
feature, the one he's know

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.920
for as a character, is
his stunning capacity

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.200
to turn physical defeat
into spiritual victory.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.350
That is, when he's
defeated in some kind

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.700
of brawl he redefines
the experience,

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.120
such that he perceives himself

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.600
as having achieved
the upper hand morally

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.520
and psychologically.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.630
At the time of its composition
Ah Q's capacity to turn defeat

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.670
into victory was
read allegorically.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.410
Okay? It was read
as a representation

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.770
of China's failures to respond

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.040
to the challenges
brought by the west.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.370
The notion that a nation
had a particular character,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.180
a national character was
very current at the time,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.000
and there was considerable
discussion

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.410
about China's national
character, what made it unique.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:50.760
And then given the problems,
what deficiencies were

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.200
in its -- in this character.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.580
Because if it was getting
beaten up by the west,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.880
at least in its perception,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.900
it must have been
deficient in some way.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.280
Lu Xun, viewing himself as a
doctor rendering a diagnosis,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.960
looked at what was wrong
with the patient, china,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.920
in order to move the body
politic towards health

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.800
and a better future.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.790
He himself declared
a few years later

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.030
that in creating the stories
he had attempted to --

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.740
he had attempted to describe
the souls of the Chinese people.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.010
So, from the beginning Ah
Q was viewed as typical,

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.680
not just a literary character,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.750
but typical of the
Chinese national character.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.930
And what was considered
his essential feature,

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.950
was this capacity to
turn defeat into victory.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:44.060
So, we should take a look
at what that actually means.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.460
And I'm going to give you a few

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:50.390
of the simpler examples
from the story.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.560
Simplest one, Ah Q was out
gambling, he's actually winning

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.180
for a change, winning a big pile
of silver, as it's described,

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.350
and suddenly a fight breaks
out, tables are overturned,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.090
there's a lot of hub
bub and carrying on.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:05.720
When he looks around
and comes to,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.870
all of his winnings,
phht, caput.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:14.390
Are gone. Initially he's a
little upset and bewildered

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:20.190
and then he slaps
his own face hard.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.830
What is he doing?

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.260
Oh, I should say, slaps his
face and he feels better, okay,

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.010
makes him feel better.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:32.390
He is, in fact, split his psyche
into the ego and the shadow.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.160
Treats the ego as if
it were the whole self,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.440
the one that gave the slap
and remember I mentioned

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.550
that Jung noted that frequently
the ego believes it is the

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.860
entire self.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.800
So, this is not quite
as bizarre it may seem.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.210
But then he disowns the part
of himself that felt the pain

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.010
and Lu Xun tells us, even though
his face is still tingling,

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.310
it works.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.870
He feels better, he's
disowned the part

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.260
that was hit, defeat
into victory.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.910
Another example.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.470
Ah Q has ringworm scars.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.860
I've never seen a ringworm scar,

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.440
but I gather they're
not very attractive.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.290
And he's doesn't like them

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.830
and he's tabooed
all mention of them.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.400
So, the very act,
if you think of it,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.510
the act of tabooing itself
a part of your body that,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.980
you know, is there,
is a way of trying

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.410
to disown or to dismiss it.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.910
So, naturally when anyone
mentions the ringworm scars he

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.000
gets furious because
the very fact of having

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.170
to acknowledge the shadow
that has been rejected,

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.280
is what constitutes defeat.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.240
So, he gets really angry.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:50.280
So, just to be explicit as
we move to my next example,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.060
scapegoating is envisioned
by Lu Xun and by the Jung,

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.920
proceeds by splitting
the psyche,

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.720
projecting the shadow a
negative part, what it regards

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.250
as negative, onto another group
and then attacking that person

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.530
for inciting their anger.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.410
I should note that
Lu Xun himself

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.770
and this is really
interesting, about five years

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:18.600
after he wrote the story, had an
intuition that the story was not

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.570
about the past or the
present, as people said,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.570
but that it was about
the future.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.530
And even several
decades in the future.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.610
So, he himself had a sense

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.260
that there was a
pattern going on here.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:35.600
But he didn't obviously he was a
writer, not a literary critique,

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.940
so he didn't look
for the pattern,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.960
but he sensed the pattern.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:44.910
And I think the pattern shows
most clearly in a simple way,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.020
in this famous incident

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.870
with a woman servant named
Ama Wu [assumed spelling].

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.680
Okay. So, at this point

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.600
in the story Ah Q's
sexuality is aroused

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.470
when he pinches a young nun.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.580
I won't go into that part.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.510
Offended though the nun hurls
a curse at him and she says,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.100
"Ah Q, may you die sonless."

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.190
And not to have children
in a culture

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:14.060
that values filial
relationships is really bad.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.320
However, Ah Q considers
the comment and thinks

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.600
that indeed he should
take a wife,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.290
which is the social context
in which ones sexual appetite

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.810
or expression of it
is appropriate, right?

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.440
So, shortly after he's
sitting with a female servant,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.130
they're both working
in the house of one

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.570
of these village elite, Ama Wu,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.420
and she's innocently chatting
away about this and that.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:45.760
And out of nowhere Ah Q says
to her, "Sleep with me."

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.830
She screams, goes running
from the room, big room,

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.900
big hullaballoo, and has
to be persuaded by the head

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.030
of the household that
she shouldn't think

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.980
about committing suicide.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:04.470
Okay. So, Ah Q's ego
speaks of marriage.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.360
His shadow speaks of
sexual intercourse.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.660
When the man of the house
comes after Ah Q, big step,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.360
to beat him for this
gross transgression,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.040
Ah Q does not understand
that he himself has initiated

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.340
the uproar.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:23.570
He thinks, like, "Hmm, wonder
what's happening here."

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.460
That is to say he has so
disowned the shadow self,

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.420
which caused the uproar, that
he doesn't even recognize it

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.280
as his own self.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.120
Further, and this is
important, the woman,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.780
who has in no way provoked
his proposition, she's just,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.270
you know, jibber
jabber, chatter, chatter,

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.670
behaves as if she were
in fact responsible,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.870
so contemplates suicide,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.400
which is the socially
appropriate response.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.600
Ah Q has -- Lu Xun has
revealed that Ah Q,

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.980
having disowned his sexuality,
has projected it onto Ama Wu,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.970
and she is merely the recipient
of the shadow projection.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.950
But she responds as if
the society will agree

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.250
that she's to blame.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.980
In fact, that she is the --

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.970
so that he has attempted
to scapegoat her.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.340
Lu Xun made the same
argument in another story,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.670
which is much overlooked,
"Soap."

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.740
That is he also showed there
that society has encouraged men

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:39.050
to disown their sexuality,
project their desires onto women

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.560
and then accuse women
of having incited it.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.920
Certainly he viewed this as
an issue of power as well,

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.100
but also in psychological terms.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.790
So, Ah Q's behavior
only seems exaggerated,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.910
because he masks the normal
covers that society creates

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:04.440
to hide it, to hide the -- to
hide the shadow projection.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.770
So, my example of the Japanese,
there was some equivalence made,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.870
they were dangerous, because
they might have connections

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.380
with the Japanese government
that was attacking us, etc. So,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.220
there's usually an excuse
to mask the projection.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.620
But in Ah Q, the story of
Ah Q, there's no excuse,

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.500
he doesn't know he
needs to make one.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.240
When the revolution
comes to the village,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.700
the same scapegoating process
is enacting on the social scale,

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.790
on the societal scale.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.760
And it's interesting seeing the
perils between Ah Q's behavior

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.560
and that of the village elite
is particularly important.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.020
Okay, why is it important?

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.850
Because over the decades the
critics have understood Ah Q is

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:55.930
a type, as I said, And trying to
determine what he is typical of,

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.410
have looked outside of
the story for answers.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.640
It was particularly a
challenge for critics working

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.780
under [inaudible] constraints,

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.930
because Chairman
[inaudible] had praise Ah Q

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.400
in such extraordinary -- I'm
sorry, has praised Lu Xun

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.620
in such extraordinary ways.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.070
So, in the context
of class struggle,

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:21.390
which I guess you will remember
as one of these major elements

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.620
in that period, Ah Q,

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.470
the peasant is he a good
figure, he's a peasant?

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.030
Or a bad figure?

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.710
And then how to explain
his cowardice

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:37.440
in turning physical
defeat into moral victory.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.860
And what was he typical of, was
he typical of China before 1949

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.650
or was he in some way
typical, could he be typical

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.110
of the great life that
happened after 1949.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.670
So, it created a
lot of problems.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.220
I'm sure the critics did
very well in trying to deal

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.450
with what had been
set up for them.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.710
But even critics not laboring

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.050
under such ideological
constraints, looked outside

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.870
of Lu Xun's text to try
to understand typicality.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.300
And in a way I would say the
writer has thrown them a curve,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.880
because in naming the story,
the true story of Ah Q,

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.690
you're naturally going to
focus on Ah Q. But if you look

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.940
at the entire story through
the lens of ego and shadow

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.510
and the whole self, then you can
see that his behavior and that

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.930
of the other villages,
are in fact just the same.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.980
That they too are trying to
turn defeat into victory,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.570
except they have more power
so they can sometimes do it

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.160
in the external world.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.780
So, few more words
about how that works.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.420
In the story Lu Xun treats the
revolution in [inaudible] terms,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.820
and you may not have
noticed this.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.350
When the revolutionary
arrives, power holders,

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.100
that is the social ego, try to
coop it, they get the badges,

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.060
they get the banners, you
know, all of the paraphernalia.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.880
And managed to remain in power.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.370
But in the text when Lu
Xun describes them he notes

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.690
that there are bad
revolutionaries

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.490
who are always off somewhere
else, never seen, you only hear

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.330
about them, and they are out
there really disrupting society.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:27.950
He never calls the local
elite good revolutionaries,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.180
but the others are
bad revolutionaries.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.970
So, he's already set up a
kind of union dynamic there.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.870
What's so wonderful
about this technique is

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:47.820
that within the text in
keeping them never dramatized,

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.700
they're always sort
of like off stage,

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.240
you hear about them second
hand through something.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.570
It's kind of mimicking the way

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.720
in which the shadow is actually
experienced psychologically.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.330
So, those of you
who know literature

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.730
in this period often know that,
you know, have a clash of good

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.630
and evil, but Lu Xun
is swifter than that.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.720
He doesn't set it up that way.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.860
When the revolution actually
does reach the village,

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:19.260
Ah Q tries to sign up
and he's shushed away.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.670
Then a serious theft occurs.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.410
Which may or may
not have been --

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.570
we don't know who committed
the revolutionaries or who.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.660
But there's a serious theft.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.120
The captain, now he's from
the town, who's in charge

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.300
with solving, not just this
crime, but several others,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.880
hasn't been able to
solve any of them.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.430
And he's feeling
pretty embarrassed

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.050
and he's probably
worried about his job,

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.460
although is ay that's
my addition.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.620
Lu Xun doesn't actually
say that.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.770
So, he has -- he looks at Ah Q

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.310
and he says, "Aha,
got a culprit."

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.870
People think he's been
a thief, you know,

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.930
there he is, let's nail him.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.090
He's clearly innocent,
he even has an alibi,

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.400
most of the villagers
believe he's not a thief

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.160
who will steal again.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.520
There is a trial,
barely a trial,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.570
and he's executed
as a public example.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.850
So, I want to go back
to my earlier metaphor.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:26.290
This is very much the example of
the dog that ate the homework.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.590
While it is very plausible

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:33.080
that the dog indeed could
have eaten the homework,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.750
it's the least likely
explanation.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.240
And, so, Ah Q is a
very plausible thief

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.170
and he's illiterate and not
very clear headed and is

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:51.460
about as good at defending
himself as the dog would be.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.650
Looking at the story through a
[inaudible] lens then reveals

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:56.830
the conceptual unity
of the plot.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.700
The early part focused on
Ah Q and the latter part.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.670
And it also makes apparent

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:09.270
that the same psychodynamic is
reenacted by the other clans

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.630
in the village and one
of the great things

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.200
about this story is
reading again for this talk,

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.620
I saw again, it's not
just that it's enacting

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.470
within the village, but it's
also enacted within the town.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.780
Keep seeing more things.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.960
So that when those at the
higher level of power are faced

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.990
with a crime and a problem
that they can't deal with,

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:38.400
they resort to scapegoating
as well, just as Ah Q has,

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.320
as the local elite have and
now the people in the town.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.120
So he's executed because they
can't find the real culprit.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.750
Almost overlooked and I'll
just say a few more things

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:54.820
about Ah Q, is that Lu Xun
has provided six different

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.250
perspectives on this execution.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.550
And I'll just name them.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.400
You can look for
yourself at a later point.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.840
The soldiers who come to arrest
Ah Q, the judge who presides

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.610
at the trial, the man
whose goods are stolen,

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.570
who naturally just wants
them back, the local --

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.790
and he's related
to the local elite.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.280
The captain who arrests him.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.460
Ah Q himself, he has
a perspective on this,

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.110
which might surprise you.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.510
And the general population
witnessed the execution.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.570
Also often overlooked are the
last two paragraphs of the story

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.740
and there's a lot in there,
but I just want to know here

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.320
that Lu Xun makes very clear
that the bad revolutionaries,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.240
as it were, are still out there.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.260
So, executing the scapegoat, it
may give you temporary relief,

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.800
but the real folks
are still there.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.460
I just want to mention
one other dimension,

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.280
which I certainly
can't go into here,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.120
but I do go into in the book

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.630
in some detail is there's
another really important critic,

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:09.550
Rene Girard, who spends a lot
of his several books talking

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.310
about violence and how
human societies try

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.990
to contain and prevent violence.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:21.560
And his focus is on different
stages in scapegoating.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.940
What tends to cause it,
how the process unfolds,

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.320
who the victims usually are,

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:37.270
etc. And his very useful
insight is that scapegoating

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:42.240
at a societal level tends
to occur when the rule

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.840
of law is not in place.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.220
This is not to say that
there are no scapegoats

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.030
when you have the rule of law.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:53.680
But that when the society, as a
society goes into scapegoating,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.330
it tends to be because the
rule of law is weakened.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.840
And, of course, what
is a revolution,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.120
but a destruction
of the rule of law.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.160
It's interesting, Girard
mentions four stages

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.400
in scapegoating, but if
you look carefully at Ah Q,

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.460
not only has Lu Xun built
into his story all four,

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.120
but they're really two more.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.030
And I won't get into that.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.780
It's sort of based on what
Girard was looking at.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.250
So, when I looked at this
and I saw this pattern

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.510
of scapegoating, and remembered
that Lu Xun had intuited

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.830
that there was a
pattern in his story,

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.610
but he didn't know what it
was, I'm wondering if that's

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.840
in fact what he intuited.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:43.180
My final point, which
is to say something

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.720
about using a union
interpretation as a way

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.490
of looking not just at this
story and other stories.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:58.330
I called it a bi-polar
closed system feud

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.540
from an exterior point.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.040
Right, that's of the
abstract description.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.460
And just briefly to take
a look at how that shows

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.720
up in the true story of Ah
Q. I should say in Ah Q,

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.030
no matter what you have in
other stories, it always seems

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:18.130
to be more complicated
and intricate,

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.620
but just briefly that pattern.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.180
Closed system, okay.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.970
The events that I've
outlined take place

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.530
within a narrative frame
where you have a narrator

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:34.560
at the beginning and the -- an
overt narrate in the beginning.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.810
And the story begins, that is
the narrator's story begins

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.600
after Ah Q has been executed.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.350
So, there's a temporal
closure, a temporal circle.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:52.560
If you juxtapose Ah Q
and the village elite,

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.320
you have the bi-polarity there.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.730
And, of course, it changes, as
I said, the story's complicated,

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.050
but there's bi-polarity
through all.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.740
And then the external view,
initially it's the narrator,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.920
but I think primarily
it's the use

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.840
of irony throughout the story

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.060
that creates the
external vision.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.710
And I haven't even
talked about the irony.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.320
I certainly didn't have
time to get that in.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:28.600
So, that pattern informs Ah Q,
it's in, I think I mentioned,

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.220
all the major stories.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.820
It's in four images
in the preface,

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:37.000
to the first collection
of short stories.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.360
It's in a Mad Man's Diary.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.240
I mentioned this is
the 100th anniversary.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.450
It's in -- that pattern informs
the New Year's sacrifice,

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.000
which is the story that got me

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.630
at the beginning
when I was a student.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.890
I just realized as I was writing
this that I read the story

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.430
at about the same age that Lu
Xun went to Japan and I thought,

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:01.970
"Oh, yeah," that's when
your mind gets opened.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.950
In the book I show that
interpreting this structure

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.670
through Jung's conceptual
framework shows

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.040
that indeed Lu Xun
had an implicit model

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.110
of psychological
illnesses and its causes.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:22.910
That in some venues
he could imagine

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.970
that therapeutic process
unfolding, although not

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:30.280
in the true story of Ah Q, and
that he even imbedded in several

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.680
of his stories a
vision of the cure.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.550
And, again, those of you
who know the literate know

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.230
that in terms of the
social environment,

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.940
there wasn't a vision of
the cure, but within the --

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:49.130
he could envision it within the
family, not always, sometimes,

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.780
but he could envision
it in the family

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.290
and he could envision
it in the private self.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:59.220
And that's all encoded in
the structure of the stories

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.100
as you read them
through a union lens.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.490
So, the union approach combined
with a focus on the structure,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.160
gives new meaning to Lu
Xun's decision to take

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.240
up the profession of
literature in his hope

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.360
of healing the spirits
of the Chinese people.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.660
So, I'll stop there.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.930
I think we have time
for questions.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.210
Although I was, yep, little bit.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.510
I meant to have more.

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:25.810
Yes.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:33.930
I just want to add that
[inaudible] architects,

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.710
[inaudible] anonymous seem
to be also applicable here,

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.360
because [inaudible]
society, as you know.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.660
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.110
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you [inaudible]
rejection of the,

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.390
I don't know, [inaudible]
psyche.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:53.060
And how that would be
part of the social malady

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:57.770
of [inaudible], I was wondering
how much Lu Xun addressed

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:01.780
himself to that particular
sexist component

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.390
of the [inaudible]?

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.320
&gt;&gt; Well, it's really
interesting because he --

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.750
and thank you for that
comment, because, you know,

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.420
I wondered about Anima and
Animus and I had so much to do

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.370
and I was trying to
pull it all together,

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.690
so I decided I'm not going
to go down that route.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:21.670
But he really thought
a lot about the role

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:26.510
of women in that society.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:29.070
And he thought about it
I would say differently

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.590
from a lot of his colleagues.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.790
He has a famous essay
that's called, "What happens

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.640
after Nora leaves home?"

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.640
Alluding to Henrik
Ibsen, "A Doll's House."

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.150
And he argues that in China she
leaves home, either she's going

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.360
to have to -- either she's
going to starve to death

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.550
or she's going to
have to return.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.890
And he has a story, which
follows the structure,

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.820
but which I argue
really ask the question,

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.720
people are always trying to
figure out what his answer was.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.800
I think the story, it's
called, "Regret for the Past

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.830
in English," what it
looks at that question.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.490
But of great interested,

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.840
a greater interest I think
is his story, "Soap."

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.620
Which was usually overlooked
because it doesn't have

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.200
that overtly, that
kind of social content,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.600
that social critical content.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:26.320
But in "Soap" he creates
a woman who is married

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.450
to an old fashioned man.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.940
I won't try to go
into the whole story.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.500
But she figures out in the
course of a dinner conversation

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.510
that he's been oogling a
young woman on the street

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.970
and directing his
sexual attentions to her.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.730
She says nothing until for
various reasons he goes

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.030
after the child.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.230
It's a very good view
of a woman really.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:52.100
And then she comes
out after him.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.870
But what Lu Xun has
done is he's given in --

00:50:55.870 --> 00:51:01.290
at a time when most of the
male writers were using women,

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:06.570
female figures as part of their
argument about social realities,

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:11.900
so kind of using them as
tokens, he has created a woman

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.620
who speaks her own
mind in her own voice,

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.130
terrifies her husband,
because he's not expecting,

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.720
because usually she's
very behaving.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:29.910
And has actually written in a
character who is as powerful

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:34.070
in rereading the
Confucian text, you know,

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.260
which you see in other stories.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.440
But the woman rereading what
gets called the performative

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.000
text, the way people behave,
through a whole new lens,

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
and this is one of the
stories that shows healing,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.940
because after her
husband recovers

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.440
from this attack,
she uses the gift.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.340
He's brought here a gift of soap
and it implies that, in fact,

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:08.740
she has succeeded in
redirecting his sexual interest

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.470
to her person.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:16.910
And there's a little detail
in there that after she uses

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:21.260
that for six months,
a new aroma pops up.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.130
Sandalwood soap.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:27.900
And thanks to my wonderful
research assistant,

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.120
Dushaya [assumed spelling], I've
understood, came to understand

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:36.990
that sandalwood soap was a
special, more expensive soap.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.190
So, she went.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.340
It's not -- they both win.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:46.240
And that's the point, that when
ego and shadow come together

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.180
and the knowledge is integrated,
everybody wins, in fact,

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.460
but it's one of his best,
most well crafted stories.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.980
It's not an excess word in it.

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.950
And it's just --
it's jut brilliant.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:02.550
It's really, it's
really brilliant.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.250
So, thank you for that question.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.690
&gt;&gt; Is there a [inaudible]
solution

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:11.840
or therapy in [inaudible]?

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.130
&gt;&gt; No. Because what happens--

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:17.200
so the way I looked at
the stories is I looked

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.860
at the stories that seemed
to function primarily --

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.950
they seemed to be
mostly about what happens

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:24.570
at the national state.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.470
And that's Ah Q and
another national level,

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.230
another story of medicine.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.790
And then what tends to happen
at the community level,

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:37.080
what may happen within the
family and what may happen

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.060
within the self, at
the national level

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.580
that shadow figure ends up dead.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.370
Community level the shadow
figure often ends up dead,

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.940
but no one has killed
the person.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.890
It's been neglect,
it's been poverty,

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:56.080
it's been all the things that
are in the social system.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:02.720
At the family level a lot of
times doesn't work very well,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.980
but he does have -- this story,
"Soap" that I've talked about,

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:10.370
where you have spiritual healing
and then there's another story,

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:15.170
which people argue is
influenced by Freudian thinking.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:18.970
These early ones I'm
pretty sure were not -

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.270
that's a longer story.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:25.600
But anyway, where the person's
encounters their shadow

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:33.010
in a dream and takes in the
knowledge of their own evil

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.320
and then very very
subtly he shows

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.390
that they've changed
just a little bit.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:41.060
So you get the way that
they behave at work,

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.000
the certain arrogance and,
"Boy, our family's great,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.500
we do this, that and the other."

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:50.290
And at the end when he absorbs
the knowledge of his own --

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.170
we would say evil, Chinese
wouldn't say evil --

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.470
his own shadow.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:57.830
He's more humble
and compassionate.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.610
But it's very subtle.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.050
So, no, at the national --

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:09.470
at that national level shadow's
finished, executed, killed.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.820
Yeah, Mary Jane.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you, [inaudible].

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.420
Fascinating.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:24.780
Did Lu Xun have the concept
of the function of literature?

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:31.080
In other words, when he
was writing was he thinking

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.300
of making society look at
itself, individuals look

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:39.220
at themselves, or was he trying

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.640
to change the existing
format of literature?

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:45.750
Did it have a function beyond
the literary the telling

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.860
of a story in terms
of the society?

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:54.500
Did he see his literature
as an instrument of change

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.240
or self-recognition or?

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, his main
ambition was to change society

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.020
and to change the
way people thought.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:09.150
Because, and I'm going
to make a gross statement

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.450
about the Chinese culture

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:12.910
that somebody can
probably shoot me for,

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:19.090
but I think there's a tendency
there to think that the thought,

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:23.730
the way you think is the
central part that's going

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.890
to help change the world, the --

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:31.590
I'm trying to think
of the language.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:35.850
Chairman [inaudible] thought
to change the thinking,

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.910
so you change the exterior.

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.880
I think westerners tend
to change the exterior

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.460
and hope the thought
will follow.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:47.720
But anyway, yes, his intention
was to change the society,

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.920
to change it by revealing
what was wrong and looking

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.320
at those patterns and
showing that the patterns

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.220
that everybody had
been following

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.970
for who knows how long.

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.920
I mean, obviously he's
only living in a --

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:09.600
but, certain time, but the
tradition, as he met it

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.450
in the early 20th century, to
show that some of the things

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:21.070
that people said about humanity
and filial piety and the things

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.860
that come from the -- now, of
course, I'm blanking on some

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.150
of the other language -- that
if you looked under the hood,

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:32.560
as it were, what
you saw was cruelty

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.710
and misery and inhumanity.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.280
And that wasn't necessary.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.580
I think that was the point.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.290
It wasn't necessary and
therefore, you could change it

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.660
and things would be better.

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.800
But you can't change it if
you don't know what it is.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.720
So, he's trying to put it on
the table and say, "Hey, look,

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.340
you thought this was so
great, it's killing people."

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.480
I mean, I'm being
sort of dramatic here.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.320
So, that was the intent.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:02.940
Initially he thought he --
and this sort of collapsed --

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.770
his first hope in taking up
literature was he was going

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:10.500
to do translation and
that if society --

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.800
and, of course, we're
just talking

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.590
about an intellectual elite,
right, we're not talking

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.890
about the whole society.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.740
That if the leadership could see

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.360
in new ways then they
could do things in new ways

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.180
and it would be helpful to have
western knowledge coming in,

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.810
because it gives you not
necessarily that you adopt it,

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:29.880
because he was smart enough not

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.330
to know you don't
adopt things wholesale,

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:34.710
but it gives you an
angle of vision to look

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.310
at what your own culture is

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.780
and then you can see
what needs to be changed.

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.660
And although he doesn't talk
about what works, you know,

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.330
there's always what works.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:47.210
So, he's trying to
heal the illness,

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:51.900
it's not cut off a working
limb in some way, yeah.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.520
I think, oh, maybe
last question.

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.320
&gt;&gt; How would you say that
Lu Xun's message is relevant

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.790
for today?

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:04.090
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a tricky one.

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.770
&gt;&gt; There's a plant
in the audience.

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a
plant in the audience.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.810
Well, I'll say a couple
things and I'm not going to --

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.970
I don't think it's my place as a
westerner who hasn't spent a lot

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:23.270
of time in China to talk

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:28.620
about what China
should and shouldn't do.

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.770
But I will say that
it's really important

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.300
to understand scapegoating.

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.680
It happens all the time.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.510
It's happening in our
current political culture.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:42.790
You know, rather
than paying attention

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:47.770
to what are the real causes
of things, it's much easier

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:52.050
to point at -- there's a lot
pointing at groups right now

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:55.980
and say, "They're
causing the problem."

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.320
And maybe a few people

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.340
in the group may be causing
the problem, but a few people

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.610
in your own group are
also causing problems.

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.690
So, it's a lot easier
to scapegoat others

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:13.970
than to actually try to figure
out what's really going wrong,

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.060
what the causes are and then
heaven forbid actually do

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.600
something about it.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.930
So, to me the whole -- and I
will say in my life the learning

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.690
to understand that
I too have a shadow.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:33.810
I do things, say
things occasionally,

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:39.380
try not to say things, a little
easier, but do things that come

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.340
out of, you know, a part
of myself that's not --

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.090
that's not my best self.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:48.350
And the trick, of course, is
to catch it before you do it

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.490
so that you can integrate that
knowledge into who you are

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.710
and become a more
whole, more integrated,

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:56.860
usually more compassionate
person.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:01.800
Because once you see,
I'll just -- this is --

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:07.250
when I was in graduate school I
discovered in a moment of fear

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.560
that I get very belligerent
when threatened

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.070
and I might even be
capable of murder.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.390
I don't know that, but I've been

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:18.020
in other situations
where I've wondered.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.450
If I, you know, had.

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:21.330
So, that's really
useful knowledge.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:25.460
No, I'm not going
to shoot you all.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:30.930
It's -- it helps you understand
that other people, right,

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:34.910
who don't have the resources
of intellect and money and time

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:38.200
and all the privileges
that we have,

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.580
and maybe have a gun available,
can fire off really fast.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.530
And that doesn't mean
somehow you're not responsible

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:49.550
for what you do, but
it complicates it

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:52.810
and I think it makes
you more compassionate

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:59.190
and we can certainly use more
compassion, more understanding.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.490
Which doesn't mean, as I said,

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:04.580
it doesn't mean you're not
responsible, but you see more

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:09.010
and you're probably
a little more humble.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:11.480
And I say in the
shadow of the capital,

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.690
a little more humility
and self-reflection.

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:20.430
So, we a little after 5 and
I was supposed to stop at 5?

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:21.730
Let's --

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr.
Brown, wonderful.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.940
Thank you very much.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.350
I really appreciate it.

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:31.990

of the Library of Congress.
