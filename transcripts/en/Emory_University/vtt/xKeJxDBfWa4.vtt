00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.920
My name is George Chang. I'm currently the Clinical Chief of Cardiology

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.359
at Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital for School of Medicine.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.199
I'm an interventional cardiologist, which basically means that I do a lot of the catheterization

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.740
procedures, which is diagnostic and also therapeutic.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.580
I grew up mostly in Texas — Austin, Texas. My dad was a professor at the University of Texas,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.800
so we kinda grew up there. and then he moved to NASA and worked for NASA, and then I grew up near Clear Lake and Houston, Texas.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.740
I went to Baylor undergraduate in Waco, Texas.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.460
I grew up, just because of my environment with my father working at NASA,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.400
actually wanting to be an astronaut, so that's kind of what drew me into the Air Force.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.440
And I went through the Air Force and actually had an accident, broke my neck, and so that kinda

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.660
took out the astronaut options, so then I became a doctor. So I'm a disabled veteran, by the way.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.340
I am a avid wine connoisseur, I guess, or "snob" some people call it snob.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.790
I like to travel, when I can, but because of my wine habit I tend to travel to France.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.470
I have a dog — two dogs -- a French Bulldog and a Schnauzer, white Schnauzer.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.330
A typical day usually starts with a meeting at 7:00 and then I usually see patients

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.070
come in early, round on my in-patients that I have in the hospital,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.460
because I have my own interventional service with our PAs.  Then I go see my clinic patients.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.500
And then in the afternoon it's all hit or miss, it depends on what day of a week it is.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.640
One of my mentors told me a long time ago, when I just started,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.380
as long as you take care of your patients, they will take care of you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.980
and that's kind of what my focus has been. That I've always try to treat my patients

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.950
like I would want to be treated or my father would want to be treated.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.580
You know, my belief really is the more your patients know,  the better the care they get,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.280
because they can become partners in their care as opposed to you just telling them what to do.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.640
There have been a few patients that I know, if I hadn't worked on, they would have died,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.580
and I get Christmas cards from their family every year thanking me.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:31.840
So that so that to me is probably the best real legacy I can leave.
