well they know they're being told oh

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
well they know they're being told oh
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.940
well they know they're being told oh
yeah they know well it's one of the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
yeah they know well it's one of the
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.049
yeah they know well it's one of the
things that's so interesting about

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
things that's so interesting about
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.120
things that's so interesting about
dealing with archetypal themes you know

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
dealing with archetypal themes you know
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.160
dealing with archetypal themes you know
archetypal themes are archetypal because

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
archetypal themes are archetypal because
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.380
archetypal themes are archetypal because
they actually speak of the structure of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
they actually speak of the structure of
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750
they actually speak of the structure of
human experience that's why they last

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
human experience that's why they last
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810
human experience that's why they last
and so it's human nature and human

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
and so it's human nature and human
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019
and so it's human nature and human
experience has a pattern you don't have

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
experience has a pattern you don't have
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970
experience has a pattern you don't have
the capacity to articulate that pattern

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
the capacity to articulate that pattern
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620
the capacity to articulate that pattern
as an individual in part because your

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
as an individual in part because your
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600
as an individual in part because your
life is too short you just can't figure

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
life is too short you just can't figure
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.869
life is too short you just can't figure
it out but the the ancient

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879
it out but the the ancient
 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.680
it out but the the ancient
representations of those patterns are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
representations of those patterns are
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.049
representations of those patterns are
everywhere around you and you you know

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
everywhere around you and you you know
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.090
everywhere around you and you you know
some of them in image you you cotton on

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
some of them in image you you cotton on
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400
some of them in image you you cotton on
to them automatically you you you fall

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
to them automatically you you you fall
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840
to them automatically you you you fall
into them if you go to a movie for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
into them if you go to a movie for
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340
into them if you go to a movie for
example because movies always express

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
example because movies always express
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.830
example because movies always express
archetypal themes if you hear them

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
archetypal themes if you hear them
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.830
archetypal themes if you hear them
articulated you think I knew that I knew

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
articulated you think I knew that I knew
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330
articulated you think I knew that I knew
that I just don't know how to say it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
that I just don't know how to say it
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.590
that I just don't know how to say it
that's that's the Platonic idea of of

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600
that's that's the Platonic idea of of
 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.330
that's that's the Platonic idea of of
learning is remembering your your soul

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
learning is remembering your your soul
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.070
about watching my lectures let's say
they say they basically say one of two

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
they say they basically say one of two
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260

know yeah it's like yeah well that's
exactly right because that's what

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
exactly right because that's what
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539
exactly right because that's what
archetypal stories are they're the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
archetypal stories are they're the
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.700
archetypal stories are they're the
description of what you already know but

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
description of what you already know but
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580
description of what you already know but
that can be articulated and then who you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
that can be articulated and then who you
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.190
that can be articulated and then who you
are and how you see yourself and the way

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
are and how you see yourself and the way
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960
are and how you see yourself and the way
you describe yourself or all become the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
you describe yourself or all become the
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.240
you describe yourself or all become the
same thing so that's wonderful then

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
same thing so that's wonderful then
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679
same thing so that's wonderful then
you're not at odds with yourself you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
you're not at odds with yourself you
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.210
you're not at odds with yourself you
know and then you have then you're a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
know and then you have then you're a
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.679
know and then you have then you're a
functioning unity and that makes you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
functioning unity and that makes you
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330
functioning unity and that makes you
much stronger and more in dormant than

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
much stronger and more in dormant than
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039
much stronger and more in dormant than
you would otherwise be and then the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
you would otherwise be and then the
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.420
you would otherwise be and then the
other thing that people say and this is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
other thing that people say and this is

and about half of them a third to half
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.520
and about half of them a third to half
of them estate afterwards to talk to me

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
