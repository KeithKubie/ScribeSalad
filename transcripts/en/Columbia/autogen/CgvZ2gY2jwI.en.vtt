was very very old and Darwin's own

of species change he first explored what

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:57.610
of species change he first explored what
 

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.990
of species change he first explored what
would be the causes of this change and

would be the causes of this change and
 

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.120
would be the causes of this change and
initially Darwin had what we would take

initially Darwin had what we would take
 

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.660
initially Darwin had what we would take
to be Lamarckian notions of the causes

to be Lamarckian notions of the causes
 

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.510
to be Lamarckian notions of the causes
of such change namely the effects of the

of such change namely the effects of the
 

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.310
of such change namely the effects of the
environment which are inherited by

had been swiped from him and he thought
 

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.700
had been swiped from him and he thought
that honor required him to stop working

on his own theory his friends had to
convince them and probably they didn't

way about human evolution he made a

way about human evolution he made a
 

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.810
way about human evolution he made a
decision that he did not want to talk

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:34.820
decision that he did not want to talk
 

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.250
decision that he did not want to talk
about human evolution in the Origin

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:36.260
about human evolution in the Origin

because he thought that everybody would

because he thought that everybody would
focus on that and that it would distract

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:40.490
focus on that and that it would distract
 

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.310
focus on that and that it would distract
from the

from the
the arguments that he was making for the

the arguments that he was making for the
 

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:46.659

focused only what on what the

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:54.260
focused only what on what the
 

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.310
focused only what on what the
implications were for human beings so he

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320
implications were for human beings so he
 

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.560
implications were for human beings so he
was forted in that respect and finally

00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.570
was forted in that respect and finally
 

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.909
was forted in that respect and finally
came out with the descent of man in 1871

now if we go back and look at some of

now if we go back and look at some of
 

00:29:05.659 --> 00:29:08.799
now if we go back and look at some of
his early notes books I think the

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:08.809
his early notes books I think the
 

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:12.039
his early notes books I think the
structure of the origin becomes much

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:12.049
structure of the origin becomes much
 

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:16.539
structure of the origin becomes much
more obvious so here is a passage from

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:16.549
more obvious so here is a passage from
 

00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:20.409
more obvious so here is a passage from
his a notebook in which he writes and

00:29:20.409 --> 00:29:20.419
his a notebook in which he writes and
 

00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:22.299
his a notebook in which he writes and
here he's working on a certain problem

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:22.309
here he's working on a certain problem
 

00:29:22.309 --> 00:29:25.049
here he's working on a certain problem
it's a problem that biologists today are

00:29:25.049 --> 00:29:25.059
it's a problem that biologists today are
 

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:28.090
it's a problem that biologists today are
still quite curious about and I suspect

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.100
still quite curious about and I suspect
 

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.789
still quite curious about and I suspect
many in this audience or even curious

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799
many in this audience or even curious
 

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:33.760
many in this audience or even curious
about and the problem is why is there

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:33.770
about and the problem is why is there
 

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:39.730
about and the problem is why is there
sex that is a more primitive form of

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:39.740
sex that is a more primitive form of
 

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.500
sex that is a more primitive form of
reproduction is what we would call

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:41.510
reproduction is what we would call
 

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.200
reproduction is what we would call
clonal reproduction that is asexual

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.210
clonal reproduction that is asexual
 

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.419
clonal reproduction that is asexual
reproduction budding efficient and so

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:46.429
reproduction budding efficient and so
 

00:29:46.429 --> 00:29:50.639
reproduction budding efficient and so

forth engaged in for example by a lot of
 

00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:54.340
forth engaged in for example by a lot of
invertebrates so the question is why

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.350
invertebrates so the question is why
 

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.580
invertebrates so the question is why

wasn't that the predominant mode of
 

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.980
wasn't that the predominant mode of
reproduction what is the origin of

reproduction what is the origin of
 

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.610
reproduction what is the origin of
sexuality and in his notebook Darwin

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:03.620
sexuality and in his notebook Darwin
 

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.490
sexuality and in his notebook Darwin
speculates about this and he forms an

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:06.500
speculates about this and he forms an
 

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.440
speculates about this and he forms an
argument and this is the argument he

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.450
argument and this is the argument he
 

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.899
argument and this is the argument he
says my theory gives great final cause

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:10.909

of sexes for otherwise there would be as

of sexes for otherwise there would be as
 

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.970
of sexes for otherwise there would be as
many species as individuals and what he

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:15.980
many species as individuals and what he
 

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.750
many species as individuals and what he
seems to have thought is that through

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760

each individual would be like an
 

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.460
each individual would be like an
individual species and he goes on if all

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:27.470
individual species and he goes on if all
 

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.350
individual species and he goes on if all
species that is if all individuals were

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360
species that is if all individuals were
 

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.659
species that is if all individuals were
species then there would not be social

00:30:31.659 --> 00:30:31.669
species then there would not be social
 

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:33.940

formation of sex is rigidly necessary

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:50.570
formation of sex is rigidly necessary
 

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.889

just going to ask you a question if

you've if you look at that very

carefully and some of you have taken
 

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:12.020
carefully and some of you have taken
biology courses what strikes you about

is perplexing but you know what the

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:29.420
is perplexing but you know what the
 

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.569
is perplexing but you know what the
answer is it's an answer that Darwin

00:54:31.569 --> 00:54:31.579
answer is it's an answer that Darwin
 

00:54:31.579 --> 00:54:34.210
answer is it's an answer that Darwin
struggled with and it only at the last

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:34.220
struggled with and it only at the last
 

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.219
struggled with and it only at the last
minute as it were solved and it's the

00:54:36.219 --> 00:54:36.229
minute as it were solved and it's the
 

00:54:36.229 --> 00:54:39.339
minute as it were solved and it's the
answer that we accept today and you get

00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:39.349
answer that we accept today and you get
 

00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:52.440

extra credit if you know

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.450
 
 

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.570
 
okay basically you've got exactly the

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:54.580
okay basically you've got exactly the
 

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.730
okay basically you've got exactly the
right answer namely natural selection

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:56.740
right answer namely natural selection
 

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.130
right answer namely natural selection
works on the whole hive are on the whole

that nest has say more aggressive bees
just by chance that nest is going to

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960
just by chance that nest is going to
 

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.700
just by chance that nest is going to
have a better chance of surviving in a

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:11.710
have a better chance of surviving in a
 

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.350
have a better chance of surviving in a
competitive environment than other nests

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:13.360

so it's the natural selection works on
 

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:49.290
so it's the natural selection works on

is not necessarily that legatee that we
 

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.599
is not necessarily that legatee that we
have inherited it it's different from

00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:50.609
have inherited it it's different from
 

00:58:50.609 --> 00:58:54.079
have inherited it it's different from
that but it's because of Darwin's

00:58:54.079 --> 00:58:54.089
that but it's because of Darwin's
 

00:58:54.089 --> 00:58:56.750
that but it's because of Darwin's
accomplishment that we have modern

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760
accomplishment that we have modern
 

00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:24.580
accomplishment that we have modern
biology today thank you very much

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:24.590
 
 

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:27.260
 
so you have let's see there's some in

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:27.270
so you have let's see there's some in
 

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:36.020
so you have let's see there's some in
the back here yeah that's fine hi thank

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.030
the back here yeah that's fine hi thank
 

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.730
the back here yeah that's fine hi thank
you for the lecture I was wondering

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740
you for the lecture I was wondering
 

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.250
you for the lecture I was wondering
about Darwin's idea of perfection it

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:40.260
about Darwin's idea of perfection it
 

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.860
about Darwin's idea of perfection it
seems to me that perfection can only be

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:42.870
seems to me that perfection can only be
 

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.150
seems to me that perfection can only be
applied when you have a purpose to

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160
applied when you have a purpose to
 

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.040
applied when you have a purpose to
achieve does he believe and if you

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:46.050
achieve does he believe and if you
 

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.150
achieve does he believe and if you
believes in perfection does he believe

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160
believes in perfection does he believe
 

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.320
believes in perfection does he believe
in a purpose for the species well I

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:51.330
in a purpose for the species well I
 

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:54.170
in a purpose for the species well I
think Darwin the concept of perfection

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180
think Darwin the concept of perfection
 

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.900
think Darwin the concept of perfection
is one that Darwin initially begins with

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:56.910
is one that Darwin initially begins with
 

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:58.880
is one that Darwin initially begins with
so in his early notebooks you see him

00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:58.890
so in his early notebooks you see him
 

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.970
so in his early notebooks you see him
talking about through the process that

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980
talking about through the process that
 

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.620
talking about through the process that
he has outlined perfection being

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:03.630
he has outlined perfection being
 

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.010
he has outlined perfection being
achieved after all the vertebrate eye

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:06.020
achieved after all the vertebrate eye
 

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.580
achieved after all the vertebrate eye
looks like a pretty extraordinary

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:09.590
looks like a pretty extraordinary
 

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:14.090
looks like a pretty extraordinary
accomplishment and in Paley's natural

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:14.100
accomplishment and in Paley's natural
 

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.680
accomplishment and in Paley's natural
theology something that Darwin had to

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:15.690
theology something that Darwin had to
 

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:18.680
theology something that Darwin had to
read as a student Paley uses the eye as

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:18.690
read as a student Paley uses the eye as
 

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.070
read as a student Paley uses the eye as
the example of a product that can only

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:22.080
the example of a product that can only
 

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.520
the example of a product that can only
be attributed to the Creator because it

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:25.530
be attributed to the Creator because it
 

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:29.120
be attributed to the Creator because it
is so well designed that there is no

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.130
is so well designed that there is no
 

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:30.890
is so well designed that there is no
other account that can be given except

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900
other account that can be given except
 

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:36.230
other account that can be given except
the direct creation by God Darwin had to

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240
the direct creation by God Darwin had to
 

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.120
the direct creation by God Darwin had to
argue that it could be created in

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.130
argue that it could be created in
 

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.310
argue that it could be created in
another fashion through the operation of

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:40.320
another fashion through the operation of
 

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.180
another fashion through the operation of
natural processes and he he he lost the

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:44.190
natural processes and he he he lost the
 

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:46.730
natural processes and he he he lost the
notion that perfection was achievable

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740
notion that perfection was achievable
 

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.010
notion that perfection was achievable
that is whatever organism were talking

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020
that is whatever organism were talking
 

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.440
that is whatever organism were talking
about could always be better but he

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:51.450
about could always be better but he
 

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.540
about could always be better but he
didn't lose the idea that there's a kind

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:53.550
didn't lose the idea that there's a kind
 

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.780
didn't lose the idea that there's a kind
of trajectory of improvement and the

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:56.790
of trajectory of improvement and the
 

01:00:56.790 --> 01:01:00.010
of trajectory of improvement and the
vertebrate eye he was happy to note

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:00.020
vertebrate eye he was happy to note

great German physiologist polymath in
 

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.120
great German physiologist polymath in
describing the I pointed out the

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:08.130
describing the I pointed out the
 

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.460
describing the I pointed out the
imperfections of the eye and that that

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:10.470
imperfections of the eye and that that
 

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:12.350
imperfections of the eye and that that
really satisfied Darwin a great deal

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:12.360
really satisfied Darwin a great deal
 

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.500
really satisfied Darwin a great deal
because he saw that the eye while it was

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:14.510
because he saw that the eye while it was
 

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:16.850
because he saw that the eye while it was
extraordinary in its design nonetheless

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:16.860
extraordinary in its design nonetheless
 

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.670
extraordinary in its design nonetheless
had imperfections which could be

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680
had imperfections which could be
 

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.110
had imperfections which could be
attributed to the actions of nature

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:21.120
attributed to the actions of nature
 

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.400
attributed to the actions of nature
so he had a relative notion of

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:24.410
so he had a relative notion of
 

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:28.400
so he had a relative notion of
perfection but he did think that that

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:28.410
perfection but he did think that that
 

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:30.770
perfection but he did think that that
the natural processes were producing

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780
the natural processes were producing
 

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:37.970
the natural processes were producing
greater progress and perfection so back

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980
greater progress and perfection so back
 

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:45.340
greater progress and perfection so back
there again you touched a little bit on

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:45.350
there again you touched a little bit on
 

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.450
there again you touched a little bit on
Darwin's opinion regarding the evolution

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460
Darwin's opinion regarding the evolution

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:55.350
came to the answer to his question and I
 

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:57.860
came to the answer to his question and I
was just thinking that isn't the current

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:57.870
was just thinking that isn't the current
 

01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:01.630
was just thinking that isn't the current
opinion nowadays that in environmentally

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640
opinion nowadays that in environmentally
 

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.420
opinion nowadays that in environmentally
environments that are fluctuating

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.430
environments that are fluctuating
 

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.200
environments that are fluctuating
unstable environments greater variation

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:08.210
unstable environments greater variation
 

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:13.820
unstable environments greater variation
in genes causes give means a higher

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:13.830
in genes causes give means a higher
 

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.780
in genes causes give means a higher
likelihood of survival for a species and

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:16.790
likelihood of survival for a species and
 

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:20.530
likelihood of survival for a species and
me because of the process of sex and

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:20.540
me because of the process of sex and
 

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.770
me because of the process of sex and
meiosis and the gene pool basically

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780
meiosis and the gene pool basically
 

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.900
meiosis and the gene pool basically
expands and so in fluctuating

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:26.910
expands and so in fluctuating
 

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.020
expands and so in fluctuating
environments it's preferable to have

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:30.030
environments it's preferable to have
 

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:33.830
environments it's preferable to have
sexually reproducing animals yes I mean

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:33.840
sexually reproducing animals yes I mean
 

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.380
sexually reproducing animals yes I mean
that that that is one of the tactics in

quite well and they have been around
 

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:55.220
quite well and they have been around
since the beginning and they have

reproduction is quite simple and for the
 

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.790
reproduction is quite simple and for the
most part asexual although I'm sure

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:04.800
most part asexual although I'm sure
 

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.560

you're going to tell me this that

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:06.570
you're going to tell me this that
 

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.750
you're going to tell me this that
occasionally they get together and

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760
occasionally they get together and
 

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.910
occasionally they get together and
exchange genes which is something like

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920
exchange genes which is something like
 

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.270
exchange genes which is something like
sexual reproduction so Darwin thought

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280
sexual reproduction so Darwin thought
 

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.780
sexual reproduction so Darwin thought
when he was trying to he never himself I

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:17.790
when he was trying to he never himself I
 

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.100
when he was trying to he never himself I
think solved the problem to his

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:19.110
think solved the problem to his
 

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.110
think solved the problem to his
satisfaction but he did recognize that

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:21.120
satisfaction but he did recognize that
 

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.890
satisfaction but he did recognize that
in clonal reproduction if accidents

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900
in clonal reproduction if accidents
 

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.690
in clonal reproduction if accidents
happen to an organism those accidents

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700
happen to an organism those accidents
 

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.090
happen to an organism those accidents
that is unfavorable situations get

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:29.100
that is unfavorable situations get
 

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.460
that is unfavorable situations get
passed on as well so there is not the

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:31.470
passed on as well so there is not the
 

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.780
passed on as well so there is not the
means as Darwin says and that's really

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:33.790
means as Darwin says and that's really
 

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.210
means as Darwin says and that's really
close to what our contemporary notion is

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:36.220
close to what our contemporary notion is
 

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.180
close to what our contemporary notion is
is you've just explained it that there's

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:39.190
is you've just explained it that there's
 

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.609
is you've just explained it that there's
greater possibility of change there's

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:41.619
greater possibility of change there's
 

01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:44.370
greater possibility of change there's
greater variability such that that can

greater variability such that that can
 

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.530
greater variability such that that can

away and as it were the the I the
 

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.290

did and he decided that he would assign

did and he decided that he would assign
 

01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:33.990

the Origin of Species and so he read it

the Origin of Species and so he read it
 

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.500

the hell cares about fruit fly genetics
well of course in a certain sense we

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:18.530
well of course in a certain sense we
 

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.650
well of course in a certain sense we
don't care about fruit fly genetics we

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:20.660
don't care about fruit fly genetics we
 

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.900
don't care about fruit fly genetics we
care about human genetics but the best

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:22.910
care about human genetics but the best
 

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:25.390
care about human genetics but the best
way to understand human genetics is to

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400
way to understand human genetics is to
 

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.970
way to understand human genetics is to
look at fruit flies where the processes

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:27.980
look at fruit flies where the processes
 

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.970
look at fruit flies where the processes
are simpler and more easily graspable so

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980
are simpler and more easily graspable so
 

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.590
are simpler and more easily graspable so
I guess at the same sense I would say

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:32.600
I guess at the same sense I would say
 

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.350
I guess at the same sense I would say
but look what we we are interested in

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:35.360
but look what we we are interested in
 

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.650
but look what we we are interested in
other animals but is it a mistake to be

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:38.660
other animals but is it a mistake to be
 

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.900
other animals but is it a mistake to be
even more interested in ourselves and

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:40.910
even more interested in ourselves and
 

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:43.750
even more interested in ourselves and
the processes that govern us we differ

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760
the processes that govern us we differ
 

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.340
the processes that govern us we differ
from other animals but one of the ways

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:45.350
from other animals but one of the ways
 

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.870
from other animals but one of the ways
in which we differ I think is pretty

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880
in which we differ I think is pretty
 

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.230
in which we differ I think is pretty
clear is that we have a moral structure

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240
clear is that we have a moral structure
 

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.400
clear is that we have a moral structure

eminent evolutionary biologists would

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:56.660
eminent evolutionary biologists would
 

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.380
eminent evolutionary biologists would
say that look what evolution teaches us

01:06:59.380 --> 01:06:59.390
say that look what evolution teaches us
 

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.290
say that look what evolution teaches us
is that we are ultimately selfish we

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:02.300
is that we are ultimately selfish we
 

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.060
is that we are ultimately selfish we
have been produced by natural selection

have been produced by natural selection
 

01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.920

four traits that are beneficial to the
 

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.460
four traits that are beneficial to the

kind of moral character that we

01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:27.490
perspective on that and I respect ofwhat
well worth considering and I think

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:27.500
well worth considering and I think
 

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.600
well worth considering and I think
there's a good deal of empirical

there's a good deal of empirical

really gave foundation for our

ratios of outcome in the production of
 

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:49.189
ratios of outcome in the production of
hybrid peas but when you looked at the

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199
hybrid peas but when you looked at the
 

01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:52.030

so the question is did Mendel sort of

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140
so the question is did Mendel sort of
 

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.690
so the question is did Mendel sort of
