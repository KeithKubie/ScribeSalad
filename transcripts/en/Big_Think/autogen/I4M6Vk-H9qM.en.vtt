to me it's amazing some of the things

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
to me it's amazing some of the things
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.009
to me it's amazing some of the things
that we actually do know you know

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
that we actually do know you know
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.150
that we actually do know you know
there's plenty of things that are

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
there's plenty of things that are
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.310
there's plenty of things that are
conjecture or theories but there's a lot

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
conjecture or theories but there's a lot
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.049
conjecture or theories but there's a lot
of stuff that we have real observations

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
of stuff that we have real observations
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.750
of stuff that we have real observations
and real knowledge of and amazingly to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
and real knowledge of and amazingly to

is actually a real fact not a theory

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
is actually a real fact not a theory
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.640
is actually a real fact not a theory
that when you look back at how the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
that when you look back at how the
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620
that when you look back at how the
universe looked about saved say 13

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
universe looked about saved say 13
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.100

billion years ago the chemistry was very

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
billion years ago the chemistry was very
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.439
billion years ago the chemistry was very
very different we can actually see so

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449
very different we can actually see so
 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.080
very different we can actually see so
far away out into space that the light

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
far away out into space that the light
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790
far away out into space that the light
were looking at took billions and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
were looking at took billions and
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380
were looking at took billions and
billions of years to get to us even at

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
billions of years to get to us even at
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.330
billions of years to get to us even at
the speed of light and the farthest away

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
the speed of light and the farthest away
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.450
the speed of light and the farthest away
we can see is to a time that was about

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460
we can see is to a time that was about
 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.770
we can see is to a time that was about
400,000 years after the Big Bang that's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
400,000 years after the Big Bang that's
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.510
400,000 years after the Big Bang that's
pretty impressive that's about 13 and a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
pretty impressive that's about 13 and a
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.790
pretty impressive that's about 13 and a
half billion years ago and when you look

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
half billion years ago and when you look
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.760
half billion years ago and when you look
back that far the only thing you see is

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770
back that far the only thing you see is
 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.250
back that far the only thing you see is
very hot hydrogen gas a little bit of

very hot hydrogen gas a little bit of
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020
very hot hydrogen gas a little bit of
helium tying a bit of lithium but that's

helium tying a bit of lithium but that's
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720
helium tying a bit of lithium but that's
it that's not theory that's actually an

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
it that's not theory that's actually an
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.660
it that's not theory that's actually an
observation and as you look at galaxies

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
observation and as you look at galaxies
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.459
observation and as you look at galaxies
very far away in space and therefore

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469
very far away in space and therefore
 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.800
very far away in space and therefore
very far back in time you can actually

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
very far back in time you can actually
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.270
very far back in time you can actually
watch the chemistry change you watch

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
watch the chemistry change you watch
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580
watch the chemistry change you watch
different atoms get built up and the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
different atoms get built up and the
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140
different atoms get built up and the
only thing in the universe that we know

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
only thing in the universe that we know
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840
only thing in the universe that we know
that can make a large atom by large I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
that can make a large atom by large I
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.840
that can make a large atom by large I
mean something like oxygen or carbon or

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
mean something like oxygen or carbon or
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.980
mean something like oxygen or carbon or
calcium or anything that makes up our

hydrogen was formed during the Big Bang

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
hydrogen was formed during the Big Bang
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
hydrogen was formed during the Big Bang
you take these hydrogen atoms you smash

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510
you take these hydrogen atoms you smash
 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.060
you take these hydrogen atoms you smash
them together and you build larger and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
them together and you build larger and
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.010
them together and you build larger and
larger atoms until you build something

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
larger atoms until you build something
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660
larger atoms until you build something
like the carbon that makes up most of my

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
like the carbon that makes up most of my
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.020

and so we've known for a while that the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
and so we've known for a while that the
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.789
and so we've known for a while that the
only way you get these large atoms is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
only way you get these large atoms is
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.910
only way you get these large atoms is
stars but even with something as

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
stars but even with something as
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280
stars but even with something as
powerful as the core of a star there

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
powerful as the core of a star there
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780

were some atoms that were a little bit

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
were some atoms that were a little bit
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310
were some atoms that were a little bit
more slippery we couldn't quite figure

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
more slippery we couldn't quite figure
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319
more slippery we couldn't quite figure
out how you get the energy needed to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
out how you get the energy needed to
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.789
out how you get the energy needed to
make something really big like a Gold

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
make something really big like a Gold
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.460
make something really big like a Gold
atom that should take even higher

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470
atom that should take even higher
 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.380
atom that should take even higher
temperatures even more energy than what

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
temperatures even more energy than what
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789
temperatures even more energy than what
you typically find in the core of a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
you typically find in the core of a
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.429
you typically find in the core of a
massive star so what is even more

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
massive star so what is even more
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.429
massive star so what is even more
violent than an exploding massive star

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
violent than an exploding massive star
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139
violent than an exploding massive star
which makes a lot of the heavy elements

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
which makes a lot of the heavy elements
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630
which makes a lot of the heavy elements
of the universe one of the things we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
of the universe one of the things we
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360
of the universe one of the things we
discovered recently is that two dead

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
discovered recently is that two dead
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.970
discovered recently is that two dead
cores of stars called neutron stars can

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
cores of stars called neutron stars can
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.839
cores of stars called neutron stars can
actually spiral together and core

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849
actually spiral together and core
 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.660
actually spiral together and core
and when they collide instead of a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
and when they collide instead of a
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.819
and when they collide instead of a
normal death of an exploding star

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829
normal death of an exploding star
 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.199

you basically have something like that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
you basically have something like that
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.270
you basically have something like that
on steroids you have an explosion that's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
on steroids you have an explosion that's
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.429
on steroids you have an explosion that's
so big and so violent people have really

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439
so big and so violent people have really
 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.750
so big and so violent people have really
seen nothing like it since the Big Bang

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760
seen nothing like it since the Big Bang
 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.030
seen nothing like it since the Big Bang
they call this uh sometimes they call it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040
they call this uh sometimes they call it
 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.559
they call this uh sometimes they call it
a hypernova sometimes they call it a

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569
a hypernova sometimes they call it a
 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.330
a hypernova sometimes they call it a
gamma-ray burst because of the bursts of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
gamma-ray burst because of the bursts of
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940
gamma-ray burst because of the bursts of
high-energy radiation that comes out but

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
high-energy radiation that comes out but
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.099
high-energy radiation that comes out but
wonderfully we've been observing more

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109
wonderfully we've been observing more
 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.629
wonderfully we've been observing more
and more of these colliding neutron

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639
and more of these colliding neutron
 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.800
and more of these colliding neutron
stars and they are just pumping out gold

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
stars and they are just pumping out gold
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.989

bismuth because these very very large

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
bismuth because these very very large
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.300
bismuth because these very very large
difficult to form atoms and there is so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310
difficult to form atoms and there is so
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.069
difficult to form atoms and there is so
much gold created in one of these

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079
much gold created in one of these
 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.199
much gold created in one of these
explosions that if you just look at the

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
explosions that if you just look at the
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.189
explosions that if you just look at the
rate you know how many of these

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.199
rate you know how many of these
 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.740
rate you know how many of these
explosions do we observe amazingly we

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
explosions do we observe amazingly we
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.289
explosions do we observe amazingly we
observe about one a day and how much

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299
observe about one a day and how much
 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.449
observe about one a day and how much
gold is created in one of those and you

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
gold is created in one of those and you
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.729
gold is created in one of those and you
can actually account for the entire

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739
can actually account for the entire
 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.740
can actually account for the entire
abundance of gold in the universe just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750
abundance of gold in the universe just
 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.390
abundance of gold in the universe just
from that one thing those colliding

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
from that one thing those colliding
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.970
from that one thing those colliding
neutron stars so the gold you have I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
neutron stars so the gold you have I
 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.470
neutron stars so the gold you have I
mean yeah you have gold in your jewelry

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480
mean yeah you have gold in your jewelry
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.030
mean yeah you have gold in your jewelry
that's really cool I've got a gold ring

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040
that's really cool I've got a gold ring
 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.220
that's really cool I've got a gold ring
but innocently enough our neurons don't

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230
but innocently enough our neurons don't
 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.869
but innocently enough our neurons don't
work without a tiny little bit of gold

neurons in our brain we need a little

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540
neurons in our brain we need a little
 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.599
neurons in our brain we need a little
bit of gold a little bit of copper so

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609
bit of gold a little bit of copper so
 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.119
bit of gold a little bit of copper so
your brain wouldn't work without a

your brain wouldn't work without a
 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.039
your brain wouldn't work without a
little bit of gold a couple of gold

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049
little bit of gold a couple of gold
 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.589
little bit of gold a couple of gold
atoms in the neurons so the reason we're
