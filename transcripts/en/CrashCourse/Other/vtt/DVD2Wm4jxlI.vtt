00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
Have you ever wanted to know everything there
is to know about the people who watch your

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.440
YouTube show?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.680
Like, how many of them are educators, or learners,
whether they're just watching for fun, or

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.611
just when they're studying, how many teachers
are playing your videos in schools?

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.559
It's probably just me.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.760
Well, I don't care!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.980
Welcome to Crash Course Surveys, a one-episode
series here on Crash Course, where I implore

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
you to please fill out a survey so that we
can know more about our audience, how you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.220
use Crash Course, and how we can make better
content for you.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.539
Your answers to these questions are going
to help us refine our mission, maybe help

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.890
us raise money to make more great videos,
or even develop broader resources for learners

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.890
and educators!

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.360
Expand our reach and just generally make the
world a better place!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.570
So please, please please, help us out!

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.530
There are two surveys in the description below,
one is for educators, so people who are using

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.840
Crash Course to help other people learn, regardless
of the circumstances, and one is for learners

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.570
- people who are using Crash Course to help
themselves learn.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.690
Again, regardless of the circumstances.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.690
If you fall under both groups, fill out both
surveys!

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.629
Thank you so much for your dedication to and
interest in Crash Course.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.350
We're very proud of what we've built here,
and want very much to make it even better.
