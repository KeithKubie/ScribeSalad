00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.510
So the question was, does ConferenceForm have properties that

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.700
map to these properties in conference? Yes, the conference

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.020
form has a name property. The user's going to enter

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.100
the name of the conference when they create a

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.730
conference. And again, it has a topics property, because

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.130
the user's going to enter the topics when they create

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.920
the conference. But no, ConferenceForm doesn't have a property

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.920
for profile key. The profile key's going to be calculated based

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.950
on the profile that's the ancestor of the conference. And also

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.180
no, it doesn't have a month property, because the user doesn't

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.060
enter the month, they just enter a start date. And then

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.690
the conference constructor actually calculates the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.300
month, based on the start date.
