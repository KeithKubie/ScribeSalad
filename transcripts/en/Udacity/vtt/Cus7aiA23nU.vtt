00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.860
Okay, so that proof didn't work.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.660
Is there one that does?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.650
Well no.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.070
As it turns out,
the set of languages is uncountable.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.950
We'll prove this by contradiction.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.730
So, suppose not.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.100
That is to say, we'll let L1, L2 be the
set of languages over an alphabet sigma.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.160
Here, I'm giving them an enumeration.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.600
And we'll also let X1,
X2 etc be the strings in sigma star,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.550
we know that has an enumeration.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.100
We are then going to build a table where
the columns correspond to the strings

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.095
in sigma star, and
the rows correspond to the languages.

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:40.910
In each element in
the table will put a one.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.010
If the string is in the language and
we'll put a 0 if it is not.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.990
Now we're going to consider a very
sneaky langauge defined as follows.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.100
It consists of those strings Xi for
which Xi is not in the language Li.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.200
In effect, we've taken this diagonal
here in the table and just reversed it.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.140
Since we're assuming that the set
of languages is countable,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.230
this language must be Lk for some k.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.530
But is Xk in Lk or not?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.730
You see from the table here
we've defined the row Lk such

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.920
that in every column the entry is just
the opposite of what is on the diagonal.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.510
But this diagonal entry can't
be the opposite of itself.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.650
If Xk is Lk, then according to the rules
for Lk, it should not be an Lk.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.450
On the other hand, if Xk is not an Lk,
then it should be an Lk.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.330
Another way to think
about this argument,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.220
is to say that this language here must
be different from every row on the table

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.270
because it is different
on the diagonal element.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.030
In any case we have a contradiction and
can conclude that this enumeration of

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.580
the languages was invalid since
the rest of our reasoning was sound.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.090
This argument here is known as
the diagonalization trick and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.280
we'll see it come up again later,
when we discuss undecidability.
