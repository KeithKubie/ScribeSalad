00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.020
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Today, we'll be taking
the flame thrower arm

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.200
that we built in the previous video,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.860
and decorating it to make it
look a little bit more finished.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.640
[Music]

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.760
Our flame thrower arm
is built and functional.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.780
It's up and running.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.820
But at this point, it does look
thrown together, which it is.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.720
And if you like
the mad scientist look,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420
then this is doing pretty good.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.440
But I think what I want to be going
for is the cartoon Mad Scientist look,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.820
so I want to make it look all sort
of sleek and carefully put together.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.660
Here's what we're going to do.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.220
We've got some craft foam
that we'll cut, glue, and paint,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.910
and then attach onto
the flame thrower arm

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.180
to hopefully make it look
like a slick finished product,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.040
rather than the thrown together
workings of a mad engineer.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.640
There will be two basic
sections divided at the hinge.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.420
We'll have an upper arm portion,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.840
and a lower arm portion.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.780
These sheets of craft foam are
something that I love to use.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.960
I've used them quite a bit.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.219
They're quarter of an inch thick.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.280
I get them at Hobby Lobby,
where they cost $1.27 each.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.240
We've got a bunch of them,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.640
and now, we need to make them
look like something really cool.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.319
The wood frame that I have here
holding the bottles in place,

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.060
so I think that's kind
of going to be a guide.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.920
I'll try and make the foam
rest right up against that,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.600
that'll give it a little bit of support.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.380
You can see that this upper arm portion
is going to end up being fairly large,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.720
but overall, this is going to look
like a giant, bulky, crazy thing

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.680
that's going on my arm,
which is what I'm hoping for.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.260
[Music]

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.440
This handle's gotta be
able to move in and out.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.320
When its open, it fits.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
But when I close it, it runs into the foam,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.380
so we'll cut a little space for that.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.820
And we won't just leave that open.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.609
I'll end up going in and adding
some other little Ironman type box

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.100
to go around that or something.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:02:34.740
[Music]

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.560
All right.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.200
It's not like completely
strapped onto my arm.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.700
I'm holding it with my
other hand at the moment.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.320
But it's just a test fit with all of the
built on armor elements just to look good.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.040
The lights are going a little bit.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.020
Now, I need to take all the
decorative armor portions off,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.780
paint it all up,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.800
put it back on,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000
and attach the lighting
in a little bit more permanent way.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.240
And at that point,
this sucker will be good to go.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.340
Step 1, painting this foam is going
to be to hit it with the heat gun.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.860
We'll then go over it with
a couple of layers of Plasti-Dip,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.860
then a primer, and then our colors.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:04:01.420
[Music]

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.800
At this point, the cover piece that goes
on top of the flame thrower is now built.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.040
It's wired up with some electric lights,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.260
checking control with
a little knob on the side.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.980
I think it looks great.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.990
It looks metallic.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.400
It looks really cool.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.880
Very cartoon evil
mastermind sort of thing,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.100
which is what I was going for.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.380
Got our dragon logo here on the side.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.240
Let's fit this bad boy on.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.300
The two exhaust burners in the back

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.500
actually just fit right
over our propane tanks,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.249
and then we've got a little
circle up here in the front

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.040
that fits right over our solenoid.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.980
Once all three of those
connection points are on there,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.120
it actually does a pretty
good job of staying on.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.320
Pretty nice and snug.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.900
The hinge in the cosmetic arm
lines up pretty nicely with the hinge

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.629
and the functional part of the arm.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.240
Let's strap this thing on and give it a test.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.189
[Music]

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.700
Open the valve so we're
taking fuel from both tanks.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.400
[Music]

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.960
Yeah!

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.640
[Music]

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.820
It's so great!

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.020
[Music]

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.200
Guys, check out the other videos

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.000
where we showed you how we built
the internals of the flame thrower,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.320
and of course, where we just went out,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.080
and showed it off using
the thing, burning stuff.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.140
All that good fun.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.440
Guys, we've always got more
cool content for you to see.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.600
Check out more of the
flame thrower here on the side,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.700
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.300
you'll do subscribe to our channel
so you never miss out on a video.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.220
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.900
Talk to you then.
