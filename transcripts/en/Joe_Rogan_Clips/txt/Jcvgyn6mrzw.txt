Speaker 1:          00:00          I feel like we're at this cusp of something very strange happening. Like we're in the middle of it right now, but we're at the cusp of something very strange where all would take is one massive world event, one Matt to to completely remap how we view each other and how we view things. It's very disconcerting to me. This feels like without that one big world event, we're not that far away from them right now. There are parallel universes right now the exist on things that you were thought everyone can accept as a basic facts. Like what you know, um, uh, I mean Syria. Yeah, the white helmets that there, there are some fairly serious people saying the white helmets are, you know, some kind of media front for alk hydro on those. Would you explain the White Helmets for people? So when there's a, when there's a bombing and a building collapses, they go in and drag people out and get them medical attention as quick as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And people think that there somehow or another involved in it through our front, yeah. To to, and the, the footage is faked in order to drum up sympathy for the rebel held areas. I mean, that's, I've, I've heard, you know, serious people say that. Serious people. Yeah. Not, not, not loons on Facebook. I've heard, you know, journalists. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. I mean, I mean, Seymour Hersh I think has walked it back a little bit since, but he said that in the early days. Why do you think he believed it? I read a really interesting article about him just a few days ago. Where was it? Um, I forget what it was. It was, you know, the expose any but a really good look at, look at, look at him. And I think he's just spent his career believing rightly that the government lies about all kinds of things. And that's got me to a point where he thinks will, they always lie no matter what.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Um, so, and it's happened to a lot of journalists that Robert Fisk, a Cmo Hush, um, Martha Gellhorn during one of my favorite war correspondents of all time. I reread some of her stuff recently and the first batch of war reporting she did, I think is the best war reporting I've ever read. Spanish civil war Vietnam. Um, and then she spent 25 years writing novels and then later on wrote about, I believe it as the Yom Kippur war and was denying that massacres that happened and saying, you know, Arabs lie, they always lie. There was no massacre and we now know there was a massacre or there were massacres, um, in the aftermath of these, of these wars. Um, so I don't know what happened to me. Maybe if you just do this for too long, you just become so cynical that, that you're open to these things, but it's, yeah, I'm amazed at Seymour Hersh is, is open to that idea when the very people that are calling it, the very people that have boots on the ground that are in these war zones are and calling these things, when they become cynical and they become jaded, that's when it gets really, really sketchy.

Speaker 1:          02:43          And we rely so heavily on people like you. Like there's, I'm not going over there. You know what, Jeremy's not going over there. We're gonna. You know what I'm saying? I mean in in and you wouldn't be able to really get like I know people that gone to Venezuela and they come back and they go, I don't know what the fuck is going on over there. I don't know who to believe. I don't understand it. Venezuela is a very strange one and I get messages all the time and you know I've had Abby Martin who goes over there and she has one take on it and I have other people that I've talked to that have a different take on it and I do not know. I don't know who to believe and I think you'd have to go over there and do you have to spend a lot of time to try to figure this out and it would have to be the entire focus of your life to really try to Parse it out.

Speaker 1:          03:26          I think that's true of a lot of conflicts. I mean, one of the, one of the, one of the drawbacks of doing what I do is I'm covering seven or eight things at once. So I feel like I'm not expert enough. And even Afghanistan where I've covered, I've covered that more than any other. And, but the Venezuela is an interesting one cause it's, there's, there's such a left right divide on that. And if you support the opposition, then you find yourself alongside John Bolton and Donald Trump, which means that a lot of people are gonna automatically attack you right automatically. Even if it's correct. And I think it's, you know, we can say without a doubt the Maduro has destroyed the economy there. Maduro has imprisoned, beaten, killed journalists. Um, there is a movement there that do want genuine elections. Um, but some people will say, well, just because George Bush and another area or John Beltland this era support the opposition, therefore the opposition must be illegitimate and the information coming out must be, must be false.

Speaker 1:          04:21          And I wish people did rely on, on people who actually went there, but it doesn't feel like that. It feels like they rely on the, you know, the guy behind the glass desk on the, on the news when they were allowed opinion rather where people are actually there. While we still have this idea, DNR had that. The, the person who's reading the news is the authority and the Don Lemon has the inside scoop or whoever it is. You know, and I think it used to be that those guys would spend 20 or 30 years traveling and then that get the cushy job behind the glass desk in the studio. Now it seems like you can go straight to the cushy job behind the glass desk. Well, did we just need someone who's relatable, who can read a teleprompter, you know, who fits the profile that they're looking for, whether it's Fox News or CNN, you know, I know say the information is there. You know, there are fantastic documentaries, articles being written about all of these conflicts, right? People aren't reading them well with something like Venezuela that the real problem is you have two sides. You have two different versions of what's happening, and it's, if you're, if you're not educated in that country and you don't understand their politics, it's very difficult to figure out who's telling the truth. Truth. Yep. Same with Syria. Yeah. Yeah.
