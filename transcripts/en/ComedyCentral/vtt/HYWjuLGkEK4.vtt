  (laughter)

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.113 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I was like living with
this older single man

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.515 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  and it gets sad
  around the house,

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 sometimes, we're just
 two lonely hearts

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.153 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  haunting the same hallway,

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.588 align:start position:0%
 we barely talk to each other,
 just passing in the night.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.956
And it gets sad, the other day,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.892 size:88% position:44%
 I recently caught
 him making pancakes

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.728
 for himself, that's
 not a single man food.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.397 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.565
That's for your family.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.935 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's for your
beautiful wife Jeannine

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.738 size:88% position:44%
  and your fuckin' boys just
  won a hockey championship.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.240
 You getting around,
 slice up strawberries,

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:42.508
 you have a nice time.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.976
 Just one lonely man
 looking out the window

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.911 size:88% position:44%
  like that's pretty fluffy.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.180 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:50.416
That tastes better than the gun
I was gonna put in my mouth.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.085 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Well, it's been a lot
 of fun, thank you.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.222
(cheering and applause)

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - [Presenter] Casey
 James Salengo.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:01.127
 (upbeat music)

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.038
 (bell)

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.307
 - Hey, how you doin'?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm gonna take a turkey,
cheddar, lettuce,
tomato, pickles,

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.348 align:start position:0%
  mayo and mustard on a hard
  roll please, thank you.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.585
 Is that a hard roll?

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:27.787
 Is that the...

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:33.659
turkey, cheddar,
tomato, lettuce,

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:35.261
mayonnaise and mustard.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.200 size:88% position:44%
 And pickles if you got 'em.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.335
 - Ten bucks, please.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:44.938
- There's a 20,

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:49.876 size:84% position:42%
  and okay.

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.018 size:88% position:44%
 Not gonna eat that.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:01.020
Hey, how you doin', sir?

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:04.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
Can I get two steak
tacos, extra sour cream,

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.426
 and that'll do it, thank you.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:19.605 align:start position:0% line:0%
  - [Presenter] We're so
  thrilled to have him here.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:20.773 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - [Other Presenter]
 Oh, brother bear.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - [Presenter] Ladies
 and gentlemen,

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:22.475 line:0%
- [Presenters] Ryan Beck

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.078 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - You always hear
 this from older guys,

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.447 line:0%
 they go "oh college, that's
 the best time in your life."

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.816 align:start position:0% line:0%
 I was trying to figure out
 why older guys always tell you

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.685
 that college is the
 best time in your life

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:36.122
and I think it's because
college is the only time

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.724 size:88% position:44%
  in your life as a
  man when the women

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.660 size:88% position:44%
 are attracted to potential.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:41.894 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.864
 After that, they're
 very results-oriented.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:47.700 align:start size:88% position:13%
 My favorite class
 that I took in college

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.936 align:start position:0%
  was a black studies course
  for the whole dynamic

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.972 size:88% position:44%
 of the class was just like
 me and one other white dude

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in an auditorium
 full of black people

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:56.976 size:88% position:44%
 and then one day as
 part of the class,

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.712
we got tested on all of
the racial stereotypes

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.315 align:start position:0%
  for black people
  throughout all of history

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.717
 and they handed out the test
 and I started to fill it out

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.054 align:start position:0%
 and I realized "oh, I
 should not be the first one

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:08.888 size:88% position:44%
  "to turn this in."

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:10.856 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
 I'm trying to make eyes to
 the other white guy in class,

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.761
like "no, you go first."

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.964 size:88% position:44%
 - Hey, man.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.066
 - Hey, dude, what's goin' on?

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.134
 - Not much, how's your night?

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.337 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Pretty good, headed
to a gig, how about you?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.606
 - My night fucking sucks bro.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.473
- What's wrong?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.243 size:88% position:44%
 - Nobody will fuck me, man.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.944 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Don't say that
 dude, someone will.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.212
 - I mean what do I have to do?

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:34.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You look at me, what
 do I have to do?

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm out here every
 day, trying my hardest

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.785 align:start position:0%
  and then all the girls
  fuck all these gross guys.

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.020
 - Been there, brother,

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.588 size:88% position:44%
 I don't know what
 to tell you, sorry.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.824
- You've been there, a
nice tall guy like you?

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:45.958
 - Hey, it even happens to me.

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.827 size:88% position:44%
 - I bet you never jerk off.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.161 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I-
 - I got to sit at home

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:50.663 size:84% position:42%
  and I got to jerk
  off every night.

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:54.166 align:start position:0%
 I'm 35 year old and I jerk
 off all over the goddamn room.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.368 size:84% position:42%
  - All over the room, huh?

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.702
- I've jerked off every
day for three years,

00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:57.970 align:start size:88% position:13%
 just sit in my room,
 jerking my dick.

00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:59.138 size:88% position:44%
 - Wow that's tough.

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.773 size:88% position:44%
 - What do I got to do, man?

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.708
Tell me what I gotta do,
please, please, please,

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:03.843 size:88% position:44%
 just tell me anything, man-

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:04.844
- Can I just... you want advice?

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.012
 - Yes.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.380
- Listen, you're
a very nice guy-

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.214 size:84% position:42%
  - I know.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.048
- You're very friendly.

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:10.283 size:84% position:42%
  - I know.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.717
 - You've got a lot of
 positive qualities,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.686 align:start position:0%
 but there's one thing,
 you're covered in rice, dude

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and I feel like that's
 a big part of it.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:16.656
- Fuck you, man.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.124
 - Why though?

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:19.325 align:start position:0%
 - You think that I don't know
 that I'm covered in rice?

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.226
Everybody tells me that
I'm covered in rice.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.394 size:88% position:44%
  I'm a messy eater.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:22.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You know that you're
 covered in rice?

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:23.629
 - I love rice.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:25.264
 That doesn't mean that
 I don't deserve love

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.532 size:88% position:44%
 just because I like to eat.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:27.800
 - All right, man, well
 you'll figure it out-

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.735 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I love rice, I have
to be at my mom's house,

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:30.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
 jerking off for
 the rest of my life

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.238 size:88% position:44%
  because I can't eat right?

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
  - It's just too much rice.
  - Fuck you!

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.342
 (subway horn)

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.843 size:88% position:44%
  (cheering)

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.979 size:88% position:44%
  - We adopted a dog
  which has been...

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:41.714
She's so sweet, I love this dog.

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.516 align:start position:0%
  We rescued the dog,
  that's what you gotta do,

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:47.253 size:84% position:42%
  you gotta rescue the dogs
  because it is cheaper.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.487 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.190
Just so much cheaper,
$75 for my best friend.

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:52.725 size:88% position:44%
  You give the city 75 bucks

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:54.627 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then all you gotta
 do is check a box

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.063
 that says that you won't use
 the dog as a food source.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.764 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.833 size:84% position:42%
  That's it, that's
  all you gotta do.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.435
 I was like look, if
 we were gonna eat her,

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.103
 we would've got a bigger one.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:04.937 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.973
 (upbeat music)

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.275 align:start position:0%
 - [Presenter] Everybody,
 you're gonna love this guy.

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:12.345
Put your hands together
for Casey James Salengo.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.113 size:88% position:44%
  (applause)

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:14.981
- Thank you boys, how you doin'?

00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:18.951 size:88% position:44%
 Joe and Nick, how bout it
 folks, isn't that exciting?

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.720 size:88% position:44%
  (applause)

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.388
 Gonna be a hot rip here, boys.
