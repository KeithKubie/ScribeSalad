00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.390
Simplify the rate of cans of
soda compared to people.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.400
So this ratio here says that
we have 92 cans of soda for

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.920
every 28 people.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.400
What we want to do is simplify
this, and really just putting

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.930
this ratio, or this fraction,
in simplest form.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.670
So the best way to do that is
just to figure out what is the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.440
largest number, or the largest
common factor, of both 92 and

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.480
28, and divide both of these
numbers by that common factor.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.800
So let's figure out
what it is.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.320
And to do that, let's just take
the prime factorization

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.300
of 92, and then we'll do the
prime factorization of 28.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:46.820
So 92 is 2 times 46, which
is 2 times 23.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.360
And 23 is a prime number,
so we're done.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.940
92 is 2 times 2 times 23.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.400
And if we did the prime
factorization of 28, 28 is 2

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:06.100
times 14, which is 2 times 7.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.150
So we can rewrite the 92 cans of
soda as 2 times 2 times 23

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:31.530
cans of soda for every 2
times 2 times 7 people.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.920
Now, both of these numbers have
a 2 times 2 in it, or

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.060
they're both divisible by 4.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.770
That is their greatest
common factor.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.210
So let's divide both the
top number and the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060
bottom number by 4.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.625
So if you divide the top number
by 4, or if you divide

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.960
it by 2 times 2, it will cancel
out right over there.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.410
And then if you do the bottom
number divided by 4, or 2

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.330
times 2, it will cancel out
with that 2 times 2.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.080
And we are left with 23 cans of
soda for every 7 people, or

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.740
7 people for every
23 cans of soda.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.320
And we're done!

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.540
We've simplified the rate of
cans, or the ratio of cans, of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.260
soda compared to people.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.770
I guess they're considering this
a rate, so maybe they're

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.490
saying how quickly do 7 people
consume cans over some period,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.700
or you can view it as a ratio.
