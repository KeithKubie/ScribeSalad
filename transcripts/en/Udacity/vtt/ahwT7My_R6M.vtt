00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.520
So quickly, how can a source router adjust paths to a

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.750
destination when there are multiple paths

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.350
to the destination? Dropping packets to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.810
cause TCB backoff, alternating between multiple forwarding table entries to the

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.400
same destination, or sending alerts to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.380
incoming senders whenever a route changes.
