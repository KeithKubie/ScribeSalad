00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.640
So you can probably guess what this question would be. You

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.580
are going to find a persona created by one of your classmates

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.070
in use case. And you are going to create a feature

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.920
list and a flow for them. And once you've done that,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.480
you are going to respond to their post in the forum,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.620
and hopefully engage in the discussion. You can maximize your chances

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.930
of engaging in a discussion if you choose a student who

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.870
has posted recently. If you choose someone who posted six months ago,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.650
it might be hard. And hopefully the feature list info that you create for

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.540
this student persona in use case will be really perfect for them. But it might

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.100
not be. This stuff is not super trivial. And if it's not, that's good. Use

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.790
this as an opportunity to see where you went wrong and how you can improve.
