00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.120
NARRATOR: Salyut 7 Space
Station, July 12th, 1984.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.540
Cosmonauts Oleg Atkov, Leonid
Kazim, and Vladimir Solovyov

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.750
enter the 156 day
of their 237 day

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.330
stay aboard Russia's scientific
research space station.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.880
To date, everything has
gone according to plan.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.580
But on this day, all
three crew members

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.330
witness an extraordinary event.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.500
In 1984, Soviet
cosmonauts on board Salyut 7

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.830
saw a strange orange glow
around the spacecraft.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.670
And they saw what they thought,
at first, was maybe a gas leak.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.540
But it seemed that the
whole station was surrounded

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.880
by this orange cloud.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.960
And as they looked at it, the
cloud coalesced into a shape.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.250
NARRATOR: Suddenly they are all
blinded by this orange light.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.120
When they regain their
vision, they look out

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.920
the portals of the
spacecraft, and they are

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920
astonished by what they see.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.580
They describe seeing
seven angelic beings that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.380
are traveling alongside
their spacecraft,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.960
and did so for 10 minutes.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.170
The men described huge,
winged creatures--

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.790
as much as 80 feet tall, that
appeared to have glowing halos.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.830
Officials dismissed
the incident as a group

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.120
hallucination resulting
from oxygen deprivation

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.670
and pressure fluctuations.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.330
Later that summer,
three more cosmonauts

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.170
joined the Salyut 7 crew.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.830
All six of them, once again,
saw these winged beings.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.000
But how could all
of these cosmonauts

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.670
share one hallucination?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.960
It seems to me that this
was not hallucination.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.710
That whatever it was they
were witnessing, it was real.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.790
It was out there.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.960
Now, angels, aliens?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.540
I don't know.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.710
But when one looks at the
recurrence of winged figures

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.540
in human history, in terms of
religion, in terms of culture,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.040
mythology, are we looking
at something real?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.170
Are these angels that
we see-- actually,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.380
extraterrestrial entities?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.790
NARRATOR: Might
the winged figures

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.920
seen by the Salyut 7 crew really
have been extraterrestrials?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.420
and suggest that
similar sightings

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.750
were secretly recorded by
many Russian cosmonauts.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.080
Soviet cosmonauts had a really
interesting and challenging

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.880
dilemma when it came
to truth telling.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.540
Because at the same time that
they were the public face

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.750
of the Soviet space program,
there was the always hidden

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.580
goal of the Soviet
space program,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.880
which was to prove
intercontinental

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.750
ballistic missile capability.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.580
So the cosmonauts were publicly
to disguise those parts

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.540
of the mission that were
secret, and involved in national

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.330
security, making it all that
much more interesting when we

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.920
tried to assess what
they saw when they talk

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.120
about anomalous things
that they supposedly

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.460
encountered in space.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.080
You have to understand that
many cosmonauts, even if they

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.880
witnessed something
strange in space,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.290
were highly reluctant to
openly talk about it, because

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.040
of the concern of
being decommissioned

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.750
for the reason of insanity.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.290
Indeed, some of the Soviet,
and the Russian cosmonauts

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.290
did have very strange
experiences in space.
