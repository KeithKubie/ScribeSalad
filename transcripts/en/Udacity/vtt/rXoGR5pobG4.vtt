00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.457
We've used object 3D to give us access to a few extra transforms in the chain.

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.119
However, object 3D is designed for another purpose that is extremely useful.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.542
What object 3D does is create a parent child relationship between two objects.

00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:18.531
Once an object is a child of another object. That child is affected by whatever

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:22.478
is done to the parent. Here I'm sowing the fleshed out set of parent child

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:27.456
relationships. The car has two doors and four wheels. Each wheel has a rim a

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:31.852
hubcap and a tire. This is usually called a seam graph as it defines the graph

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.560
of relationships of objects in the scene. This whole tree structure is called

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.358
the hierarchy another frequently misspelled word so get it right. With this

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:43.228
hierarchy we can do a lot. For example, we can move the whole car by applying a

00:00:43.228 --> 00:00:46.510
transform to just the parent. The other objects in the hierarchy will

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.956
automatically be updated with this transform and follow along with the body. We

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:54.144
can also affect objects within the hierarchy. If I change the wheel's rotation,

00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:58.710
the rim, hubcap and tire will also be updated and move along. Under the hood

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.967
what is happening is that a series of transforms are being maintained. For

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.790
example, for the hub cap, here's the series. There's the scale, rotate and

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.376
translate set for the hub cap itself. Then another scale rotate and translate

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.994
for the wheel. And finally a scale rotate and translate for the car as a whole.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:20.209
In practice, the scale matrices are not often used. As many model creators make

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.023
their models to scale. The good news is that these complex series of transforms

00:01:24.023 --> 00:01:27.975
can be compressed into a single transform that does it all. It holds all the

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:32.294
scales, rotations and translations. Plus any thing else done. We'll show how

00:01:32.294 --> 00:01:36.339
this works in the upcoming lesson on matrices. That said, fixed hierarchies in

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:40.348
the parent child relationship they establish are extremely useful. Hierarchies

00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:44.200
allow most objects to be controlled in a natural way. I believe I've said this

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.358
three times, so I'll invoke Lewis Carroll's line from The Hunting of the Snark,

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.642
what I tell you three times is true. Personally, when I'm thinking through what

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:56.688
series of transforms I want to apply, I work step by step. Perhaps the most

00:01:56.688 --> 00:02:01.043
important rule I can offer you is this Once you've applied a transform, forget

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:05.650
about it entirely. That transforms applied, it's history and you now have some

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.160
new object and a new position, possibly with some new location at the origin.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.088
Next, draw a picture if it helps. I usually do. Finally, once a transform is

00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:19.905
applied, where does your new object want to move from there? If you find you've

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:24.013
messed up and the new object is not moving toward your goal, undo and try again.
