00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
 Hi 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.450
 I am an advocate of Dan Galpin Android development. 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.080
 Let's talk about the preview of Android 7.1 here. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 A few weeks ago 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.220
 We tell everyone the Android 7.1 developer preview 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 Will be released soon 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.790
 If you don't know it, it is now released. 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.790
 Preview and other versions 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 There are some differences 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.840
 Version 7.1 has been released on Pixel 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.800
 We released the original developer preview 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.790
 Test on Nexus devices 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.190
 The goal is to find any device-related issues 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.360
 In other words, we have already API 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120
 Set to API level 25 and we publish open source on Google Play 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 Easy application development for new API versions 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 So you can update your app as soon as possible 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.300
 What new features are there? 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.080
 First Android 7.1 startup 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.790
 There are several changes 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.880
 Apply shortcuts to allow you to be a key action in your app 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.770
 Add static and dynamic links 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.290
 Users just have to press and hold your app launch icon 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.060
 To display app shortcuts 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.390
 Then click on the shortcut to start the relevant action 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.910
 Every shortcut has an intent 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.010
 Each will initiate a specific action or task 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.020
 You can create shortcuts for any operation 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.820
 You can express it as an intention 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.620
 For example, your creation intention can be 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.800
 Send new information to make an appointment 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.070
 Play video to continue the game loading map location 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 and many more 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.660
 You can statically add shortcuts to your app. 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.390
 Resource files in the APK by adding them 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.330
 You can also add them dynamically at runtime. 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.820
 Static shortcuts for normal operations 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.710
 Dynamic shortcuts let you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.690
 Emphasize the operation according to the user's preferences 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.150
 Behavioral location, etc. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.420
 You can create five shortcuts in every application. 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.220
 When you add a shortcut to your app 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.526
 Can be accessed by supporting their launch bar 

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.150
 For example, the default launch bar on the Pixel boot bar Pixel device 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.970
 Now Launcher default launch bar on Nexus devices 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.430
 And other support bars that provide support 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.260
 Any application can create shortcuts 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.150
 Any startup bar app can support shortcuts 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.580
 Android 7.1 provides an API for the app 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.410
 To register shortcuts and launch bar 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.050
 To access the registered shortcuts 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.780
 The application can now define the loop launch bar icon 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.330
 Devices that can be used to support them 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.800
 Most of these are happening automatically 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.810
 When launching to request an app icon 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.480
 You can receive the Android icon 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.060
 Or Android round icon 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.560
 According to the configuration of the device 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.310
 You can use Image Asset Studio to design round icons 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.280
 You can test your round icon on a Google Pixel device 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.130
 Or use the Google API's emulation system to run the Android emulator 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.117
 For API level 25 

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:34.950
 Related to the launch bar 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.620
 Is to strengthen the metadata of the wallpaper 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.900
 In addition to existing metadata attributes 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 Such as label description and author 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.810
 There are a lot of new properties about context links and headlines 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.370
 Link user to 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 More information about wallpapers 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.240
 This allows for a better and richer user experience 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.580
 When choosing a live wallpaper 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.000
 Another Android 7.1 feature is to make stickers and other rich content. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
 Via soft keyboard 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.770
 Also called input method editor or IME 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.370
 7.1 SDK includes Commit Content API 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.710
 It provides a general way to send information 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.600
 And other content 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.150
 a text editor sent directly to the app via an IME 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.200
 API also has revision 25 version 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.880
 In the support library of V13 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.250
 With this API you can build information applications 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.470
 Come to receive rich information from any keyboard 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.250
 You can also use the keyboard to send rich information to any app. 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.620
 There are two more in the 7.1 version. 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.050
 Cool features you might want to take advantage of 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.480
 The first is the storage manager's intent 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.540
 The storage manager's intent that the application can now trigger an action 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.660
 Bring the user to the system's Free Up Space interface 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.610
 If your app needs more space than there is now 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.150
 It can use this intent to let users delete unwanted apps 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.250
 And content to get enough space 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.379
 Another feature you can take advantage of with your app is 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.170
 Check if the device is running 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.020
 Demo user using new user manager 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.670
 Is a way to demonstrate users 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.200
 This makes your app customizable 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.600
 Initial experience of potential customers 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.130
 Run the app as a demo user 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.350
 Apps will give users more help 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.180
 Or more carefully explain its function 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.690
 There are many new features in the 7.1 release. 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.030
