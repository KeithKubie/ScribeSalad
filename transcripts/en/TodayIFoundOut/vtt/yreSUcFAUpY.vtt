00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:14.030
The word so 
has been in English pretty much as long as

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.910
there has been English (derived from the Old
English swæ).

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.230
It is alternately an adverb (it’s so hot),
a conjunction (eat your dinner so you can

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.330
have dessert), an adjective (Jim is dead,
isn’t that so?) and an introductory particle

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.160
(So, I heard gun shots last night).

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.219
For many, the ubiquity of so just to introduce
a topic or idea in modern parlance (So, what

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.879
are we doing?) is troubling and often thought
to be a recent addition to the language; however,

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.220
English speakers have actually been using
so to open a sentence since at least the Middle

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.220
Ages.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.070
For instance, Chaucer (1343-1400) used so
as an introductory particle in his poem Troilus

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.070
and Criseyde:

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.390
So graunte hem sone out of this world to pace
(So, grant him soon out of this world to pass);

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.980
So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge (So,
when this Calkas knew by astrological calculation);

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.980
and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.350
So hyd it wel, I tell it never to mo (So,
hide it well, I tell it never to others)

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.000
Shakespeare (1564-1616) also introduced sentences
with a so.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.470
In the poem, The Rape of Lucrece, he wrote:

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.180
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer;

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.020
So that in venturing ill we leave to be;

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.890
So from himself impiety hath wrought;

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.170
So thy surviving husband shall remain;

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.990
So shall these slaves be king, and though
their slave; and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.550
So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state’.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.060
In the 18th century, Samuel Richardson (1689-1761),
also used so in this way in the novel, Pamela:

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.160
So, like a fool, I was ready to cry;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.230
So, with our blessings, and assured prayers
for you, more than ourselves, we remain;

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.680
So, dear father and mother, it is not disobedience;
and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.000
So, taunting again!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.570
As did Richard Brinsley Sherida (1751-1816)
in his comedy of manners The Rivals:

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.350
So, so!

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.970
– What, this is some freak, I warrant!

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.680
So, come to me presently, and I’ll give
you another letter to Sir Lucius;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.830
So, my dear Simplicity, let me give you a
little respite;

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.350
So, so – here he comes; and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.930
So, that’s done – Well, I’ll fold it
up presently.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.730
Nonetheless, the so haters do have a point
that it is used much more ubiquitously in

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.070
recent years.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.280
As for why, that’s up for debate, with the
commonly touted theory putting the blame on

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.140
Silicon Valley lingo.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.890
This was first noted by Michael Lewis in The
New New Thing (1999)- “When a computer programmer

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.450
answers a question, he often begins with the
word ‘so’.”

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.140
As to how this came about, it is thought that
given the international composition of the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.600
typical Silicon Valley work site, where a
large number did not speak English as their

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.550
first language, it became the simple “catchall”
word of transition.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.650
Over time and frequent usage, it eventually
became like a tic and just part of the common

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.080
speech pattern of those in that industry and
then spreading beyond.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.680
A far better starter than um or well, both
of which convey uncertainty, so connotes authority,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.000
as well as something being thought through.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.010
In the same vein, when it is used to answer
a question rather than raise a point, inserting

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.819
a so buys time – either to formulate a response
or ignore the question and return to another

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:22.819
topic.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.810
In addition, communications professor Galina
Bolden of Rutgers University notes that beginning

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.020
sentences with so, “communicates that the
speaker is interested in or concerned about

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.030
the recipient…

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.590
It also invokes prior conversations between
the speaker and the recipient, drawing on

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.900
their relationship history.”

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.190
So, given its utility and specious appearance
of authority, as well as sometimes helping

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.319
to avoid awkward silence while you think,
it is no wonder so has become so popular.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.330
Of course, as with all lingual conventions,
it can be (and often is) overused.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.030
But as using so in this way has been with
us since pretty much the beginning of the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.250
language and seemingly just keeps increasing
in popularity, the so haters might just have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:21.299
to hunker down and endure while the present
wave passes.
