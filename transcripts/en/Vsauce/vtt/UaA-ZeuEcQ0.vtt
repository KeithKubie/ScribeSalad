00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.029
Star Wars splatter art and a t-shirt commemorating
one of history's most lapidary quotes.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.249
It's episode 25 of LÃœT.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.099
Navigate the web with glow-in-the-dark mouse

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.479
containing an actual spider.
And you can use a straw to drink juice right

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.340
out of a fruit, but this hand juicer turns
a fruit into a spray bottle for all your favourite

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.010
dishes.
Now go buy some top hats for your cat and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.920
toast his style with a frothy beer that's
always foamy.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.960
Japan Trend Shop brings us a gadget that with
a single click sends a rush of new bubbles

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.320
to the top.
You can say "I love you" in binary and then

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.980
snuggle up with your custom-made pillows.
PillowMob lets you upload a photo, crop it,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.640
colour it, edit it and then receive a nice,
soft, cuddly, high-quality pillow, which is

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.270
apparently made by cats...?
Well, Neatoshop offers a unicorn-shaped pencil

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.720
sharpener, a beanie that makes you look like
a gory zombie, a soft, plush salami, ouchlets

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.760
for safety and a Tommy gun shaped purse.
I guess to carry around your spy video camera.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.860
But you could be even more secret with a spy
camera hidden inside what looks like a phone

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.840
charger.
Evolution in New York sells a cute, stylised

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.830
tiger rug.
But if you have $3,000 and want a real animal

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.430
rug, they've got black bears, wolves and I'm
not kidding, zebras.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.320
For a cool $12,000 you can get this.
Seriously.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.799
I'm not lying.
Less real, but still macabre is this hollowed-out

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.799
skull USB hub.
You get 4 more ports and a skullball to keep

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.530
your stuff.
Similarly skeletory are these leg bones knee-high

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.960
socks, also available shorter, and Sock Theory
also has ones that lace up.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.070
Happy socks and Converse shoes... socks.
Luna &amp; Curious' animal mugs render each animal

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.670
half as a handle.
But if you're more interested in this end,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.720
here's a coffee mug with a built-in secret.
As you sip away the Java, you reveal a perfect

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.270
little pile of poo.
When it comes poo at the office, avoid awkward

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.750
dumps next to your boss or dropped toilet
paper with this handy survival guide.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.819
But in a worse-case scenario, make sure you've
got an emergency underpants dispenser.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.480
Now, speaking of bathrooms, they are more
fun with giant googly eyes.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.459
You can put these things on anything.
And they may not have meant it ironically,

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.420
but this book proves that dads are the original hipsters.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.209
Of course, those gnomes and pink flamingos
they've got today... buy yourself a zombie

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.110
version for your own lawn.
And enjoy the sweetness of a 20-sided sucker.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.480
The only luxury items more soothing are these
tequila ice pops, filled with real edible

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.760
gold flakes.
Now, your body can't really digest gold, so

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.440
save money and collect the flakes back after
sitting on your truck-hitched toilet seat-on-the-go.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.560
In fact, why ever stop sitting?
These lazy football chairs let you try your

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.430
skills without working too hard.
Kick the ball with Kobi Levi's shark shoes

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.930
for him and her and illuminate the action
using a kit that helps you snap old light

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.750
bulbs into fun shapes around a new one.
Of course, why have real light when you can

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.890
have 8-bit light?
Painted on a canvas just for you.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.350
Because then you can show your 8-bit life
with this necklace.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.599
Or use one where the pendant swings on the
necklace, which is cute, but why the neck

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.430
a gemini?
Litter offers leg necklaces.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.340
Well, they're guarder chains.
But here are some that attach to sunglasses

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.319
to give you a moustache.
Or a full biker beard.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:02.140
Do you prefer air to metal inflatable beards,
because you can wash your body with soap containing

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.640
a foetus?
Look, just wash your head with some brain

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.580
soap.
Or brighten things up with a brain in a jar

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.110
candle.
You may wish to use a miniature MacBook pocket

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.320
mirror, but RedCandy has bigger ones.
The London underground, a razor blade or a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.970
wiper blade to easily defog after a shower.
Oh and this one let's you compare your height

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.310
to celebrities.
Are you Snoop Dogg or Salvador Dali...?

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.650
...whose melting clocks could be yours with
this shelf clinking model.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.509
It might be easier to just keep time on your
wrist with a watch made out of wood.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.840
For every watch they sell the company plants a tree.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.050
Now for your free thing, check out the wallpapers
Split Reason is offering.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.300
I particularly enjoyed what the count must
see in the mirror.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.100
And the simple fact that Particle physics
gives me a hadron.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.340
Combine honeybees and boo to get boo-bees.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.500
And always,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.820
thanks for watching.
