00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:10.743
<i> South Africa has one of
 the most sophisticated</i>

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.546
<i> and extensive networks of
 marine reserves on our planet.</i>

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.648
Home!

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.784
My home. I get to go home.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.318
You know, after ten
years on the road

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.387 line:0%
and I was gone sometimes
300 days a year.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:24.290 line:0%
I got a bit tired
of not being home.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.724 line:0%
So, the next story
that I proposed to

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.594
<i>National Geographic</i> was actually
a story about my backyard.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.496
<i> I wanted to actually
 tell the story about</i>

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.298
<i>our network of marine reserves.</i>

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.235
Marine birds normally don't
feature all that much

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.803
when we talk about
marine reserves.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.238
However, this is
what happens when

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.005
they don't feature
in management.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.042
<i> This is a picture that I
 took on slide from 2003.</i>

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.310
<i> It's a place called
 Malgas Island.</i>

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.046
<i> And I went back there for
 the article last year</i>

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.314
<i> and this is what I found.</i>

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.718
<i> Major decrease in
 nesting numbers because</i>

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:54.553
<i> even though this
 island is protected,</i>

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.055
<i> the fishing grounds are not.</i>

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.589
<i> The sardines and
 the anchovies that</i>

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.559
<i>these birds eat are overfished.</i>

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.027
<i> So, a lot of these
 youngsters die on the nest.</i>

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.330
<i> There's a place called
 Mercury Island in Namibia.</i>

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.201
<i> And this is the centerpiece of
the Namib Island Marine Reserve.</i>

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.803
<i> And here for the first
 time, people are trying to</i>

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.840
<i> connect the nesting grounds
 and the feeding grounds</i>

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.974
<i> of these birds together.</i>

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.277
<i> Mercury Island has stable
 population of Cape Gannets.</i>

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.512
<i> You know, Bank Cormorants</i>

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.481
<i> the most endangered
 marine bird in Africa</i>

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.717
<i> stable population,
 only place.</i>

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.452
<i> Penguins,
 African Penguins.</i>

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.988
<i> They can't fly, so what
 happens is they can only swim</i>

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.323
<i> a certain amount of distance
 before they have to</i>

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:32.892
<i> go back and feed their chicks.</i>

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.128
<i> So, they are the first ones
 to abandon and starve.</i>

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.295
<i> Here...</i>

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.264
<i> these guys are not
 starving, are they?</i>

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.064
( audience laughter )

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:40.300
<i> Penguins heading out to sea.</i>

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.235
<i> You know, this looks like a
really calm and beautiful scene.</i>

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.270
<i> It's, you know, sunny and</i>

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.771
<i> it's just this sort of
 an idyllic place</i>

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:46.805
<i> and this is what it looks like</i>

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.641
<i> when you're trying to
 take this picture.</i>

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.844
<i> Water is about five degrees
 and you're in this rock pool</i>

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.413
<i> and you're surrounded by
 massive Atlantic Ocean waves.</i>

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:55.448
Assistant:
<i> We got a big one!</i>

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.950
<i> There's my assistant warning
 me there's a big wave coming.</i>

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.053
<i> So, I swim away from the
picture, trying to save myself.</i>

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.221
( sound of waves )

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.457
Assistant:
<i> Okay. False alarm.</i>

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.492
( audience laughter )

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.428
<i>So I just try to swim back again
 and this goes on for hours.</i>

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.364
<i> And then he misses
 the flipping wave.</i>

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.499
<i> And here come
 the penguins.</i>

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.268
( audience laughter )

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.270
<i> I'm going, "What's going...
 you're supposed to be there."</i>

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.473
<i> It's a little bit
 dangerous there because</i>

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.675
<i> if you get washed out
 to sea, you're done!</i>

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.977
<i> There's another wave coming,
 I'm shooting and again...</i>

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.982
( waves crashing on the rocks )

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.087
Anyway, you know

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:37.023
most marine reserves in
Africa were actually

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.259
they work great for
bio-diversity.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.128
Except they were imposed
on the local communities.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.764
And so, even though,
you know, they...

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.733
you know, biologically and
scientifically they're amazing,

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:50.569
most local people do not
benefit from these reserves.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.472
<i> Thus there's, you know,
 high levels of poaching</i>

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:55.108
<i> and there's actually a
 danger of these reserves</i>

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:58.244
<i> being opened up to fishing,
 because they serve no benefit</i>

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.012
<i> to the local people who
 live next to them.</i>

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.781
And, a developing country
like South Africa

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.749
you kind of have to marry

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.518
the needs of
bio-diversity and people

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.920
if you want to have any
chance of being sustainable.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.956
So, I was looking for
a few examples where

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.224
people and bio-diversity
coexisted together...

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.659
you know, happily.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.229
<i> This is Ponta on the
Mozambique-South African border.</i>

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.398
<i> This is the only marine
 national park in Africa.</i>

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.400
<i> And here, both sides of
 the border are protected</i>

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.236
<i> and these dolphins spend half
 their lives in Mozambique,</i>

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.337
<i> and half their life
 in South Africa.</i>

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.740
<i> And now, because of this new
 arrangement of conservation</i>

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.609
<i> their entire habitat
 is protected.</i>

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.578
But the reason I went
there is because

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.313
they have a really
interesting perspective

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:36.815
on how they integrate people
into the marine environment.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:37.850
<i> The rangers instead
 of, you know,</i>

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.385
<i> doing anti-poaching patrols</i>

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.453
<i> and arresting people,
 they built a school.</i>

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:43.389
<i> And they're teaching kids.</i>

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.624
The philosophy there is
we first have to give

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.627
the local residents a benefit

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.895
and the benefit
here is education.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.664
And this is a little video
of them learning Portuguese.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:56.803
( children reciting Portuguese
vowels and sounds )

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:04.743
<i> They also hold
 immunization clinic</i>

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:06.278
<i> and a nurse comes
 out once a month.</i>

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:08.014
<i> The adults love this service.</i>

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.048
<i> Kids not so much.</i>

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.849
( audience laughter )

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.085
<i> This little guy was not
 a happy chap, but again</i>

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.720
you know, this is one
of those great examples

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.688
where, you know, before
enforcing regulation

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:18.090
they wanted to give the
community benefits.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.159
<i> Further north in Mozambique,
 you know, Vamizi Island</i>

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.828
<i> again an interesting
 case-study where you have</i>

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:25.465
<i> a luxury resort and a fishing
 community on one island</i>

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.099
<i> and together they
 agree to protect</i>

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.101
<i> half of their coral
 reef from all fishing</i>

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.269
<i> and for last ten years.</i>

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.705
<i> And now the fishermen,
 the reserve is so good</i>

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.807
<i> it's actually exporting
 fish biomass</i>

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.776
<i> into the fishing
 zones on the outside</i>

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.844
<i>And now these guys are having a
 better catch than ever before.</i>

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.913
<i> So, again, you know,
 there are ways</i>

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.548
<i> to marry bio-diversity
 and people.</i>

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.850
<i> And this is what has to
 happen in South Africa</i>

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.119
<i> if these reserves are gonna
 have any hope in surviving</i>

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.721
<i>over the next five or ten years.</i>

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.223
To end this evening

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.258
I want to kind of go back
right to the beginning.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.260
<i> This was one of my favorite
 books as a child.</i>

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.663
"Under the Red Sea"
<i> by Dr. Prof. Hans Hass.</i>

00:04:57.663 --> 00:05:00.799
<i> He was an Austrian diving
 pioneer and biologist.</i>

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.801
And you know, one of my biggest
wishes as a kid was to

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.203
sort of, you know, be in one of

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.406
you know, in the situations
that he found himself.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.507
And, you know, putting
this presentation together

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:11.677
<i> I came across this image,
 and I went, "Sheesh.</i>

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.612
<i> I've already had
 those experiences."</i>

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:16.915
<i> So, you know, full circle, you
 know 12 years later and...</i>

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.684
<i> thank you all so
 much for coming.</i>

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:19.986
( applause )
