00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt; So I'm here to tell everybody to still
pay attention to Iraq, and to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.690
know that Iraq is instrumental for the stability
and welfare of the

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.470
Middle East and the world.
Media attention is often only spotlighted

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.670
on Iraq when there's a huge
crisis.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.600
We hope that we reduce the crises and actually
get media attention for

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.170
successes in moving forward.
It's going to be a crucial year, 2010 is a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.390
crucial year for Iraq with
new elections on the horizon and many aspirations

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.800
for Iraqi people to
get to a better stage in their lives.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.290
It has been a very rough three decades for
the country but we hope in

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.739
the coming decades, everyone around the world
will continue to help

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.390
Iraq to get back on its feet.
My one wish for 2010 is to have less violence

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.610
in Iraq, more hope, and
to give the Iraqi people the opportunities

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.399
they truly deserve.
