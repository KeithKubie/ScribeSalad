00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: So our
next speaker, Yasmin Green,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.260
who is our head of
strategy and operations

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.129
for Google Ideas-- and her fun
fact is that in her spare time,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.970
she's taken up
filmmaking-- seems

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.410
to be a common theme
today-- and she's currently

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.719
location scouting
for a-- and I just

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.260
want to get it right-- for an
absurdist and modern technology

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.650
take on the folk tale
of Aladdin, which

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.810
should be pretty cool.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.660
I'm pretty excited.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.201
And now I have the blue genie
in my head with Robin Williams.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.562
And so with that,
I give you Yasmin.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:37.270
YASMIN GREEN: Hi.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.811
Hi, everyone.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.220
I thought we could actually
get started by me showing you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.430
a video clip of an event
that we arranged in my group,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.970
Google Ideas, called 'Conflict
in a Connected World.' So maybe

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.544
we could dim the lights
and show that video.

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:54.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.250
-The internet was designed
for, and has proven to have,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.080
an incredibly positive
impact on the world.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.355
It was designed with an
aspirational optimism

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:03.770
that remains.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.070
But we need to
adapt our tool set

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.365
to the realities of the world.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.410
-Today, access to the internet
equals freedom of expression,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.340
and it should be considered
a basic human right.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.880
However, wavered the controls
information has always

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.860
been a priority for
the Cuba dictatorship,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.300
as most dictatorships.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.070
-In 2009, when there were a
contested election, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.730
became a place where people
expressed dissatisfaction

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.520
they want in government.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.250
And in a matter of four
months, it got blocked.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.020
-There have been
more than 70,000 URLs

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.082
blocked in Thailand.

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:51.110
When people express opinion
about the king on the internet,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.090
they can get
bullied, and they are

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.900
risky of going to jail
for up to 15 years.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.450
-Because of their limited
access to the internet,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.540
humans have resource to offline
lines, like USB flash memories

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.100
and DVDs, to share information.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.050
It's important that they
know what really goes on

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.960
in their country, and
it's also important

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.300
that they know what
goes on in the world.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.070
-Conflict has existed
since the dawn of time,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.290
but we're just now seeing how
closely digital technology is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.570
starting to influence the
way that different forms

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.410
of conflict play out.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.720
Things that happen
offline are impacting

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.510
how people react and
share content online,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.140
which in turn impacts
offline events.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620
-During the
revolution, I covered

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.770
what was happening in
[INAUDIBLE] over the internet.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.600
I was arrested and tortured
in the Interior Ministry

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.730
for five days.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.160
I think that social
networks and the internet

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.600
was the most important factor
in the Tunisian revolution.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.320
-Since January of
2013, the Syrian regime

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.310
launched at least 150
scud missiles on people.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.460
So we built Aymta, which
is the online warning

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.360
system for people who
live in the targeted areas

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.420
so they can go to the shelter.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.040
That service made the
Syrian regime angry.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.300
After 10 days, we had this
massively huge DDoS attack

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.505
throw us offline.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.660
-Attacks against the users, the
servers, and the infrastructure

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.560
of the internet are increasing.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.540
The reality is that the next
generation of internet users

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.140
is going to experience
more turbulence,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.500
and we need to figure out
how they can be protected.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.370
-As technology changes,
the law doesn't always

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.440
catch up quite fast enough.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.530
If we want people to
have freedom online,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.930
we absolutely have to
keep fighting for it.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.080
-My hope for future generations
are very simple-- access

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.980
to the internet,
access to information,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.700
access to freedom of expression.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.600
When they can communicate
among themselves,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.320
eventually that will
lead to freedom.

00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:26.280
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.780
Oh, thanks.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.450
I hope you enjoyed that video.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.490
It always inspires me.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.000
Slim Amamou-- we
saw him on the clip.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.820
He talked about being arrested
and tortured in Tunisia.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.290
He's probably one of the most
inspirational people that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.050
I've met in the
last few years. .

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.830
He's a Tunisian programmer,
blogger, and internet activist.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.780
And he was arranging street
protests for internet freedoms

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.030
and getting arrested
several times

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.030
before the protests that led
to the Jasmine Revolution,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.530
where he was arrested
and tortured.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.130
And after his release,
interestingly-- two days

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.180
after in January of
2011, he was actually

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.640
appointed to be Secretary
of State for Sport and Youth

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.370
for the interim Tunisian
government, which

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.450
sounds magnificent
other than the fact

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.470
that by May of that same
year, he had resigned.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.200
Because of army pressure
on the government,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.000
internet censorship had resumed.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.666
So Slim is one of many pioneers
on the forefront-- I mean,

00:05:24.666 --> 00:05:27.339
on the front lines
of revolution.

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.130
But I found him
particularly inspirational.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.330
And he said something
that really stuck with me.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.000
I asked him, "What advice do
you have for other people that

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.300
are thinking about challenging
their governments?"

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.240
And he said, "If you
aren't tech savvy,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.300
you aren't effective
because you're not safe."

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.110
And that's really
relevant to what

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.990
I'd like to talk
to you about today.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.720
How many people before they saw
the agenda for today's event

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.450
had heard of Google Ideas?

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.660
By show of hands-- OK.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.250
Maybe a quarter, so that's good.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.089
I'm looking forward to telling
you more about what we do.

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:09.505
The starting premise
is that there

00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:12.550
is a nexus between
technology and geopolitics,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.590
and world affairs
increasingly have

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.080
a digital and a
physical component

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.040
that come hand-in-hand.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.380
So when we started at Google
Ideas three years ago,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.430
it was our intention
to bring together

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.950
users and experts,
but also engineers,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.560
to see technology initiatives
that would help the people that

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.832
are living through conflict
and instability and repression.

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:37.790
That's why I'm really
excited to be here today,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.500
because I assume
that every one of us

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.770
is really passionate
about technology

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.520
and also about geopolitics.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.350
The question I have is how
many of us think of them

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.780
or work on them in tandem?

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.820
And if the answer
isn't everyone,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.060
then that's something
that I'd love to change.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.670
So let's start by taking
a look at the problem.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.870
This is a map created by Freedom
House, who are a US-based NGO.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.070
According to Freedom House,
two out of every three people

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.540
in the world faces some type
of repression, either online

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.690
or offline.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.950
And for one out of
every three people,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.380
that repression is severe.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.400
And without trivializing
the devastating impact

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.440
of censorship and
authoritarianism,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.970
those things aren't really new.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.480
They've been around since
the beginning of time.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.850
So what is new?

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.460
The way connected
technologies are

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.570
changing how they
manifest themselves.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.844
Our beloved internet-- it's
been around since-- well,

00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:42.510
it's been around since
longer than that.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.380
It's been changing lives
really since the mid-1990s,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.300
even though only 16 million
people used it then.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.520
Since that time, a
whopping 2.7 billion people

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.770
have come online, and they've
used a suite of devices, most

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.120
recently PCs and desktops,
mobiles, tablets, wearables.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.040
And social platforms
have completely exploded.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.660
So not many of us would
get to quarter past 2:00

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.890
PM in the afternoon without
interacting with a social media

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.910
platform at least once.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:20.140
But social has really ushered
unprecedented usage patterns.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.830
On average, every
single second--

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.300
that's every single
second-- 100 hours of video

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.010
are uploaded to YouTube, half
a million tweets are sent

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.570
on Twitter, and-- this is
whopping-- 10 million photos

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.720
are served on Facebook
in a single second.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.409
So that's really astounding.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.840
And of course, that pace of
change is not decelerating.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.880
And we're only at the 2.7
billion people online mark.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.260
In the next decade,
we could be joined

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.815
by another five billion people.

00:08:57.815 --> 00:08:58.440
And guess what?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.110
They're disproportionately
coming online in environments

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.540
where states are weak,
rule of law is strained,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.200
and the youth are the majority
and largely unemployed.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.230
So there's a real risk that
while repression and conflict

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.180
persist in the physical world,
as the next five billion

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.980
come online, they
manifest themselves

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.070
in entirely new forms
on the internet.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.740
So at Google, we
like to aim big,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.650
and we talk about something
called a "moon shot."

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.534
Has anyone heard that
term, moon shot, before?

00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:35.700
Raise your hand if you have.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.870
I will ask you.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.370
OK.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.760
What do you think
a moon shot is?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.780
AUDIENCE: You mean in Google?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.488
YASMIN GREEN: No.

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:41.800
Anything-- in non-Google.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.862
AUDIENCE: In non-Google?

00:09:43.862 --> 00:09:46.232
Something that is
technologically possible

00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:48.128
but not yet foreseen.

00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:50.384
It's not foreseen in
how you would get there.

00:09:50.384 --> 00:09:51.550
YASMIN GREEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.172
You have a kind of
an idea that makes

00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:55.630
you think that you can achieve
something really outrageous.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.490
AUDIENCE: And you feel excited.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.948
YASMIN GREEN: And
you feel excited.

00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:58.860
That's perfect.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.930
So it originated
from Project Apollo,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.350
which was-- President JFK
proposed a national goal

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.450
to Congress in 1961 to
send a man to the moon

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.360
and have him return safely.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.940
And that was thought
to be audacious

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.160
and actually impossible.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
And he proposed for it to be
done by the end of the 1960s,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.750
and it indeed was done by 1969.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.740
So that's kind our inspiration
when we talk about moon shots.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.840
And our moon shot
at Google Ideas

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.970
is this-- to end repressive
censorship by 2024.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.320
So let's take a look at what
that looks like in practice.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.290
Here's out map.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.320
Freedom House-- we said they
look at print and internet

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.050
and broadcast media, and
they rank all countries

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.710
in the world-- so
all 197 countries--

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.060
according to press freedoms.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.910
And of course, press freedom
is an indispensable requirement

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.680
for democracy.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.330
So of all of these 197
countries, coming in at 191--

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.770
so that's six from the
very bottom-- was Iran.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.550
I am Iranian.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.370
I was born in Iran, and I
have friends and family who

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.090
are there, and I think that I
have a pretty good familiarity

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.840
with the Iranian digital
repression toolkit,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.890
so I want to take you
through it really fast.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.100
The first go-to tactic actually
of any repressive regime

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.805
is the blocking of websites.

00:11:23.805 --> 00:11:27.010
So any site that's
thought to be associated

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.690
with free expression, like
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter--

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.050
those are blocked.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.690
Independent media, human
rights advocacy, those

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.420
are also blocked.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.880
But a real hallmark of
Iranian digital repression

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.300
is throttling-- so
deliberately slowing down

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.710
the internet to when it gets
so painfully, visibly slow

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.070
that people just give up trying.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.340
And the minister in Iran for
communication and technology

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.959
is actually on record as saying
that the Iranian government

00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.500
deliberately slowed
down the internet

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.050
at the time of the last
presidential election.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:07.260
So news like the ex-two term
president being disqualified

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.070
from running, or really anything
about the eight candidates

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.780
that were approved to run--
none of that information

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.120
could be found for users that
were trying to look online.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.160
But one of the most alarming
tactics the Iranian government

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.800
uses is something called
man in the middle.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.340
That's manipulating your
own information traffic.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.890
So any time that
your information

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.510
is going through hardware
or software that's

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.820
being controlled by a
government or a corrupt ISP,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.540
they can manipulate
that traffic.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.390
And last year, pro-regime
activists in Iran--

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.270
they created an imitation
version of the BBC's website.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.580
The aesthetics were identical--
same font, same layout,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.550
same everything.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.247
But just the odd
story was replaced

00:12:54.247 --> 00:12:56.080
with something that was
more like propaganda

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.540
for the Islamic republic.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.780
So on the BBC's website--
or this fake BBC--

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.420
you could see articles like
'Death of bin Laden Fabricated

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.050
by Washington,' or 'BBC
Colluding with Israel to Attack

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.380
Iran.' And users in Iran
would try to visit bbc.co.uk

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.610
and automatically get
redirected to the fake BBC,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.380
and they just wouldn't know.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.000
So the motivation was to deceive
people, and it really worked.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.770
The good news,
however, is that there

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.100
are tools to protect users
such as those in Iran,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.276
and they're called proxies.

00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:33.650
By show of hands,
how many people

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.948
here have used a proxy before?

00:13:36.948 --> 00:13:39.970
OK, that's incredible-- 90%.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.900
Likely to be a lot
lower, I think,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.720
in a less technical audience.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.000
So you know that proxies
redirect your connection

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.640
through a computer
that isn't subjected

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.810
to the same repressive tactics.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.870
So you 90% are in
very good company,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.920
and I'd like to just
pause for a second

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.360
and highlight a bit
of an irony here.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.150
Some of the most prominent
users of proxies in Iran

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.780
are actually the supreme leader.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.070
So this is the most
powerful man in Iran

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.370
and, arguably, the entire
Shiite Muslim world.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.910
He uses proxies to add to
his photo album online.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.010
I follow him [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.280
The recently elected
president, Hassan Rouhani,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.280
tweets to his 170,000
Twitter followers

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.430
presumably using a proxy because
Twitter is blocked in Iran.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.920
And this is the biggest
social media power

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.050
user you'll come across-- the
Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif,

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.700
who has 824,000
likes on Facebook.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.800
So these are three of the
most prominent leaders in Iran

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.420
who are using-- who actually
were not on social media at all

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.130
a year ago, and are now
using proxies, sometimes

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:58.730
on a daily basis, to circumvent
the same severe digital

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.670
repression that they impose
on all of their people.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:09.520
That's 21st century
statecraft in Iran for you.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.020
So in theory, you
have these proxies

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.670
that allow people to access
the internet through more

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.880
safe, less blocked,
more private means.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.430
But in practice, they
face two challenges.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.980
The first is scale.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.750
So unlike traditional
technologies

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.720
where the more
people that use them,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.530
the more people that use them--
positive network effects--

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.430
with proxies, the more people
that use them, the more likely

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.820
they are to be
detected and shut down.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.640
The other challenge is trust.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.490
Because they're
anonymous, you don't

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.720
know who's providing your
proxy, and you don't who's

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.890
using your server as a proxy.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.240
And that's a problem.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.740
So it's widely believed
that in the Iranian bazaar,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.290
the majority of proxies
that are on sale

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.930
are being provided by the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.550
So ostensibly they
say they're going

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.896
to speed up your
internet connection.

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:03.770
And then when something
politically sensitive

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.930
happens in the country, they
start blocking and throttling

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.334
and manipulating traffic.

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:10.750
So if you are an
Iranian, you have

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.560
to choose-- don't access
the worldwide web,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.480
or access it through a proxy
that's provided by someone

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.820
that you don't know.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.940
And the surprising thing
is that every Iranian I

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.220
know who uses the internet
does so using a proxy that they

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.840
couldn't possibly have faith in.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.460
So at Google Ideas, we
spend a lot of time thinking

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.160
about the challenges faced by
people in places like Iran,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.820
and also the
opportunities that are

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.890
presented by connected
technologies.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.200
And an interesting
insight occurred.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.150
Most of the people
that we spoke to who

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.590
are living in these
repressive environments

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.920
had a friend or a
family member that they

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.010
trust who lives abroad,
that they already

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.360
communicate online with.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.450
So let me just check here.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.950
How many people---
by show of hands,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.940
how many people in this room
have somebody that they trust

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.210
that lives in a country
that's colored in black, red,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.166
or orange?

00:17:07.166 --> 00:17:07.740
Fantastic.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.690
That's practically everybody.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.190
Great.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.950
So that insight is what is
at the heart of a product

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.040
that we are launching
called uProxy.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.819
And the insight is what if we
could give every person who

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.680
lives in a repressive
environment

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.690
the technology-- in this
case, a browser extension--

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.670
to be able to communicate with
somebody who lives outside

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.890
of their firewall, somebody
they already trust?

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.320
So this intermediation
and trust risks

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.830
aren't there through a
means that's really simple.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.330
And uProxy is a
browser extension

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.390
in Chrome and in Firefox.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.780
And also, we're going
to build it for Android.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.180
You download it like you
would any other extension.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.670
You can log in to a
chat through, let's say,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.584
G+ or Facebook.

00:17:54.584 --> 00:17:56.000
And as long as the
person that you

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.540
trust who's on the other
side of the national border

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.490
has that same
extension, you can now

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.700
exchange not just photos
and jokes online-- actually,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.390
your internet experience--
your less restricted access

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.440
to the internet.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.870
And that really is probably
in my eight years at Google--

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.850
this is the product that
I am the most-- I mean

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.440
it has personal
resonance for me--

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.950
but the product that I'm
the most excited about.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.430
But our moon shot
has several steps.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.276
So what if those users that are
trying to access information

00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:29.400
find that when they get
there, that information has

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.850
been taken offline
in the first place?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.215
So let me give you a few
examples from recent real world

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:36.715
events.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.417
Several regimes
across the world are

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:44.300
being challenged by protests.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.910
This is Thailand.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.160
This is Ukraine.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.430
This is Venezuela.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.060
Hundreds of thousands of
protesters on the streets,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:55.280
and in many cases, those
protests are turning bloody.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.460
And the violence is
rarely unilateral--

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.450
and the context for these
displays of civil unrest

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.607
are very complicated indeed.

00:19:04.607 --> 00:19:06.190
But there's one thing
that we believe,

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:11.030
which is that every voice in
the debate deserves to be heard.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.850
And there's an observation
there that, typically,

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.090
if dissent is being cracked
down on in the physical world,

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.160
it's also being cracked down
on in the virtual world.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.450
And if freedom of assembly
is deemed to be a threat,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.660
then surely, so is
freedom of speech.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.520
And in many ways, you
can think of a website

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.650
as being the 21st century
equivalent of an office.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.580
So in the same way that the
physical presence of NGOs

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.100
and independent
media organizations

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.890
are being shut down, so are
their online virtual presences.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.760
Another question--
how many people

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.340
have had before of a DDoS?

00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:53.574
Wow, OK, about two-thirds.

00:19:53.574 --> 00:19:54.490
Who put up their hand?

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.830
Can you put up your hand again?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.580
Do you know what a
DDoS attack stands for?

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:01.270
OK, behind you.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.989
Do you know?

00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:03.280
Oh, everyone's just like, "Who?

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.230
Who?"

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.380
OK, another question.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.831
Who here knows what a
DDoS attack stands for?

00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:08.330
OK.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.497
AUDIENCE: Denial of service.

00:20:09.497 --> 00:20:10.621
YASMIN GREEN: Yes, exactly.

00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:11.430
Denial of service.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.250
It's distributed denial
of service attack, which

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.520
is basically flooding a
website with unwanted traffic

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.520
so that it can't stay up.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.030
And there are very, very
many of these DDoS attacks

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.890
happening-- 20,000 plus a day.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.330
And DDoS attacks are
responsible for one-third

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.140
of all server downtime.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.230
And they are most
often politically

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.810
and ideologically motivated.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.500
So these are a
really big program.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.290
Guess what?

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.930
You can buy a DDoS attack.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.840
And this one I found online.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.715
This is actually, I
think, even expensive now

00:20:46.715 --> 00:20:47.930
because I found this
three months ago,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.110
and I think they're really
getting cheaper in price.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.330
$100 on eBay to buy a botnet
that wages a DDoS attack.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.380
So I'm sure you guys
know what a botnet is.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.650
You kind of infect a network
of machines with malware,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.260
and then you command and control
them like an army of computers.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.760
So now we're in
this situation where

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.730
anyone can buy anyone else's
silence anywhere in the world

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.710
by buying a botnet.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.380
In particular, a particular
risk are small websites

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.050
because they don't have the
infrastructure or the resources

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:23.260
to stay up when faced
with a flood of traffic.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.230
And this is an example-- the
Kenyan election monitoring

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.627
webmasters told us
that, despite having

00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:31.960
a website the whole time,
they've never actually managed

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.880
to stay up during the
presidential election itself.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.640
We saw the guy talk about
[INAUDIBLE], an Iranian website

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.150
in the video clip.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.590
They are blocked in Iran.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.645
But even though they're
blocked, they still

00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:46.020
suffer DDoS attacks every time
they write anything that's

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.620
politically controversial
because those pro-state actors

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.316
want to make triply
sure that nobody in Iran

00:21:51.316 --> 00:21:56.070
can access that content,
even if they use a proxy.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:01.180
So this is the
graph of four years

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.540
so that you can
see how prevalent

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.940
and how these attacks are,
and also how they're growing.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.220
This is a pretty
worrying picture.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.672
So other than the
people in this room, who

00:22:11.672 --> 00:22:13.630
are impressive in terms
of having heard of DDoS

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.580
attacks before, most
people rarely, if ever,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.610
hear about them.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.200
Why is that?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.890
Because they're invisible.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:21.851
The threat's invisible.

00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:23.850
Actually, the people that
we speak to-- the NGOs

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.730
that we speak to
or activists that

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.870
have suffered DDoS
attacks-- most often

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.850
don't even know what's happened
to them because it's invisible.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.940
So they'll go into the browser
and they'll put in their URL,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.420
and what do they see?

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:36.955
Nothing.

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.330
They ask their
friends and family

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.380
abroad to visit the site,
and they also see nothing.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.432
The second problem
is that, of course,

00:22:44.432 --> 00:22:48.620
we each only see just our
small corner of the internet.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.200
No one really has
the big picture

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.840
to understand just how
big the problem is.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.730
So that's why I want
to share with you--

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.810
that's why we
launched this website.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.110
It's called-- it's at
digitalattackmap.com,

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.180
and it's based on
the premise that you

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.850
don't need to be a meteorologist
to understand a weather map.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.460
So we wanted to create
a map of digital attacks

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.400
that anybody could
understand, that was

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.984
intuitive and
informative for anyone

00:23:17.984 --> 00:23:19.150
who wanted to find out more.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.090
And this is at
digitalattackmap.com,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.670
so anyone who wants
to visit it can.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.707
But if you want to take photos
of it, that's also good.

00:23:26.707 --> 00:23:28.540
Let me just kind of
talk you through in case

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.220
you can't see the
legend-- how this works.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.399
The shape of the lines
denote how much information

00:23:35.399 --> 00:23:36.440
we know about the attack.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.630
So if we know the origin
and the destination,

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.670
you see an arched line.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.560
If we know just the
origin or the destination,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.170
you see a vertical line
going into or coming out

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.150
of the country.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.374
And if you see a
concentric circle,

00:23:51.374 --> 00:23:53.040
that means that the
attack was internal,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.440
so the origin and
the destination

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.669
were in the same country.

00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.460
And then you can also
kind of color the map

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.820
by different variables-- type,
duration, the source port

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.720
origin of the attack,
or the destination

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.950
port where the
attack is targeted.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.870
And the data-- I'm going get
you something pretty-- this

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.710
is just a day-by-day
of all of the attacks

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.620
that we've seen over
the last few months.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.000
The data was provided by a
group called Arbor Networks, who

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.210
install DDoS mitigation
hardware at over 80% of ISPs

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.270
around the world.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.760
And those ISPs then feed
back to Arbor anonymized data

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.320
on the attacks that
they've received,

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.060
and that's what's kind
of driving this map.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.680
But I did want to
show you, actually,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.250
a few interesting
moments specifically.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.100
So we spoke before about
the real world protests

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.230
that we've seen over
the last few months.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.760
If you scroll down
here to the timeline,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.130
this is Thailand that
we're looking at.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.920
And this is the timeline
of DDoS attacks.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.309
And this is December 4.

00:24:56.309 --> 00:24:58.100
And you'll notice, of
course, that December

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.950
was when the controversial
anti-government protests first

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.520
started.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.610
And you can see that there's--
as is often the case,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.740
but not always recognized--
there's a cyber spillover

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.410
to what we're seeing happen
in the real, physical world.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.200
Let me show you another
interesting case study.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.700
This is now China on August 27.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.490
And you'll see a huge flood
of both volumetric and

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.450
connection-based attacks
that are landing in China.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.440
If you scroll down,
the news results

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.420
are updated to reflect
the country, hopefully

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.050
relevant to DDoS
attacks, and they're

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.480
relevant for that
particular day.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.240
So if we click on
a result, we can

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.360
see that, indeed,
China was attacked.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.170
The attack targeted China's
domain name service,

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.206
so all the .cn websites.

00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:52.580
And this attack
actually took out

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.810
a huge chunk of the
Chinese internet.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.240
So it was pretty monumental.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:05.810
And the last one--
this is October 2,

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.670
and we're looking
at the Philippines.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.230
So this massive spike in
attacks against the Philippine

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.180
government, actually, was
allegedly waged by the hacker

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.240
group Anonymous in retaliation
for the Philippine government

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.250
passing a bill that
was interpreted

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.580
to be against free
expression online.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.820
So we see many types
of attacks happen

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.470
for many types of reasons.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.410
We said governments against
independent media sites--

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:39.660
actually, quite prevalent, kids
against their online gaming

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.530
rivals.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.375
And of course--

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.880
Actually, one of
the biggest attacks

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.380
that is ever recorded
on history happened

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.550
in March of last year, which was
300 megabits per second, which

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.960
is the same as the entire
international bandwidth

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.130
of Spain.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.130
And when they found
the person that did it,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.460
it was a 16-year-old
boy in the UK

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.280
who had basically been playing
online games in his parents'

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.935
basement and had committed this.

00:27:07.935 --> 00:27:09.462
So we get the idea.

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:10.920
One thing is really
clear-- that we

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.660
have something of a
DDoS issue on our hands.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.650
And that takes us
to the next problem,

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.330
the problem of protection.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.970
DDoS attacks can be used by
anyone to silence anyone else,

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.870
which hurts the internet, and
it hampers free expression.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.010
And mapping it is a
really good first step,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.540
but if you're being attacked,
that simply doesn't cut it.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.890
Oh, and Google,
of course, we have

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.320
some of the world's leading
experts in DDoS mitigation

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.460
capabilities.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.440
And we also have a core value
to protect free expression.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.480
So we decided to
connect those dots.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.750
I'm excited to tell you
about Project Shield.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.510
Last year we
announced the launch

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.920
of a new project,
a new initiative,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.970
that provides access to
Google's enormous infrastructure

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.280
to the websites that
are most vulnerable

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.160
and need it the most.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.870
And it works by connecting
Google's DDoS mitigation

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.850
capabilities to a reverse proxy.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.680
So those most vulnerable sites
can use Google's defenses

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.120
as their first line of defense
against malicious traffic

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.640
while still keeping that
own site and data locally

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.680
on their own servers.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.870
The objective was to kind of put
our products where our values

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.280
are and keep the web's-- support
free speech and keep websites

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.166
up and running.

00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:37.290
And we're looking for more.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.160
So we've had some really
encouraging results so far.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.940
The Kenyan election monitoring
site that I mentioned,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.440
we kept them up during the
last presidential election.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.830
We've helped websites in
Iran, Ukraine, Venezuela,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.060
and we want to help more.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.430
So in case you, yourself, run a
website that kind of qualifies

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.290
as being independent
media, human rights

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.400
advocacy, or
election monitoring,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.060
or you know anyone
that does, then please

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.180
visit the link that's
being projected here--

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.320
projectshield.withgoogle.com--
and apply

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.530
to be protected by us.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.870
It's free.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.320
OK, so thank you for listening.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.130
Thank you for being here.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.550
And I guess I'll just leave
you with a question, which

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.700
is do you care about
moon shots, and do you

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.950
want to help the
next five billion

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.120
that are coming online in
conflict and repression?

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.530
And do you get a kick out
of working alongside people

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.600
like Slim Amamou who's
a personal hero of mine?

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.880
If you do, then the invitation
is here to join forces.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.380
Thanks.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.760
I don't think I
have time to do Q&amp;A.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.520
But if somebody tells
me to do it, I will.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.311
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
can take two questions.

00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:00.400
YASMIN GREEN: OK.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.934
Anyone have any questions?

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.100
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:03.920
YASMIN GREEN: Hi.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:05.400
Nice talk.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.480
Thank you.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.230
I work for [INAUDIBLE],
actually, and Internews Kenya,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.490
so we do a lot of
crisis mapping.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.219
And we're looking
for developers,

00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:15.260
so if anyone wants to
develop for crisis mapping,

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.870
we're totally into it.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.000
But I have a question about
your relationship with Tor.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.470
I know similar proxy services
that are more focused

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.460
on creating anonymity networks,
but also based on trust,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.700
and uProxy seems to create more
of like an intimacy network.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.500
So I'm curious about
that relationship.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.010
YASMIN GREEN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.290
Does everyone here
know who Tor are?

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.310
Have you heard of Tor as a--
less people familiar with Tor?

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.880
OK, so Tor are one of the most
widely used proxies out there.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.120
And honesty, they are
a group that Google

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.280
has supported in the past.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.760
And the group that
are developing uProxy

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.260
are in close
communication with them.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.676
So the critical
difference, and one

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:54.050
that I think is
really important,

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.570
is that Tor is anonymous.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.730
So you don't
necessarily know when

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.540
you're participating in
the Tor network-- who

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.370
it is that's using
your computer.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.160
You can just imagine
the types of concerns

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.140
you might have about why
somebody might want to navigate

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.750
anonymously through
the internet.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.830
And the difference
with uProxy is

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:14.680
that it's just based on this
peer-to-peer trust network.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.570
Having said that, you could
imagine some really cool spin

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:20.770
offs where you can kind of
make them interoperable.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.910
So the cool thing
about this tool

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.940
is that it works
through just a browser

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.620
extension and or Gchat window
or your Facebook Chat window.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.676
And so I think,
ideally, we would really

00:31:30.676 --> 00:31:32.827
want to integrate with
them, going forward.

00:31:32.827 --> 00:31:33.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.285
YASMIN GREEN: Thanks
for your question.

00:31:38.362 --> 00:31:40.320
AUDIENCE: First of all,
I can't tell you enough

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.650
how excited I am to hear this.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.910
I was born and raised
in China for 25 years.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.290
I stayed there for 25 years.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.300
I had been personally
identified and threatened

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.950
for related-- just
posting free informations

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.700
on the internet when
I was still in China,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.390
so this is very exciting.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.680
But my question
is-- it's different.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.350
So in the map, you
show the United States,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.360
and it's in the color of yellow.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.180
So I want to know
if we are, indeed,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:14.570
as Americans, our own target
of rescue to any extent at all.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.125
Could you elaborate at
least on the coloring--

00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:18.270
the scheme of that?

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.920
YASMIN GREEN: Yeah, so-- I
mean, I showed it three times.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.060
I guess I don't need to
show you that map anymore.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.542
The map was-- I am so grateful
that there are organizations

00:32:28.542 --> 00:32:30.750
that publish these reports
so that I don't personally

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.380
have to subjectively stay where
is free and where is not free.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.350
But yeah, in that map--
so Freedom House--

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.250
a very well-respected
NGO that publish reports

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.290
on press freedoms
and other freedoms.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.974
And in that map, the
US was not white,

00:32:43.974 --> 00:32:45.140
which was the absolute best.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.265
There were five categories.

00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:48.450
The USA was yellow.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.470
So is your question
do I personally

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.140
think if the USA
should have been white?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:54.770
AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.522
It's--

00:32:55.522 --> 00:32:56.230
YASMIN GREEN: OK.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.730
Phew.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.860
AUDIENCE: Do we
have areas, I guess,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.380
to improve to being
white, I guess.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.760
More free-- union
we free ourselves,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.847
or do we have work to do?

00:33:08.847 --> 00:33:10.930
YASMIN GREEN: I actually
don't know that question.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.790
I'm going to look
at specifically--

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.760
I think Freedom House
actually give their rationale.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.230
They have
country-specific reports,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.100
and I should have been
prepared with that.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.200
So I'll go and look at
why specifically they

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.412
see the USA isn't white.

00:33:23.412 --> 00:33:24.120
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:24.470
YASMIN GREEN: Good question.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.310
Thank you.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.330
Thanks.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.250
OK, I know I'm--

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry, guys.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.420
We're just--

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:28.960
YASMIN GREEN: Thank you so much.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.079
Thanks for having me.

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:30.620
Get in touch.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.170
Thanks.
