00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.290
Hey guys,

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.120
Tim Ferris going to show just a few moves that are surprisingly easy to do,

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.820
but very impressive looking in the world of Aqua Yoga.

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:21.740
And I'm no expert experts or people like Kipling here at Kipling, k, p, l, I,

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:25.580
N, n, and all the socials, Jason Nemer, uh, Jenny, of course, those are the,

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.480
the co founders of Yoga and many others are the pros.

7
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:33.560
But that's why I'm showing you this because these do not require you to be a

8
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:38.090
pro. All right? So the first is going to be a walkover to throne.

9
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.170
So this is something that people have a lot of trepidation about getting into a

10
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.610
handstand. Uh, so Kipling can feel free to add some color as needed,

11
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:50.660
but I'm going to show you what is actually an entrance into a routine of any

12
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:55.490
type that is surprisingly easy to do. So we'll show it and then

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.720
I can sort of add some thoughts.

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.260
First thing you'll notice is that I'm not like this getting ready for it because

15
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.980
it looks terrible. All right? And you learn these things over time.

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.500
All I'm going to do is sort of be sitting like this,

17
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.700
then my legs are going to straddle pike up to here. Right?

18
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.700
That's what it's going to look like. And we'll, we'll show it. It looks like.

19
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay. All right. And then we're in throwing,

20
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.630
then we can do fun stuff like pop the bird.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.510
Okay. Okay. No, that's not the part we're going to cover.

22
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:39.160
We're just going to cover the walk over. So let's come down. All right,

23
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.083
so with the walkover,

24
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.520
what I want to point out is that I'm actually aiming to land right about here,

25
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.970
right? If you go right from the glute, when she actually sits,

26
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:50.840
your foot's going to slip.

27
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.730
So you're kind of aiming right here in terms of the mail or not necessarily mail

28
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.050
, but base portion of it. Um, Kipling. Any thoughts on the actual hand? Stan?

29
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.850
Any pointers? Their hands close to the hips as you are better.

30
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.610
Okay. Slowly.

31
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.470
So the flier should have their hands close to my hips.

32
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:13.430
You don't wanna be too far out,

33
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.390
obviously better to be a little too close than too far away. And, uh,

34
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.310
in general,

35
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.190
a lot of folks when they're thinking of hand stands their different ways to do

36
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.024
it.

37
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.050
Start with shoulder with then you can either have your middle fingers pointing

38
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.640
forward or index fingers pointing forward. You can play with what works for you,

39
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.390
uh,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.920
and getting a little bit of extension can help quite a bit with slowing things

41
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:40.430
down. She's actually kind of a fun drill. You can do hand stands against a wall.

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.730
Start off, kick up and then really push,

43
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.060
push to get that extension and brake. It'll slow you down.

44
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.260
So let's show it one more time and then we will do a few more.

45
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.943
<v 1>Okay?</v>

46
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.570
<v 0>Okay, so you see them right here.</v>

47
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.180
Now what I'm going to do is Hook on top of the feet.

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.960
She's going to Dorse a flex, pull her toes back and then just sit right up.

49
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.290
Boom. Now from here, since this looks kind of weird, you can,

50
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.820
you put the feet right on the shins and that allows you to do all sorts of

51
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.640
things. You actually rest pretty easily from here.

52
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.130
And then at a later point in time,

53
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.110
I can do something like this, which is just the one to

54
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.200
catch into Burton. You know, that's when I catch my feet are pointed out.

55
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.370
There are many different ways to do this.

56
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.940
I find that to be the least violent against my flyer,

57
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.520
lots of bend and then kind of popping up and then placing the feet back to

58
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.210
parallel,

59
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.560
almost like an Olympic weightlifter coming up from a clean and like popping it

60
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.000
up to get their hands into proper position.

61
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.830
Very similar and I would suggest staying away from the pop to bird for now.

62
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.630
But if you're at a level where that makes sense,

63
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.100
placing a lot of weight on the hands, uh,

64
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.190
and allows the flyer if they have good body awareness to kind of break

65
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:04.090
themselves on the way down. So it's not just a uncontrolled freefall. Okay.

66
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.130
And that is the walkover to throne to Burke.

67
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.130
Thanks for watching everybody.

68
