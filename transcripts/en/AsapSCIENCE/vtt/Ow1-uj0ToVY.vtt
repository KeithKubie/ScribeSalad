00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.350
We’re all told to work hard in school, so
that we can get into the best colleges or

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.009
universities, and be successful. But, does
the school you choose actually matter?

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.049
Take a look at these SAT scores for an average
school - which are out of 800, by the way.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.420
Those that have the highest SAT scores end
up representing over 50% of the people who

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.869
get degrees at these schools, while the lowest
SAT scores only represent around 18% of the

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.019
people who actually graduate. Not so surprising.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.340
But now let’s look at a top school, like
Harvard. Here, the students with the lowest

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.280
SAT scores, are still smarter than the best
students at an average school. And yet, when

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.520
we look at their rate of completion, it looks
awfully similar. The top students represent

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.710
just over 50% of people who graduate, while
the lower SAT scores represent around 15%

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.420
of people who actually graduate.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.450
Wait, what’s going on?? This phenomenon
is known as the Big Fish - Little Pond Effect.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.880
Simply put, we compare ourselves not globally,
but to our neighbours or people who are in

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.719
the same boat as we are. As a result, students
at top schools compare themselves to their

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.200
brilliant peers, and if you’re in the bottom
half of your class, you’re likely to have

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.390
feelings of inadequacy. Even though compared
to the rest of the world you are at the top!

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
Who do you think has a higher incidence of
suicide? People who live in developed countries

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.369
that declare themselves as very happy, like
Switzerland, Denmark and Canada or those which

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.859
describe themselves as unhappy, like Italy,
Greece, and Spain? The happy countries. If

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.990
you’re depressed but everyone around you
is also unhappy, you may think of yourself

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.020
as normal, as opposed to being stuck around people
who are happier than you.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.409
Similarly, if you’re very intelligent at
an elite school, you may end up being a little

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.689
fish in a very big pond. And feeling as though
you’re at the bottom impacts your confidence

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.770
and ultimately your motivation. Need more
statistics? 50% of US students in STEM programs

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.799
drop out in the first or second year of school.
But for every 10 point decrease in the school’s

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.719
average SAT score, degree completion rises
by 2%! Meaning, you’re much more likely

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.649
to even get your degree if you don’t go
to your top pick.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.850
But who ends up being more successful in the
‘real world’? A study looking at publications

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.500
produced by economists in their first six
years after graduation showed that top students

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.550
in the 99th percentile - ie smarter than almost
every other person at the school - from the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.920
top 5 schools in America were producing an
impressive amount of publications. But those

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.470
in the 75th percentile, still the top quarter
of best students, are publishing next to nothing.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.820
Essentially failures in their field.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.060
But if we now look at the best students from
the 30 worst schools, we see that they’re

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.280
publishing more than those in the top quarter
of the best schools in the country! Clearly,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.360
your surroundings and peers matter.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.920
Now, of course, this doesn’t cover every
aspect of going to a top ranked school - including

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.690
the fact that having a degree from one of
them can be a badge of honour, and may help

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.110
you find a job more easily. But, that’s
if you ever even graduate.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.290
So when you’re applying for school, or even
at your new college, keep in mind that whether

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.710
you go to the best or worst school, the formula
for success is mixed. Remember the importance

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.320
of confidence in your abilities, and how being
a Big Fish in a little pond can sometimes

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.800
be more important than your school itself.
