00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.850
The Man Who was a Dwarf and Later a Giant

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.420
The man was Adam Rainer born in Graz, Austria
sometime in 1899 (the exact date isn’t known).

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.389
Rainer’s parents were neither tall nor short
for the time, with his father measuring in

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.160
at 5 feet 8 inches (1.72 m) and his mother
at 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m).

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.119
He even had a brother who matched his father’s
height at 5 feet 8 inches.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.580
This wasn’t the case for Adam.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.619
Thanks to the fact that Adam attempted to
join the army when he was 18 to participate

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.900
in WWI, we know that at that age Rainer had
reached a height of just 4 feet 6.3 inches

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.460
(1.38 m), and then at 19 he measured in at
4 feet 8.3 inches (1.43 m) when he tried to

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.710
join up again.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.400
Both times he was considered too short and
also too weak to be able to join the military.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.690
For reference, the cutoff for someone being
classified as a dwarf is usually considered

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.860
to be an adult height of less than 4 feet
10 inches (1.47 m).

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.330
While he was short, according to the medical
report, he actually had exceptionally large

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.770
feet for his height, with his shoes measuring
in at a European size of 43 at the age of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.690
18, which is about a size 10 in U.S. sizes.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.600
According to Rainier by the time he hit 21,
while still barely

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.310
classified as a dwarf in height, his shoe
size had gone up to a European size 53, which

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.170
would be about a size 20 in the U.S. (for
reference, Shaquille O’Neal wears a size

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.770
22-23).

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.150
Although his feet were continuing to grow
at a remarkable pace, Rainer himself was staying

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.950
at more or less the same height.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.350
That’s when something even more bizarre
than his clown-feet happened.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.860
For a reason unknown at the time, Adam started
growing again… rapidly.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.080
What must have initially seemed a blessing
to the short Rainer, soon turned into a curse.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.540
From his 21st birthday to his 32nd, Rainer
grew from just under 4 feet 10 inches tall

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.170
to 7 feet 2 inches tall (1.47 m to 2.18 m).

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.070
It should also be noted that his height would
have been greater than this, except by his

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.099
26th birthday he started developing a severe
spinal curve, which continued to progress

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.170
as he grew.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.340
This, and later difficulty in eating, had
the negative side effect of leaving Rainer

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.439
bed ridden for the majority of the latter
half of his life.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.950
If that wasn’t bad enough, he also went
blind in his right eye and his vision diminished

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.950
in his left.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.340
His hearing also started to go and he became
deaf in his left ear.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060
So what caused this extreme shift in height?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.670
After a medical exam done by Doctors F. Windholz
and A. Mandl, they discovered a tumor on his

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.150
pituitary gland, which not only explained
his rapid growth but his partial blindness

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.150
as well.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.319
As far as the growth is concerned, this tumor
resulted in a condition known as acromegaly,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.780
where the pituitary gland produces excessive
amounts of growth hormone during adulthood.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.730
His vision loss was due to the compression
of his optic chiasm, which is where the right

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.930
and left eye nerves cross near the pituitary
gland.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.660
To try to fix the problem, in 1930 doctors
removed the tumor, but he still continued

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.171
to grow, albeit at a much slower rate that
seemed even slower than it was because of

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:12.159
his spinal curvature continuing to increase.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.390
For instance, from December 1930 to May of
1931, his standing height stayed the same,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.669
but his spinal curvature increased.

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.980
Over the next and final 19 years of his life,
Rainer’s spinal curve would continue to

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.540
increase and he’d grow another 6 inches,
dying at the age of 51 in 1950 at a height

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.010
of about 7 feet 8 inches (2.34 m), making
him the only known person to spend time officially

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.909
classified as a dwarf and then as a giant.

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.950
Bonus Fact:
• The word “giant” ultimately derives

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.340
from the name of a Greek mythological race
of giants defeated by the gods, with the help

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.019
of Heracles, when the giants tried to free
the Titans.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.859
This race were called “gigas” and were
the children of Gaia and Uranus.

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.540
They were produced when Kronus castrated Uranus,
with Uranus’ blood fertilizing Gaia.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.980
Once the giants were defeated, they were buried
deep underground to imprison them.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.049
According to Greek mythology, earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions are caused by the race

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.209
of giants struggling to free themselves from
the depths of the Earth.

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.819
The Greek word “gigas” evolved into the
English word “giant” via Latin and then

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.590
the Old French “geant”, which by 1350
had been adopted into English as “giant”.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.060
It was first used to describe a person who
is exceptionally tall in 1559 and before that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:47.939
simply as an adjective to describe some attribute
that a person had that was exceptional.
