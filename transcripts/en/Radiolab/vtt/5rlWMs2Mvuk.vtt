00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.560
You are listening to radio lab

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
<v 1>lab.</v>

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.843
<v 0>Where do you live?</v>

4
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.050
<v 1>W and Y. C c? Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.180
<v 0>N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

6
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.520
This is radio lab, the podcast.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.020
Robert, Robert is not here. He is away.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880
So it's just me unfortunately. But I will do my best. So in this podcast, uh,

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.980
I want to dig a little deeper into something that we ran into in our last a new

10
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.950
full episode, which was on words

11
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.190
and green

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.470
door. So yeah,

13
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:50.120
we did an hour on the power of words and uh, we ended up talking with this guy.

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.640
Hello? Hello. Is this Dr Ferny? Huh? Hi, can you hear me?

15
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.810
The name Charles Ferny Hill.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.320
I'm a writer and developmental psychologist from Durham University and we were

17
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.230
having this conversation with him about what happens to young kids when they

18
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.300
learn words to step up things that you know,

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.380
like what happens to the way they see the world.

20
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.490
And in the middle of the chat he said something kind of radical,

21
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.300
which was the four. They have words I don't think very young children.

22
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:15.200
Do you think

23
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.140
like think period did?

24
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:22.570
Was there a period at the end of that sentence you don't think that they think

25
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:26.140
period? I don't think they think in the way that I want to call thinking.

26
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.460
All right, which is a bit of a cheat,

27
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.170
but let me say what he meant is that thinking as he defines it is basically just

28
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:36.190
words sounding silently in your head and before you have those words in your

29
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:40.480
head, you can't think this is a controversial idea,

30
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.800
which we debated back and forth,

31
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.690
but for the next few minutes we're not going to debate it.

32
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.880
We're going to jump into it farther because whether or not you think it's true,

33
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.640
if you follow the idea all the way through as we're about to do,

34
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.330
it does lead you to some interesting places.

35
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.780
So first of all, this whole idea is this. Charles goes back to this Russian guy,

36
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.910
Russian psychologist named

37
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.610
Vigotsky Lev Vygotsky, and is he a contemporary dude? No,

38
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
he died in the 30s he was, he was active and anyhow, he came up with this idea.

39
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.530
It's really interesting notion of how kids learn to think and it all begins.

40
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.240
He said on the outside,

41
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.560
think about a small child who's sitting down solving a puzzle.

42
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.460
How come does that look like? It goes somewhere. You're

43
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.470
<v 4>here,</v>

44
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.170
you're sitting down and you're working together on a puzzlement and all you've

45
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:40.130
got to do is get these shapes into this board in the right kind of order.

46
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.690
If you watch any kid and it would that parent anywhere in the world doing this

47
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:48.260
kind of thing, you'll see them thinking together.

48
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.630
Having the child for example, picks up a picture of a boat and says, you know,

49
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.420
read it. Where am I going to put this piece? And then the mom says, well,

50
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.010
have a look at the fella. And

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.340
<v 0>then the kids looks at the shape and says, oh, he's got that points a bit there.</v>

52
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.840
And the mum says, right,

53
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.040
well can you see anywhere on the board that has a pointy bit right there and so

54
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.720
on. According to Vygotsky, this is the beginning of thinking,

55
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.710
this kind of dialogue and at this point is completely external.

56
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.430
It's all happening in that space between the child and her mother. It, yeah.

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.960
We don't know where it goes yet, but if you put it together and any over time,

58
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.960
does it become internalized and how that happens.

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.420
The gassy thought is that as the child gets older,

60
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.350
she'll start to take on the dialogue herself. She'll start to talk to herself.

61
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.070
This is the stage we called private speech. We've all seen kids do this, right,

62
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.200
where they narrate every single thing they're doing. Put the ball in the box,

63
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.880
take the ball out of the box.

64
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.450
Now what then happens is a few years further down the line,

65
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.440
these kids who are narrating everything they're doing then go to school and the

66
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.870
teachers tell them, shh, don't talk out loud.

67
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.290
So they kind of get the message that they need to start doing this internally.

68
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.350
So they start to whisper to themselves out loud,

69
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.351
and then eventually they whisper to themselves silently because the words are

70
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:12.280
now in their head. And that according to Vigotsky's theory,

71
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.040
that his thinking only then he says is the child having a thought?

72
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.953
<v 5>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.620
<v 6>Now forgetting the particulars for a second.</v>

74
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.660
The main point here is that those thoughts that are humming along silently in

75
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:29.494
your mind,

76
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.240
those thoughts began as a duo with your mom

77
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.520
or a trio with your mom and your dad or a quartet with your mom and your dad and

78
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.930
your sister. In other words, those thoughts began as a crowd.

79
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
The logic of it is that all our thinking is full of other people's voices.

80
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.490
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

81
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.730
<v 6>now, most of us know that the voices in our head are just us,</v>

82
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.750
but what got us interested in this whole Vygotsky thing is it maybe this idea

83
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:05.751
has something to say to people who actually do hear other voices in their head.

84
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.560
Yeah. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming up here.

85
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.400
As we were thinking about this, just so happened that our producer,

86
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.750
pat Walters had taken a trip to Denver, had a little time on his hands,

87
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:23.430
did a little research and ended up tracking down this late and I'm Molly Martin

88
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:26.700
and I am a psychotherapist and I run the hearing voices network of Denver.

89
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.020
They met up at this hotel.

90
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.950
Molly works with people who hear voices in their heads and she runs a support

91
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:35.760
group for people to share their experiences. The day pat was there,

92
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.560
she introduced him to a fellow named Mark [inaudible].

93
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.210
<v 7>Hi, I'm Marcus Masias. Uh, I'm a voice here myself.</v>

94
00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:45.080
I hear voices so I can kind of share my experiences.

95
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.250
<v 6>Can you kind of tell me this story of</v>

96
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.330
<v 7>well yeah. Um, you know, I first started hearing them 20 years ago,</v>

97
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.230
so I've been hearing him for 20 years and so I'm 40 now,

98
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.310
so here's what, when I was 20,

99
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 6>when I first started hearing them, when it started for him,</v>

100
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.970
he says the voices would kind of materialize out of background noise,

101
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.060
like the hum of a refrigerator or the wear of a fan.

102
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.050
When I first started hearing, um, they were kind of guiding a little bit,

103
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:14.090
you know, like guiding voices. Like she says,

104
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:15.650
initially the voices would help them out.

105
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.500
Like if he was in an argument and about to say something mean,

106
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.700
the voices would warn him, be careful, watch out. They say things like that,

107
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.930
you know, kind of like they were helpful. But then, uh,

108
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.810
there was like other negative ones. He's had periods in his life.

109
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.670
He says we were the voices of even turned demonic. Yeah. So that was intense.

110
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.540
Things are a lot better now though. She, I'm learning how to manage him,

111
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.980
you know, cause I'm taking care of myself. So, okay, so why do we bring this up?

112
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.980
Well, clearly for a lot of people,

113
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.790
like Marcus hearing voices involves some psychiatric issues,

114
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.510
which sometimes for people it can be serious, really serious.

115
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.800
But here's the weird thing.

116
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.270
<v 0>The experience of hearing somebody else's voice in your own head is actually way</v>

117
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:01.660
more common than you would think.

118
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.280
Surveys have been done about this and the number seems to be between five and

119
00:07:06.281 --> 00:07:11.281
10% of normal healthy people have that experience or have had it at one time.

120
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.860
Which brings us back to this philosophy situation.

121
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.320
What might be happening in those cases, Lisa, if yes,

122
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.340
Charles is a kind of misattribution of your own inner voice.

123
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.450
Those voices in your head,

124
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:30.100
which are you get mistaken to be from someone else.

125
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.450
A Nice, simple,

126
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.100
elegant demonstration of this is that you take some people who are hearing

127
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.750
voices, people with, um,

128
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.010
in this case a diagnosis of schizophrenia who hear voices and you sit them down

129
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.390
at a microphone, some headphones on, and you show them some words on a screen,

130
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.180
just flush up some words on a screen. And their task is to repeat the words,

131
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:53.350
to read the words out loud.

132
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.920
Now if you can imagine these subjects are seeing these words on the screen,

133
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.310
they're repeating them into the mic and they've got headphones on.

134
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:04.570
So they're actually hearing their own voices as they're doing this trick is the

135
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.030
researchers have rigged it so that the voice in their headphones,

136
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:11.980
their voice actually gets lower just a little bit right before they hear it.

137
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.060
What that means is that if I were to say, hello, my name is Jad,

138
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.020
what I'd hear in my headphones is, hello, my name is Chad. And as you know,

139
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.360
she loaded the pitch of the voice by a few semitones.

140
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.750
It becomes much harder to recognize it because when I'm speaking in this lowered

141
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:30.010
voice, you can still kind of recognize it's me, but it's a little bit hard.

142
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.180
Now what the experimenters found is that most people,

143
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.250
most non voice hearing quote unquote healthy people when they were presented

144
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:43.810
with the sound of their own voice lowered like this and then asked, is this you?

145
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.260
Is it a stranger or you're not sure? They did make mistakes.

146
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.510
Some mistakes.

147
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.340
The voice here is made considerably more mistakes.

148
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.900
Really. Yeah. Not only that, when they heard their voices lowered,

149
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.150
they would very, very often say that voice is coming from a stranger.

150
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.090
That's not me. That's not myself. That didn't come from me.

151
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.930
Now of course that is potentially find new experience.

152
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.960
That is potentially a very distressing experience, but not always

153
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.050
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

154
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.730
<v 0>Cause let's just imagine that God ski was right,</v>

155
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.060
that the internal voice of our thoughts is actually a blend of all of those

156
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.550
external voices from our childhood. So in other words that our mom,

157
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:28.620
our dad or sisters, brothers, whatever,

158
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:33.030
they're all in there in some way and that can actually be a comfort

159
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.110
back at that hotel in Denver. Molly Martin, yes.

160
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.430
<v 6>Told pat about a woman who had seen her father murdered.</v>

161
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.660
He was shot in front of her. Um, and she was,

162
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.880
it was a robbery and it was, I believe at a convenience store.

163
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.720
And for years afterwards, she says this woman would hear her dad's voice.

164
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.870
She would tell us that every morning when she would wake up,

165
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
he would tell her to make her bed and he would remind her throughout the day to

166
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:12.470
do more positive things. And if she was doing something, for example,

167
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:15.590
if she wanted, she was a drug addict and she wanted to use drugs again,

168
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.330
her father would say to her things like, you know, don't do it. You know,

169
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.470
it's bad for you. It's a horrible, you know, more looking after her.

170
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.870
I think she might've been 11 when he was killed, but

171
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.680
it was a good relationship during that time. Yeah.

172
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.850
And then it just kind of like stuck like frozen. Yeah, I think so. I think so.

173
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.283
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.440
Okay, so before we go,

181

182
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.330

189
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.150
<v 6>on a cow's back. This is a very meaningful image to us,</v>
