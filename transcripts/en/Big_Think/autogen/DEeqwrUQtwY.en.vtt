containment of Saddam Hussein was a
 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.120
containment of Saddam Hussein was a
viable and perfectly adequate option

and around Europe because the sanctions
 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.980
and around Europe because the sanctions
were alleged to be hurting innocent

suffering that was going on in Iraq was
 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200
suffering that was going on in Iraq was
because Saddam Hussein was causing the

because Saddam Hussein was causing the
 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.030
because Saddam Hussein was causing the
suffering but wanted the sanctions to be

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040
suffering but wanted the sanctions to be
 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.460
suffering but wanted the sanctions to be

to undermine international support for
the sanctions but Powell's idea was

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610
the sanctions but Powell's idea was
 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.250
the sanctions but Powell's idea was
essentially to challenge him at that

essentially to challenge him at that
 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.230
essentially to challenge him at that

rebuilding regional and global support
 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.640

states are going to have to work out a
 

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.230
states are going to have to work out a
new arrangement where essentially the

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240
new arrangement where essentially the

will move more slowly and secondly we
 

00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:59.730
will move more slowly and secondly we
will keep some kind of residual force in

the increase in US combat forces there
was the change in strategy which is

was the change in strategy which is
 

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.840
was the change in strategy which is
probably even more significant away from

the case of Russia they may actually

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:31.700
the case of Russia they may actually
 

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.819
the case of Russia they may actually
have to develop a real economy which

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:33.829
have to develop a real economy which
 

00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:36.190
have to develop a real economy which
wouldn't be bad news and in the case of

wouldn't be bad news and in the case of
 

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.949
wouldn't be bad news and in the case of
places like Iran or Venezuela they won't

00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:38.959
places like Iran or Venezuela they won't
 

00:41:38.959 --> 00:41:42.219
places like Iran or Venezuela they won't
have this all these extra resources to

have this all these extra resources to
 

00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:45.519
have this all these extra resources to
cause mischief and indeed to the

those are the exceptions and I think the

or the structure and I interviewed a lot

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480
or the structure and I interviewed a lot
 

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.180

of people and looked at a lot of people

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.190
of people and looked at a lot of people
