1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,010
Most of us grow up thinking that the
bond between infant and mother is a very

2
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:11,480
tight sharing of interests.
However,

3
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:15,440
in fact if we look at it from the point
of view of the genes that are in the

4
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:16,670
mother and in the offspring,

5
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:21,671
we see that there is a strong potential
for evolutionary conflict that has

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,010
medical consequences and so I would
like to start this by talking about the

7
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:31,190
evolutionary theory behind
parent offspring conflict.

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,510
We owe that to bill Hamilton who came
up with the idea of cancellation to Bob

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,600
Trevor's who saw that that
had implications for parent
offspring conflict and to

10
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:46,190
David Haig who saw that parent offspring
and mother father conflict both will

11
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,140
have influence on the course of pregnancy.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,660
So the basic idea of kin selection comes
from Bill Hamilton here photographed on

13
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,140
the Amazon River,
a British evolutionary geneticist.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,210
Bill saw that what matters in
evolution is not individual survival,

15
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:05,960
but the increase in frequency of the
genes that are carried by an individual.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,860
That's an insight he got from Fisher
and Haldane and others therefore pays an

17
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,840
individual to sacrifice itself.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,920
If more copies of that individual's
genes get into the next generation,

19
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:21,650
then if that individual
did not sacrifice itself.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,210
So there can be a conflict between
genetic interest in individual survival.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,480
The costs and benefits of acts are
weighed against each other in genetic

22
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:33,314
currency.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,010
Yeah.

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,010
And genes exist not only in the
individual but also in its relatives.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,250
Therefore,

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,930
if an individual can help its relatives
to survive and reproduce and if the

27
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:50,931
increase in the number of its genes in
the next generation through offspring of

28
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:55,230
relatives is greater than the
decrease through its own offspring,

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,360
is a consequence of that act than
helping behavior will be selected.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,820
Now, how do we calculate genetic
costs and benefits? Well,

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,160
if we let be equal benefit,

32
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:13,050
that would be the increase
in the recipient's fitness
is as the result of an act.

33
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,210
See,

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,770
the cost would be the decrease in the
donor's fitness is the result of an act

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,490
are,
is the coefficient of relationship,

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,810
which is the probability that a gene in
the donor and a gene and the recipient

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,870
are identical by descent
from a common ancestor.

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,700
Yeah.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,900
Given that the condition for helping is
that B divided by c is greater than one

40
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:42,901
divided by r or there'd be times R is
greater than c times one or to put it into

41
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,794
English.

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,370
The increase in the relatives fitness
as a result of the act times the

43
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,970
relationship to the relative.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
So that's B Times r is greater than the
decrease in the donor's is a result of

45
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,070
the act times its relationship to itself.

46
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,380
It's relationship to itself is one.

47
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,180
Yeah,

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,180
so some of the kinds of traits that are
proposed as instances of Ken selected

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,790
quote,

50
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,790
all through wisdom of acting to save
others that are costing yourself include

51
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:22,760
alarm calls in birds,

52
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,080
ground squirrels and primates
guarding behavior and vigilance,

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,930
helping at the nest in birds,

54
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,720
suppressed reproduction which we see
and bees and wasps and ants in social

55
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:37,730
carnivores like mere cats.

56
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:41,180
Wild dogs dwarf mongooses and
hyenas and they could mole rats.

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,850
Here we see some mere
cats confronting a cobra.

58
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:48,851
They have both suppressed reproduction
with one female reproducing and the rest

59
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:52,460
helping and they have guarding
behavior and vigilance.

60
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,740
Now there are alternative explanations
for some of these behaviors,

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,010
but these are the kinds of things that
behavioral ecologist explain his kin

62
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,604
selected.

63
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,020
Now the next idea is that of parent
offspring conflict, which we get from Bob.

64
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,854
Trevor's

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,030
apparent in a diploid sexually reproducing
species is 50% related to each of its

66
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,474
offspring,

67
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,950
and that means it would like to invest
equally in each of its offspring.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,480
However,
the offspring is 100% related to itself.

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,960
It's 50% related to its full sibs
and it's 25% related to half sibs.

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,360
Therefore,
an offspring should,

71
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:41,740
should try to get more investment from
its parents than its parents had been

72
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,420
selected to give. That's that difference
between a hundred percent and 50%

73
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,343
okay.

74
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,550
The offspring should seek to force the
parental investment upwards until it's

75
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,780
inclusive fitness.

76
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,760
It's own fitness plus what it would get
from current or potential siblings is

77
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,580
maximized.
It doesn't try to take everything,

78
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,630
but it tries to take more
than the parent wants to give.

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,490
Yeah,

80
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,410
so parent and offspring are expected
to disagree over how long the period of

81
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:20,670
parental investment should be over the
amount of parental investments should be

82
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:25,080
given and over the altruistic or
selfish behavior of offspring towards

83
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:25,914
relatives.

84
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,460
Yeah,

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,690
parent offspring conflict is expected
increase during the period of parental

86
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:36,691
care and offspring are expected to
employee both biological and psychological

87
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,490
weapons in conflict with their parents.

88
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,630
The next step in this train of reasoning
came from David Haig who thought about

89
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,860
parent offspring conflict in pregnancy.

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,980
As with any,
oh,

91
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,050
an offspring that's the fetus is selected
to extract more from the mother than

92
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,791
the mother is selected to give and we've
seen from our study of invasiveness

93
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,040
that fetal tissue in the
placenta is put into itself,

94
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,690
into a position to manipulate maternal
physiology and it can do that by hormone

95
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,524
production.

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,030
That kind of manipulation is easier
when the fetal tissue has invaded the

97
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:26,380
maternal tissue in the placenta and
there are two with two main ways of doing

98
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:30,130
that. One is to increase maternal blood
pressure that continues the risk for

99
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:34,750
Preeclampsia and the other is to increase
the sugar concentration of maternal

100
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,560
blood that leads to
pregnancy related diabetes.

101
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,560
Yeah.

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,680
This kind of control is
related to genetic imprinting.

103
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,630
Genes are imprinted or turned
off by methylating the DNA,

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,210
we're changing the acetylation
pattern in histones.

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,430
Some genes are imprinted differently in
the germ line of fathers and mothers.

106
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,930
This is called parent of
origin or genomic imprinting.

107
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:08,020
Genes imprinted in the germ line are
not expressed early in fetal development

108
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,360
and they are then reprogrammed in the
germ line of the adult to be appropriate

109
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,520
for being either a mother or father.
Okay. Either a male or a female.

110
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,480
There is a connection between kin
selection and genomic imprinting.

111
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,790
The mother is 50% related to each year
for her offspring as we have emphasized,

112
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,390
but if she has future
offspring with other males,

113
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,410
then only this offspring is
50% related to the father.

114
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,530
The others will not be
related to him at all.

115
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,090
Yeah.

116
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,520
Thus to the degree that
meeting is polygamous.

117
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,210
Paternal genes are going to be selected
to extract more from the mother than the

118
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:52,830
mother is selected to give and the mother
or the maternal genes will be selected

119
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,664
to resist.

120
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,510
So to develop that idea
in a bit more detail.

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,750
What's going on is that the father is
turning off genes that downregulate

122
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:10,390
growth, so paternally expressed
transcripts, enhanced growth.

123
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,810
There's an interesting double negative
here. Let me run through it again.

124
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,350
The father is turning off genes that
downregulate growth paternally expressed

125
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:21,550
transcripts,
enhance growth.

126
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,110
The mother is turning off
genes that upregulate growth,

127
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,260
so maternally express
transcripts inhibit growth.

128
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,410
The normal state of the embryo is that
there is an equilibrium in which both

129
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:38,440
mother and offspring are in
reasonably good condition.

130
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,280
Yeah.

131
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,113
However,

132
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
the conflict is revealed when the action
taken by one parent is canceled by

133
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,050
disrupting the imprinting
in mice.

134
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:56,051
This can be done with extended with a
genetic manipulation and that produces an

135
00:08:56,101 --> 00:09:00,480
increase or decrease of about
10% in birth weight. In humans,

136
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:04,470
we rely on mutations that
produced rare diseases.

137
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,360
We'll talk more about that later.

138
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,550
Yeah.

139
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,890
The idea is well supported for the jeans,

140
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:15,891
Igf two and Igf two r this is insulin
like growth factor and its receptor CDK

141
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:21,060
nic and GRB 10 but there's not yet.

142
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,740
We'll support it for others genes that
are known to be imprinted by sex of

143
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,040
origin.
So to summarize,

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
natural selection acts to
increase the frequency of genes,

145
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,490
not the survival of individuals.

146
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,880
Genes can influence their fate by
influencing actions that affect the

147
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,590
reproductive success of relatives.

148
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,450
Okay.

149
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,990
Parent and offspring are in conflict
over reproductive investment.

150
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,920
The offspring is selected to demand more
than the period of selected to give.

151
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,600
Okay.

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,100
Maternally and fraternity derived genes
are in similar conflict within the,

153
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,660
within the offspring.

154
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,690
And this seems to explain
genomic imprinting that is
parent of origin in pretty,

155
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,370
in both cases,

156
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:13,290
the normal condition is an equilibrium
established by an evolutionary tug of war.

157
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,660
Disrupting that equilibrium can
manifest in unselected pathology.
