00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.270
These books are all about this ring. How it's
found and [spoiler alert] how it's destroyed.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.170
While Tolkien built the largest and most consistent
fictional universe he sure didn't mind being

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.450
vague at times -- so if you finished the story
and then thought: wait, what can this ring

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.410
do and where did it come from? This is your
video.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.599
First thing first: The One Ring is not the
only ring -- it's Lord of the Ring*s*, after

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.699
all -- and that lord is Sauron.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.179
Long before this story starts, Sauron disguised
himself and came to the elves to work with

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.779
their master craftsman Celebrimbor to forge
the rings of power. Together they made 16

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.710
-- called the lesser rings, then Celebrimbor
took Sauron's formula and made three on his

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.000
own that turned out more powerful than the
original 16.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.910
Why make rings based on the suggestion of
a stranger whose resume has a millennia-long

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
gap? Because he promised the rings would fix
the Elves biggest problem: this world is winding

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.440
down. The amount of big and awesome and magic
decreases as a function of time here.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.350
For elves, magic *immortal* creatures, this
is bad news. Sauron said the rings would preserve

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.540
what their wearers cared about most. That's
why the Elven kingdoms are so fantastical

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.960
compared to the rest of the world -- their
rings have preserved them

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.810
Unlike the famous poem implies, the elves
made all the rings for themselves intending

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.539
exactly 0 to get into the hands of men or
dwarves, whom the elves think are stinky -- so

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.479
obviously something went wrong. Which brings
us back to The One Ring to rule them all.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.280
Sauron's chief ability's is to dominate the
minds of others -- that's partly why he's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.409
able to control such large armies -- and he
secretly made the The One Ring as a kind of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.939
lens to focus this power -- his formula for
ring construction, unknown to Celebrimbor,

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.649
also made the wearers of the nineteen rings
more vulnerable.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.179
Basically: The One Ring buffs his psy attack
and the other rings debuf psy defense.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.119
Plan A was to control a bunch of high-level
elves. But when he put The One ring on, the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.249
elves' base-level stats allowed them to resist
and take off their rings just in time.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.340
Sauron captured Celebrimbor and tortured him
until he gave up the 16 lesser rings -- but

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.079
he died before revealing who was protecting
the three most powerful ones.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.359
So Sauron now had 16 mind-controlling rings
and had to turn to plan B: dwarves.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.069
Sauron manipulated sevens rings into the hands
of the dwarven kings but that didn't work

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.499
well either -- Dwarves are a kind of clockwork
creature Sauron found impossible to control.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.330
But the rings weren't super helpful for dwarves
either who loved treasure above all else so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.830
the rings grew their hordes large enough to
attract dragons who ate the dwarves and their

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.910
precious rings.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.040
Finally, in the hands of men, ever the corruptible
species, the rings worked as expected: Sauron

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.750
controlled their minds. And, as mortals, they
valued their lives the most, which the rings

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.070
stretched for 1,000s of years. Stretched so
thin the men turn into invisible wraiths.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.280
Anyway, these domination plans don't go unnoticed,
there�s a big war -- Sauron is defeated

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.390
and fades and The One Ring is lost.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.370
But the One ring is tricksy. It has a mind
of its own and wants to get back to Sauron,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.570
which brings us back to its powers:

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.790
First: the ring tempts everyone (Well, almost
everyone) with promises that, yes this little

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.260
ring can be a mighty weapon or a tool to reshape
the world, and gosh, don't you just look like

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.070
the best guy to use it? Let's go vanquish
the powerful-demigod who lives over there

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.980
to get started, shall we. Hmmm?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.731
This is why the Hobbits made great ring bearers:
because they're pretty happy with the way

00:02:59.731 --> 00:03:03.820
things are and don't aspire to greatness.
Of course, there's Gollum who started out

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.990
as a hobbit, but all things considered he
held out pretty well for a couple hundred

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.620
years. Set the ring on the desk of most men
and they wouldn't be able to finish their

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.470
coffee before heading to Mordor to rule the
world and do it right this time.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.410
It's worth considering that The One Ring's
promises are just lies -- that no one could

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.830
*really* overthrow Sauron with it -- The Ring
only wants to trick its wearer to get found

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.420
which brings us to...

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.420
Invisibility.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.580
Which outside the minds of characters, is
the only, tangible power the ring displays

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.120
for everyone else -- Invisibility seems great
-- but while you're hiding from that troll

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.540
you shine like a beacon in the unseen world.
Where the, also invisible ring wraiths, can

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.730
easily spot you.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.730
In summary:

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.210
The One Ring
a) Turns you invisible in the most unhelpful

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.860
manner
b) Is probably filled with lies, because

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.790
c) It's part of Sauron and works for him.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.340
He's so connected to it, that its destruction
ends him for good. But the formula also intertwines

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.569
The One Ring with all the rest. And so when
it fails, so do they.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.010
This is why the elves are *so somber*. Victory
over Sauron also means that the rings won't

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.690
preserve their kingdoms anymore -- and all
will diminish. These books are the end of

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.040
the age of magic and the beginning of the
age of men.
