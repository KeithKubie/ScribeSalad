00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.502
- Yeah, okay.
- 'Cause once Uber realizes

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:06.072
a large portion of their drivers
are under our control,

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.875
they'll have no choice but to
listen to your demands.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.343
- Very smart, very smart.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.078 align:end position:100%
- And at that point, you can
tell them,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.813 align:start size:78% position:22%
"Get rid of that onesie."

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.748
- Knock them down.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.117
That's the best idea.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.786
I love you, man.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.556
- I, uh...I love you too.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.127
Okay, so I think that's good for
today.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.962
- Okay.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.931
<i> - I'd never started a sleeper
 cell before.</i>

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.033
<i> But in doing some research
 online,</i>

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.903
<i> I learned that the key to
 running any clandestine cell</i>

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.139
<i> operation is having a
 communication structure that</i>

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.575
<i> kept the identities of the
 leaders secret.</i>

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:46.045
<i> That way, if any of our sleeper
 agents were compromised,</i>

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:48.314
<i> they wouldn't be able to rat us
 out to Uber</i>

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.450
<i> and bring down the cell.</i>

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.920
<i> From now on, we couldn't risk
 using our personal phones.</i>

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.622
<i> We'd have to get prepaid burner
 phones.</i>

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.792
<i> So to make sure the purchase
 couldn't be traced back to us,</i>

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.462
<i> I anonymously hired someone off
 Craigslist</i>

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.465
<i> to go to a local Walgreens and
 told him there would be cash</i>

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.935
<i> hidden in a dirty McDonald's
 cup outside the location,</i>

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.871
<i> which he was to use to buy up
 the store's entire supply</i>

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.973
<i> of prepaid cell phones.</i>

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.509
<i> The Craigslist guy was told to
 then bring the phones</i>

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.479
<i> to an abandoned pier at the San
 Pedro harbor</i>

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.514
<i> at exactly 1:15 p.m.,</i>

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:24.016
<i> where he would find a
 waterproof pouch hidden</i>

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.286
<i> inside a white first aid kit at
 the end of the dock.</i>

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.890
<i> He was then instructed to put
 all the phones into the pouch,</i>

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.026
<i> hook the base of the pouch to a
 nearby cinder block,</i>

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:37.296
<i> and throw it off the pier,
 where unbeknownst to him,</i>

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.166
<i> I was awaiting the delivery in
 full scuba gear</i>

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:43.002
<i> beneath the surface completing
 the final step</i>

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.638
<i> of a burner phone purchase that
 would be impossible</i>

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.875
<i> to trace back to either me or
 Andy.</i>

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.577
<i> Now that we had a way to
 communicate with our drivers,</i>

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.547
<i> we would need to figure out the
 commands to give them.</i>

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.983
<i> So I started researching Uber
 Yelp reviews</i>

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.286
<i> and online comments to see what
 behaviors from drivers</i>

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.188
<i> customers hated the most.</i>

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:05.391
<i> The complaints ranged from
 foul-smelling vehicles</i>

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:09.695
<i> to telling offensive jokes to
 blasting terrible music.</i>

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:12.131
<i> But to know which combination
 of these would be most</i>

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.400
<i> effective, we would need to
 test them out</i>

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.402
<i> on actual Uber customers.</i>

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:20.239
<i> So I had Andy go undercover and
 sign up for an Uber driver</i>

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.275
<i> account with his personal
 vehicle.</i>

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.877
<i> And after taking it for a final
 inspection</i>

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.113
<i> posing as an average Joe
 looking to make</i>

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.748
<i> a few extra bucks on the side..</i>

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.449
- Yeah, I'm just an average Joe,

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.819
make some money the side, you
know.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.756
- Yeah, I'm a normal guy.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.293
<i> - Andy was now registered as a
 fully accredited Uber driver.</i>

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.461
<i> And that meant we could begin
 our test.</i>

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.263
- "Playing bad music," yep.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.832

- Gas.
- Oh, that's bad, yeah.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:53.406
- What's the worst of these?
- The worst one's

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.474

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:58.377 size:81% position:41%
You're supposed to go to 5
North, drive me 5 South.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.814 align:start position:0%
That's it.
They're like, "No, it's crazy."

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.050 align:end position:100%

like--

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.184 align:start position:0%

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.786 size:75% position:38%
I'm the master of these.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.521
- You're already a bad driver?

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:11.924 align:start position:0%
No, I'm not bad driver,
but I have lots of experience.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.260
<i> - To simulate the smell of
 driver farting,</i>

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:16.862
<i> I brought Andy box full of
 ziplock bags</i>

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.732
<i> each filled with a sulfur-based
 stink spray.</i>

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.801
So it's, like, one per ride.
- Okay.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:22.935 size:75% position:38%

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.637 align:start size:66% position:34%

<i> - To test the effects of bad

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.874
<i> I gave him a burned CD with an

Yeah.

Uh-huh.

Excuse me. Can I--can we roll

It's broken.
