00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.070
GILBERT STRANG: I'm coming
back to the number one

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.350
example, but not
the easiest example,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.770
of a second order equation
with an oscillating

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.800
forcing term, cosine omega t.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.290
We have to know the
answer to this problem.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.350
And it's a little messy,
but the method is not messy.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
The method is straightforward.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.940
So let me begin by looking
for the rectangular form.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.840
I call this the
rectangular form.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
It separates the cosine
with its amplitude

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.920
and the sine with its amplitude
into two separate pieces.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.950
So if I'm looking
for that solution,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.770
and m and n are the numbers I
want to find, how do I proceed?

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.350
It's a case of undetermined
coefficients, M and N.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.140
And the way to determine
them is substitute this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.090
into the equation and match the
cosine term and find M and N.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.830
And the way we find M and
N, we need two equations

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.990
for two quantities, M and N.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.010
And imagine this
substituted in there.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.280
I'll get some cosines.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.130
So the cosines on one
side will match the cosine

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.440
on the other side.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.780
And also from the derivative,
I'll get some sines

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.850
and they should match 0
because I have no sine omega

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.180
t on the right hand side.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.830
So I have two equations,
matching the sines,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.200
matching the cosines.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.985
And I solve those.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.990
Two equations, two unknowns.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020
And I just write
the answer down.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.530
M involves a C
minus omega squared.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.380
M is coming from the cosines.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.330
And we get cosines from
that term and that term.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.229
Divided by some number,
D, that I'll write down.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.726
And N is just B omega
divided by that same D.

00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:22.670
And now I'll write down D.
That's C minus A omega squared

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.580
squared plus B omega squared.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.110
This is what comes out from
the two equations for M and N.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.440
I just solve those equations.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.160
This D here is the
two by two determinant

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300
if we think about the linear
algebra behind two equations.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.560
And that's what it is.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.730
And so the answer now is
in terms of A, C, B, and D,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.660
which is a mixture of all of A,
B, and C. That's the solution.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.020
Only I always want to show you a
different form of the solution.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.060
And in this case, a better form.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.460
Because the most important
physical quantity

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.170
is the magnitude.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.720
How large does y get?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.920
What is the amplitude of this?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.270
This is a sinusoid.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.640
And we remember
that every sinusoid

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.570
can be written in a polar form.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.640
Says that y of t is
some amplitude of G,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.940
the gain, times a cosine
of omega t with a shift,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.190
with a lag, with an angle alpha.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.300
So I have two numbers now.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.730
That's the gain.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.835
And this is the
phase shift alpha.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.480
And that's an attractive form
because it has only one term.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.090
The two numbers, G and alpha,
get put into a single term

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.110
where we can see the
magnitude of the oscillation.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.560
And what does that
come out to be?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.480
I won't go through
all the steps.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.570
I'll just write down
what G turns out to be.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.820
G turns out to be--
it comes from there--

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.320
and it's 1 over the
square root of D. Well,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.050
G is the square root of
M squared plus N squared.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.960
The square root of M
squared plus N squared.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.160
And if I put M
squared and N squared,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.360
then I have D over D squared.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.660
I get that answer.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.150
That's the gain.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.300
Let me write that
word, gain, again.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.620
Because you got it there.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.060
Here it is again.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.680
And as always, the
tangent of alpha

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:20.910
is the N over the M, which
is just B omega over C

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.860
minus A omega squared.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.305
I like that polar form.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.440
And I feel I should
just do an example.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.300
I didn't do any of the
algebra in this video.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.770
But you know where
the algebra came from.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.500
It came from
substituting the form

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.590
we expect for the solution.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.850
And of course, that
form that we expect

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.100
is the form we get provided
omega, the driving frequency,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.740
is different from omega N.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.390
Well, no.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.830
I guess we're all right even
if omega is omega N, because we

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.850
have a damping term.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.020
So that's the answer.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.400
So an example.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.160
Why not an example?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.280
y double prime plus y prime
plus 2y equals cosine of t.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.240
That's a simple example.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.880
I took omega to be 1, you see.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.680
And there is omega.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.500
And then A is 1, B is 1, C is 2.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.600
We can evaluate everything.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.980
In fact, I think
M and N are 1/2.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.790
D, by the way, will be 1
squared plus 1 squared.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.790
That's 2 square root.

00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:54.750
Sorry.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.970
D will be 2.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.360
1 squared plus 1 squared.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.450
So what do I know?

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.000
Do I know the rectangular form?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.910
Yes.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.800
Rectangular form is 1/2.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.060
1/2 for both the
cosine and the sine.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:19.050
1/2 of cosine t plus sine t.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.230
That's the rectangular form.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.550
Two simple things, but
I have to add them.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.930
And in my mind, I
don't necessarily

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.060
see how the cosine
adds to the sine.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:38.900
But the sinusoidal identity,
the polar form, gives it to me.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.630
So what is it in polar form?

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.840
So G, the gain, is going to be
1 over the square root of 2.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.690
At the highest point, the cosine
and the sine are the same.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.970
They're both 1 over
the square root of 2.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.170
I have two of them.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.260
So I get 1 over the
square root of 2

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:11.010
cosine of t minus pi over 4
is the angle, the phase lag.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.070
When I add the
cosine and the sine,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.450
I get a sinusoid that's sitting
over pi over 4, 45 degrees.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.640
So those are the two forms.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.450
So in a nice example, we
certainly got a nice answer.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.530
We certainly did.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.990
Yes.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:38.289
So that is the-- worked out,
more or less worked out,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.340
in principle, worked
out-- is the solution

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:47.870
to what I think of as the most
important application when

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.750
the forcing term is a cosine.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.490
So it gives oscillating motion.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.350
It gives a phase shift.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.740
And it gives these formulas.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:06.490
The only thing I would
add is that I need

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.650
to comment on better notation.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:15.870
So I have used in these
formulas A, B, and C.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:23.630
But those have meaning as
mass, damping constant,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.310
spring constant.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.330
M, B, and K.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:37.330
And it's combinations
of those that come in.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:46.950
So let me just take this
moment to say better notation.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:52.130
Or maybe I should say
engineering notation

00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:04.550
instead of A, B, C, which are
mass, damping, spring constant.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.860
Well, that's already
better to use

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.820
letters that have a meaning.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.000
But the small but
very important point

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.790
is that two combinations
of A, B, C, M, B, K

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.480
are especially good.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.510
One is the natural frequency
that we've seen already,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.570
square root of C over A.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:38.220
Square root of K over
M. So that gives us

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.560
one important
combination of A and C.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.375
And the other one is
the damping ratio.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.365
And it's called zeta.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.360
And that damping ratio is B
over the square root of 4ac.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.147
Ha!

00:11:03.147 --> 00:11:04.730
You'll say, where
does that come from?

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.665
Or I can use these letters, B
over the square root of 4mk.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:20.180
That damping ratio
is, so to speak,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.800
it's the right
dimensionless quantity.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:32.980
The dimensions of this
ratio are just numbers.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.460
Those two quantities
have the same dimension.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.490
And we can see that because
in the quadratic formula

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.920
comes-- you remember that
in a quadratic formula

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.010
comes the square root
of b squared minus 4ac?

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:55.080
Now if you see a formula that
has b squared minus 4ac in it,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.750
you know that these must
have the same units.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.790
Otherwise, subtraction
would be a crime.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:12.950
So they have the same
ratio and the same units

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.520
and therefore the
ratio is dimensionless.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.637
Let me write that word.

00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:20.220
Dimensionless.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.910
So conclusion.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:30.550
I could rewrite the answer in
terms of these quantities omega

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.480
n and zeta.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.840
I won't do that here.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.550
That can wait for another time.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:45.080
But just to say since we've
found a solution to the most

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.210
important application
with cosine omega

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:55.130
t there, since we
found the solution,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.010
appropriate to comment that we
could write the answer in terms

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:04.560
of omega n, the natural
frequency, and z, zeta,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.800
the damping ratio.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.620
Thank you.
