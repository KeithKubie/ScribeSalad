00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.929
That's what brings us to one of the great
discoveries

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.810
in the early years of this century,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.900
the development of the cloud chamber.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.410
Now Bryson Gore has been building this cloud
chamber here

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.330
for several months. It has taken months of
his life out.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.450
And indeed this sort of thing here that Bryson
has built,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.720
the word has already got around and people
are phoning up

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560
and asking advice on how to build these things
from him.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.330
So this in itself is an amazing piece of apparatus
that we've got here.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.020
Down the bottom here we have some coolant,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.630
which is keeping this whole evacuated thing
at the top here nice and cool.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.250
And mists are forming inside it. You can see
the mists forming as we look.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.239
This originally was invented by a man called
Charles Wilson.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.000
He used to go hiking in the Scottish Highlands.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.880
He really loved the mists and he tried reproduce
them in the laboratory.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.050
He wanted to make atmosphere of his own to
study things with.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.860
And as a result of that, stumbled on this
amazing fact.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.840
That you will see shooting around little trails,
clouds seem to spontaneously form.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.509
The reason here is that in the middle we have
got a source of radiation.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.249
Alpha particle emitter, an alpha radioactivity.

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:21.520
The alpha particles are shooting out and as
they do so,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.060
the mist forms on them.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.439
You're not actually seeing the particles,
you're seeing their footprints.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.159
You're seeing where they have been.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.909
It's like a plane coming into land and you
see the mist forming on the wingtips.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.719
This was such an amazing development that
Rutherford himself said:

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.969
"At least we've got a telescope that we can
look inside the atom

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.869
and see what's going on."

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.319
Here for the first time you're actually seeing
matter breaking down,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.609
radiating away. The trails of those alpha
particles shooting out into the mist.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.689
Now that is lovely and I think Bryson has
done a remarkable job here

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.210
producing this for us, I find amazing as I
watch it.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.929
It's like eerie seeing these things happening
right before us.
