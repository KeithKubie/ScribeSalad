well for us I actually was told by very

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800
well for us I actually was told by very
 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.890
well for us I actually was told by very
one of the largest manufacturers in the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
one of the largest manufacturers in the
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.210
one of the largest manufacturers in the
world that it would cost thirty dollars

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
world that it would cost thirty dollars
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.739
world that it would cost thirty dollars
more for the laptop to be

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:18.749
more for the laptop to be
 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.720
more for the laptop to be
environmentally friendly and I thought

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
environmentally friendly and I thought
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.870
environmentally friendly and I thought
you know that's just too much money

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
you know that's just too much money
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880
you know that's just too much money
we're not going to do it and they were

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
we're not going to do it and they were
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.769
we're not going to do it and they were
wrong we've made the most

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
wrong we've made the most
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.469
wrong we've made the most
environmentally friendly laptop ever

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479
environmentally friendly laptop ever
 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.410
environmentally friendly laptop ever
made and it wasn't it was by trying to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
made and it wasn't it was by trying to
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049
made and it wasn't it was by trying to
do trying to design for the developing

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
do trying to design for the developing
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.939
do trying to design for the developing
world and for children the batteries

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949
world and for children the batteries
 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.439
world and for children the batteries
can't explode right I mean take your

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449
can't explode right I mean take your
 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.990
can't explode right I mean take your
company they have recalls about every

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
company they have recalls about every
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.119
company they have recalls about every
six months of millions of batteries that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
six months of millions of batteries that
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.250
six months of millions of batteries that
are exploding using lithium ion

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
are exploding using lithium ion
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.000
are exploding using lithium ion
technology and so we explore different

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
technology and so we explore different
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.029
technology and so we explore different
technology and the batteries that would

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
technology and the batteries that would
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.759
technology and the batteries that would
last much longer on the typical lithium

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769
last much longer on the typical lithium
 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.279
last much longer on the typical lithium
ion battery lasts some 500 tarde to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
ion battery lasts some 500 tarde to
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200
ion battery lasts some 500 tarde to
recharge cycles which is if you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
recharge cycles which is if you're
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.510
recharge cycles which is if you're
running off of battery all the time you

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520
running off of battery all the time you
 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.040
running off of battery all the time you
know a year a year and a half two years

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050
know a year a year and a half two years
 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.280
know a year a year and a half two years
well ours last 2000 charge recharge

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
well ours last 2000 charge recharge
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.470
well ours last 2000 charge recharge
cycles and so that's like five years

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480
cycles and so that's like five years
 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.730
cycles and so that's like five years
right even when you're running off

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
right even when you're running off
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.570
right even when you're running off
battery all the time and lithium Pharaoh

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
battery all the time and lithium Pharaoh
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.820
battery all the time and lithium Pharaoh
phosphate which which we use as well as

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
phosphate which which we use as well as
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580
phosphate which which we use as well as
nickel metal hydride lithium Pharaoh

are still sort of working this out is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
are still sort of working this out is
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.400
are still sort of working this out is
the new new technology but those are the

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410
the new new technology but those are the
 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.800
the new new technology but those are the
components of fertilizer so that's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
components of fertilizer so that's
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.970
components of fertilizer so that's
that's pretty great the reason that the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980
that's pretty great the reason that the
 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.000
that's pretty great the reason that the
OLPC laptop sort of got the title of the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010
OLPC laptop sort of got the title of the
 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.180
OLPC laptop sort of got the title of the
greenest laptop ever made was was was

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190
greenest laptop ever made was was was
 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.060
greenest laptop ever made was was was
multifold it looked but but much of much

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
multifold it looked but but much of much
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.010
multifold it looked but but much of much
of much of the um we rode the e use sort

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
of much of the um we rode the e use sort
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080

of legislation for reduction of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
of legislation for reduction of
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.970
of legislation for reduction of
hazardous substances so all of the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980
hazardous substances so all of the
 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.430
hazardous substances so all of the
factories the world were retooling so

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440
factories the world were retooling so
 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.830
factories the world were retooling so
they could ship to the EU so the EU

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
they could ship to the EU so the EU
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.750
they could ship to the EU so the EU
legislation really made a profound

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760
legislation really made a profound
 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.610
legislation really made a profound
difference for that but in addition we

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620
difference for that but in addition we
 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.200
difference for that but in addition we
got rid of the mercury which wasn't

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210
got rid of the mercury which wasn't
 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.690
got rid of the mercury which wasn't
required but we used in LED backlight so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
required but we used in LED backlight so
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190
required but we used in LED backlight so
that was really great as far as

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
that was really great as far as
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.740
that was really great as far as
hazardous substances but then you're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
hazardous substances but then you're
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.210
hazardous substances but then you're
left with things that that aren't really

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
left with things that that aren't really
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.640
left with things that that aren't really

Star compliance mandates which is you

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079
Star compliance mandates which is you
 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.839
Star compliance mandates which is you
know you think well they don't sort of

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
know you think well they don't sort of
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.699
know you think well they don't sort of
set the bar high enough like people

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709
set the bar high enough like people
 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.069
set the bar high enough like people
could do more and and you know I talk to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079
could do more and and you know I talk to
 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.899
could do more and and you know I talk to
people and they say well how do you

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909
people and they say well how do you
 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.210
people and they say well how do you
legislate that everybody can't do it I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220
legislate that everybody can't do it I
 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.330
legislate that everybody can't do it I
mean how do you legislate that that's a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
mean how do you legislate that that's a
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.190
mean how do you legislate that that's a
question but but also some of the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
question but but also some of the
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.890
question but but also some of the

stands for the to the ease in it are
electrical engineering and it's the

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599
electrical engineering and it's the
 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.899
electrical engineering and it's the
largest electrical engineering society

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909
largest electrical engineering society
 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.750
largest electrical engineering society
in the world and they came up with sort

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
in the world and they came up with sort
 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.599
in the world and they came up with sort
of a standard for what environmentally

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609
of a standard for what environmentally
 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.149

friendly laptops and computers should be

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159
friendly laptops and computers should be
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.030
friendly laptops and computers should be
and this organization said okay we're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
and this organization said okay we're
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.309
and this organization said okay we're
going to make that into you know a sushi

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319
going to make that into you know a sushi
 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.619
going to make that into you know a sushi
card and you check you can do each thing

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629
card and you check you can do each thing
 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.059
card and you check you can do each thing
and if you get enough checkmarks you get

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069
and if you get enough checkmarks you get
 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.369
and if you get enough checkmarks you get
this gold award when we got that but it

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379
this gold award when we got that but it
 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.059
this gold award when we got that but it
doesn't even count how long the product

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069
doesn't even count how long the product
 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.089
doesn't even count how long the product
lasts does the laptop last two years or

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099
lasts does the laptop last two years or
 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.939
lasts does the laptop last two years or
five years or you know what the what the

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949
five years or you know what the what the
 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.379
five years or you know what the what the
footprint is what's the size and weight

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389
footprint is what's the size and weight
 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.259
footprint is what's the size and weight
of it how much of this would end up in

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
of it how much of this would end up in
 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.119
of it how much of this would end up in
landfill like those aren't counted even

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129
landfill like those aren't counted even
 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.580
landfill like those aren't counted even
in this and so I think that there's a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590
in this and so I think that there's a
 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.030
in this and so I think that there's a
lot more that can be done but the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040
lot more that can be done but the
 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.759
lot more that can be done but the
question is really you know do you

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
question is really you know do you
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.210
question is really you know do you
regulate it or how do you incentive

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
regulate it or how do you incentive
 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.339
regulate it or how do you incentive
these bars they're probably not hard

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349
these bars they're probably not hard
 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.260
these bars they're probably not hard
enough

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270
 
 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.330
 
you
