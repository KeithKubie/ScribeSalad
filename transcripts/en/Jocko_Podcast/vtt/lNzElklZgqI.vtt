00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.270
What advice do you have for those who have weak,
poor,

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.010
or otherwise ineffective leaders?
How do you manipulate that situation?

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.930
So again,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
I think I may have actually answered this question before,

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.060
but I'll answer it again.
Sure.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.550
When,
Eh,
when you are in a situation like this,

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
when you've got somebody that's weak or ineffective leader or a poor leader,

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.030
the answer's always the same.
What you do is you lead,

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
you lead yourself and I hope people that listen to podcast,
all of irregular,

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.920
you all knew what I was going to say there.

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.160
You all know that when someone is not leading you,

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.950
then you lead them.
You pick up the slack for the weakness.

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.410
My leaders want to come up with a plan.
Cool.
I will.

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.890
My leader doesn't want to give a brief.
That's fine.
I will.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.320
My leader doesn't want to mentor the younger troops.
That's okay.

16
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.430
I will do it.

17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
Leader doesn't want to take the blame when something goes wrong.

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
That's fine with me.
I'm going to take the blame

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.900
and you think about that one.

20
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:19.320
That one can be tricky because you think I'm going to look bad in front of the,

21
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.150
in front of the more senior boss.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.790
Now think about it from the senior bosses position.

23
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.080
If if you work for me echo and the boss comes in and we the,

24
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.310
the mission was a failure and I'm the,

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.920
I'm the guy that's in charge and I say,
sorry boss,
we failed.

26
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.150
It was echo's fault and echo goes,
hey sir,
it was my fault.
Here's what happened,

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.580
here's the mistakes I made and here's what to do to fix it next time.

28
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.050
Who Do you respect more?
Yeah,
of course I'm looking to promote you.
You know,

29
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.420
I actually want to promote you and our fire myself from being a guy that's

30
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.150
passing the buck and passing responsibility,
not taking ownership of everything.

31
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.230
So imagine what that looks like before you get all intimidated by taking the

32
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.720
blame for something and think you're going to look bad and think you're going to

33
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:58.554
get fired.

34
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.340
Think about what it looks like from the senior perspective and you actually have

35
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.220
to imagine what it will look like underneath you.

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.270
You have to see it from your perspective cause it's even when you think about

37
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:12.510
their perspective,
you still can be in fear of it.
You Think,

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.320
oh I'm the guy that's taking the blame.
I'm the one that's going to get fired.
No.

39
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840
And am I saying this like blanket that there's some times where if the boss

40
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.070
screw something up really bad,

41
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:28.071
like let's say it was something like classified information got left out and it

42
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.530
was your boss that literally left it out and you go,
no,
it was me.

43
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540
Well first of all,
you're not telling the truth.
Right?

44
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.440
So you're not telling the truth and the person made a mistake.
That's that.

45
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.980
There's no excuse for yeah.
So that's not a situation that I'm talking about.

46
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.540
And if your boss was the type of person that said yes,

47
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.230
I'm going to put the blame on him,
I would burn them alive.
I'd be like,
actually,

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.510
here's what really happened.
So

49
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.840
I'm not talking about that type of situation.

50
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.830
But when you're doing an operational thing where there's mistakes that get made

51
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:02.080
and your to scared to take ownership of them,
take ownership of them,

52
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790
not that you will win in the long run.
Um,

53
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.543
now the,

54
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.580
now here's the part that is crucial and critical and the most challenging part

55
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.730
of this.
And that is when you step up and lead,

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you want to make sure you aren't stepping up and stepping on your leader.

57
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.900
You don't want to step into their little spotlight.

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.230
You don't want to impose yourself in their leadership limelight.

59
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.870
And Gloria,
you don't want to do that.
You,
you,
you can't do that.

60
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.580
You want them to get the credit.

61
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.880
You don't want to have them be intimidated by you in any way.

62
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.650
And this is hard because when you start taking ownership for stuff,

63
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.181
it's very,

64
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.181
it can be very intimidating for the person that's above you because they think,

65
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.330
Dang,
this guy just,

66
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.420
he's just a bold bastard than stepping up and taking charge of stuff.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.850
And they might get intimidated that.
So,

68
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.460
so what you have to do is you have to do some,

69
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.020
some indirect maneuver warfare here.
And for instance,

70
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.020
if they don't want to,
if they don't want to come up with a plan,

71
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.270
maybe you start saying,
hey sir,
what do you think of this?

72
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:20.260
Would this be a good plan?
And maybe if you're,

73
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.780
if they're not mentoring the younger guys,
maybe you say,
Hey,
you know what?

74
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.630
I want to do this up.
I want to spend some time with the guys after work.

75
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.580
Do you mind if I have a little session with them?

76
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.180
Kind of go over what we learned on last appointment or hey,

77
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.770
about this new regulatory thing that's come out in the business world and I want

78
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.920
to get our younger troops to know it.
Do you mind if I teach a class on that?

79
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.150
So you're,
you're asking them permission and you might even say,
you know,
hey,

80
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.780
I think it would look really good for you too if we were doing this.

81
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.220
Do you want to make them look good?
Um,
and

82
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.440
those are the ways that you do that.
You step up and lead.

83
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.970
But make sure you're not stepping on your leader because that,

84
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.530
that that could backfire and you could end up in a situation where they feel

85
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:10.531
intimidated and you're getting put in the dog house or fired or demoted or in

86
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.870
trouble because they feel intimidated by you.

87
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.720
So use caution if you have a good leader.

88
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.290
Some leaders just aren't that aggressive and when you start getting aggressive

89
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.843
they start,

90
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.990
they actually like the fact that you're getting aggressive and they like,

91
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.330
I mean I work for some people that I love the fact that I would take a step up

92
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:28.781
and take charge.

93
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:30.880
They had no problem with it because they were good confident leaders.

94
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.170
It's the insecure leader you have to watch out for the insecure leader that's

95
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:40.171
worried about looking bad and that's another two to change perspective.

96
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.170
Again on this,

97
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.170
when you as a leader have somebody that's stepping up and taking charge as and

98
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:50.410
you start feeling intimidated by it,
ask yourself why.
It's probably your ego.

99
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.550
You're being a weak leader by being intimidated by your subordinates.

100
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.360
If your subordinate is doing your job at doing it better than you let get step

101
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.850
up and start looking at how can you go up the chain of command?

102
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.910
How can you look up and out?
How,
what other areas can you focus on?

103
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.810
Since that leader has stepped up and is making things happen,
that's awesome.

104
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.880
That is awesome.
We want that [inaudible].
That's decentralized command,

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.840
that's building other leaders underneath you,
which is what your goal is.

106
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.980
A leader should always be,

107
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.740
and I'll tell you,
every time I see someone that goes,
oh,
I got a weak leader.

108
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:32.480
I'm always like,
lucky you.
Lucky you.
Take advantage of that.

109
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.270
Take advantage of it.
Do whatever you want.

110
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.720
You have such a good opportunity when you have a weak leader above,

111
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.250
you don't look at that.
Don't,

112
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:45.020
don't get all down trodden because one leader just doesn't motivate you.
Awesome.

113
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.640
Motivate yourself,
get char,
get in charge of things,
take advantage of it.

114
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.780
Make things happen.
It's awesome to have a weak leader.
I love it.
Get after it.

115
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.350
It's good to give me so much mobility in my,
in my,

116
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.180
in my job.
Right?
I'm so much more mobility than if I've got someone,
Hey,

117
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.830
if I've got someone that's a strong leader,
that's great too.

118
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.270
But weak leaders know factor.
Hmm.
I'm gonna take advantage of it.
Yes,

119
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.180
yes.
I would
like you got a weak leader and,

120
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.710
and you're,
um,
you're not stepping up.

121
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.450
You're essentially allowing the,
the group,
the team,

122
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:25.910
the objectives to kind of fail in a way.

123
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.660
You're kind of allowing it and then in a way to depends on what you do,

124
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:33.590
but in a way you're kind of be being like,
Hey,

125
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.990
all right.
You're allowing the excuse to be valid.
You know,
where,

126
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.330
which kind of makes it invalid really,
when you're like,
Hey,
I could step up,

127
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.060
but hey,
it's the leaders for as long as it's not my fault.
You know,

128
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.680
that my leaders,
not that it's you really not taking much ownership.

129
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.710
Yeah.
You just point your finger at your leader and say,
this is a weak leader.

130
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.730
That's not what we do here.
Not what we do at all.

131
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.890
And at the Times where I've had weak leaders,
I always took advantage of it.

132
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:02.030
Like I said one time,

133
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.360
and I've talked about this on the podcast before we fired our leader.
No,

134
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.920
we had a little mutiny that only happened once for me.
But yeah,

135
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.090
it happens that,
I mean,
I obviously,
I don't know all the details of that,

136
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:17.810
but in a way isn't that you just stepping up and making it happen.
I mean,

137
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.570
that's really the basic impending result.
Like Dang,
that's,

138
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.830
that's kind of where we're going to arrive at freely given us stepping up.
If,

139
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.370
if that's how it goes down.
That's how it goes down.
But you stepped up,

140
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:30.830
you solve the problem,
they're the problem,
and that was the problem.

141
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:35.270
There's your solution.
Yes.
Up and down the chain of command.

142
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.130
You got to own it for sure.
