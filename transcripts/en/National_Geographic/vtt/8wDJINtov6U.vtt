FRANCESCA FIORENTINI
(VOICEOVER):

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.533
That's how I ended
up in a body farm,

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.900
the biggest one in the country.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.867
The Forensic Anthropology
Research Center in South Texas

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.900
studies how bodies
decompose, and why.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
Their research helps law
enforcement officers,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.467
forensic specialists,
and scientists figure

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.266
out when and how a person died.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.700
I don't know if you've
ever tried digging

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.533
holes, especially in Texas.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.900
It's a pretty difficult thing
to do with all the limestone

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.166
we have around here.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.333
Totally.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:36.233
So another way that
Perpetrators tend to cover

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.867
the bodies by throwing
refuse on it, you know,

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.834
whatever's around, just to
try to conceal the body.

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:40.467
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
Perpetrators.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.467
Right.

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:42.300
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI:
So murderers.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
Exactly.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.900
So what this thesis project
is attempting to replicate

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.467
is, in that instance, that
they throw a mattress on top

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.300
of the body, how that
affects the decomposition

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.133
rate of these humans.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.600
FRANCESCA FIORENTINI: Wow.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.166
So if I donated my body
here, I could help solve

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.834
a murder from beyond the grave.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.734
What other good deeds can my
rotting corpse do for humanity?

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:08.100
[music playing]

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.233
That's-- that's real.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.066
OK.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.400
I am studying how the
clothing will affect vultures'

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.033
scavenging, if clothing,
like, impedes their ability

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.567
to access the body.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:29.567
They have a very
strong sense of smell.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.700
Are they just, like-- are
they watching us right now?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.667
KRYSTLE LEWIS: They could be.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:33.667
