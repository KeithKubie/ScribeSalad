00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.646
&gt;&gt;Student: This is all about
you learning your science words.

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:09.456
What's the picture?

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:11.886
&gt;&gt;Lauren: With our tech buddies,
they're learning how to work together.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.686
So it's not just the academic piece,

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:16.706
I think it also teaches a
lot of emotional skills.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:17.496
&gt;&gt;Student: So next one.

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:20.426
&gt;&gt;Lauren: The fifth graders feel
so proud of themselves after,

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:22.396
because they taught a younger student.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:22.906
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: See how easy that was?

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:34.526
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Here at John Barry,
technology transformed our school.

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:37.606
When we went to one to one devices,

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:41.086
we saw a huge increase
of student engagement.

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.246
&gt;&gt;Can you read that back to me?

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:45.756
&gt;&gt;Francesca: Technology gets used
through all curriculum subjects, math,

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.186
reading, writing, science,
social studies, art, everywhere.

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:52.546
&gt;&gt;All right, so you are my teachers
and here's your job for today.

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:55.716
Fifth graders will be teaching
first graders how to use Google Docs

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.976
to compose a piece of narrative writing.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.486
&gt;&gt;So tech buddies is a program where
we pair up one of the older grades

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:06.236
with a lower grade to expose the younger
students to various programs and apps.

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:11.606
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: We teach them how to use the
Chromebooks and how to search websites

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.476
that they haven't used before.

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:15.356
&gt;&gt;Francesca: What are some skills you
want to work on with your buddy today?

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.996
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: Help them copy and paste.

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:21.906
&gt;&gt;It makes me happy, because
I like when they learn.

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:23.886
&gt;&gt;Daniel: We started it small scale.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.566
Then now every single teacher

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.746
in our building is matched
up with a different grade.

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:32.476
&gt;&gt;Francesca: Our students meet once a
week for about an hour and Miss Saint J.

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:34.946
and I meet the week prior to plan.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:38.486
&gt;&gt;Lauren: We talk about what types
of things are in my curriculum

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.136
that my students will
need to do on their own.

00:01:41.186 --> 00:01:42.886
&gt;&gt;Charlize's buddy, come on in.

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.076
&gt;&gt;And then we look at what is going
to motivate them to learn these parts

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.726
of the curriculum, what
program, what device.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:52.376
In the beginning, we
rolled it out slowly.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.086
Each week was one program.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.416
We did Google Classroom, Padlet, Osmo.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:00.506
Once they had the skills in each
program, we put them all together

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:02.386
and started to send to rotation model,

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:06.326
so that they could use multiple
programs in one session.

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:10.706
So in our tech buddy session today, the
first program they used was Google Docs.

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:12.316
They were working on narrative writing.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:16.316
&gt;&gt;Charlize: So once upon a
time, there was a castle.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.926
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: Who lives in your castle?

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.266
&gt;&gt;Charlize: My tech buddies are nice.

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.976
They're my friends.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:28.406
They teach me how to
do things by myself.

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:33.646
&gt;&gt;Nayeilli: So do you remember
how to capitalize a word?

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:34.816
[ bell rings ]

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:37.026
&gt;&gt;Lauren: The second center was myON.

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.886
MyON is a reading program
on the Chromebook.

00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:45.556
The students were listening to a
nonfiction book about a reptile.

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:49.986
&gt;&gt;Computer: Scientists don't know
exactly how long a sea turtle lives.

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:52.586
&gt;&gt;Lauren: They took notes
at the same time.

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:55.146
So the fifth graders
helped them figure out,

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.036
what is the important part of each page.

00:02:57.306 --> 00:03:00.566
&gt;&gt;Sergio: It helps me
learn because I get

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:04.146
to know what they're struggling
with, so I can help them out.

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:04.213
[ bell rings ]

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:07.576
&gt;&gt;Lauren: And then we
have Google Slides,

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:11.026
and here's where they're making a
presentation using the information they

00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.176
learned from their reptile research.

00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:17.986
&gt;&gt;Heavenly: We're using our facts to
make a Google Slideshow of crocodiles.

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:22.956
&gt;&gt;Jada: I've been teaching how to
insert pictures and change the font.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:24.636
&gt;&gt;Want it bigger?

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:26.886
&gt;&gt;Yes, sixty.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.836
&gt;&gt;So highlight it, and then...

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.866
&gt;&gt;Ah!

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.246
&gt;&gt;Heavenly: It's hard to teach.

00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:35.106
Sometimes they don't listen.

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:37.476
It's hard but it's worth it.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:40.166
&gt;&gt;Francesca: So my role
has minimized a bit,

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:42.506
because our fifth graders are
really doing all the teaching,

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:44.656
and we can just kind of
check in and allow them

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:45.596
to take charge of their lessons.

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:46.326
&gt;&gt;Student: No helping him.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:50.756
&gt;&gt;Francesca: At the end of each session,
we like to ask the students things

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:52.656
that they thought they
could use some work on

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:54.926
and some accomplishments
that they're proud of.

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:56.816
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm done with my story.

00:03:56.816 --> 00:03:57.616
&gt;&gt;Francesca: That's awesome.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:58.526
What about a fifth grader?

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:00.956
Who can tell me something that
went well in your group today?

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:04.086
&gt;&gt;Student: I do it, like first,
and then they do it after me,

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.836
or point to what they have to click on.

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:06.496
&gt;&gt;Francesca: You were modeling.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.516
&gt;&gt;Lauren: Actually showing
them modeling.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:10.136
Give yourself a round of applause.

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:10.236
[ applause ]

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:13.616
&gt;&gt;I think tech buddies has
given me the extra time,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.176
because the fifth graders
give the students the one

00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:19.496
on one attention they need that I
can't provide for them all the time,

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:22.466
and my students are more independent.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.936
&gt;&gt;Francesca: So my fifth graders
definitely have had a boost

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:25.536
in confidence.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.656
Seeing them work with the first graders,

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:30.186
their relationships are
blooming with each other.

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:30.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes!

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.136
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Having that relationship
has done wonders not only

00:04:33.136 --> 00:04:36.326
for the technology integration and
the instruction, but for climate

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:37.366
and culture here at John Barry.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.976
&gt;&gt;Student: We got it.
