00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
being here this afternoon.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.330
And today we're
pleased to welcome

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
Dr. T, a very special
guest from Minneapolis.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.640
Dr. T was born in
Jerusalem, Israel.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.110
He has two doctorate degrees.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.070
One, in Chiropractic, and the
other one, in General Medicine.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.660
Dr. T's specialties is in
health, medicine, nutrition,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.610
and sustainability.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.670
Dr. T had been traveling
extensively, offering

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.660
medical care and studying
nutrition practices

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.680
around the world.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.020
In the West, we are dealing
with all kinds of stress,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.310
mostly related to work.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.410
Even Google, being the best
company to work for in 2014

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.340
according to the "Fortune"
magazine-- we still

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.300
feel the stress,
with a smiley face.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.360
On the other hand,
the people in Nepal,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.950
they have a different
type of stress in life,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.090
and that's what I call
everyday life stress.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.050
And, for example, they have
one of the slowest internet

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.410
services in the world,
and the internet

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.700
was introduced to Nepal in 1994.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.960
And even as of today,
yet their internet speed

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.097
is the second slowest in the
world, just behind Libya.

00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:43.680
And then, the second
problem they have

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.760
is, on average,
most people only get

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.250
about 9 to 12 hours of
electricity per day.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.990
So, you can imagine living in
that type of an environment,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.280
and even before these
challenges in life.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.360
But the people in
Nepal are still

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.510
pretty happy and
extremely friendly.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.990
And you can find, in
their greeting tradition,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.230
for example, they do
not shake hands or hug.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.120
What they would do is
they close their palm,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.840
and then bow their
head, and say Namaste.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.190
So today, we're lucky to have
Dr. T to share his childhood

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.720
experience in
Nepal and then what

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.380
we can learn from these people
about the health and also

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.340
the stress issue.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.890
And then with that, I would
like to welcome Dr. T to Google.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:52.822
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:54.712
I know that you're
here for many reasons.

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:57.170
Some of you are here because
you want to know about stress,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.586
and some are here
because you want

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:00.330
to know about the
Himalayas, and some

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.530
want to know about
the skin, and some

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.160
want to know about vitality.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.650
So, how do we weave all
those things together

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.029
in just a short talk?

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.320
Normally, each one of them
could be a two or three hour

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.660
discussion.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.160
So, we have to be a
little more concise

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.675
and be rapid in
our presentation.

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.130
And we need to realize what's
truly important in life.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.950
What is it makes
people really stressed?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.370
Why are we stressed?

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.470
Because we take on more
than we can handle.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.390
Because we have a
lot of expectations

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.270
that are put upon us or
that we decide to adopt.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.620
Because we want to Excel.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.690
Because we want to
get appreciation.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
Because today people would love
us for what we manufacture,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.380
what we produce.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.120
So, we have to get results.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.970
We are very result
oriented in our society

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.080
and if we don't
perform according

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.040
to expectation, distress.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.110
Even if we have the best food
in the world and the places

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.460
to get suntan, it's not enough.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.510
So, we need to start
thinking about what's

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.070
really important to engage in
and to adopt above and beyond

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.250
the day-to-day routine of taking
more and more responsibilities

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.820
upon ourselves, which is the
main cause for stress in people

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.970
who are productive, and
young, and relatively healthy.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.480
Of course, when you
have stress, you

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.830
have the physiological and
psychological consequence.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.880
Many people have back
problems and insomnia.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.380
Many people have stomach
upset and headaches.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.840
A lot of people have
palpitation anxiety attack.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.280
A lot of young
people that I see are

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.390
suffering from mood disorders.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.290
They simply can't handle the
pressure of the daily life.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.990
And that's not their fault.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.070
It's the fault of
our physiology.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.950
We're not made for that.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.830
We are hardwired, in
our brain, to handle

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.070
quick and severe or
extensive stress, that

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.640
then abates and disappears.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.290
That's what we are
designed to have in nature.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.650
And we all came from
nature, like it or not.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.840
We came from a place where
we had severe risk of death,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.970
instantly, and then 10 minutes
later that risk passes away.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.650
And if we survived
it, we can relax.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.410
Today we don't have
that opportunity.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.570
If the stress lasts too
long and it is too severe,

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.310
the results are extreme.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.380
They've done studies
with mice and they

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.600
saw that when the mice are under
severe stress for too long,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.370
after just several
hours of extreme threat,

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.080
those mice had three
severe anatomical changes.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.800
In volution of the
reticuloendothelial system,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.850
meaning everything shrinks
in the immune system organs.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.040
Like the thymus, shrinks
rapidly and you could see it.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.480
The adrenal glands, which
are associated with stress,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.360
with the output of stress
hormones, starts swelling

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:25.430
and you see it rapidly, visibly,
anatomical growth, hypertrophy,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.940
of the adrenals.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.090
And the last of the visible
signs, is wounds and open sores

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.160
and bleeding ulcers in
the digestive system.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.870
Now this is visible.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.160
Imagine what is not visible.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.540
Imagine all the little
things, the changes,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.220
that happen in the body with our
circulation, with our hormones,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.070
with our neurology.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.250
All those things that happen
that are not visible in mice

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.330
within just a few
hours of severe stress.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.120
And this is what we are
enduring in our society

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.750
because our stress
is interminable.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.470
It continues, unabated.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.980
We don't know when
to shut it down

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.520
because our responsibilities
and the tasks

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.590
we have to engage in on
a daily basis don't end.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.860
On the contrary, we keep adding
on and on and on because we

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.410
want to excel, we want to
get respect and appreciation

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.500
from the jobs, from the
peers, from our friends,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.800
from our family.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.620
Everybody expects
something out of us.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.310
We just don't know where to
let go and how to let go.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.010
So, we go to all of those
methods of stress management

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.420
because we have those symptoms.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.926
We can't sleep at night,
we need stimulants

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:41.550
to stay up during
the day because we're

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.310
so tired when we wake up.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.620
If we wake up from
a night of no sleep

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.540
If you need to drink coffee
or take any stimulants to feel

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.460
that you can go
through the day, you're

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.750
not getting enough sleep
or poor quality of sleep.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.090
And most people today
need stimulants every day,

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.370
whether it's caffeine,
coffee, chocolate,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.130
or other such stimulants.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.750
What are they doing?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.730
They're pressing on the gas
pedal when the tank is empty.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.990
They're forcing us into
the stimulation that

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.560
resembles a stress
response, which tells us

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.560
that we have a
little more energy.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.540
Our blood supply is
slightly richer in glucose,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.200
so we can bring more
energy to the muscles

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.020
for the fight-or-flight
that doesn't exist.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.620
And that is the
stimulant that we always

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.940
take thinking it's good for us
because it makes us feel high,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.080
but it's only necessary
because without it we plummet,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.820
and we get tired, we
crash throughout each day.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.890
Sounds familiar to some
of you, doesn't it?

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.750
That is not where you want
to be because over time all

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.010
of these conditions associated
with the physiological and

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.030
emotional stress are
going to simply make

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.560
you either fat, or tired,
chronically fatigued,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.220
or having chronically suppressed
immune system resulting

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.410
in cancer.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.640
People always go through
these three phases

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.480
of general adaptation syndrome.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.680
The first phase is
just being under stress

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.110
but not knowing it.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.260
The second, is having the
stress and having those symptoms

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.770
of fatigue, and
aches, and pains,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.030
and digestive
complaints, et cetera.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.500
The third phase is when there's
complete systematic break down.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.240
The adrenals are overwhelmed.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.310
They cannot create more of these
hormonal outputs of stress.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.860
At that point,
people either develop

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.970
chronic fatigue syndrome
or fybromyalgia,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.870
they become bedridden,
they totally

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.340
lose their
functionality, or they

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.460
have other severe chronic
condition, or they get cancer.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.550
That's the third phase.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.960
Most people today who are
under significant stress,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.860
are already high
on the second phase

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.610
of this general adaptation
syndrome, also known as GAS,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.210
and they are very dangerously
close to phase three.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.850
I see today a lot of young
people in their '20s and '30s

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.000
who already are coming
into phase three

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.460
and wondering
where it came from.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.080
Not realizing how much of
it is related to the stress

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.870
that they're suffering from.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.900
And this is the stress
that is typically

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.180
in affluent countries.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.680
We are all suffering
from affluenza.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.800
And we really want
to change that.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.690
We want to start moving
towards simplicity.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.240
It's not always easy when we
have everything available right

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.130
in front of us to
just pick and choose.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.630
Sometimes too many choices
is a stressful thing.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.610
You want to just
be told, do this.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.830
You don't want to know
too much information.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.370
Just give me what I need.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.326
But you have too many options.

00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:04.580
That is a stress
because you want

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.460
to live life to the fullest.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.981
You want to
experience everything.

00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:12.210
While people in other countries
don't have that opportunity.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:17.100
People in Nepal are always
having very few options

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.310
to eat, to see.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.550
They never travel much.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.200
They never go on an airplane,
they can't afford it.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.759
So, they stay in one village
in the remote rural Nepal

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.550
and they never get out
of that environment.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.830
Maybe once or twice a year
they would travel all the way

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.540
to Kathmandu, the
capital of Nepal.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.560
And that's about it.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.550
Those people are always
seeing the same trees,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.040
the same houses,
the same mountains.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.690
They wake up and
everything is predictable.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.480
Now you would say-- and you'd
be correct-- is predictability

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.320
always a good thing?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.600
Is nature predictable?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.840
And you'd be right to ask
that because the answer is no.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.420
And I've never said
that their life

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.870
is perfect out there in Nepal.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.945
They have a lot of
their own challenges.

00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:11.300
But their existence appears
to you to be predictable.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.490
In reality, it's not.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.190
They have constant
change in their life.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:20.620
Every day brings numerous,
unpredictable events.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.700
They never know if the food will
be good, if there will be food.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.550
They never know
who they're going

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.420
to meet coming to
visit their village.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.210
They have a lot of changes
in their environment.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.990
Not just with the seasons,
but with survival.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.850
Every time they walk on the
trail, something happens.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.490
They might have to
confront a mule or a cow

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.010
or water Buffalo that might
push them off the trail.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:51.640
Or they may just have a
landslide that will take down

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.930
a whole village and they
would have to somehow make do.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.170
They're always on the survival
mode without even knowing it.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.330
But it's a different
type of survival mode.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.250
It's the kind that brings
change continuously,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:11.940
where change is expected where
the unpredictable is expected.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.960
Therefore, it is
not so stressful

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.780
when you see new things.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.370
Let's contrast
that with Americans

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.274
who are accustomed
to their routine.

00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:21.940
Every day they have
to get in their car,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.800
drive, go from 9:00
to 5:00, drive back,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.280
stop on the way in the coffee
shop, go to get some bagels.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.070
Those people are doing exactly
the same thing every day.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.650
They are creatures of habit.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.700
But as soon as something
happens that is different,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.910
they can't handle the stress.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.460
They go berserk.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.060
So, they need to drink
alcohol or take some pot.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.370
Drink, smoke some pot
to feel more relaxed

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.310
because they can't
handle change.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.440
In nature, we have
to handle change

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.770
because from every bush might
be an animal jumping out

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.220
at us-- under every tree.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.560
Or every time we have to run
away we have to be prepared,

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.080
have to be alert, all the time.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.730
When you get used to
that constant change,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.370
you stop being stressed.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.030
So, this is one thing
I like to teach people,

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.310
to keep making your life varied.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.080
Increase variety,
complexity, in your life.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.930
Allow things not to be simple,
while you live a simpler

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.590
lifestyle.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.860
Sounds like a contradiction,
but it's the truth.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.150
Simplify your life in what
you take on, but increase

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.640
the variety so that
you are accustomed

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.890
to the unpredictable.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.390
Go outdoors into nature.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.200
Many people will tell
you that to reduce stress

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.790
you have to either
meditate, or do mindfulness,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:15:01.110
or hypnotherapy, or guided
imagery, or Tai Chi.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.880
There are so many
techniques that

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.210
are being told to you that are
great to manage your stress.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.780
They don't treat the
underlying cause of stress,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.630
but they help you manage it.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:18.770
And they're good, but one thing
on the list is go to nature.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.170
Learn from nature.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.000
Your body,
physiologically, is adapted

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.310
through tens of thousands of
years and hundreds of thousands

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.430
of years to the natural
environment from which we came.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.360
Eat according to
nature because any time

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.790
you have a slight
disorder, anytime you

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.750
have a slight
nutritional deficiency,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:43.185
anytime you're exposed
to toxins, all of those

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:48.150
are related to our departure
from what's natural.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.010
We need to try to correct that.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.510
And in nature we
have extreme variety

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.130
of foods that are
made by nature that we

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.620
would have had in nature in
their natural pristine state.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.510
Today, how much of a
variety do we have in food?

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.980
You could go to all
of Google cafeterias,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.600
you would still not have more
than 50 foods covering just

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.620
about the whole gamut.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.010
50 vegetables, and spices,
and grains, and legumes,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.970
and few other things
Not that much.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.870
But if you go
foraging in nature,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.320
as our predecessors did--
our ancestors foraged

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.170
all the time before
agricultural age--

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.660
you would have unlimited
number of foods

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.310
to choose from all the time.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.600
And you would have
the unpredictability

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.870
of what would be
available, which keeps you

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.310
on your toes in a healthy way.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.590
It keeps you excited about life.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.300
So, please bring variety
into your life and please

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.330
go to nature to learn
from her, and not

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.120
just to use her as a
shelter from stress.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.170
And if you do go
into nature, then you

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.600
start learning other
things because you

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.270
will see the different animals
and people that co-inhabit

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.069
that natural environment,
and you see what they do

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.829
and what they don't do.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.900
That is true for learning
from other people.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.880
What do they do?

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.550
What do they not do?

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.310
And what makes them
healthier than us,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.829
is always an important question.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:28.375
You know that 79 million
Americans have pre-diabetes.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.750
That's a huge number.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.840
You know that hundreds
of thousands of children

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.910
are being diagnosed,
before age 10, with cancer.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.620
Pediatric cancer is
a fast growing trend

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.500
and most hospitals are
building special wings

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.330
for childhood cancer.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.370
And we have one out of three
or four children on drugs

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.570
or diagnosed with a disease.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.710
And almost all
the children today

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.400
have some allergies, or
asthma, autoimmune disease,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.940
or immune suppression condition
that will never [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.440
of children.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.680
So, many children are
diagnosed with learning

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.320
disorders, and autism,
and other conditions that

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.900
didn't used to be so popular.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.000
Once, it was 1 in
10,000 children--

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.200
not too long ago, a
few decades-- and now

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.990
1 out of 49 children are
diagnosed as having autism.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.346
What's happening to
the next generation?

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.970
Many of you are going
to have children,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.960
if you don't have them already.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.040
What's happening to our children
that makes them suddenly

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.740
the sickest children
have ever been?

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.650
Shouldn't we learn
something about what

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.570
is happening in other countries
to compare and contrast and see

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.690
what we can learn to save a
whole generation of children

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.470
in this country?

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.210
How do we do that?

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.800
How do we learn about the
health of our children

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.220
when they're all exposed
to the same factors,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.990
such as we don't
have a control group.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.250
If we want to do a
scientific study.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.580
We can't.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.710
We have to go somewhere else
where the children have not

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.559
been exposed to what children
here have been exposed to.

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.100
There have been
studies with children

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.600
who have moved from
one country to another,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.810
and they saw
clearly, the children

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.280
who moved to an
affluent Western nation

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.330
to a more primitive,
more developing nation,

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:43.150
the earlier they move to
the newer place, the newer

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.090
residence, the more they
adopted the same diseases

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.520
and disorders, including
mental diseases,

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.800
of the new adoptive country
that they've joined.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.610
That is a very
important observation.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.180
So, if a child comes to the
United States from Ethiopia

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.840
when he or she is
only 6 years old,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.380
they're going to be a lot
healthier than the local kids

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.720
because they had 6 years
in a primitive environment.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.270
But if they come here at age
2 or age 1, or worse yet,

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.720
at age 6 months, they develop
all the medical, and mental,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.820
and behavioral conditions
that are typically

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.910
in the modern country
that they've joined.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.310
Shouldn't we try to ask
ourselves the question,

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.670
why is that the case.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.530
What are we doing to children
that makes them so sick?

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.310
How do we study that
when in our country

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.761
all the children are
exposed to the same things?

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:49.760
So, if we asked ourselves,
is it because they're

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.490
exposed to too many
electromagnetic radiation

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.930
sources?

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.230
Is because they had
too many vaccines?

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.370
Is it because they eat
genetically modified organisms?

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.270
Is it because of something else?

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.830
Too much stress, perhaps?

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.220
They know when they are 2
years old that one day they

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.725
will work in Google.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:12.030
They already are stressed out.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.000
Who knows.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.570
We don't have the answers.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.300
But the only way to find out is
to start asking the questions

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.820
and doing some studies.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.060
For that we need
a control group.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.150
It just so happens that you
can create a control group

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.510
in a place that is far away
from the United States.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.780
A place that is so
pristine, and so primitive,

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.980
so underdeveloped, that
most of the young children

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.580
have not been exposed to
what our children have

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.150
been exposed to.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.260
If we can have a good
number of children

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:55.170
that we could study how
healthy they really are,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.460
how lacking they are in mental
and behavioral disorders when

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.410
they go to school, how easy it
is to teach them, how excited

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.500
they are to go to school.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.900
And they are
beautifully behaved.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.000
They always are excited to
study, to learn new things.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.190
When you see those children
and you fall in love with them,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.940
you think, what a
great thing we can

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.690
do to impart some of their
health to other people

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.040
in developing countries
who are suffering

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.530
from all those modern diseases
of children that have never

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:32.310
been a part of our life until
just the last few decades.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.290
Instead of just
worrying about it

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.320
and getting more
and more hospitals

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.640
to build more and
more cancer wings,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.000
shouldn't we find the
causes and treat them

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.510
or avoid them or prevent them.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.730
Preventive medicine
is not so heroic.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.140
It's exactly the
same as preventing

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.870
suffering in children in
Nepal because while we create

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.660
the control group of
thousands and thousands

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.260
of children that can show
us the way, can guide us

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.560
into the light of health and
vitality, at the same time,

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.900
we can help them avoid the
horrific tragedy of childhood

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.140
trafficking.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.230
15,000 children,
in Nepal alone, are

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.500
used in trafficking,
prostitution,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.930
slavery every year, even now.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.980
15,000 for a small country.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.390
That's a huge tragedy.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.630
Some of them are ending up as
domestic workers and slaves.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.620
But most of them
end up in India,

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.680
where they're sold for
prostitution or slavery

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.630
and it's because their
environment is so poor, so

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.840
destitute, that they have
no capability of organizing.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.030
Their communities
are fragmented.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.830
Their families have
fallen apart, not just

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.450
because of a 10
year civil war that

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.930
left the country in
a desperate state,

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.300
but also because there
are no opportunities

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.340
in the rural areas of Nepal.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.290
No socioeconomic
opportunity, no health

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.660
care available, no
educational opportunities,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.430
so the children end up in
the fields all the time

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.470
and they are simple
and easy to pick.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.100
And their parents are
totally illiterate,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.060
so it's easy to come to
a parent and say we're

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.180
going to take your
child and give her

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.330
a great education in India and
put her in some boarding school

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.750
where she will learn
English and learn a vocation

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.630
and have a great
successful life.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.880
If you are a parent that can't
offer anything to your child,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.370
you'd fall for that.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.490
And that child ends up
trafficked and suffering

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.150
horribly for the
rest of her life.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:59.210
That can be easily prevented
with very little money

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.710
because prevention is
1,000 to 10,000 times more

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.860
effective than heroic
salvation after the fact.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.890
So, instead of the expensive
emergency room medicine,

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:16.050
we're engaging in lifestyle,
nutritional, stress reduction

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.540
type of medicine, which
prevents the disease

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.460
at a tiny, tiny
fraction of the cost.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.150
As I said, it's not heroic,
it's not so attractive and sexy,

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.052
because you can't
pinpoint those children

00:25:30.052 --> 00:25:31.510
that you've saved
from trafficking.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.970
But you make a real
impact, especially

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.130
if you go through
those societies,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.210
in those remote areas,
and you help them organize

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.290
and then you make
them participate,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.390
so it is more sustainable.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.820
And you help rebuild
their communities

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.910
and build for them a
community center that

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.980
could take care of their
health and hygiene.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.070
And start doing adult
literacy program

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.810
that teach the
parents some skills

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.310
and how to read and write.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.510
And organize the women
in mother's groups

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.100
because the mother is really the
beginning and end of the family

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.440
caretaker, the educator.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.560
Take care of those
in a sustainable way

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.920
and you don't need much money.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:22.030
For only 8 and 1/2
dollars a month per child,

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:26.620
I can, by myself,
sustain 5,000 children

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.770
with Everest Learning
Academy-- which I really

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.070
want to applaud Google
because Google now

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.410
has its own matching program,
so people could contribute money

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.680
to the Ecopolitan
Eco-Health Community, which

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.900
supports the Everest Academy.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.320
And I have some great news--
you're the first group

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.160
to hear about it-- that
we are now, finally,

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.700
recognized by the Nepali
Social Welfare Council

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:57.990
as an international NGO,
similar to the Peace Corps.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.990
And we are just a few
people, not a government.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.040
So, I invite you
to start thinking

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.770
about things bigger
than yourself.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.800
That might be the thinking
person's stress relief.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.110
Start thinking about what you
can do to make life better

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.680
on earth, not just for
yourself, but for others.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.480
When you do that,
suddenly the stress

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.590
will melt way because
now you have a vision

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.880
and you have a purpose.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.530
Think about it.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.400
They've done studies with
people who are stressed,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.720
and they said, yes,
stress will kill you.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.330
But for some reason, some people
have the highest stress level

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.590
and they live the longest.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.910
Studies have shown that.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.320
It's a Paradox.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.840
So, you have to start
looking, who are those people

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.760
because we want to
be like them, right?

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.970
And we find out that those
who live the longest,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.510
despite severe stress,
are the ones who

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.900
are in charge of
their own destiny.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.940
The ones who are not pushed
to a nine to five job,

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.420
but feel like they
create their own reality.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.014
They manifest their own
dreams, visions, and missions.

00:28:15.014 --> 00:28:17.180
Does it mean that the only
people who are the bosses

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.170
can live long?

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.960
Not necessarily.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.810
Even people who
work a 9 to 5 job

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.360
can create a purpose
for themselves.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.630
Can become the heroes
of their community

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.830
and of remote countries.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:37.860
Can venture into new lands
where they can do some good.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.140
And while doing that,
they think every day,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.390
what am I doing today
that meets or gets me

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.160
a step closer to that purpose?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.290
How do I make earth
a better place

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.150
from me, and for my children,
and for my friends' children

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.630
and great grandchildren?

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.660
How do we make this
a better place?

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.890
If you take a purpose to your
heart and start implementing,

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.930
on a daily basis,
whatever it is,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.680
it will simply
overshadow the stress

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.150
of trying to simply preserve
your own ego in a society that

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.740
expects so much of you.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.290
Where your responsibility
that you adopt

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.070
are so numerous just
because you need

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.450
to have affirmation
and acceptance

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.540
from your peers and
your family members.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.070
Do something that's outside
of yourself and people

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.700
will leave you alone and they
will not expect much of you

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.060
because you'll be
doing something good.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.610
Not just for yourself, not
just for your own pocket.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:44.310
People who just work for
money have a lot of stress

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.300
because they always worry,
will they have enough money

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.240
to meet their next
consumerism goal.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.810
What are they going to buy
next that they won't to use.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.420
That will rot in their
garage-- three car

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:03.370
garage, which has
four cars in it.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.700
What are those
people going to do?

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.920
Nothing.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.310
They just have to keep
showing off to other people

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.970
how much they have.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.420
So, instead you have
various options.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.540
You can contribute to
worthwhile causes--

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.146
we're going to match you.

00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:22.610
You work here-- or you
could decide to join.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.240
You can start getting
into the activism mode.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.680
We already have 5,000
children in our network

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.290
of 65 projects of schools,
and childcare centers,

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.820
and orphanages, and
community care centers

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.450
and we're growing rapidly.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:42.680
We need somebody to be
creative and think and help

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.370
us create a technological system
that will allow us to collect

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.040
all the data we need to
collect about the health of all

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.890
the children in our network.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.800
My goal is to get
to 100,000 children.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:01.490
If you participate, as creative
individuals, and help us

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.110
find a system, a
method, that allows

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:08.150
us to collect all the
information that we need

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:15.120
to truly tabulate the mental,
emotional, social, and physical

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.090
health of our thousands
and thousands of children.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:24.270
That would help us take better
care of our children in Nepal,

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.600
but it will also help
us create the data

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.290
that will allow us to start
implementing some changes that

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.030
are necessary so that the
hospitals will stop building

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.620
those cancer wings for children,
so that the pediatrician will

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.030
not have to treat so
many children with drugs,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.240
so the children will not
be diagnosed with autism

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.400
and have to take various
drugs for ADD and ADHD.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.900
That's not necessary.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.760
We just need to
understand why is it

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.610
that 100,000
children-- God willing,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:03.230
if we get 200,000 children
with the support of populations

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:08.110
that care, that have
the ability to care,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.860
then we can really
help the whole world

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.080
because the modern
civilization is

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.220
where we have more problems
than we have over there.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.870
As soon as they're
organized, as soon

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.710
they can take care
of themselves,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.570
as soon as they have schools and
child care centers so that they

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.560
can get to work, as soon as
they learn to read and write.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.070
We give them the
opportunity to acquire

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.330
a skill that will make
their life in rural Nepal

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.600
a lot better, a lot easier.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.170
We can preserve their
culture, their ethnicity.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.230
And you're welcome to visit.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.200
You can come and check with us.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.290
In March, we have some
people from Google

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.120
coming to represent Google.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.080
And we will have other
people coming in October.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.760
We do it twice a year.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.112
You can come and join our
treks and see for yourself

00:32:55.112 --> 00:32:56.320
what we do with the children.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.000
You can volunteer or you could
just do it from your own home.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920
Help us create a system.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.600
Let's design something
that allows technology

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.710
to collect the
information we need

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.235
to make this earth
a better place.

00:33:11.235 --> 00:33:16.170
And In the meantime, we just
need to support it financially.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.770
Financially we do the support
through the skin clinics,

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.270
which is something that I
created many, many years ago.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.970
A way to eliminate and
prevent skin cancer, which

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.640
is the most common
cancer there is.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.670
It is so easy to
prevent melanomas,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.980
which kills tens of thousands
of Americans every year.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.460
So easy, you just have to
eliminate the lesions that

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.940
might become cancer five years
from now or 10 years from now.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.790
It's true prevention.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:53.650
If you have 100 lesions on your
body-- little dark spots, flat,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:57.520
where the sun won't
shine-- be aware.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.340
Melanoma, the lethal skin
cancer everybody is afraid of,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.870
always always
develops in the places

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.590
that have not been
exposed to the sun.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.590
Surprising.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.205
But it's not surprising,
we've known it for many years.

00:34:13.205 --> 00:34:16.440
The information you're
getting from the establishment

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.130
is not accurate.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.210
You have to open the
textbook yourself

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.590
and find out where
those melanomas occur.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.370
And you'll be
surprised that they

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.380
occur on the scalp
under the hair,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.510
behind your neck where
there's no sun exposure,

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:33.570
on your torso, and your
armpits, under your bikini line,

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.659
in the white spots that
have never seen the sun.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.679
You better start
mooning the sun,

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:45.400
so the sun will shine where
it normally doesn't shine.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.679
Get some sun exposure
in the various places,

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.420
but you have to do it regularly.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.320
Because if you don't,
those white areas

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.840
that are irregularly exposed
once every six months,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.170
that's where you will
develop your melanomas

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.160
and they start from little dark
spots that can gradually grow.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.670
Catch all of those dark spots.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.970
Eliminate them now.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.255
It's so easy.

00:35:09.255 --> 00:35:11.200
No surgery necessary.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.490
No medical treatment necessary.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:17.630
You can get rid of a hundred
of them in just one sitting.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.370
And by doing that--
with any of the doctors

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:24.090
that I have trained, in
various places in the world,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:29.520
to do this using my method--
by removing those skin lesions,

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.520
you prevent yourself from
developing skin cancer.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.920
Also, the carcinomas
are very easy to treat--

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.720
that's a different
type of skin cancer.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.210
Very easy to work with
those type of skin lesion

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:43.160
and catch them early.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.440
Very good to remove
protrusions and growths,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.610
which could develop as a
result of hormonal imbalance

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.620
or the result of
unhealthy nutrition.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.410
And remember, if you get sick
because of unhealthy nutrition

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.220
or lack of sleep or
other types of exposures

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.450
or toxic exposures, the stress
that you have in your life

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.130
becomes far worse.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.750
It's makes every
disease magnified.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.310
So, you do want to eat really
well according to nature.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.850
If you want to know
what I mean by nature,

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.515
go to the website
thetruthaboutyourfood.com

00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:25.850
where I give 12 hours
of free information.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.580
12 hours of lectures
that you get

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.310
for free--
thetruthaboutyourfood.com.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:34.010
Then, you'll learn about healthy
nutrition according to nature

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.280
and according to science.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.290
You do that, you
reduce your skin aging.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.730
You make sure that you have
all the nutrients necessary,

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.640
like sulfur, which is a crucial
nutrient for the skin health

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.250
and for your hair health.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.660
When you have not sufficient
sulfur in your body,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.040
your hair starts falling and
becomes fragile and brittle.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.930
And your skin starts
aging because it

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.430
loses its cytoskeletal
structure, that's

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:09.600
supported and makes
it plump and gives it

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.800
a body-- just like
when you were born

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.870
and had a plump face and
plump skin everywhere.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:21.250
You want to retain that,
you have to eat really

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.920
food rich, rich,
rich, in antioxidants.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.740
Every meal should be
rich in antioxidants

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.420
because today you're
exposed to so many toxins

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.350
that they increase the
[INAUDIBLE] damage.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.110
It's not just the sun
that we blame on aging.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.630
The sun is one source of
[INAUDIBLE] in our skin,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.260
but our diet is
another big source.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.840
Whenever you eat
rancid fats, you

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.290
damage your subcutaneous
fat under the skin,

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:52.100
and your skin ages prematurely.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.470
If you want to remove
protrusion and growths

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.290
that occur as a
result of your diet

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.870
or if you want to improve
the hormonal balance,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.280
so that you don't develop
tons and tons of skin tags

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.750
on your neck and
under your breast

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:11.390
and on your face, which you see
a lot of people suffering from.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:17.530
And if you don't want to have a
rough spots and dark areas that

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.220
are caused by excessive
free radicals,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.850
you have to make changes.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.900
And then your body will be able
to handle stress a lot more.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.320
You can take some
adaptogenic herbs,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.720
which also help you handle
stress more effectively.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.400
But again, they're
not addressing

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.260
the underlying problem.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.470
So, I truly recommend
to go back to nature,

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.510
to learn from nature,
to come to the Himalayas

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.240
to see what we're
doing out there,

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.780
and get your stress level
down just by being in nature

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.580
and by adapting a
purposeful life.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.110
That would make
your skin healthier,

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:03.340
your skin lesions less likely
to appear, you can easily

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.616
remove them and reduce the
stress of bad image problem

00:39:06.616 --> 00:39:07.990
when you look in
the mirror, when

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.240
you have those huge
things on your nose.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.430
They can easily be removed.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.510
Don't tell me that you were born
with it; therefore, it's OK.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.010
Because if you're
born with it, it's

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:18.635
been on you for a
longer amount of time

00:39:18.635 --> 00:39:20.550
and it's been exposed
more to the elements.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.730
It's even more risk.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.760
And if it's caused by the
neurological imbalance that

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.600
makes some of those
protrusion occur,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.850
you can improve your
neurological state

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.140
by removing them.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.880
Improving the
balance of your body.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.840
Your symmetry of
information that comes,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.770
sensory information that
comes into your brain.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.910
There are many reasons to
improve the skin appearance.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.390
Not just your image.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.440
Your skin is the
mirror off your health.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.200
The integrity of this barrier
between the inside of our body

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.990
and the environment
outside of us.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:57.470
That integrity is
crucial and it tells us

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.280
a lot about the integrity
of your entire body, which

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.140
is made of barriers.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.780
The blood brain barrier,
the digestive barrier,

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.860
the cellular membrane,
as a barrier.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:12.080
All of those barriers must be
healthy for you to be alive.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.080
And of course, they have
to be healthy in order

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.880
for you to be healthy.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.900
If the, skin as a barrier,
has lost its integrity,

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.970
also other barriers, which share
the same type of nutrition,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.800
are going to lose
their integrity,

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.710
and you lose your health
on so many levels.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:37.840
Keep your integrity of the
barriers, of your life,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.320
of the purpose, of the
participation in making

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.630
this world, this earth,
a better place, and then,

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.570
your stress level will
go down because you

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.520
will learn what's really
important in life.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.960
And you will truly stop
sweating the small stuff

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.210
that makes you worried
and stressed all the time.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.120
You can do your work and
be happy with the results

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.870
because you know that
ultimately there's

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.350
something greater,
something bigger,

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:13.580
that you participate in to
leave a much better world

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.220
for future generation so that
the legacy that each one of you

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:23.330
has is a legacy worth having for
prosperity for many generations

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:24.687
into the future.

00:41:24.687 --> 00:41:25.520
Thank you very much.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:34.249
AUDIENCE: Are you working
with other organizations

00:41:34.249 --> 00:41:36.040
like Soroptimist
International and the U.N.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.200
with the children's issue?

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.160
And, if so, what companies?

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.770
Soroptimist has been around
since the 1920s, was founded

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.920
in Oakland by women that
weren't allowed into rotary.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.480
And trafficking
of women and girls

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.854
has always been
something they've

00:41:48.854 --> 00:41:51.760
worked on both internationally,
nationally, and locally.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.010
They help women and children.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:58.190
DR. TEL-OREN: At the
moment we are fairly young.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.550
We've only been around
for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:06.440
And it's been so far
sort of a one man show.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.360
And I have no time,
really, to get involved

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.630
with other organizations but
I wish I did have that time.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.290
And I need more
people to help me

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.890
make the connection
because I'm limited.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:22.760
I'm just one person who's seeing
patients nonstop and giving

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.280
lectures 250 times a year
in several continents.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.470
I travel all the time, and
educate, and teach, and treat

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:37.440
and write, and travel,
and guide treks in Nepal.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.230
I just don't have the
time, or the capability,

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:48.120
or the knowledge to do this this
administrative, important work,

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.210
that is connecting with
other organizations that

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:50.613
are pre-existing.

00:42:50.613 --> 00:42:52.655
AUDIENCE: Well, I'd be happy
to connect you [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:52.655 --> 00:42:53.655
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.

00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:55.792
Any help is always
welcome, as long

00:42:55.792 --> 00:42:58.830
as it doesn't add more
stuff on my table.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:01.190
So, whoever wants
to help, please

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.210
help in a meaningful way
that can make things really

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.830
change for the better.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:07.520
We have to activate
as many people

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.820
as we can to make this work.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.420
We have a wonderful
staff in Nepal

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.370
that made it possible to grow
to 5,000 children in just 3

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.610
and 1/2 years.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.970
It's just unbelievable.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.410
It's above and beyond
my wildest imagination.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:24.220
I had no idea that we
would become, suddenly,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.160
an INGO, international
NGO, in Nepal.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.670
We can have our own office
of the Ecopolitan community

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.850
from the United States.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.010
We can have a full-time
office now in Nepal,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:40.530
which we're going to
dedicate this March of 2014

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:44.640
because of this new honor that
has been bestowed upon us.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.390
So, we are humbled by that, but
with a lot of responsibility.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.330
We always want to
be sustainable.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.890
We don't want to pluck
daughters, or girls,

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.860
or children from their
society and isolate them just

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.840
to save them.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.080
We want to save the whole
community by organizing it

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.170
sustainably, so that all
the girls in the community

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.380
will not be trafficked.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.490
Instead of just save 20 or
30, put them in the house,

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.730
and they will never go
back to their home society

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.624
because they have
been isolated from it

00:44:14.624 --> 00:44:16.540
and they don't think
it's appropriate for them

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.210
to go back to the village.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.400
And then, other girls in the
village who are less fortunate

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.970
end up trafficked instead.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.560
Some organizations do that.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.280
They have great
intention, but we

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.190
are trying to change society
by organizing the communities

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.350
with their own
participation, so they

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.660
can take pride in
what they're doing.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.210
And we need help in that
direction, as much as we can.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.580
What we mostly need
right now is money.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.710
AUDIENCE: I have two
part question, actually.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.990
Number one, is about the
trek that you mentioned

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:51.380
that happens in March and
October-- or November,

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:51.940
I'm not sure.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.160
I want to learn a little
bit more about that.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.530
And the second question
is, being born and raised

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:01.760
in Kathmandu, I would just like
to learn a little bit about how

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.510
you view the stress level,
the health quality, and just

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.210
quality of life.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.000
Meaning, people that are living
in rural Nepal versus somebody

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.083
that's living in the city.

00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:12.720
DR. TEL-OREN: Excellent
question and I often

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.090
lecture about it when
I have more time.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.420
Differentiating what
happens to the children

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.980
who migrate to the city.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.950
And it's usually
the young people

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.160
who are looking for
some opportunity who

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.440
go to Kathmandu where all
the tourists are so there's

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.750
a little more money,
there's more action,

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.950
there are more hospitals, and
more educational facilities

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.080
that provide
greater opportunity.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.270
Unfortunately, when
they go to the city,

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.270
they also lose their culture.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.260
Many times the ethnicities,
the beautiful Nepali culture,

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.690
gets dissolved into the
foreigners, and the pollution,

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.670
and the population overload
that occurs in the city.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.470
And also, their health
starts deteriorating.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.240
They start eating more
like the Westerners.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.220
They want to emulate the
Westerners if they can.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:06.170
So, they start eating a lot
higher on the food chain.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.920
They start eating a lot less
plants and a lot more animals,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.790
which they could never
afford in rural Nepal.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:15.610
They start having
some of the symptoms

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.790
that I see with Americans.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.200
A little more belly, a little
more diabetes, little more

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.100
skin disorders, they
start losing their hair.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.190
I never see bald people who
are truly in rural Nepal,

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:32.220
but in the city I see
a lot of bald people.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.380
All kinds of changes
happen when they

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.230
increase too much their
level of protein intake,

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.470
especially from animals sources.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.720
And I'm not telling people
that they have to be vegan.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.190
Nepalis are never vegan.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.450
Even if they live
in rural Nepal,

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.470
they eat animals once in awhile.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.380
But very rarely
can they afford it.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.970
They reserve it for special
celebrations, special holidays.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.900
Tihar, Dashain, and
other special festivals.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.170
That's when they do that.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.870
But as soon as they go to the
city and they can afford it,

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.080
they start partaking
of the cheap flesh that

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.900
comes from factory
farming of the animals.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.909
And that could never
be healthy for them.

00:47:15.909 --> 00:47:17.700
And we see the differences
in their health,

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.408
and in their mindset,
and their attitude.

00:47:19.408 --> 00:47:22.390
I did some studies
with vitamin D level,

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.640
and even though Kathmandu
is still the city

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.140
and its polluted
and populated, I've

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:32.420
seen the highest level of
vitamin D in Nepal much higher

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.840
than anything I've seen in the
United States even in Florida.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.870
And in Israel, the sunny country
of Israel, where 99% of people

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.190
are vitamin D deficient,
but in Nepal they

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.300
had a much higher,
healthier level of vitamin D

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:51.250
even though they use
umbrellas and there are foggy

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:55.180
times during the monsoon
season, and pollution,

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.035
and they don't like the sun
because they want to be whiter.

00:47:58.035 --> 00:48:00.840
They're afraid of
becoming darker.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.176
They want to be more
like the foreigners.

00:48:04.176 --> 00:48:06.300
As a result, they don't
have that much sun exposure

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.480
but yet they still
have much higher level

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.010
of vitamin D, which
again is something

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.700
that could be interesting
for us to study.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.150
Why is that?

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.380
Why are they healthier
on that level?

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.260
Because vitamin D protects
you from 25 types of cancer,

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.140
and diabetes, and obesity,
cardiovascular disease.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.870
And people here are deficient.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.880
And people here take
supplements and they still

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.832
have lower level
of vitamin D, then

00:48:30.832 --> 00:48:33.040
Nepalis who don't even know
that there's such a thing

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.250
called vitamin D. And
they would definitely

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.501
never take supplements because
they can't afford them.

00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:39.083
And they don't even
know what the test

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.740
is because they can't
afford the test.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.590
So, I had to send their
blood from Kathmandu to India

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.190
to test their
vitamin D 11 level.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.740
It doesn't exist it Nepal.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.630
And they all have
vitamin D level far,

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:55.070
far higher than Americans do
in the southernmost states

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.810
of the United States.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.400
So, this is another thing
that needs to be questioned.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.860
We need to really do
some good study using

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.080
this amazing population
of kind-hearted people

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.060
who want to always
give you everything

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:13.140
they have to give with a smile,
no matter how little they have.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.490
You could study
so much from them.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.580
We inspire them just because
we could travel to visit.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.370
But they can inspire us on
so many other levels that

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.000
help us open our
heart and our mind

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.520
to truly learn about
our world and be

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.400
happy with little consumerism,
with little materialism,

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.596
and learn to really enjoy
what is meaningful in life.

00:49:40.596 --> 00:49:42.594
So, thank you for that question.

00:49:42.594 --> 00:49:43.260
Did I answer it?

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.248
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:46.248 --> 00:49:47.850
DR. TEL-OREN: The trip.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:49.220
It's very simple.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:56.270
You go on nepali-children.org
or on trek4humanity.com.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.080
One of those two.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.820
And you read about it
and you send an email

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.220
and then you get information
about how to join the treks.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.770
It's a 15 day trip, during
which you learn about Nepal--

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.450
not you, of course, because
you know so much about it.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.880
But most people can
learn about Nepal

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.260
as if they were
there for four months

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:25.580
because during those 15 days,
I guide you incessantly.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.440
You'll get tired of my accent.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:32.030
You'll say, shut up already,
we learned enough for one

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.250
day about Nepal.

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.160
You will learn about
health, about nutrition,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.540
about sustainability,
about socioeconomic issues,

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.010
about humanitarian
work, and you will also

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:47.500
learn a lot about
Nepal that you can't

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.510
learn in any regular trip
that is on the beaten path.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.920
We go to places where
tourists never go .

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.630
We go to communities
that are never visited.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.900
We go to areas in the
countryside in the Himalayas

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:03.350
that have amazing views and you
will never see another tourist.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.330
Plus, we visit,
during those 15 days,

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:09.640
a lot of the communities that
the Ecopolitan communities

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.779
service through the
Everest Learning Academy.

00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:13.820
You will meet the people.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.640
We also go to Chitwan
National Park.

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.630
Come Some elephant ride in the
forest and see some animals

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:24.740
and get into a nice little
resort and go into some temple,

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.910
so you can learn
about the culture

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.280
and you learn about the people.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.380
We also do our Touching
the Untouchable program.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.460
That I started two
years ago to help

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:41.810
break the ancient caste
system and the prejudice

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.350
of the caste system.

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:46.060
Even though the government
of Nepal has abolished it,

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.050
in the rural part of the country
they still practice the caste

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.720
system, to some extent .

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.980
And we try to break
through that by blending

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.300
the different castes
together with the tourists,

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:00.630
with the groups, in a very
beautiful ceremony that allows

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:04.465
us to share with them
foods and drink and touch

00:52:04.465 --> 00:52:08.030
them, and massage
them, and hug them.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.970
And it shocks them because
they're the untouchables.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:18.020
And they are so unexpecting
when that happens.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.740
It's just an amazing
thing to see.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.170
Every time we take
new groups so it's

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.830
a fresh new experience
with the Touching

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:26.770
the Untouchable program,
which I really hope

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.210
will end this caste
prejudice forever

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:33.130
in practice, as well as in law.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:35.840
People who are interested
in joining the trek

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.180
can be sponsored by other
people on the website

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.120
trek4humanity.com
there is this option.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.520
Just like people do the
walkathon, the MS-a-thon,

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.860
and so on, you could come
there and you're coming

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.570
is by itself
supporting the effort

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.680
because most of
the money actually

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.400
goes towards the activities of
the Everest Learning Academy.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.267
And so, people can support
you, can sponsor you.

00:53:04.267 --> 00:53:06.600
As many friends as you have
can sponsor you with as much

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.330
as they want, and that
allows you to come and also

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:14.370
to contribute more to Nepal and
also have the matching program

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:15.190
work with that.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.210
So, it's a win-win-win
for everybody

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.280
and I really want
to thank Google

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.820
for being on that
matching program list.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:27.880
I have to say that also Apple,
and Microsoft, and Oracle,

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.840
and Boeing Corporation are
all on our matching program

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.050
for the Ecopolitan
Eco-Health Community.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.900
But Google has a great
program and we truly, truly

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.424
thank Google for having that.

00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:41.340
MALE SPEAKER: For the
benefit of the audience,

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.089
I think that it will
be great to introduce

00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:46.410
about the Himalayan,
high sulfur, black salts

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:47.160
that you bring in.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.170
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank
you, I forgot about it.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.490
I did mention the sulfur
earlier and how important

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.860
it is for the skin
health, but I forgot

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.390
to continue on that
idea, which is really

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.340
the sulfur-rich, black
salt from the Himalayas.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.760
It's made in Nepal
in a factory that I

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.420
built in Kathmandu
that, basically,

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.950
has all of it's
profits supporting

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.860
the children and the activities
of the Everest Learning

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.900
Academy.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.550
So, when you eat this
sulfur-rich salt,

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.716
which tastes like
eggs, by the way.

00:54:19.716 --> 00:54:21.840
So you add it to a vegetable
and suddenly it tastes

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.520
like an egg salad.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.630
You add it to a sandwich, it
tastes like an egg sandwich.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:31.050
You add it to an avocado and
you want to melt from pleasure.

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.050
You can add it to anything.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:36.010
It's kind of addictive
because it's so tasty,

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.940
but the sulfur is
extremely healthy

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.460
because it supports your
detoxification process,

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.720
called sulfation, and supports
the structure of your skin

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.280
and your hair, and nails, and
all of those structural organs

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.620
from ligaments,
tendons, to cartilage.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:52.310
They all require sulfur.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:55.270
So, this salt comes from
a very clean environment.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:59.210
It is exactly nothing
more, nothing less,

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:02.480
than the pulverized
black crystals

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.340
of this special salt that
comes from the Himalayas.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.630
And that's another way
to support our children

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.220
while supporting
your own health.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.880
That's all it does.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.852
Support the children
and your health.

00:55:16.852 --> 00:55:19.220
MALE SPEAKER: You're
welcome to stay around.

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.070
Dr. T will be happy to
answer questions if you have.

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:26.080
And now let's give
applause to Dr. T.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.230
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.
