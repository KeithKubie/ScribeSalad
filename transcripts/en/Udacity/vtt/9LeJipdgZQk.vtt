00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.070
So yes, one way to create the index

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.490
configuration file is to actually manually edit it.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.119
And another way to get the indexes correct

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.320
is to run the queries on local host before

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.420
you update the app to appspot. This one here, annotate the property at AutoIndex

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.910
is incorrect. I just made this up this at AutoIndex, however

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.180
you do have to annotate your properties as @Index,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.300
if you want them to be indexed at all. And actually yes, you don't have

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.500
to worry about single property queries because index

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.480
are automatically created for ever property that is

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.400
marked with at Index. So the only thing you have to worry about for your

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.480
single property queries is to make sure that

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.897
the property itself has got the @Index annotation.
