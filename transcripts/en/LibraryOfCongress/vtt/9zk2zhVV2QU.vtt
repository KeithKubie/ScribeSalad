00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.090
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank you very
much for joining today's lecture

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.020
by Thomas Burns regarding his
National Cherry Blossom Festival

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.760
Poster Process.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.120
My name is Mari Nakahara,
the curator for architecture,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.240
design, and engineering
at the Library's Print

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.080
and Photograph division.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.290
And I also am today's
program coordinator.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.270
This program is one of the 2018
National Cherry Blossom Festival

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.660
official events, cohosted by
the Library's Asian division,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.220
as well as Print and
Photograph division.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.490
The Library began to participate

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.230
in the National Cherry Blossom
Festival starting from 2012,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.620
when we celebrate
the 100th anniversary

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.610
of the cherry blossom
tree gift from city

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.720
of Tokyo to Washington, DC.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.720
Since then, we continue
hosting events and the programs,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.800
coinciding with the National
Cherry Blossom spring event

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.030
every year.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.480
So this is to pursue one
of the Library's goals

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.360
of providing general
understanding

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.990
of American cultural,
intellectual, and social life,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.280
and of other peoples
in the nation.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.170
I'm hoping that these
lectures and events will

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.620
in the future inspire a greater
interest in Japanese culture,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.030
the US-Japan relationship,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.140
and also the Library's
diverse collections

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
in the general public,
including K-12 students.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.260
As a matter of fact, in
addition to today's lecture,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.310
the Library will host a K-12
program called Japanese Culture

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.480
Day this Saturday April
7, between 10 to 3

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.750
at the Young Readers Center with
children's book author Tad Hills

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.340
from New York City, as
well as the Spring Fling,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.620
a pop-up exhibition exploring
the sight, sound, and the smells

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.450
of the spring season
through treasures

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.920
from the Library's vast
collections, including a host

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.370
of cherry blossom
related materials.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.980
The Spring Fling will be
held on April 6, 7, 13,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.040
and 14, between 10 to 4.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.740
Events are free of charge.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.380
I hope many of you can come
back and enjoy these programs.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.080
The National Cherry Blossom
Festival has been one

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.470
of the international
renowned events in DC.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.950
What I as a curator
for design look forward

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.350
to every year is an exquisite
poster which is created

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.780
by a selected designer.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.310
I gradually cultivated my dream
to collect these posters as part

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.980
of the Library of
Congress collections.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.670
And my curiosity to learn how
each designer gets inspired

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.470
to design the National
Cherry Blossom poster has

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.690
naturally grown.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.720
Today I'm extremely excited and
pleased to invite Thomas Burns

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.790
and introduce the National
Cherry Blossom historical

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.280
posters generously donated

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.770
by the National Cherry
Blossom Festival last year.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.130
I believe you have already
enjoyed five posters outside

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.680
of this room, but we will be
showing rest of the posters,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.580
historical posters,
at the Prints

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.990
and Photographs Reading
Room after this lecture.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.670
The room is just
around the corner.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.220
We will guide you where it is.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.110
So please attend and just
enjoy the rest of the posters.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.660
Borrowing this opportunity,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.420
I want to express my deep
appreciation to Diana Mayhew,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.500
president of the National
Cherry Blossom Festival,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.560
and Lillian Iversen
and their colleagues,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.520
and then also Martha Kennedy,
my colleague and the curator

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.110
of Popular and Applied Graphic
Arts, who corroborated with me

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.960
to acquire these posters.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.600
Let me introduce Thomas Burns.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.200
Thomas Burns grew up in
Gainesville, Florida,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.950
and received a bachelor of
fine arts in graphic design

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.850
from the University of Florida.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.630
After pursuing an MBA in
supply chain management

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.960
at Michigan State University, he
relocated to Atlanta, Georgia,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.630
to work for a major
telecommunications company.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.650
Artistically, he
remained unfulfilled

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.200
and eventually created his
own freelance studio in 2007.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.040
His illustrations
are fun, whimsical,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.130
and richly detailed
piece like this.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.500
He created the flyer to us

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.980
that still boasts a
very handmade quality.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.360
His areas of expertise
include editorial advertising

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.210
and children's illustrations.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.320
His work has been
exhibited in New York,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.310
Los Angeles, and Atlanta.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.130
Mr. Burns is currently a
professor of illustration

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.310
at the Savannah College of Art
and Design, Atlanta, Georgia.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.510
Finally, please join me
welcoming Thomas Burns.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.840
[ Applause ]

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.320
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Thank
you, Mari, and thank you

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.150
to the Library for inviting
me here, and thank you guys

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.340
for coming out today to
hear this little talk

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.300
about this process
for the 2016 poster

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.750
for the National
Cherry Blossom Festival.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.640
And I think Mari kind of
went through my whole life.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.950
I have a little like -- yeah, I
know, I have this little section

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.430
about my background, so
I'll go through it again.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.550
Okay, so this is
me long, long ago,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.950
when the dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.740
I'm way older than I look.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.660
I went to school and got
a degree in graphic design

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.960
from the University of Florida.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.970
And you can see how
happy I look there.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.930
Coming out of school
with my portfolio,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.970
I'm ready to go conquer the
world and do some artwork,

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.300
but my family said, you got to
go get a real degree in business

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.790
because -- and if you
notice, my expression starts

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.450
to go a little bit -- yeah.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.150
Business is where
it's at, you know.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.810
So you can, you know, have
a long fulfilling life

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.180
as an accountant or
something like that.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.120
So I got a degree in
supply chain management

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.540
from the University of -- or
Michigan State University.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.500
And I ended up working
for the phone company.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.600
And I kid you not, my little
cubicle was between the bathroom

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.900
and the janitors closet.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.630
I did not see sunlight
for eight hours a day.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.320
It was not fulfilling to me.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.740
So of course my solution
is to go back to school

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.040
and get another degree.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.060
So I got my MFA in
illustration from SCAD,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.840
the Savannah College
of Art and Design.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.930
They have an Atlanta
campus, a Savannah campus,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.500
and one in France I
think, and then Hong Kong.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.310
So you can see the expression
changes, I'm much happier.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.090
I open a little studio.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.990
Started doing some freelance
work, a lot of advertising,

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.950
packaging, some editorial stuff.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.100
And then I started teaching
and I grew this beard,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.030
which I'll probably get rid of.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.300
So now it's gone again.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.140
Okay, so that's just
a little bit about me.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.030
So this was the type of
work that I was doing

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.850
when I had my own
little studio kind

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.220
of post college,
graduate school.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.750
You can see, this is editorial
stuff and then a little bit

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.030
of children's stuff here, and
it sort of has this kind of fun,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.060
whimsical feel to it, kind of
brighter colors, and it's sort

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.630
of rooted in kind of that
mid-20th century aesthetic of,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.120
you know, Warner Brothers
cartoons or Tex Avery

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.020
or Hanna-Barbera and
maybe a little bit

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.320
of Mary Blair in there.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.610
If you're familiar with "It's
a Small World" at Disney,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.710
that's that sort of
Mary Blair aesthetic.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.640
It's a 1950s -- she was
a '50s conceptual artist

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.540
for Disney World.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.130
And I think this is what
caught Lillian Iversen --

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.220
she's in the audience today.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.470
The director of programming

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.040
at the National Cherry
Blossom Festival.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.640
And so she sent me an
email, gave me a phone call,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.590
something like that, and
said, hey, what do you think

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.820
about doing the poster
for this year's 2016 --

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.480
for this year's Cherry
Blossom Festival?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.040
And I was like, oh, that
sounds amazing, let's do that!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.820
So generally what
happens in big projects

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.930
like this is you get
a creative brief.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.080
And part of the brief
was, you know,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.080
they wanted to own
springtime that was anchored

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080
in the annual flowering
of the trees

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.880
and retelling the narrative
of the awe-inspiring beauty

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.240
of the trees in bloom.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.080
And then of course
something that can be utilized

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.660
on merchandise, you know, for
that memory of participant.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.230
And how many people have come

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.370
to multiple Cherry
Blossom Festivals?

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.730
More than 10, more than -- okay.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.890
This is our second one,
it's just, it's fantastic.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.890
And thank you guys for the
weather today and tomorrow

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.840
but not so much on Saturday,
because it's supposed

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.200
to snow; is that right?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.260
A lot of snow?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.200
Okay, so the way this
starts for me, this process,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.670
is I go all old school and
I get into my sketchbook.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.210
Even though my work is
finished digitally --

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.470
I do everything in
the computer --

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.590
I love to get in my sketchbook
with some pen and ink and paper

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.640
and get down and dirty and do
some traditional materials.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.940
And I'll do some board
association stuff, you know,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.850
that's kind of for me
just to kind of plot

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.550
out the major points of, you
know, what should be connected

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.590
and the feeling and the
ideas that should go into it.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.440
And then this is what
my thumbnails look like.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.780
And you can see some

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.170
of the cherry blossom
thumbnails over on the right.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.530
The stuff on the left
could be something

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.040
from an editorial project
or any ideas that I've had

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.900
that I just sort of try
to get out of my head

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.340
or get onto some paper.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.280
Otherwise they tend to
evaporate and you're like,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.910
I had this great idea but I
don't remember what it was.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.210
So as long as it gets
down on some paper

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.830
and there's some record of
it, you know, you can sort

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.370
of save it and work with it.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.090
And you know, maybe you're
working out some kind

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.510
of solution to some
visual problem.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.190
And these are just some
more thumbnails, you know.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.140
There was this a
project about frogs.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.850
So I'm doing a lot of frogs
and I'm trying to figure

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.350
out what this frog is
going to look like.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.670
Is he in a race?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.810
Is he, you know -- what is
he -- I don't know, whatever.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.110
It's a bunch of frogs.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.190
Okay, so these are some of
the beginning thumbnails

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.670
for this poster that's
out front.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.300
So they're really small.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.240
They're maybe about an
inch and a half big.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.820
They're pretty simple at
this stage, but you can kind

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.770
of tell exactly what's going
on in each one of these.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.160
So there's the capitol with
the reflected cherry blossom

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.460
and a little bit of typography.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.750
Or maybe the capitol's made out
of flowers or cherry blossoms.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.590
Or maybe there's the
monuments with the, you know,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.040
blossoms coming out of it.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.130
Or the capitol popping
open an explosion

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.590
of flowers, which I always love.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.200
And then maybe the typography
ends up in trees, you know,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.500
it's sort of woven into it.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.200
Or there's a large flower
with birds and caterpillars

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.760
and maybe some butterflies
and ladybugs

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.060
and then some more
little tiny ones.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.570
Just trying to work out
what this is supposed

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.890
to look like visually.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.350
So this is the one I really
liked at the beginning stage.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.730
She's kind of laughing.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.590
She's like, because this
is not what the final piece

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.890
looked like.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.460
And I know there were a couple
other illustrators maybe

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.140
under consideration
for this at this point.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.690
So I took this way
beyond probably

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.990
where it should've been.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.430
I took it almost to finish, and
I was like, this looks awesome.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.110
I got some hand type in here.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.140
And there's a couple
color variations.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.710
And I showed this to Lillian.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.390
And I think I even mocked it
up on some products, you know.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.090
I was like, this better happen.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.420
I was like, look, we can put
it on T-shirts and coffee cups

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.410
and tote bags and key chains
and all kinds of stuff.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.710
And I sent it off to Lillian.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.710
And she was like, this
looks great, except --

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.120
let's go back and do
some more thumbnails.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.060
Because I don't know about the
capitol popping open the things

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.710
exploding out of it, so that
might be a little weird.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.980
So we did some more thumbnails,

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.800
some more exploration
on this stuff.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.780
And these are just a little
bit beyond what a thumbnail

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.120
might be.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.420
These are value comps.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.410
Some kind of working out,
you know, where the darks

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.000
and the lights and the
greens and the blues

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.680
and that kind of stuff will go.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.660
So you can see this
sort of swish that kind

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.070
of comes out of the capitol.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.490
And then the idea of that
second one where it swishes

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.170
around the capitol and ends in
that larger dominant flower,

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.280
and then the third
one where it switches

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.690
to the Washington Monument.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.380
And then you can see the kind
of difference between three

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.730
and four where it's just a
subtle difference between that.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.790
So the one that was picked
out of here was this one.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.010
And I think that type actually
ended up moving down lower.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.130
So some basic design
principles that go into even

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.990
at the small size
of these thumbnails.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.080
This is like super design
101, the basic rule of thirds.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.970
So if you grid up something,
you know, with three columns

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.240
and three rows, you can overlay
it on a piece and kind of figure

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.580
out where the major components
of things are going to lay out.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.540
So you can see the
buildings kind of lay

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.840
out in the top third, you
know, where those dots are,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.330
and the Washington Monument
sits in the top third

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.460
and the swish comes down
and that type drops right

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.960
in the middle and
it leads down to

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.260
that larger dominant
flower at the bottom.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.900
So really simple kind of stuff.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.260
And then another thing
that's sort of working

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.310
in this composition is the
little S swish that goes

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.690
through it and leads your eye
all the way down to the bottom.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.720
And then the V that
kind of funnels you back

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.020
down to the bottom again too.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.350
So, you know, it's just this is
really basic design principles

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.000
about how these things
are constructed.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.270
And this is an example
of another piece that has

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.220
that swish that kind
of runs through it,

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.840
but it's really obvious
in this piece.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.670
And then this one
maybe not so obvious.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.670
There's a lot of stuff
happening in here.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.740
Except, you know, you can
see where this upside U

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.870
and this top U kind of --

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.240
the major piece of this
sort of lay on those arcs.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.030
And then maybe one more, you can
see the X, it just drops right

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.330
in the middle, you know, sort

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.800
of this two-point
perspective kind of thing.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.710
So this stems from my graphic
design background of kind of,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.170
you know, wanting things to
be organized and orderly.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.170
Not all my pieces, you know, end
up like this, but as a structure

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.860
to hang your hat on
and do these pieces,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.200
it sort of facilitates
the process.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.380
All right, so then here, this
is actually the finished piece I

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.520
think, except maybe the type
changed a little bit at the end.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.920
But then you can see,
you know, how those --

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.950
the V shows up and
the S shows up in that

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.270
and funnels everything
down to the bottom.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.820
And then -- oops, let
me go back one more.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.380
I'm getting ahead.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.130
And then you can also see
there's one other little

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.170
principle kind of happening
in here is this sort of large,

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.580
medium, and small idea.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.180
One large dominant flower,
a bunch of medium-size ones,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.490
and then thousands of
little tiny tiny flowers.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.670
So let's go forward.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.500
And I work in Adobe Illustrator.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.900
I'm sure you guys are
familiar with Photoshop.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.200
Everyone's heard of Photoshop,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.800
and you can tweak
things and change things.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.950
And Photoshop lends
itself really well

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.650
to mimicking traditional media.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.500
So you can plug in all these
brushes and emulate oil painting

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.580
or watercolor or charcoal or
pencil or that kind of stuff

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.320
and get this sort
of really hand-done,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.780
traditional look to something.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.940
Adobe Illustrator works
a little bit differently

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.040
and it's heavily used in
the graphic design world,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.640
which is my background.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.110
And if you think about it,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.110
Adobe Illustrator works
almost like cut paper.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.060
So all these little
things are layers of paper.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.960
And they can all be repositioned
and resized and tweaked

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.060
and turned and manipulated.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.480
And I'll go forward.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.740
So this is what all the
pieces start to look

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.040
like when I'm designing them.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.110
And then they can all
sort of be overlaid.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.960
So you can see that green
swish that runs that.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.790
It looks kind of like cut paper.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.090
It has that flat look to it.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.040
And there's thousands and
thousands of layers of pieces

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.500
of that cut paper in here.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.800
And you can see the buildings

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.100
when I've pulled
them apart here.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.400
You know, they're not
completely finished

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.350
because -- if I go back.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.010
They're hidden behind
some other things.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.680
But there's actually
a little bit more

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.260
to the buildings and the pieces.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.610
And Adobe Illustrator is very
-- you can manipulate things

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.030
and kind of move
the flowers around

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.330
and make sure there's
no tangents

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.040
when things touch each other
in awkward ways, or there's,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.430
you know, two pink flowers
next to each other that look

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.730
like they blend into each other.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.370
So you have a lot of precision
and a lot control over it.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.970
Maybe not so much like in
Photoshop or traditional media,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.160
where once you put that mark
down and you kind of blend it

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.680
with other pieces,
it's harder to kind

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.620
of manipulate it
and move it around.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.100
And then some typography
was being considered during

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.470
this process.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.160
And some little animals
snuck into it,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.000
some little birds
and butterflies.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.970
The capitol snuck into
that bottom right one.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.480
I don't think any of this got --
well, maybe the middle one kind

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.180
of got considered near the end.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.050
So then this was sort
of laid out on the --

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.970
the major swish thing
where the type went.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.070
It kind of moves around.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.850
And then I think that's the
your regular logo, right?

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.650
So then the building
process of this whole thing.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.000
So there's the finished piece.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.220
So if I'm starting with
all that cut paper,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.550
I lay down my sky first,
and add the buildings.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.790
Then started adding the
green river of spring.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.860
And then a bunch of flowers.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.020
And then some more
-- yeah, you can see,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.100
it's kind of a tiny little
-- there's just more stuff

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.210
and leaves kind of adding in the
background sort of fills it out.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.510
Then some butterflies.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.900
It's animated --
it's not animated,

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.650
I'm just clicking buttons.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.990
And okay, and then the big
flower ends up at the end.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.430
And then there's a subtle shift
here, and I'll talk about that

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.200
in a second, where you can
see right around the clouds

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.500
and maybe in the green area

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.410
where some texture
ends up in there.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.570
And I do bring this into
Photoshop at the end.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.100
And then there's a color
shift here and some

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.220
of that typography
ends up at the bottom.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.540
And then that's sort
of the finished piece.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.550
And this is sort of a
blown up detail of that.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.530
And you can see, I bring this
into Photoshop and use some

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.360
of those more traditional
brushes that emulate splatters

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.870
and gouache and oil paint, and
you can see a little bit of that

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.760
down in the corner, and then
it's ending up on the flower.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.800
And it sort of takes
away that really clean,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.690
sterile graphic design look
to it and gives it a more,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.230
you know, sort of humanistic,
traditional feel to it.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:02.500
And one of the final pieces
to that is I will slip a piece

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.770
of old vintage paper
behind the entire piece.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.070
And you can see on the right,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.370
that's just a little
section of it.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.380
And it's, you know, something
out of a book, like an end paper

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.090
out of a discarded
book from the library,

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.900
or an old comic book that,
you know, has a section

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.810
that has some speckled
tone to it

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.300
and has yellowed and has aged.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.100
And that slips behind everything
and I let it kind of peek

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.040
through the entire design.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.590
And you can see that texture
on the flower and kind

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.740
of sit behind in the
green area and the --

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.880
yeah, I guess on the flower

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.830
and the little green
area in the back.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.670
So then there's the
final design.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.990
I think it's close, except
for the type at the bottom.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.440
And then I do want to mention
that I do teach at SCAD,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.090
the Savannah College
of Art and Design.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.510
They have a campus in Atlanta.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.360
And I've been there
about five years.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.200
And I always tell the students
that this is like Hogwarts.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.500
It's a magical place.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.040
And I know, because they
come in and, you know,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.130
they're just drawing and
they're making magical things.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.740
And I tend to get them right at
the end of their career there --

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.380
I teach graduate students
and undergrads but sort

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.650
of seniors and high juniors.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.550
So they've kind of gone through
all their techniques classes

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.090
and they've learned oil,
pastels, and watercolors,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.190
and you know, all their
perspective drawing

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.600
and their life drawing.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.010
And then I get them when it
starts to the application stage.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.600
So we're doing posters.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.140
I teach posters and
advertising illustration

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.280
and editorial illustration and
children's book illustration.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.070
And let's see.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.920
And this is what a typical
classroom looks like.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.990
We have like meeting
rooms and tables,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.600
kind of like you would
have in a small agency

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.970
or like a bigger company.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.520
And then there's
workstations behind.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.130
And other classrooms have
traditional media tables to get

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.000
down and dirty with the
actual physical things.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.300
And we just have such a good
time sitting there and talking

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.930
about this stuff
and doing stuff.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.250
And honestly, I may
learn more from them

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.760
than I teach them, I don't know.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.930
But at some point I'm just
like, oh, that looks great,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:04.340
and I'm writing it down, like
how did they do that, I don't --

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.760
so I guess that's about it.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.980
That sort of sums up
the whole idea of how

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.710
that thing is created and
I guess where I came from.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.110
And I would like to thank Mari
and the Library of Congress

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.320
and Lillian and my
family and you guys

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.510
for coming out for this.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.080
[ Applause ]

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.550
Sorry, did I talk too fast?

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.880
Yeah, so now, do you
guys have any questions?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.230
I will -- plenty of questions.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.320
&gt;&gt; How far in advance are you
actually approached about this?

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.290
&gt;&gt; Was it maybe about
a year maybe.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.990
&gt;&gt; Over the summer or latest
early fall of the previous year

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.490
of the festival that's
forthcoming.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:53.750
So for 2016, I think I
reached out to you about July.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.050
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
July of '15, yeah.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.850
Because a lot of stuff had to
be done by fall of '15, right?

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to get printed and
advertised on the website

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.140
and that kind of stuff, yeah.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.190
&gt;&gt; Typically we get
inspired by the artwork

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.950
and then utilize pieces of
it in marketing materials,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.410
all of that starts getting
designed before Christmas.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:23.640
So that's why we try and -- the
sweet spot is the late summer.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.930
&gt;&gt; Is there an annual
feel to this?

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:33.250
Or is it whatever
they want to do?

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.660
&gt;&gt; No real feel, per se.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.580
There might be something or some
words that we try and interject

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.370
or propose to the artists to see
how it might resonate with them

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.080
and put it into an illustration
or from a artistic rendering.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.790
But it's not as though we
say, oh, 2015, the theme is,

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.090
you know, a walk in the
park or anything like that

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.390
and say have your artwork
specifically represent

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.690
that statement.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.990
But -- so yeah.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.290
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yeah.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.590
And I think when we started
doing this, I had a bunch

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.890
of animals in there,
and you're like, no,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.190
we did animals last year.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.490
So more about the flowers
and the green and, yeah,

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.790
explosion in the
river of flowers.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:06.750
&gt;&gt; Right. I was trying to think
what was the theme for 2016.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:12.790
Was that the celebrated
parks and nature or whatnot.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.620
There might have been something
that we might have been using

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.420
to help steer some
programming and, you know,

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.000
proposed it as if there's
a way that that comes

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.300
across without being
explicit, we welcome it.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.600
So then all of that is
reviewed a little bit

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.900
in the thumbnail phase.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.200
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Right.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.500
So that all sort
of gets weeded out.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.800
More questions?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.100
Yes?

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.890
&gt;&gt; So what -- can you
talk a little bit more

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.520
about the client-artist
relationship,

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.820
this back and forth?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.970
Like you have this idea
and then they go huh-uh,

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.760
and then you have another
idea and they go huh-uh.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.060
What is that like?

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.550
Like what is going on there?

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.620
And how many people
are you dealing with?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.070
Are you just dealing
with one person,

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.720
or are you dealing
with a committee?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.620
And what is that like?

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.150
And how much are
you compromising?

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.440
Or are you trying to convince
them like well, aesthetically,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.730
this is really more than that?

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.030
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Right, right.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.330
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] or is it
whatever the client says?

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.630
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.930
But it depends on the client.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.990
So in the editorial
world, something that turns

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.060
around really quickly,
like for newspapers

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.120
or maybe even magazines,
it may have a couple days

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.220
or a couple weeks of turnaround,
generally those art directors,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.460
they say, we have this idea,
give me some thumbnails

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.870
and then we'll pick one
and then just go do it.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.490
But you get into the book
world or the advertising world

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.240
and there's longer lead times.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.420
Especially in the book
world and advertising,

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.320
there will be committees
of people.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.910
And so there may be a
couple steps to get to that.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.200
So you present a lot of
thumbnails and it goes

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.840
to maybe an art director
and they take it back

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.400
to a creative team and
then they look at it

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.410
and so they get a
lot more input.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.310
And so things can get steered
by committees, and then that's

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.410
where that compromise
may come in, you know.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.810
Where you say, I really
like these colors or the way

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.390
with this type fits together,

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.140
and then someone else
has another idea,

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.920
some graphic designer
on the other end,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.100
and then you start
the sort of, you know,

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.480
kind of just juxtaposition
on how these things work

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.800
and you got to start doing a
lot of give-and-take with that.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.640
And so it really
depends on the client.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.570
The editorial world,
which is very fast,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.870
I like working in that.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.540
So if someone gives me an
idea, the thumbnails come out.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.060
And, you know, honestly I
think giving them a lot options

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.720
up front, so that's why you
can see that in my sketchbook

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.030
where there's tons
of thumbnails.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.400
And I really enjoy doing it.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.350
Long ago -- and I tell my
students this all the time.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.650
Because they'll come in with

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.200
like maybe a couple
little pencil sketches

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.500
with a stick figure.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.380
I'm like, you need to do more
thumbnails, and they're like,

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.600
I hate them, I just want
do the final project.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.950
So long ago, I was like
that, but then I grew

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.390
to love making thumbnails
and working out those little,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.490
you know, the little I
guess the compositions

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.310
at that small scale.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.830
And then that's almost like the
roadmap for the bigger thing.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.900
And, you know, the final
piece becomes easier to do.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.090
So I don't know if that answered
your question or not but.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.960
Yeah, so it depends on who --

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.930
what the client or what
industry you're working for.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.110
&gt;&gt; Well, I may want to ask a
little more further detail.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.440
For instance, I did
architectural design

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.970
and [inaudible] certain scenes.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.440
Oh you like this one but
structure wise it doesn't work.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.740
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Right.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.040
&gt;&gt; You know?

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.340
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.640
&gt;&gt; And we have kind

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.940
of [inaudible] push them
back, push them back.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.080
What was your feel that you
want to push your idea from

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.830
and then just back up?

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.710
What would be the weapon to use?

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.050
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: The weapon.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.650
You hired me, I'm the expert.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.480
Yeah, but you can't
phrase it that way.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.090
You're just like, you know, you
have to be really diplomatic

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.740
about it and say, you
know, aesthetically --

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.170
and there's some
reasoning behind it.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.650
So I sort of showed you the
really basic design principles,

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.780
so you can use that as
a weapon to, you know,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.510
back up why you're doing things.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.860
And then you can always use
other weapons of, you know,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.540
like color palettes and
consistency and how type works.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.950
And you can lay out
some good reasoning

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.840
about why something
works, you know.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.200
And if it's somebody who
doesn't have as much experience,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.880
you know, you can kind
of argue against it.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.940
But, you know, at some point you
want to make the client happy.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.720
And there's some
compromise at a point.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.030
[inaudible] It is, yeah, yeah.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.860
And you talk about the basic
principles and, you know,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.180
it's hard to argue against that.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.900
Say, well, this layout looks
really nice and it sort

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.200
of follows this rule of thirds.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.100
And they're like, oh, okay.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.560
You got me there, you know.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.370
&gt;&gt; Do they try to
micromanage you then?

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.670
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Some do, yeah.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.970
&gt;&gt; To the point where,
okay, I want to put

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.740
in this texture and
you go, oh no.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.040
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Take that out.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.620
Yes. Yeah, and that's, you know,

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.600
whatever art director
you're dealing with.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.760
Some are very loose and
some are very micromanagy.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.670
And you either like
that or dislike that.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.450
And if you don't want to
work with somebody, you know,

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.110
that super micromanages
you, you can, you know, say,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.420
thanks but no thanks, you know.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.050
I have a high tolerance
of, you know, open projects

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.170
versus really closed and
tightly-done projects.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.970
And I tend to give my students
like a really structured,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.430
tightly-bound project
and really open projects.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.630
And some of them just
hate the open projects.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.930
They're like, I want
the structure,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.230
I want the micromanaging.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.780
Or some go the absolute
other way,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.650
I want the little
tightly-bound thing.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.600
So, yeah, it depends.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.800
It always depends.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.100
More questions?

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.760
&gt;&gt; When you're working in
Illustrator, Adobe Illustrator,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.030
are all the elements that
you're working with things

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.330
that you started out --

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.480
that started out as you
drawing them by hand?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.780
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yes.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.180
So all those little tiny little
flowers, all drawn by hand.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.660
And I know there could
be the impetus to sort

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.630
of like cut-and-paste and
sort of make a thousand

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.290
of the same flower, but then
you can really kind of tell

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.810
that somebody cut-and-pasted
and didn't, you know,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.710
do every little flower by hand.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.670
It just looks more natural

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.930
and doesn't look as,
you know, artificial.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.360
So yeah, all those little
pieces, all the little pieces

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.650
of the monuments, the little
dots, the little dashes,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.200
the butterflies, the bees, and
all that stuff is all hand done.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.040
And then since it's so
manipulative that you can,

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.370
you know, rearrange everything
to the thousands of an inch

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.650
and manipulate it and
turn it and rotate it,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.950
I just I like that precision.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.380
So yes.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.060
&gt;&gt; So are they scanned?

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
They're not scanned.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.940
Going from that thumbnail stage,
a little pen and ink stuff,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.030
sometimes I'll scan that in and
put it next to the art board

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.570
in Adobe Illustrator,
and then just sort of use

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.870
that as a reference guide.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.880
I know other people will lay

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.990
that underneath the art
board and draw over it.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.240
Because they want to draw over
exactly what they did by hand.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.060
I tend to be a little bit
more loosey-goosey about it

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.000
and just sort of start tweaking
things and manipulating things.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.150
So that thumbnail is by no
means the absolute, you know,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:30:02.650
Bible of how that thing
is going to play out.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:03.950
Yes?

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.250
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] with your demos.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.340
You showed a ship with some
humor to it with the iceberg,

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.750
and the perspective that there's
humor throughout your material.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.360
Are there times where
you're, again,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.940
trying to change something, the
rule of thirds or other concepts

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.710
like that, that are used
where you can manipulate that,

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.260
if you do that within your
work, it's not rule of thirds,

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.650
it's something else
because you're trying to.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.950
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Right.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.250
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about
it like that?

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.270
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Like that
one, that little ship.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.820
I think there was
another one that looked

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.170
like a pill next to it.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.040
And that's just, you know, a
straight up editorial image

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.340
like right in the middle.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.010
I mean, that ship has
a nice diagonal to it.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.910
So instead of, you know,
dropping it on a horizontal,

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.850
which is less interesting
than a diagonal,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.150
that's just sort giving

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.170
that particular piece
something a little bit more

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.470
that's unexpected.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.780
And it's not that hard to, you
know, tweak it on a diagonal.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.960
The little pill one --
and I can maybe go back

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.260
to those really quick.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.620
Let's have the lecture
again, in reverse.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:12.960
I didn't memorize it in reverse.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.560
And so close.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.070
I feel like -- there.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.490
Yeah, and that pill house
was about sort of addiction

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.980
in the suburbs, a
little editorial piece.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.630
And again, it has a
little diagonal to it.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.040
It could've been straight on.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.990
But that definitely does not
play into that rule of thirds.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.520
It just, it is what
it is kind of piece.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.540
And that's something that
might end up in a magazine

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.580
at about a quarter size
illustration or half a page.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.200
I think this one
was half a page.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.610
You know, and then at some
point, you know, you can rely

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.450
on these rule of thirds and
these sort of structures,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.230
and at some point you can do
what -- you can break the rules

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.530
and do what you want with it.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.990
And some of my students come in

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.670
and they've already broken
the rules and they're right

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:53.970
in the middle of that pill house

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.410
with just one little
image in the middle.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.730
And you know, you first start
doing this stuff with the V's

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.450
and the S's and the X's and
then you can get to that,

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.850
depending on the project and,
you know, what it calls for.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.690
And I don't think that
needed anything more to it.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.500
It's communicating some
kind editorial concept.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.800
Yes?

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.250
&gt;&gt; So you were talking
about your process

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.000
and that you were old
school in the sketchbook.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.370
I'm curious what you're
seeing now with your students.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:28.440
Is it a basic thing to get them
to be -- to do the old school?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.660
I mean, what direction
are they in?

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.370
Is everything going
to be computerized?

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.160
I'm just kind of curious
about what's happening with?

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.990
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: In
that world, yeah.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.290
Yeah, you would kind of think

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.770
since computers are everywhere
and, you know, people just want

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.420
to jump on the computer
and start doing stuff.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.320
And that's absolutely
not the case where I'm

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.920
at and what I am seeing.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.170
There's tons of students
that, you know,

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.700
want to get the watercolors
out and get gouache paint out

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.660
and do stuff with
colored pencil.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.980
And what's kind of weird,
I'm seeing some cut paper,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.420
some real cut paper, not this
Adobe Illustrator cut paper.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.720
And they are cutting stuff out

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.020
and they're gluing
things together,

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.770
and it's very tactile,
very handmade.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.970
And then at some point, you
know, those handmade things get

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.090
into the computer, because
then you can shift colors

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.770
around way easier,
or change something,

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.510
or add typography to it.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.560
But I'm seeing sort of a 50-50.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.950
And at SCAD, we teach all this
sort of traditional media first,

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.320
and then -- not that these
students aren't coming in with,

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.620
you know, Photoshop skills,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.100
but then they see how
these things work together.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.840
It's just another tool to use.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.280
And it can act as
traditional media.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.290
And I think, you know, sort
of out in the marketplace,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.140
that traditional media is prize,
and you'll see stuff like that

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.870
on Etsy and all these, you know,

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.020
websites where you see
the crocheted stuff

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.760
or the knitted stuff or
the hand calligraphy.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.610
But then at some point it has
to go digital to be dispersed

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:46.910
into the larger market.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.130
Or if it stays in that
handmade stage, you know,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:54.110
it becomes a sort of more
important almost artist --

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.900
like artists' books or
paintings or that kind of stuff,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.450
it has more weight to it.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.110
So I'm definitely seeing both.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.360
And that's maybe why I love
getting in the sketchbook

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.200
and doing pen and ink up front,

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.510
so I still have my
feet in both worlds.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.420
And I think a lot of the
students learn that eventually.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.110
Like, oh, I can use a
computer, but then I want

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.920
to work traditionally on
this project and I want

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.940
to work digitally
on this project.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.680
So I'm definitely seeing both.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.270
And I think that may
be a reaction to --

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.600
probably around 2000,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.320
when computers were becoming
more prevalent in the design

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.230
and illustration
process, everyone wanted

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.530
to be on the computer.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.830
Everything was going to be
computerized in the future.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.320
And so then everything
sort of had this sort

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.220
of computery look to it.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.290
And then it sort of
swung back the other way

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.470
where you'll see a lot of
the hand-done lettering.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.720
So people are prizing that
more tactile feel to it,

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.080
more traditional look.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.520
&gt;&gt; That's really [inaudible].

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.820
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.120
So traditional stuff --

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.420
yeah, just like almost
like vinyl has come back.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.370
You know, I bought
a turntable recently

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.810
and I'm buying these records.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.700
And I'm like, this
is so old school.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.620
Because all music is available
everywhere on the Internet,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.190
but I'm listening to records.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.490
And that was because
of my daughter

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.790
who got a record player.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.480
Yes?

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.580
&gt;&gt; Do you have your students
turn in sketchbooks for classes?

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.880
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
I do, yeah, yeah.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.620
And we look at them, you know,
throughout the whole class,

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.920
just seeing what they're doing.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.950
And some are amazing, and
some are not so amazing.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.770
Well, you know, and
I get that, you know,

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.780
because some people think --
some students think, well,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.080
you know, why do I
have to get in here?

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.380
I just want to get
on the computer.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.270
And then some just love
just sitting and drawing.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.510
And it's cathartic and it's
relaxing and you can sort

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.810
of get in the zen moment.

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.840
And I do that in my
sketchbook with the pen and --

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.730
so I'll do everything
in pencil first.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.300
And then I go over it
with a Rapidograph pen

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.940
or a little Tombow
pen or something.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.380
And it's relaxing for me.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.070
And you can kind of take
some time to start inking it,

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.390
and then you're thinking about
the next thing, you know,

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.690
that you're going to draw.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.260
But, you know, you're sort
of automatically doing this

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.670
and Netflix is on or music
is on, and then you move

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.030
on to the next sketch in pencil.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.870
So yes, I have them turn
in sketchbooks and look

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:05.580
through sketchbooks, and we talk
about them and the importance

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.760
of thumbnails and doing
stuff, you know, tactically

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.640
and traditionally,
yeah, absolutely.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.830
&gt;&gt; So your selection as
the artist to do the poster

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:22.760
in 2016 I think it was, how
has that changed your life?

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.870
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: I'm here, so
that was super cool, right?

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.740
And this is the second
time we've been here.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.270
I was like, this is amazing.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.070
Life-changing, this is a
big deal to have something,

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.920
you know, nationally
recognized like that,

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.220
and then to be in
the collection.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.530
I don't know, it makes me
feel amazing that it sort

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.600
of legitimizes as an
illustrator and artist.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.530
I'm super appreciative of, you
know, the chance to do that

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.150
and to come here and
speak about that.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.870
&gt;&gt; I mean, did your
name get out more?

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.560
Was it like -- are you
getting more offers?

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.870
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: You
know, it's hard to say

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.280
if that's how people find it.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.090
Because it's always
such an interesting path

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.030
about how people find
you as an illustrator.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.820
Like magazine art
directors will find you

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.760
because they saw
an editorial piece

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.060
or a poster or somewhere else.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.480
And I don't know if I
specifically ask all the time,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.450
but I'm sure that
absolutely has something to do

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:23.480
with a larger awareness and
sort of marketing of yourself.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.630
So yeah, I would say yes.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:30.980
&gt;&gt; Can you speak to
the time involved

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.790
in even just the creation of one
of those flowers on the poster

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.950
and manipulating that program?

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.250
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yes.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.830
You know, those little
flowers may take --

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.500
I mean, since they're all sorted
different, you kind of get

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.910
into a rhythm of making them.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.750
They make take a minute or two.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.240
Or like that bigger one that had
some more dots and squiggles,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.990
that might take three or four or
five or 10 minutes, just to kind

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.960
of get it right, you know.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.250
You can draw it and then like,
well, this curve doesn't look

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.230
so perfect, and you
refine it a little bit.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.620
And then you lay down
some dots, and, well,

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.820
this dark pink is right
next to another dark pink,

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.270
let's shrink it, let's move it.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.280
And so it just gets really
manipulative like that.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.820
So, you know, and that
three or four minutes adds

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.690
up for the amount of
those little flowers

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:14.990
that are in there.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.980
So then it starts going
into hours and hours.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.010
And then sort of designing
that swish of the river

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.300
that sits behind it and making
sure those flowers don't run

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.950
over any awkward spots
and the green shows

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.510
through in all the right areas.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.760
So, you know, things like
little thumbnails and kind

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.030
of drawing those might take
two or three or four minutes

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.330
to kind of get some of those.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.660
And you can do an hour or
two hours worth of that.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.960
And then the flowers
start getting

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.260
into the hours and hours.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.260
And then the tweaking and
the moving starts getting

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.560
into more and more hours.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.910
And then you're at 10, 15, 20
hours, and then, I don't know,

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.130
30 hours with the
paper and the texture.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.060
Yeah, it just keeps
building cumulatively.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.140
So yeah. But to me that's what
I like doing, so it doesn't seem

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.210
like it's taking a lot of time.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.610
You know, anything that you
really enjoy doing, you're like,

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.860
this isn't work to me, I
just love drawing flowers

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.420
and buildings and
swishes and, you know,

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.880
birds and bees and
things like that.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.180
Yes?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.750
&gt;&gt; For somebody who got stuck in
the real cherry blossom traffic,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:17.060
can you discuss more to your
final picture for the rest

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.390
of the questions
so I can see it?

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:21.690
Thank you.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.990
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: So close.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.240
Wait. We'll go through it again

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.880
and we'll have the
lecture again.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.180
Wait.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.660
Yes?

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.050
&gt;&gt; I was putting your
poster lovingly back

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.720
in our reading room at the top
of your talk, so forgive me

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.040
if you already mentioned this.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.800
But were there artists who
influenced you early on?

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.910
Are there artists that
you really love today?

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.210
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Oh, definitely.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.750
And I did kind of
go through that,

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.790
that a lot of my art
was influenced by sort

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.100
of that mid-20th century,
the cartoon world,

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.260
the Hanna-Barbera, to
Tex Avery, you know,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.850
the 1960-ish Bugs Bunny that
had that kind of wonky line work

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.470
and the really loosey-goosey
color.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.920
Maybe not so much the '30s and
'40s Warner Brothers stuff.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.180
&gt;&gt; That poster shows that
that you showed earlier.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.480
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.780
And you can totally see
that popping through.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.850
And then even like
people like Mary Blair.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:19.000
Do you know -- she was a concept
artist for Disney like in the --

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.970
and think of like Cinderella.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.010
And she did all this
sort of gouache painting

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.790
that has this really
light loosey feel to it.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.130
And then if you've ever
been on It's a Small World

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:33.200
at Disney World and that
kind of really geometric kind

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.360
of fun kind of aesthetic
of the midcentury is her.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.690
So you're kind of familiar
with it on some level.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.730
&gt;&gt; I wanted to also mention that
we've had students who come here

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.190
and draw looking at the
collection for inspiration.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.250
We had Pixar folks here and
they had both sketchbooks

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.820
and tablets going, you know,
they were doing all of it.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.120
It's just another tool.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.800
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.100
Yes?

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.010
&gt;&gt; On these, do you
get to autograph these,

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:03.910
or are they largely anonymous?

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.550
And is there anything
you can do --

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.270
you know, would I
know this was yours?

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.440
Is there a hidden signature
that you have worked in here?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.370
Is there like Hirschfeld
has those schemas.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.580
How do you not be anonymous?

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.880
How do you?

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.400
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: You'll see
a lot of B shapes in here

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.770
for Burns -- no, I didn't.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:26.600
Every flower.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.990
No, I don't think I
snuck anything in here.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.790
But at some point there
was some autographing

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.740
of the actual prints,
the posters.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.110
But I don't think I
put anything in there.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.560
&gt;&gt; We put it in a post design
to make sure you got credit.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.860
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Oh, is it?

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.160
It might be on the side, yeah.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.460
Yeah, okay.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.760
So an after -- but
nothing hidden in there

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.080
that I'll tell you about.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.490
I'm just kidding.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.640
Because Lillian's here.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.530
How dare he?

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.830
Yes?

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.700
&gt;&gt; If you cross your eyes,

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.260
you'll see still
see the capitol.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.560
&gt;&gt; Martha?

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:11.010
&gt;&gt; I'm really curious,
did you ever study --

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:17.800
ever take a course on the
history of art or history

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.070
of design or illustration
in your training?

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.370
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: So many
art history classes.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.670
I think I have an entire
PhD in art history.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.330
Yeah, and it was, you
know, in undergrad

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.630
and in graduate school.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.310
They give you lots of, you know,
Italian Renaissance and Greek

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:31.040
and Roman and Baroque and
all that kind of stuff.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.000
So that, you know,
influences you

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.880
in some base level,
yeah, absolutely.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:41.160
&gt;&gt; You seem to have
a theme of motion.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.930
Do you ever take that to the
next step, theater and writing?

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:51.280
You talked about
animation that you like.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.580
Maybe things of like
cartoonish, you know,

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.880
the next slide after this?

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.180
What is your experience
with that where some

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.480
of these static displays
come alive?

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.780
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yeah.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.080
And so the world is
sort of moving towards

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.380
that of these things
having at least some motion.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.680
So I actually teach a class
called dynamic publication,

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.610
which is turning
editorial pieces

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.540
into little animated gifts.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.500
So it adds just that next little
time -- we're not doing full on,

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.130
you know, Pixar animation.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.840
But to illustrate a point,
something else happens.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.000
Like that little ship
would snake a little bit

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.550
around that iceberg and it
might bump into it, move back.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.490
And, you know, just something
like that to kind of show --

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.890
it reinforces the
point of that concept.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.720
So yeah, I've done a little
bit of that, I haven't done any

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.490
like super professional work for
magazines or digital magazines

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.290
like that, but just on
my own I've done it.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.750
And it's a little bit
newer field to kind

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:38.680
of push the illustration into.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.690
But we're trying to push
the students into that.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.950
Because magazines and
different publications will ask

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.250
for things like that.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.550
Like here's the really
nice editorial piece,

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.710
but can you also make it,
you know, blink or rotate

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.010
or flip around or something.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.440
Yeah, so just a little bit.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.740
And it's great to
have that knowledge.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.320
It's not that hard to
take that next step.

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.190
&gt;&gt; More questions?

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.530
I want to ask Lillian actually,
how you run all the artists

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.010
and how you select one,

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.540
specifically one,
to a specific year?

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.970
&gt;&gt; So just a lot of culling
through various sources.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.530
I think I found Thomas through
the park book or something.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:20.830
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Workbook
or something, you're.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.750
&gt;&gt; Workbook.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:30.900
And then just doing
the outreach.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:37.550
Gaging how interested the
artist might be varies by year

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:44.650
that sometimes we might approach
up to three and ask them

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:50.820
to at least do a concept
round, where we can

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.440
at least get a sense
of how their approach

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.140
to art might then marry

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:03.320
with what we're hoping
to present visually.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:12.440
Sometimes we just already know
who we want to be working with.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.360
People saying, you should
work with this artist.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.660
And I'll say, well, enough

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.360
of them are telling
us, maybe we should.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.390
So it just varies year by year.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:28.620
And then with the selection
process or the whole process

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.520
in general with the festival,
it's a little bit of a blend

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.600
of me serving the primary role
of art director and to working

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.010
with the artists, but then
having from the president

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.310
and also from a smaller
committee,

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.610
that I'll take their suggestions
and kind of whittle it

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:39.910
down to be enough direction
to give positive feedback

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:41.210
to the direction that
we want to go to,

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:42.510
but not necessarily
box the artist in.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:43.810
Like in the case of typography,
we were open to exploring it

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.110
and then when the piece came
in, I was reminded, well,

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.410
it needs to have our logo on it.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.710
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Let's get rid of that

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.010
and put the logo on there.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:50.310
&gt;&gt; Right. So from my
perspective, we definitely try

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:51.610
and keep it where there's
an openness and a chance

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:52.910
for the artist to explore, but
also still preparing in my head,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.210
it's the visual piece of
the festival for that year,

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.510
and so how can we make sure it's
representative of what we want

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:56.810
to put out to our audience.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.110
&gt;&gt; What Lillian does --
she's got a great eye.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.060
She looks at that artwork
and tries to pick out --

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.390
every year we do an artwork
-- I mean, an original pen.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.340
I actually have the one for
that year for '16 in here

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.650
that she picked it out of there

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.780
and then the pelican
was created from that.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.490
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yeah, there
was a lot of amazing merch --

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.800
the little ornaments that came

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.840
out of this were hand
painted was amazing, yeah.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.140
[inaudible].

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:27.390
&gt;&gt; It was inspiring
[inaudible], so thank you.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.020
&gt;&gt; So we are librarians and
archivists and curators.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.760
I want to ask you, how you
are archiving your work?

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.540
And finally, as an
educator, what is your message

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.040
to the next generation?

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.210
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: A lot of
this stuff is archived sort

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.200
of digitally, but then
I do print out a lot

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.900
of these things on, you know,
acid free page neutral paper,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.630
the giclee prints, in
a large scale format,

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.830
and then I keep those.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.840
But I have all the
stuff digitally archived

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.330
in a couple different places.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:05.370
So in case, you know, that
hard drive is destroyed

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.670
or that computer is destroyed,

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.830
all that work is
at least somewhere.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.320
The next generation,
I would say, you keep,

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.800
keep working traditionally,
learn digital stuff as tools

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.980
and start putting
some motion into it.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.620
And there's such a wide range
of styles and industries

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.510
and places to be drawing.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.480
Especially in the
illustration world,

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.140
that there's always some
niche place where you can end

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.240
up working and your stuff
can be accepted and,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.940
you know, do well in the world.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.150
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.500
&gt;&gt; So when you started out,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.520
were you mainly using
traditional methods

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.220
or was the computer always?

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.930
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Long,
long ago, you mean?

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:50.390
From graphic design days?

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:51.690
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:52.990
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Yeah,
long, long ago --

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:54.290
and I don't know if you
have a background or not

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.960
in graphic design
or know anything.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.130
It was computers had
sort of just come out,

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:00.790
like the little boxy
Macs, you know,

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.650
with black and white screens.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.820
And so those were
in another room.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.230
And like that was our goal
was to get to these things.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.710
And so we had these pads
of paper and we were

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:13.410
like hand tracing typography
and putting glue on things

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.240
and pasting things
up and using markers.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.130
And then once we get to this
black and white computer,

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.770
they couldn't do
very much, you know.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.940
So that's where a lot of
that hand-done stuff for me

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.210
at least comes from
those basic principles.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:28.040
And then getting to the -- and
I think that's a really nice way

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.040
to go instead of just sort
of jumping to the computer

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.490
and letting it do
everything for you.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.910
However, you know, you get on
the computer and you can flip

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.120
through 1000 typefaces in a
second, instead of looking

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.030
through a book and trying to
get some Zipatone and, you know,

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.400
scratch it onto the paper.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.700
And go, oh, that didn't work,

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.000
and throw it away
and move to the next.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.300
Yeah, I know.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.600
So there's a balance
between the two.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.320
So yes, definitely.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.460
&gt;&gt; Other questions?

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:56.050
No? So we would like to
wrap up the lecture session

00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.040
and then please join
me appreciating Thomas

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.340
Burns' lecture.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.640
Thank you.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.940
[applause].

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.240
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: Thank you,
no thank you very much.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.380
Thank you for coming out.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.630
&gt;&gt; And you all make sure
to stop by the Prints

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.930
and Photographs division.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.130
We displayed all the pictures --

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.410
the posters which donated

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.980
by National Cherry
Blossom Festival Inc.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.320
Which will be around the corner
if you exit this building --

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.520
I mean this room to the
right and then make one turn

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.390
to the right and on the door,
337, you will see Thomas Burns'

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.870
like a flyer on the door.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.170
So you don't miss it.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.470
So please go by.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.770
Thank you very much
for coming today.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.070
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns: It
looks similar to that.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.670
&gt;&gt; Thomas Burns:
Thank you so much.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:41.970
Oh my God, that was so much fun.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.270
I really enjoyed it.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:46.690
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.070
