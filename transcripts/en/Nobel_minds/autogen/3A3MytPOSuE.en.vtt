failure because we're pushing to
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089 align:start position:0%
failure because we're pushing to
something<00:00:12.780><c> that</c><00:00:12.809><c> nobody</c><00:00:13.320><c> knows</c><00:00:13.559><c> about</c><00:00:13.889><c> and</c>

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
something that nobody knows about and
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
something that nobody knows about and
we're<00:00:14.250><c> trying</c><00:00:14.490><c> to</c><00:00:14.610><c> gain</c><00:00:14.790><c> some</c><00:00:14.820><c> understanding</c>

we're trying to gain some understanding
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390 align:start position:0%
we're trying to gain some understanding
of<00:00:15.929><c> it</c><00:00:16.080><c> I</c><00:00:16.260><c> think</c><00:00:16.770><c> that</c><00:00:16.920><c> that</c><00:00:17.070><c> means</c><00:00:17.279><c> that</c>

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
of it I think that that means that
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 align:start position:0%
of it I think that that means that
failure<00:00:17.730><c> is</c><00:00:18.180><c> inevitable</c><00:00:18.900><c> important</c><00:00:19.859><c> that</c>

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 align:start position:0%
failure is inevitable important that
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
failure is inevitable important that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
does happen I'm not really sure what the
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
does happen I'm not really sure what the
prescription<00:00:23.220><c> is</c><00:00:23.730><c> to</c><00:00:23.880><c> get</c><00:00:24.180><c> over</c><00:00:24.449><c> the</c><00:00:24.600><c> failure</c>

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 align:start position:0%
prescription is to get over the failure
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
