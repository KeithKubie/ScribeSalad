00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
another way Derek oh my cuz it I think
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.510 align:start position:0%
another way Derek oh my cuz it I think
it's<00:02:28.800><c> one</c><00:02:28.950><c> of</c><00:02:29.010><c> those</c><00:02:29.070><c> where</c><00:02:29.310><c> it's</c><00:02:29.430><c> like</c>

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's one of those where it's like
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.220 align:start position:0%
it's one of those where it's like
because<00:02:29.820><c> they</c><00:02:29.970><c> do</c><00:02:30.030><c> so</c><00:02:30.330><c> much</c><00:02:30.540><c> as</c><00:02:30.870><c> one</c><00:02:31.050><c> of</c><00:02:31.080><c> those</c>

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 align:start position:0%
