00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.030
 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.219
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.480
This is the eighth of 12
lectures on copyright.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.580
In the preceding lecture, I examined
two of the four major economic rights

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.400
associated with a copyright,
specifically the right to control

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.780
reproduction and the right to control
modifications of a copyrighted work.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.540
In this lecture, I'll examine the
other two major economic rights--

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.850
the right to control
distribution, and the right

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.000
to control public
performances and displays.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.350
As usual, I'll spend most of the
time discussing the law in the United

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250
States, but will also
indicate various issues

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.520
on which the law in
other countries differs.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.110
As always, I'll be
illustrating the presentation

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.010
with various audiovisual
materials, one of which

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.130
is a map of copyright law,
the current version of which

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.840
can be found on my
homepage, tfisher.org.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.140
 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.880
We'll begin with the
right of distribution.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.780
This aspect of copyright
law is characterized

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.890
by a clash between two
powerful sets of impulses.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.330
On one side are strong economic
interests of copyright owners.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.780
On the other side is an equally
powerful set of attitudes,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.030
hostile to the copyright
owners' yearning

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.810
for continuing control over
embodiments of their works.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.820
The tension between these
forces has generated

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.950
and will continue to generate strife
and periodic doctrinal eruptions.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.710
The interest of the
copyright owners are,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.520
as I say, strong for three reasons.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.470
They want to be able to control what
purchasers and possessor of copies

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.430
of their works do with those copies.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.700
The first, and least
important, of those reasons

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.490
is that such control supplements
the copyright owner's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.970
right of reproduction.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.320
Specifically, by enabling the
owners to attack intermediaries

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.180
who do not themselves
make unauthorized copies,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.110
but who traffic in unauthorized copies.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.590
In this sense, the distribution right is
analogous to the rules in criminal law

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.540
penalizing the receipt
of stolen property.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.620
The second, and more important
reason is that copyright owners

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.630
would like to suppress, if
possible, resales and lending

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.660
of copies of their works.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.430
In other words, they would like to
prevent the first purchaser of a copy

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850
from passing it on to others.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.170
Why?

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.390
Because the result would be
to increase demand for copies,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.740
and thus to enhance the
copyright owners income.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.730
For example, novelists would
like to be able to prevent

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.300
sales of used copies of their books.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.990
Movie studios would like
to prevent, or to charge

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.260
for resales or rentals of DVDs
embodying their works, and so forth.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.770
Third, copyright owners would
like to prevent arbitrage,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.760
which corrodes their ability to engage
in lucrative, differential pricing.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.050
This last point is both
complicated and important.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.660
I touched on it very briefly at
the end of lecture number four.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.170
I now want to discuss it in more detail.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.690
The following analysis
consists of a condensed version

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.080
of an argument deployed in much
more fine grain in an article

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.447
I wrote some years ago on this topic.

00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:31.280
If you're curious about
this phenomenon, you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.238
might wish to follow the
links on my home page.

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.860
 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.350
Differential pricing, otherwise
known as price discrimination,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.050
consists in the core case of charging
different consumers different prices

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.670
for access to the same good or service.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.980
A more subtle form of differential
pricing involves charging different

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.240
consumers different prices for different
versions of the same good or service

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.950
when the variation cannot be
explained by differences in the costs

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.380
of the versions.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.110
A familiar example of the core
case of differential pricing

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.060
is when a bus company or museum
charges lower entrance fees

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.709
to students or senior citizens than
it does to middle aged, non students.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.120
A familiar example of
the more subtle form

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320
is the practice of airlines to charge
vastly more for a business class seat

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.130
than for a coach class
seat for a given trip.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.540
Suppose, for example, that
I want to fly from Boston

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.860
to Los Angeles in the afternoon of
June 1, 2014, roughly three months

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.850
from right now.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.760
I prefer American Airlines, so I
visit the website of the company,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.130
and check for available
flights and prices.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.400
Flight 143, which departs at 4:30 in
the afternoon, suits my schedule well.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.750
I now have to choose a class.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.030
As you can see, there
are various options.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.030
But the major choice involves
where in the plane I will sit.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.730
Flight 143 uses the
Boeing 757-200 aircraft,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.280
which is configured as follows.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.530
So, if I want to sit in what's
known as the main cabin,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.790
I will pay $400 or $500.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.260
If I want to sit up
front, in first class,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.500
I'll pay more than three times as much.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.730
The difference between these prices
cannot be explained on the basis

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.500
of the extra costs associated
with a wide seat, better food,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.500
and more attentive service.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.750
Rather, it reflects primarily
the airline's shrewd effort

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.470
to capitalize on
differences in the price

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.790
sensitivity of the two
types of passengers.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.780
If I'm wealthy, or I'm able to rely on
the generous business expense account,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.430
I'll choose first class.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.790
If neither, I'll choose the main cabin.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.710
Price discrimination usually
increases the profits

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.950
of the firm that engages in it.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.300
Why, then, is it relatively uncommon?

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.610
Because, with rare exceptions, the
practice of price discrimination

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.430
is feasible only when
three conditions coincide.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.510
First, the firm ordinarily
must have market power.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.110
In other words, there must exist no
readily available, equally satisfactory

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.110
substitutes for the good or
service the firm is selling.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.420
Otherwise, customers from whom the
firm seeks to extract a high price,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.920
will defect to competitors.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.080
Next, the firm must be able to
differentiate among its customers

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.040
on the basis of the values they place
on the firm's product or service.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.070
Are several ways in which
this could be achieved.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.250
In what economists refer to as
first degree price discrimination,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.590
the firm gathers information
about individual buyers,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.060
and attempts to charge each
one the most that he or she

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.370
is able and willing to pay for
the good or service in question.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.300
In so-called second degree
price discrimination,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.510
the seller does not know how much
buyers are able willing to pay,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.750
but induces them to reveal their
resources or their preferences

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.650
through their purchasing decisions.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.790
Among the techniques of this sort
are volume discounts and versioning,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.665
such as the practice I
mentioned a minute ago

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:20.030
of differentiating business
class and coach tickets,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.280
and then charging radically
different prices for them.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.800
 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.630
In so-called third degree
price discrimination,

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.430
the seller does not know the
purchasing power of individual buyers,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.240
but is able to separate them into
groups that correspond roughly

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.830
to their wealth or eagerness.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.420
The student discounts and senior
discounts I mentioned previously

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.110
are examples.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.040
Opportunities to engage in first
degree price discrimination

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.440
have traditionally been
rare, but opportunities

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.267
for second and third degree
discrimination abound.

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:57.350
One area in which they're
proliferating especially

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.660
rapidly are the kinds of
the informational products

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.900
to which copyright law applies.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.130
Take software, for example.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.900
One of the ways in which software
firms seek to enhance their revenues

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.040
is by selling identical or
versioned copies of their products

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.250
to students for vastly
different prices than the prices

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.270
they charge professionals.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.270
Here's an illustration.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:27.000
As you can see, as of
today, February 23, 2014,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.750
Adobe's Creative Suite 6 is
ordinarily priced at $1,700,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.200
but is available to
students and teachers--

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:42.130
groups that tend to be poorer than
average-- for $590, a huge markdown.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.370
As I hope you recognize, this is
an example of third degree price

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.400
discrimination in which the
copyright owner uses a criterion

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.070
to separate set of potential
customers for its product

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:58.670
into two or more subgroups, which differ
roughly in their price sensitivity,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.700
and then charges the members of the
two groups very different prices.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.870
An example of second degree price
discrimination is the way in which book

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.010
publishers typically package
and release their products.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.670
In the usual case, a hardcover edition
is sold at a substantial price.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.200
And then a few months
later, or a few years later,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.600
a much cheaper paperback
version is released.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.270
For example, right now I'm reading
Scott Turow's novel Identical,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.640
the newest in a series of
excellent legal thrillers.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.640
I bought a hard cover copy of
this book about a month ago

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.130
from Amazon.com for $28.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.620
I could have obtained from Amazon a
paperback copy for a much lower price.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.590
But I would have had to wait
until July of this year to get it.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.700
The cost of manufacturing
a hardcover copy of a book

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.970
is not double the cost of
manufacturing a paperback copy.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:02.910
Rather, the sharp price difference
is a form of differential pricing.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.800
More specifically, this common marketing
practice, used by book publishers,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.950
combines two distinct price
discrimination schemes.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.500
The first is known as versioning,
just as was the case with respect

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.910
to business class versus
coach airline tickets.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.540
Publishers expect price
insensitive consumers, like me,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.100
to buy the premium-- in other words,
hardcover editions-- and poorer

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.310
consumers to prefer the economy model.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.620
The second strategy is sometimes known
as intertemporal price discrimination.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.790
The reason the publishers
do not ordinarily

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.870
release the paperback
editions at the same time

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.280
as the hardback editions is that they
don't want buyers who care little about

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:54.630
price but find paperbacks perfectly
acceptable to opt for paperbacks,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.010
so they wait until the market
consisting of wealthy consumers

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.710
has been pretty well exhausted
through sales of hardbacks

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.260
before putting the cheaper
versions on the shelves.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.830
 

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.560
The same composite strategy underlies
the so-called windowing system

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.370
through which most Hollywood movies,
at least until recently, were marketed.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.530
Typically, a firm was first
licensed for performances

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.030
in American movie theaters.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.210
Roughly three months later, it was
released both in foreign theaters

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.150
and through pay per view channels.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.740
Three months after that, DVD copies
were made available for sale and rental.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.360
After three more months, it was released
to premium cable television channels.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.160
A year later, it was shown on television
in countries outside the United States,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.756
and then on network television
inside the United States.

00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:52.740
And finally, after
another three years, it

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.310
was licensed to local
television syndicators.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.740
The price per viewing paid by
consumers in each of these windows

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.020
was lower than in the preceding window.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.080
Again, we see here a
combination of versioning,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.840
which prompts consumers to
sort themselves by format,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.990
and intertemporal
discrimination, whereby

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.140
the most price sensitive consumers
have to wait the longest.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.920
 

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.250
There are many more examples of price
discrimination by copyright owners,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.280
some of which we'll encounter
later in the course.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.600
But there remains one more
condition essential to the strategy.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.290
To engage in effective
price discrimination,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.250
the copyright owner must be able
to prevent, or at least to limit,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.720
arbitrage.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.700
In other words, it must
be able to stop customers

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.420
to whom it sells copies of its work
a low price from reselling them,

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.590
either directly or with
the aid of intermediaries,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.730
to customers from the firm is
seeking to extract a high price.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.450
If it can't do so, then
the copyright owner

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.920
forfeits its high margin
customers, which is disastrous.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.110
This is where the right to control
distribution comes into play.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.900
What copyright owners would
most like would be a legal right

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.550
to prevent altogether any
resales of copies of their works.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.020
Not just for the reason
we've already seen-- namely,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.440
that such a right would increase
demand for their products--

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.630
but also for the more subtle reason
that it would enhance their capacity

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.870
to charge different customers
different prices without worrying

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.140
that poor customers who bought
the copies for low prices

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.990
would resell them to rich
customers for intermediate prices,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.550
and thus corrode the high end market.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.330
To summarize, for three
reasons, copyright owners

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.990
would like strong rights to control
distribution of copies of their works.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.050
First, it would help them
to attack intermediaries

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.130
who traffic in unauthorized copies.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.280
Second, it would enhance demand
for copies of their works.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.850
And third, it would
enhance their ability

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.500
to engage in differential pricing.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.120
 

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.170
Opposed to these interests are not
only the obvious economic interest

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.510
of consumers, in
reducing the amount they

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.300
have to pay for access
to copyrighted works,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.690
but also three widely shared attitudes
hostile to the kind of control

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.820
the copyright owners seek.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.860
First, copyright owners who seek to
prevent resales or lending of copies

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.240
of their works are often seen as greedy.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.170
They've already been paid once when
a copy of their works was first sold.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.550
They're not morally entitled to more.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.150
This sentiment is loosely tied to
the principle of proportionality

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.880
that figures so prominently, as
we saw in lecture number two,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.680
in the fairness theory of copyright.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.270
Copyright owners, it is
widely thought, do not

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.750
deserve to collect
more revenue than they

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.410
receive from the first sale of copies.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:03.370
Exactly why not is unclear, but
this attitude is very common.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.440
Second, many people-- and
many lawyers in particular--

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.670
are skeptical of attempts to control
a thing after you've sold it.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.900
Viewing the same issue
from the other side,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.180
a widely shared attitude is that
once you have bought an object,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.950
you are entitled to do
with it whatever you want.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.850
Among the manifestations
of this sentiment

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.590
in the law is the bias against
restraints on alienation

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.540
of real property-- in other
words, land-- and the impediments

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.740
I mentioned once before to
servitudes, longstanding restrictions

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.720
on what people who buy
land can do on or with it.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.400
The same sentiment figures in the
debate over the Monsanto case,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.220
which was decided last year by the
United States Supreme Court, which

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.840
concerned the right of a purchaser
of seeds that contain genes

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.080
subject to patent protection
to grow crops from that seed,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.950
save some of the seeds
produced by those crops,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.570
and then use the saved
seed to grow more crops.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.030
The Monsanto case involved patent
and contract law, not copyright law,

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.890
so the complex legal issues
at issue in that case

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.770
are not pertinent to our subject here.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.880
But one of the general sentiments
expressed often in the public debate

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:26.080
over that case is that the farmer,
Vernon Bowman, having bought the seed,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.100
should be able to do
what he wants with it.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.100
The same sentiment tilts against
the interests of copyright owners

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.150
to control redistribution
of copies of their works.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.050
 

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.050
The third attitude is skepticism
concerning differential pricing.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.760
Now, this attitude is not universal.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.760
Some forms of differential
pricing-- for example,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.370
the practice of US private
universities of charging students

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.520
very different tuitions depending on the
financial resources of their families--

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.350
are accepted without much grumpiness.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:07.230
But other forms, even trivial
in amount, can provoke rage.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.420
Here's just one example.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.660
In the fall of 2000, Amazon.com began
to adjust the prices of a few DVDs,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.819
depending on the status
of the purchasers.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:23.050
It seems-- although most Amazon
representatives denied this--

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:29.380
that repeat customers, identifiable by
the Amazon cookies on their computers,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:35.450
were quoted higher prices for
films than were new customers.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.900
Presumably, Amazon thought the
new customers might shop around,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.680
and so offered them lower
prices to induce them to buy.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.190
When this practice was revealed
on an online DVD talk forum,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.490
the response of most
participants was fury.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.200
Quote, "I will never buy
another thing from those guys,"

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.510
declared one consumer.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.770
Surveys confirm the prevalence of the
sentiment that underlies this reaction.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.660
For, example in 2005,
the Annenberg Center

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.500
asked 1,500 adult internet
users some questions concerning

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.630
their views of online
marketing practices.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.530
87% disagreed with the
proposition that, quote,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.150
"It's OK if an online
store I use charges

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.720
different people different
prices for the same products

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.210
during the same hour," unquote.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.750
 

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.220
The way this attitude
bears on our subject today

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.720
is that, to the extent copyright
owners seek increased control

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.280
over the distribution of their works
in order to more effectively engage

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.810
in differential pricing,
they face strong-- though not

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.040
universal-- popular resistance.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.650
The tension between these competing
forces is managed to some degree

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.790
by a set of interlocking statutory
provisions, to which we'll now turn.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.550
 

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.810
The financial interests
of copyright owners

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:08.030
are protected by Section 106(3)
and 602(a) of the US Statute.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.930
The first of these, as you can
see, gives copyright owners

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.170
the exclusive right quote, "to
distribute copies or phonorecords

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.290
of the copyrighted work to the public
by sale or other transfer of ownership,

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.610
or by rental, lease, or lending."

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.370
602(a) gives copyright
owners analogous rights

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:33.750
to control importation and
exportation of copies of their works.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.800
Now, if these are the only
relevant statutory provisions,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.530
they would reflect total
victory by the copyright owners.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.190
But each of these provisions
is qualified by others.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.790
The right granted by 106(3)
is curtailed quite sharply

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.260
by 109(a), which, as you can
see provides that, quote,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.580
"the owner of a particular copy
or phonorecord lawfully made

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.660
under this title, or any other
person authorized by such owner,

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.470
is entitled to sell or otherwise
dispose of the possession of that copy

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.610
or phonorecord," close quote.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.800
This provision is widely known
as the first sale doctrine.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.960
The basic idea underlying that doctrine
is that once a copyright owner has sold

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.910
a copy, he cannot control
resales, gifts, et cetera.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.900
We'll return to the precise meaning
of this provision in a minute.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.130
The right to prevent unauthorized
importation of copies

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.700
is also qualified in various ways.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.610
Three specific exceptions
are listed on your screen.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:45.020
In addition, the way in
which 602(a) is phrased

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.980
leaves open the possibility
that it is qualified,

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.520
not just by these specific exemptions,
but also by the much broader first sale

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.172
doctrine embodied in 109(a).

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.180
How might this work?

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.910
Well, you'll notice that 602(a)
refers to unauthorized importation as,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.420
quote, "an infringement
of the exclusive right

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:11.860
to distribute copies under
Section 106," close quote.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.390
Section 106, in turn,
makes all the rights

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.740
it grants to copyright owners quote,
"subject to sections 107 through 122,"

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.570
close quote.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.480
Included in that list is 109(a),
which we've already seen.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.030
Through this chain of
connections, it's possible

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:34.600
that the first sale doctrine qualifies
the importation right, as well

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.450
as the right to control domestic
distribution of copies of the work.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.720
We'll return to this
textual nuance shortly.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.470
 

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.140
The first sale doctrine
embodied in section 109(a)

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.470
is itself subject to exceptions.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:54.150
Specifically, to the
provisions of 109(b)(1)(a).

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.840
The key language is, quote, "neither
the owner of a particular phonorecord,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.980
nor any person in possession of a
particular copy of a computer program,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.010
may, for the purposes of a direct
or indirect commercial advantage,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:13.110
dispose of that phonorecord or computer
program by rental, lease, or lending,"

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.020
close quote.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.010
The primary purpose
of this provision was

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.760
to shut down stores that,
at the time of its adoption,

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.640
were renting audio CDs to
customers who would then

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.340
copy the sound recordings on those CDs
to the hard drives of their computers,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.650
return the CDs to the
stores, and thereby avoid

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.590
the cost of buying CDs of their own.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:42.110
As you can see, this exception is
subject to exceptions of its own.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.500
So graphically, the relationship
among these various provisions

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.890
might be represented as follows--
106(3) and the primary portion

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:57.530
of 602(a) advance the
interests of copyright owners.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:04.130
109(a) and 602(a) (1-3)
establish limits on those rights,

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.420
giving expression to the
sentiments opposed to the copyright

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.760
owner's interests.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.820
109(b)(1)(a) reinstates
a portion of 106(3),

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.970
with respect to some
categories of works.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.410
109(b)(1)(b) tempers that reinstatement.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.390
As I hope you can see, from
the diagram on your screen,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.120
this combination of
statutory provisions seeks

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.470
to manage the deep tension
between the competing

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.580
forces that shape this field of the law.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.940
But the statute is not precise
enough to resolve all issues.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:45.300
The result is that there's lots of
litigation along this fault line.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.320
I'll describe two sets
of cases of this sort.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.230
Others will likely come
up in the discussions

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.396
that accompany this lecture.

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:54.210
 

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:59.140
The reason why the relationship between
109(a) and 602(a) is so important

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.010
is that it determines the
power of copyright owners

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.190
to engage in international
geographic price discrimination.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.340
In other words, to sell
copies of their works

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.110
at high prices to customers in the
United States, and at lower prices

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.300
to customers in poorer countries.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.490
In lecture number three, I mentioned
one among the many companies that

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.010
engage in this practice, Omega watch.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.400
Here's a brief reminder.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:30.000
Omega has obtained a US copyright
on the design shown on your screen.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.480
Omega engraves a version of this
logo on the underside of its watches.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.650
Omega sells those watches
all over the world.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.450
Typically, it sells them for
lower prices in poor countries

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.880
than in the United States.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.840
Some years ago, Costco, a discount
retailer using an intermediary,

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.430
purchased some of the watches that Omega
had sold cheaply outside the United

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.620
States, imported them
into the United States,

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.290
and then began selling
them in its US stores

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:03.710
for prices lower than those used
by Omega's authorized US dealers.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:07.530
Omega brought suit
against Costco, contending

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:15.130
that the so-called parallel importation
violated Omega's copyright in the logo.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.050
Now Costco had a
seemingly strong defense.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.660
In an earlier case, called
Quality King vs Lanza,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.660
the United States Supreme Court
held that 109(a) did indeed

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:32.480
limit the reach of 602(a), with the
result that a copyright owner could not

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:39.120
block importation of copies that he or
it had sold outside the United States.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.950
However, Quality King involved so-called
round trip parallel importation.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.720
In other words, a situation in which
the copies of the work in question

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.960
were lawfully manufactured
in the United States,

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.790
shipped overseas, sold at low
prices there, bought overseas

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.030
by an arbitrageur, and then
imported by the arbitrageur

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.130
back into the United States, where
they were sold for prices lower

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.340
than those charged by
authorized US dealers.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.700
Omega, relying on a concurring opinion
by Justice Ginsburg in the Quality King

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.950
case, pointed out that its
situation was different.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.090
The watches that bore
its copyrighted logo,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.180
and thus the copies of
the logos themselves,

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.260
were not first made
in the United States.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.100
They were manufactured in Switzerland.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:35.340
As a result, Omega argued, 109(a)
did not bar its claim against Costco

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.885
because 109(a) only applies, as
you can see, to copies quote,

00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:43.630
"lawfully made under this title."

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:48.830
The phrase, "this title," refers
to title 17 of the US Code,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.820
namely, the US Copyright statute.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.370
Omega argued that, because the
watches were not made in the US,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:02.170
they were not made under the US statute,
and thus the provision did not apply.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:07.020
And thus Omega had a right, under
602, to block unauthorized importation

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.110
of the watches bearing the
logo into the United States.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.040
It's a clever argument, and it worked.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.380
The Court of Appeals for the
9th Circuit agreed with Omega,

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.760
ruling that the first sale doctrine
applies to copies manufactured

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.370
outside the United States only if
an authorized first sale occurs

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.280
within the United States.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.290
Costco asked the Supreme Court
to review the case, which it did.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.260
But the Supreme Court was
unable to resolve the question.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.950
Four justices sided with
Costco, four with Omega,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.870
and Justice Kagan recused herself.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.010
The result is that the
lower court's ruling stood.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.180
In other words, Omega won.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.330
But the main issue had not
been definitively resolved.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.970
 

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.120
Last year, in the Kirtsaeng
case, the Supreme Court

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.730
was provided a second opportunity
to address this issue.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.230
The essential facts of that
case were straightforward.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.940
Supap Kirtsaeng was born in Thailand,
but educated in the United States.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.910
In 2007, he was studying for a
Ph.D. In mathematics at UCLA.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.380
Like many students, he had discovered
that copies of the English language

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.930
textbooks could be purchased more
cheaply abroad than in the United

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.020
States.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.020
Kirtsaeng decided to
capitalize on this fact

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.990
in order to finance
his graduate education.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:34.970
He asked his relatives in Thailand to
buy there large quantities of textbooks

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:39.300
of various sorts, and ship
them to him in California.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.640
He then resold the books to US
students for prices below the rates

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.520
that the publishers were
charging in the United States--

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.670
well above the prices in Thailand.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.260
He was thus able to repay his relatives
and keep a substantial amount of money

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.150
for himself.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.720
This system enabled him, in short order,
to earn roughly a million dollars.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.540
Enough to finance his graduate
education and then some.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.300
At this point, you're
probably wondering,

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.870
wasn't Kirtsaeng aware of the
legal risk he was running?

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.830
After all, the copies of
the books he was importing

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.070
bore clear warnings that
his conduct was unlawful,

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.340
like the warning shown on your screen.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.860
He might have thought that
he, like many students,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.640
could avoid the wrath of the publishers
if he operated on a small scale.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.080
But did he think that he could sell
a million of books with impunity?

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.880
Apparently, yes.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.100
In making that judgment, he relied
on advice from his relatives

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.340
in Thailand, and upon the website
Google Answers, which assured him

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:46.570
that he could legally resell the
foreign additions in the United States.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.450
In the short term, Kirtsaeng's
reliance on that advice proved foolish.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.990
One of the publishers, John
Wiley, brought suit against him,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.460
contending that unauthorized
importation of the books

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.190
constituted copyright infringement.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.220
Because all of the books in question
had been manufactured and first sold

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.620
by Wiley's wholly owned subsidiary
outside the United States,

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:14.750
Wiley could and did point to
the Omega decision for support.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.760
Wiley prevailed in the
trial court, and then

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.150
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:24.260
Kirtsaeng asked the Supreme Court
to review the case, which agreed.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.460
The stakes were very high.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.110
Not just book publishers,
but the sellers and buyers

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.100
of all copyrighted materials
distributed at different prices

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.139
in different countries would
be affected by the outcome.

00:30:36.139 --> 00:30:37.930
As one might imagine,
the Supreme Court was

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:43.820
deluged with briefs from organization
with stakes in one result or another.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.340
This legal battle was paralleled
by a struggle for dominance

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.300
in the so-called court
of public opinion.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.182
Here's one Foray into
that war, sponsored

00:30:53.182 --> 00:30:54.640
by the groups supporting Kirtsaeng.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:06.540
 

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.560
I think that once you've bought an
item, you should be able to do with it

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.330
what you want.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.760
If you want to resell it,
that should be up to you.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.662
Because I paid money for
it, and gosh dang it,

00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:18.620
I should be able to do
whatever I want with it.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.820
I don't own anything,
I'm just borrowing things

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.490
from a company for a long time,
which seems to be outrageous.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.800
How can they tell you that
you don't own what you buy?

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.300
You used your own money to buy that.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.992
I think that would be totally
unfair, and against capitalism.

00:31:30.992 --> 00:31:32.950
I would say it would be
important to everybody,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.760
because that's just the way of America.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.440
We buy, we sell, we trade.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.590
Country boundaries aren't
what they once were.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.410
So, of course, you should be able
to buy and sell things, regardless

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.830
of where you get them from.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.840
Of course, of course.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.027
Because most of the things I've got
on now are made from someplace else.

00:31:50.027 --> 00:31:52.610
I'd be very highly upset and
pissed off due to the simple fact

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.790
that they're trying to tell
me what to do with an item.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.890
It'll affect everybody.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:03.445
Anybody that has a power to purchase
now will be impacted by this.

00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:06.090
For one thing, in college
books, it would be a killer.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.460
It's already so expensive
to go to college

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.220
that you should be able to use
whatever textbooks we want,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.820
wherever we got them, without
having the threat of the government

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.710
telling us that that's
not appropriate to use.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.619
It really hurts the consumers.

00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:22.910
I'm really about the consumers
because I' m a consumer.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.290
That seems to add a whole new
level of administration that's

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.100
going to cost millions
and millions of dollars.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.530
And that's just all that
money going into having

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.520
to ask someone if you wants
to sell your own things?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.210
That seems silly.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:41.470
Just thinking of kind of the
gravity of what that would mean.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.950
It would piss me off a little bit.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.640
If I want to buy it, I'll buy it.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.100
If I want to sell it, I'll sell it.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.683
It's my right.

00:32:48.683 --> 00:32:55.990
 

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:00.170
Perhaps moved in part by sentiments
like these, the Supreme Court,

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.280
in the Kirtsaeng case--
somewhat to my surprise--

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.060
reversed the ruling of
the lower court, holding

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.830
that one way parallel importation,
like round trip parallel importation,

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:15.380
is privileged by section 109.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.150
The heart of the court's rationale
was that the statutory phrase

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.870
quote, "lawfully made under
this title," close quote,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.780
is not a geographic limitation.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.120
So long as copies of a work are made
with the authorization of the copyright

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.740
holder, they are, in the
Supreme Court's judgment,

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.430
lawfully made under this title.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.040
The decision by the Supreme
Court is widely and rightly

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.800
regarded as a win for at least some
consumers in the United States,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.370
who may, as a result of the ruling,
be able to obtain copyrighted

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.750
materials more cheaply.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.470
On the other hand, the
decision disadvantages

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.220
the residents of poor countries.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.060
The reason is that the sellers
of copyrighted materials

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.130
are likely, in the future, to
find it somewhat harder to engage

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.050
in international geographic
price discrimination.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.880
If so, how will they respond?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.980
One option, of course, will be to
reduce the prices of their goods

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.239
in the United States.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:17.330
If their markets are poor countries
are large enough, they may do that.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.989
But it's at least as likely that they
will increase the prices of their goods

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:24.510
in poor countries, thus
disadvantaging consumers there.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.020
 

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.760
So returning to our
chart, the ruling in Omega

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.409
has now been superseded by
the ruling in Kirtsaeng.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:39.020
The struggle over this issue
is probably not finished.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.749
Copyright owners, most of whom
are unhappy with this outcome,

00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:46.889
are already seeking to change the law,
either through an amendment of the US

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.440
Copyright statute, or through
adoption of a treaty provision that

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.659
would compel the United States and
all other members of the treaty,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.060
to amend the statute.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:01.490
Indeed, they're likely to seek not
just a return to the Omega rule--

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:06.570
which would forbid unauthorized one way
parallel importation-- but elimination

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.620
or qualification of the earlier ruling
in Quality King, which, as you recall,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.280
authorized round trip
parallel importation.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.440
Stay tuned.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.760
But for the time being,
here's where the law stands.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:30.020
OK, that's one of the zones of
ongoing litigation on this fault line.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.500
There's another volcano.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.400
Autodesk makes CAD software.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.880
In other words, computer
aided design programs.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.000
Its main product is known as AutoCAD.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.460
It distributes AutoCAD in the old
fashioned way-- namely, on CD-ROMs.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.010
Just as we saw with
Adobe, AutoCAD engages

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.340
in explicit price discrimination.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.050
As you can see from this
slide, it sells the program

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.760
to commercial users, presumably
architects, for very high prices.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.830
It then uses various
techniques to sell the program

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.930
to other groups, such as
students, for much lower prices.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.340
One of those techniques is versioning.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.360
For example, as you can
see from this slide,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.640
a student edition-- presumably a
de-tuned edition-- of the program

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.870
is available for less than
5% of the commercial version.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.510
 

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:29.360
Another technique that Autodesk employs
to facilitate price discrimination

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.330
is contract.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.420
In other words, the company
seeks to impose upon customers

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.990
various restrictions on
what they're permitted

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.990
to do with the copies of
the programs they buy.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:46.080
In the 1990s, those restrictions
included the following.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.500
First, Autodesk retains
title to all copies.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:56.220
Second, Autodesk grants the customer a
nonexclusive, non-transferable license

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.580
to use the software.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.550
Third, the purchaser agrees to
refrain from various activities,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.890
including reverse
engineering the software,

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.980
or using it outside
the Western hemisphere.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.740
Fourth, the purchaser agrees to
destroy copies of the software

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.360
within 60 days of the time
the purchaser upgrades it.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.570
Among other things,
these restrictions sought

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:26.060
to destroy the secondary
market for copies of AutoCAD.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.560
In 1999, a company called CTA
acquired, through legitimate channels,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.160
10 copies of the 14th
release of AutoCAD.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.680
Some months later, CTA paid
a modest fee for an upgrade

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.460
to obtain the 15th
release of the program.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.460
But instead of destroying its
copies of the 14th release,

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.060
CTA sold them to a
man named Vernor, who,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.490
in turn, offered them for sale on eBay.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.960
Vernor was a pure intermediary.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.490
He signed no contract with Autodesk and
never installed or used the software.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:05.800
His only ambition was to
resell the copies at a profit.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.510
Autodesk got wind of
this plan, and sought

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:11.400
to block the eBay sales
on the ground but they

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.910
would violate Autodesk's
exclusive right under 106(3)

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.480
to distribute copies of the program.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.900
Vernor contended that the sales in
question were privileged under 109(a).

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.070
So here's how the competing
parties told their stories

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:31.290
and described their legal implications.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:36.190
Vernor conceded that Autodesk
had a valid copyright in AutoCAD.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:41.420
Exercising its exclusive right under
106(1) to reproduce the software,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.720
Autodesk made a copy on a CD-ROM.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.400
Exercising its exclusive right under
106(3) to distribute that copy,

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.680
Autodesk then sold it to CTA.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.750
CTA then exercised its
privilege, under 109(a),

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:02.560
to resell the validly acquired copy
to Vernor, who, similarly, relied

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.750
on 109(a) in seeking to resell the
copy through eBay to another buyer.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:13.160
As Vernor told the tale, every step in
this process, including the last one,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.040
was lawful.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.970
Autodesk, not surprisingly,
saw things differently.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.310
Steps one and two were just
as Vernor described them.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:26.590
But instead of selling
the copy to CTA, Autodesk

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:33.650
contended that it merely leased the copy
to CTA in return for various promises.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:39.330
CTA then purported to sell to
Vernor a copy it did not know,

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:44.730
because 109(a) only applies to, quote,
"the owner of a particular copy,"

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.660
close quote.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.760
It did not shield this transaction.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.730
The purported resale thus violated
Autodesk's distribution rights

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.040
under 106(3).

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.310
For the same reason, this last
transaction was not shielded by 109(a).

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:05.520
Vernor was no more an owner
of the copy than was CTA.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.180
Thus, selling the copy on
eBay also violated 106(3).

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:17.215
In sum, according to Autodesk, both this
transaction and this one were unlawful.

00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:19.730
 

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.950
The key issue in the case thus
became whether the relationship

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:27.470
between Autodesk and CTA
had been a lease or a sale.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:32.610
Vernor, of course, preferred
the latter, Autodesk the former.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:35.160
In 2010, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.050
ruled in Autodesk's favor.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:42.250
Here's the decisive portion
of the court's opinion.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.830
We hold today that a software
user is a licensee, rather than

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:52.200
an owner of a copy, where the copyright
owner, one, specifies that the user is

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.660
granted a license, two,
significantly restricts the user's

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.770
ability to transfer the
software, and, three,

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.770
imposes notable use restrictions.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.790
The way in which this decision
fits into the overall landscape

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:13.950
of the law governing distribution
rights is indicated on the map.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:18.620
It's reasonably well settled
that, using Nimmer's typology,

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.970
a transaction involving a
copy of a copyrighted work

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:26.560
is covered by 109(a), and
thus lawful, if and only

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.890
if four conditions are satisfied.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.100
A, a copy was lawfully manufactured
with the authorization of the copyright

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.220
owner.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.210
B, the copy was transferred under
the copyright owner's authority.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:45.790
C, the defendant qualifies as the
lawful owner of that particular copy.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:49.960
And D, the defendant thereupon
disposed of that particular copy,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.560
as opposed to, for
example, reproducing it.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.780
When software firms provide
customers copies of their programs

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.330
in return for money,
requirements A and B

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:03.170
are more or less
automatically satisfied.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.140
However, if the software
firm adds to the transaction

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.650
enough conditions to make the deal
appear to be a lease of a copy,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:17.440
and thus not a sale, then
requirement c is not satisfied.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:23.300
And as a result, the customer does not
have a privilege to resell that copy.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.910
This option is highly beneficial
to software firms for two reasons.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.870
First, by suppressing
resales of copies, it

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.280
enables the firms to sell
more original copies.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.480
Second, it helps the
firm suppress arbitrage

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.250
of copies sold cheaply
to students and so forth,

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.220
and thus protects the
firm's primary markets,

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.900
consisting of adult or commercial users.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.420
The result, as you might expect,
makes the software firms happy,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.650
but makes their customers
much less happy.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:57.090
Again, a highly technical
ruling, which locates

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:01.070
this particular transaction on one
side rather than the other of the fault

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.630
line, has large economic implications.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.470
 

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.540
This concludes our analysis
of the rights of distribution.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.560
After the break, we'll turn
to the even more intricate set

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.920
of rules governing public performances.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.459
