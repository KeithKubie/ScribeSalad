00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.010
Want 100% efficiency electronics?

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.090
How about levitating transportation?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.110
Faster supercomputers?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.510
Duh-duh-nuh-nuh!!!

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.219
Superconductors to the rescue!

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.980
As long as the world you live in is close
to absolute zero, that is.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.790
See, superconductors are materials with all
of these amazing potential applications...but

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.550
the conditions required for them to work are
pretty extreme.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.960
It’s gonna take a LOT of work to get us
closer to a world where we could use superconductors

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.039
on the daily...and new research has gotten
us just a little closer.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.570
Simply put, a superconductor is a material
that electricity can flow through without

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.640
losing energy along the way.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.469
It’s a material with no resistance, it doesn’t
diminish an electric current as the current

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.789
passes through it.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.710
The microscopic structure of a superconductor
is like a uncongested highway, letting electrons

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.819
travel through the material with ease.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.769
Which is HUGE, right?

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.379
That means they can conduct electricity more
efficiently than any other material.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.390
Imagine, electricity buzzing along superconducting
wires without losing any energy to But these

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.230
materials don’t just get their powers from
their particular microscopic structure.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.500
They also have to be really, really frickin’
cold.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.330
Like, many hundreds of negative degrees celsius.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.250
So that kinda cools off a lot of the hype
around them.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.000
See, a material’s conductivity either increases
or decreases with a rise in temperature, depending

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.540
on what kind of material it is.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.500
The conductivity of semiconductors and insulators
increases with higher temperature because

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.530
more electrons are freed up to joint the current,
whereas for conductors, conductivity increases

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.710
as temperature goes down.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.110
At colder temperatures, there are less thermal
vibrations that get in the way of those electrons

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.890
and keep them from traveling through the material
efficiently.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.360
Ultra high pressures are also good at keeping
things still enough for electrons to pass

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.800
through with less trouble.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.700
If we could use superconductors in electronics,
those devices would theoretically run at perfect

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.450
or near perfect efficiency--they would output
the same amount of energy that’s put into

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.450
them.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.720
That would be SUPER useful, you can imagine,
when trying to get electricity into your home.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.369
In the US we lose about 5-6% of our electricity
every year during transmission from the grid

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.790
to your house because of issues like resistance.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.140
That’s about as much energy as it would
take to power about 23 million homes for a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
year.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.550
What a waste, right?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.010
If that electricity was travelling via superconductor,
we wouldn’t lose any along the way.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.480
Think about it another way--you could power
a supercomputer without losing any energy

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.370
to heat, meaning you would have a supercomputer
you could do more with--more calculations,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.520
more speed, with less energy input because
you wouldn’t have to cool it off.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.980
They also do a really cool thing where if
you put them next to a strong magnet, the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.620
magnet causes the superconductor to have its
own, opposite magnetic field.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.490
Making the superconductor levitate above the
magnet!

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.730
Superconductors and their magnetic capabilities
are already used in important medical technology

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.099
like MRIs, which help doctors see inside your
body.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.630
But there’s a reason getting an MRI is so
expensive--and it’s because the machine

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.630
itself is so expensive.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.060
And that’s partly because the superconductor
inside of it has to be kept so.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.060
Dang.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.060
Chilly.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.270
So it’d be pretty amazing if we could make
a superconductor that works at room temperature,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.270
right?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.360
So far, the material that’s achieved superconductivity
closest to room temperature is a rare hydrogen

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.090
sulphur compound that maintains its properties
at up to steamy -70 degrees celsius...but

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.209
that’s only because it was at a pressure
over a million times the one we comfortably

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.209
live at.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.209
But.

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.209
Despair not.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.940
An exciting new research project has unveiled
new materials that get us closer to the goal

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.690
of superconductors that we could use in real
life--y’know at room temperature and pressure.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.260
The team of Russian, American, and Chinese
scientists has now successfully created several

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.990
new species of uranium hydride.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.240
Although these U-H materials were made under
extreme pressures, the researchers showed

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.760
that the compounds remained stable at much
more reasonable pressures--close to atmospheric.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.980
AND the researchers predict that the characteristics
of these compounds they’ve observed so far

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.180
mean that eventually, an improved version
of uranium hydrides could be superconducting

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.270
at room temperature.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.990
No big deal!

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.340
Just as a little extra dash of awesome, the
fact that they were able to predict the existence

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.880
and behaviors of these compounds and successfully
verify those predictions with their experiments

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.020
means that their predictive capabilities are
pretty solid...meaning they could use the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.630
same methods to explore other promising materials
to keep searching for the superconductor that

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.590
could bring us into the future of technology,
without the limitations of the icebox.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.610
Fun fact: Several cities in Japan, Korea,
and China already use superconducting technology

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.580
in MagLev trains.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.280
These trains can reach super high speeds because
there’s no friction of the train on the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.700
track--because the train is floating ABOVE
the track.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.720
