00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.827
- [Voiceover] Naoya read
a book cover to cover

00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:06.356
in a single session, at a
rate of 55 pages per hour.

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:08.713
55 pages per hour.

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:12.684
After reading for four hours,
after reading for four hours,

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:16.050
he had 330 pages left to read.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.954
How long is the book in pages and how long

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.252
did it take Naoya to read the entire book?

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:23.698
Well there's a bunch of ways
that we could approach this.

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:26.656
Like always, pause the video
and try to figure it out.

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:28.955
But I will go with one
way first, and then maybe

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.685
I'll tackle it another way.

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.355
So one way is, let's just
set up a little table here.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:36.791
And on one column, let's think about,

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:39.856
let's think about how long Naoya has read

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.888
in hours, so we'll just call that "time."

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:43.850
"T" for time in hours.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.718
This is how long he has
read, and in this column,

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:48.884
this is how much he has left to read.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.961
So let's just write
that "L," left to read.

00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.654
And then this is going
to be given in pages.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.580
This is going to be given in pages.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.856
So lets see, we don't know at zero hours,

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:02.526
we don't know how many
pages he has left to read,

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:05.584
at, if we knew that, at zero
hours, before he's read,

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:07.750
the pages left to read, that's
gonna be the entire book.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.526
So that would answer this
question, "How long is the book?"

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:12.419
So this is gonna be interesting.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:14.288
We don't know what happens at one hour,

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:17.121
after two hours, after three hours.

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.638
But they do tell us, that
after reading for four hours,

00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:23.889
after reading for four
hours, he had 330 pages

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.352
left to read.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:30.352
So after four hours, he had 330 pages,

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:34.211
330 pages left to read.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.647
So, based on this, and the fact that

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:40.480
he's reading at 55 pages per hour,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.684
can we back up to figure out all of this?

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.088
Well remember, every hour that goes by,

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:49.988
every hour that goes by,
he has read 55 pages.

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:52.392
So if he's read 55
pages, remember this 330,

00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:54.516
this isn't how many pages he's read,

00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:56.606
this is how many he has left to read.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:02:00.995
So after every hour he has
55 fewer pages to read.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.756
So at three hours, he should
have 55 more pages to read.

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:08.181
So this should be, at
three hours, 330 plus 55

00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:10.863
would be 385.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.721
Now let's see whether this makes sense.

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.275
So when our change in time, this triangle

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.725
is just the Greek letter
Delta, means "change in."

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:21.452
When our change in time is
plus one, plus one hour,

00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:25.619
our change in pages left
to read is going to be

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:29.973
equal to negative 55 pages.

00:02:29.973 --> 00:02:32.353
And that makes sense,
the pages left to read

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:34.629
goes down every hour.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.417
We're measuring not how much he's read,

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.820
we're measuring how much
he has left to read.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.140
So that should go down
by 55 pages every hour.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.056
Or if we were to go
backwards through time,

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:45.287
it should go up.

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:48.456
So at two hours he should
have 55 more pages to read.

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:51.394
So what's 385 plus 55?

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:56.394
We'll let's see, 385 plus
5 is 390, plus 50 is 440.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.063
So he'd have 440 pages, and
all I did is I added 55.

00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:03.985
And then, after reading for one hour,

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:05.791
he would have 55 more pages than after

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:07.886
reading for two hours.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.839
So 440 plus 55 is 495.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:14.728
And then before he started reading,

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.226
or right when he started reading,

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:18.548
he would have had to
read even 55 more pages,

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:21.323
'cause after one hour, he
would have read those 55 pages.

00:03:21.323 --> 00:03:26.323
So 495 plus 55 is going to be, let's see,

00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:28.870
it's gonna be, add 5, you get to 500

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.991
plus another 50 is 550 pages.

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:36.287
So at time equals zero
had had 550 pages to read.

00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.283
So that's how long the book is.

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:42.022
But how long does it take
Naoya to read the entire book?

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.055
Well we could keep going.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.307
We could say, "Okay, at the fifth hour,

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:47.780
"this thing's gonna go down by 55."

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.253
So let's see, if this goes down by 50,

00:03:50.253 --> 00:03:54.851
if this goes down by 50,
we're going to get to 280,

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:56.488
but then you go down five more, it's

00:03:56.488 --> 00:03:59.774
gonna go to 275, and we could keep going

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:01.155
on and on and on.

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:02.653
Or we could just say, "Look."

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:06.124
"He's got 330 pages left
to read, and he's gonna,"

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.086
Let's see, let me write this,
let me write the units down.

00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:13.086
"Pages, and he's reading at
a rate of 55 pages per hour,

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.293
"pages per hour, this is the same thing,

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:21.554
"this is going to be equal to 330 pages

00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:26.554
"times one over 55 hours per page."

00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:31.321
I'm dividing by something,
the same thing as

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.874
multiplying by its reciprocal, so 55 pages

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.720
per hours, if you divide by that,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.554
that's the same thing as multiplying by

00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:42.513
1/55th of an hour per page,
is one way to think about it.

00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:43.314
And so what do you get?

00:04:43.314 --> 00:04:45.961
The pages cancel out,
pages divided by pages,

00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:49.688
and you have 330 divided by 55 hours.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:54.518
330 divided by 55 hours.

00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:55.690
And what's that going to be?

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.757
Let's see, 30 divided by 5 is 6,

00:04:57.757 --> 00:05:00.683
300 divided by 50 is 6,
so this is going to be

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:02.053
equal to 6 hours.

00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:03.353
Now we have to be very
careful, you might want

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:05.545
to write six hours here, but this is

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:07.960
six hours after this point.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.293
Six hours after that point.

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.161
So in total, it's going
to take him ten hours.

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:15.053
At four hours, he had
330 pages left to read

00:05:15.053 --> 00:05:16.423
and then there was six more hours to

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:18.490
finish those 330 pages.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.649
So it's gonna take a total of ten hours.

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.623
And we could also see if this makes sense.

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:27.615
If he reads 550 pages in ten hours,

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:32.615
If he reads 550 pages in ten hours,

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.520
in ten hours, what's his rate of reading?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.958
Well, 550 divided by 10, that's gonna be

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:43.958
the same thing as 55 pages per hour.

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:46.249
Which is consistent
with what we just read,

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.616
that he reads at 55 pages per hour.

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.323
Now another way that you
could have tackled this,

00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:52.351
you could say, "Hey, this in gonna be

00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.826
"a linear equation!"

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.881
If you're well versed
with your linear equations

00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:58.279
you could say, "Look, he's
reading at a constant rate."

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.754
And if we're talking about, let's say,

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:00.891
let me just set up a function here,

00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:04.456
we could say left to read,
as a function of time,

00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:07.486
is going to be equal to,
he's reading at a rate of

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:10.412
55 pages per hour, so the
amount he's left to read

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:13.210
is gonna go down by 55 pages per hour.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.210
So it's gonna go down
55, 55 pages every hour.

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:21.557
So you could write it like that, plus it's

00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:23.786
whatever the initial number of pages were.

00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.888
Plus whatever the initial
number of pages were.

00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:27.293
And then you could use this information

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:29.417
right over here to solve for b.

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.053
We know that when time
is equal to four hours,

00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:34.653
we know that when, let
me do it in that color.

00:06:34.653 --> 00:06:38.090
We know that when time
is equal to four hours,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.526
that the pages left to read are 330.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.953
Pages left to read are 330, and so you get

00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:48.953
330 is equal to, let's
see, negative 55 times 4 is

00:06:49.293 --> 00:06:50.989
negative 220.

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:55.087
Negative 220 plus,

00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:58.117
negative 220 plus b,

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:01.914
plus b, and then if you
add 220 to both sides,

00:07:01.914 --> 00:07:06.488
220, add 220, to both
sides, you're going to

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:08.392
be left with, on this
side, you're gonna get

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:13.291
550 is equal to, these cancel
out, they add up to zero,

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:14.719
is equal to b.

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.020
And so the function
that describes how much

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.191
he has left to read,
the amount he has left

00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.524
to read is a function
of time, is, well he's

00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:22.452
reading 55 pages per hour, so the amount

00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:24.390
he has left to read's
gonna go down every hour,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.318
that's why we have that negative there.

00:07:26.318 --> 00:07:29.615
So the negative 55 pages per hour,

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:34.352
times the number of hours, plus 550.

00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:37.161
So if someone said, "Well
how long is the book?"

00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:39.221
Well that's going to be L of zero.

00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:40.591
That's going to be how many pages

00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:42.553
he has left to read at time zero.

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:46.153
And we see that L of
zero is going to be 550.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:48.927
When T is equal to zero,
let me write this down,

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:53.455
L of zero is going to be equal to 550.

00:07:53.455 --> 00:07:55.789
When T is equal to zero,
this term goes away

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:57.983
and you just have 550 pages.

00:07:57.983 --> 00:08:01.025
And, just like that,
we could have answered

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:02.615
this question.

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.520
And then you could say,
"Well look, if the book

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.956
"is 550 pages, and if he's
reading at 55 pages per hour,

00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:09.581
"how many hours is it gonna take?"

00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:13.018
Well 550 pages divided
by 55 pages per hour

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:14.794
is going to get you 10 hours.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.095
And we could have done that here actually,

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:16.919
now that I think about it.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:19.112
Instead of saying 330
pages divided by 55 pages

00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:20.626
per hour, and say ,"Hey,
that's gonna take us

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:22.620
"six more hours from this point."

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.419
We already knew this,
and we could have said,

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:26.994
"Look, if we have 550 pages to read,

00:08:26.994 --> 00:08:29.083
"and we're reading at 55 pages per hour,

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:30.918
"it's gonna take us ten hours."

00:08:30.918 --> 00:08:32.624
So you see, there's a
ton of different ways

00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:33.659
to solve these problems.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.958
And they're all really,
at the end of the day,

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.194
representing the same thing.

00:08:36.194 --> 00:08:38.389
That's what's neat about mathematics.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:42.255
They're just ways of representing how to

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.822
think about things, and
at the end of the day

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:46.690
we're really just thinking
about the same problem,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.058
just representing it with different ways

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:51.087
and different symbols.
