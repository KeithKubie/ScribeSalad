KAREN MAY: It is a terrific
honor and pleasure for me

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.100
to be able to be here with all
of you and with you, Ed, today.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.140
I'm Karen May.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.940
I lead our People
Development Team.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.910
AUDIENCE: Wo-hoo!

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.660
KAREN MAY: Wo-hoo!

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.450
But way more
importantly than that,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.670
I am a lifetime student of
organizational behavior,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.290
organizational development,
how in the world

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.330
we can function better
in this world as people,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.160
and a lifelong
student of yours, Ed.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.659
So I'm thrilled to
be able to be here.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.880
And I know I'm joined here
today by a group of people

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.130
who are also deeply
interested in your work

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.020
and in the work of
organizational development

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.780
and fundamentally how
people and organizations can

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.930
be more effective, more
effective together,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.430
and can reach both individual
and collective real potential.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.060
And we are joined not only
by these folks physically,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.440
but by any number
of people virtually

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.420
who are joining us
live stream and/or who

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.960
will be watching us later.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.630
So we'll keep them
in mind as we go.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.334
If you are joining on live
stream, there is a Dory--

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:24.042
go/EdSchein-Dory.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:29.700
And if you didn't know
how to spell Ed Schein,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.199
you wouldn't be on
this live stream,

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.440
so I'm not even going
to bother with that.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.390
So feel free to pop in a Dory
question if you're live stream.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050
At about a half an
hour in, Kathy Chen

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.660
will be managing
the Dory with me

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.970
and will be reading out
some of your questions.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.240
If you're here in the
room, we have a mic.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620
And we'll ask that, when you do
have a live question, that you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.390
use the mic so that those
who are joining us virtually

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.790
can hear the response.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.260
And, as I say, it's an honor
to be here with you today, Ed,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.890
and to be joined by
people who know share

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.190
such common interests with us.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.830
And in the spirit of your work,
I'd like to start with a very

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.445
open-ended question--

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:18.700
ED SCHEIN: Sure.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.790
KAREN MAY: --and ask you who
you are here today with us.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.390
ED SCHEIN: Well, I'm, first of
all, very pleased to be here.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.710
This is my third
visit to Google.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.970
And they are always
fascinating visits.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.560
It's almost like
age meets youth.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.700
And I think one of the things
that is me is curiosity,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.820
and so curiosity about what's
going on in Silicon Valley,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.970
in Google, in all
these startups.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.110
The world is changing before
our very eyes very rapidly.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.970
What could be better for
me than to engage in that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.250
and share some of what I'm
learning as I encounter what

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.110
will be one of the
themes of the next book,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.400
"Humble Consulting," which is
how to give real help faster.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.550
I've begun to adapt to speed.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.470
KAREN MAY: We can all
learn with you, then.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.660
Wonderful.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.740
And I know we'll look forward to
"Humble Consulting" coming out,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.580
so we can read it and continue
to learn from you and with you.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.860
I actually came to
our conversation

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.040
with a set of
questions more tailored

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.660
to your more recent "The
Humble Inquiry" book.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.300
But I actually would like to
have us start a bit broader

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.330
and then move into
some of the questions--

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.220
and broader in terms of culture.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.380
And we spoke a little
bit over our lunch

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.600
today about culture as
a multidimensional--

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.542
we have many cultures.

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:08.750
We don't just have a culture.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.130
And it's within those cultures
that we choose our behavior

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.140
and kind of assess our context.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.360
So if I could ask you to
share some of your thoughts

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.900
about those many cultures.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.750
ED SCHEIN: I think
that-- as I was thinking

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.060
about this conversation,
Kathy, two words

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.570
kept popping up in my head.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
One is culture as
something that's inside us,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.510
not something that's out there.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.220
It's inside us.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.170
And that leads to
the other word.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.400
If I have a message today that
I want to get out to the world,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.550
it's that we've got to combine
our notions of mindfulness

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.620
with our understanding
of culture,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.770
that mindfulness is not some
kind of meditation process.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.410
Mindfulness is
situational awareness

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.350
of how culture inside
us and around us

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.700
is really dominating
our thinking.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.800
And if we don't become aware
of how much our thinking is

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.560
culturally
determined, culturally

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.870
at the level of
nation-- you all come

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.090
from different countries
and different ethnicities;

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.860
that's a big layer-- culture at
the level of an organization,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.700
and then inside the
organization, the occupation

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.590
you come from.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.680
The engineering culture is
different from the finance

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.860
culture.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.770
And then right down
to the work group,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.340
where we now get to my quick
definition of "culture."

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.230
"Culture" is the
accumulated learning

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.010
you've had in your
group experience.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.480
So you learned the
culture of your family.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.320
You learned the culture of your
schools and your education.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.230
And when you entered
Google, you had

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.760
to learn the culture not only of
the corporation called Google,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.800
but of your own
particular work group.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.140
So don't think of
culture as anything

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.200
other than accumulated
learning that

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.820
sits inside you as one of
your layers of consciousness.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.070
And becoming more aware of
that I think is crucial.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.800
Now the other dimension
of culture-- and then

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.235
I'll shut up.

00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:39.534
I don't want to use up
all the air time here--

00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:40.200
culture can be--

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.980
KAREN MAY: It's why
you're here, though.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.307
It's your air time.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:45.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.400
ED SCHEIN: To analyze culture--
when people say, OK, Ed, you've

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.290
described it.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.810
But how do we analyze it?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.240
You have to think of it
at three different levels.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.000
When we arrived here, we
saw what the anthropologists

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.870
would call the artifacts
or the artifices

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.610
or the creations of culture--
the buildings, the way people

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.650
dress, the structures, how
you get into the place.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.960
All that stuff is the visible,
feelable, smellable, hearable

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.060
part of culture, which
is real but is just

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.660
the surface manifestation.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.610
It's not below-- it's above what
is down below, which I think

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.320
of as the DNA of the culture.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.720
In between that is the layer
that we like to talk about,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.970
which is what I call
the "espoused values."

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.620
If someone says, why
do you people at Google

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.320
do it this way?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.960
Then you'll come up with,
because we're creative.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.980
We're fast.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.570
We're team-based.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.110
Those words are espoused values.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.890
They are not
necessarily what is even

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.960
the deeper level that
would explain in detail

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.350
your day-to-day behavior.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.460
I think of that as your "taken
for granted" assumptions.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.640
It's sort of the
automatic way you

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.280
learn to behave around here.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.160
That may mean
something as subtle as,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.020
well, if we meet
one of our founders,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.720
how do I relate to that person?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.650
You know, you're not
necessarily going to learn that

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.230
from the espoused value level.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.030
You're going to learn
that from observing,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.030
by talking to older
employees, and say, how do you

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.990
really handle it when you get
nervous in your group meeting?

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.000
Or when you think
it's too competitive

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.260
and it's not supposed to be?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.950
That's the DNA of the culture.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.900
And that will reflect the
US culture, the management

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.020
culture-- broadly
speaking-- and then

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.460
the corporate culture of
Google and your own department.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.760
So what we need to get conscious
of is that deeper level.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.050
It's not about "is it
a nice place to work?"

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.160
It's about what's the
deeper reality of what

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.490
it means to work here
and how you get along.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.810
So culture and mindfulness are,
in that sense, my key messages.

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:30.000
KAREN MAY: As
you're saying that,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.740
I'm imagining all of us
going through our day,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.510
trying to take into account
all of those layers.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:44.180
And it's a lot to
take in-- and thinking

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:50.150
how do you guide people
to develop the capacity

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:57.600
to be aware and mindful
in a complex environment

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.170
where not only are there many
layers, but the volume of work

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.600
is high and the pace
of work is fast?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.050
So you're sort of torn between
a process consciousness,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.340
if you will, and getting
pulled into the task at hand.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.950
And how do you advise people
to cultivate the capacity

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.354
to stay self-aware,
even in that complexity?

00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:24.770
ED SCHEIN: That's
a great question

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.840
because it forces us into
some countercultural thinking.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.160
If you look at how rampant
individualistic competitive US

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.720
society trains you, it's
all about you the person.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.360
What are your talents?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.500
What are your strengths?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.150
What are your weaknesses?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.570
All the measures of
people are around

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.030
their individual capacities
and talents, and so on.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.160
And what's missed in that
is that-- particularly

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.770
in an organization like this
one that espouses teamwork

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.640
and the belief that
really great ideas come

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.900
about from a lot
of interaction--

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.490
the first principle is to become
less self-conscious and more

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.590
what one of my heroes,
Erving Goffman,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.310
would call "interaction
conscious."

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.480
Think a bit more like the
social psychologist who

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.610
says, "What's going on
here between these people?"

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.460
rather than "How am I doing?"

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.580
We are so over-trained
on "How am I doing?"

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.910
and "Am I doing well?"
and getting feedback.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.110
And the reward system is all
about my accomplishments.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.070
But the reality of
work, I suspect,

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.370
is all about your
relationships to people.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.640
So one of the big points that
comes out of "Humble Inquiry"

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:07.000
and helping is it's about
the relationship, stupid.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.760
If you don't understand
how relationships form,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.470
if you don't learn a bit of
sociology, and what is it

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.540
that people do when they date.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.950
Or how is-- why is
there all this talk

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.510
about "is this a date or not?"

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.730
What are those words about?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.080
What's a date?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.240
A date is a relational concept.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.760
Or what's a superior-subordinate
relationship?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.400
You can't talk about
this individually.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.740
You have to talk about
it situationally.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.950
And so learning more
about relationships

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.890
is what humble inquiry and
helping and humble consulting

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.675
is really all about.

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:50.633
KAREN MAY: Interesting.

00:12:53.182 --> 00:12:55.390
One of the things you talk
about in the book in terms

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.970
of relationships that struck
me was the-- my words,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.410
not yours-- but the
increased responsibility

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.830
that one has for inquiry,
for humble inquiry,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.680
as status increases.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.470
And it struck me in
thinking about how

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:18.770
do we help leaders see and
take on that responsibility.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.500
So when status is at play,
what are some of the things

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:29.310
that leaders can do to create
the psychological safety

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:35.090
or the safe space within
which creativity and problems

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.130
can be solved?

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.970
ED SCHEIN: OK, that's
a difficult one

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.160
because if the leader
were sitting here today,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.460
I would say, you have
to become situationally

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.490
aware to whether the problem
you're trying to solve,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.540
or what's worrying you is a
simple problem to which you

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.310
have the answer--
in which case, fine.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.970
Tell your subordinate what
to do because you know.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.790
You've been there.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.930
You know all about it.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.510
But if we discover
that what's really

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.720
worrying you is that
you don't know how

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.020
to get a bunch of
subgroups to work together,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.570
you're discovering that
there's a loss of alignment

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.320
between various of
your subordinates

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.500
or the groups or
the subcultures,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.670
now telling him what to
do isn't going to work.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.980
The complexity, the
systemic interconnections

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.310
are too complicated.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:46.830
So you have to get past thinking
that you know what to do.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.070
Accept your ignorance.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.080
And that's where the
word "humility" comes in.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.660
Humility is acknowledging
that there are some things

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.900
I don't know how to do.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.180
Or there is some bit of
knowledge that I don't have.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.300
We've projected this on
to the senior leaders,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.140
but it applies to
everyone in this room.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.710
There are situations
where you know what to do

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.780
and are experienced.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.750
But a lot of situations
that you encounter daily,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.710
if you're honest with
yourself, you don't really

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.420
know what's going on.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.680
You don't really
know what to do.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.060
And in those
situations, you have

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.170
to let your curiosity
and your humility surface

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.330
and become dominant.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.870
"Humble inquiry" is
the acknowledgment

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.180
that sometimes
the other person--

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.850
whether it's a subordinate
or a boss or a peer--

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.260
knows something that you
need to know in order

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.170
to accomplish your next task.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.920
So it's probably the
most practical suggestion

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.310
we can have in a complex world
is to get curious and ask

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.830
questions.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.300
Don't think you already
know because chances

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.340
are, if it's complex, you
probably got the wrong answer.

00:16:09.357 --> 00:16:11.440
KAREN MAY: It's interesting
as you're saying that.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.780
And I'm thinking-- as
I imagine some of you

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.430
are-- about contexts in
which, on our best days,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.530
we could be curious
and ask questions.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:27.070
And on some days, either we
feel we have to prove ourselves

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:33.650
or we feel it there isn't
time for asking questions.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.060
And so let me push
this a step farther

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.200
and say, if I know
intellectually the best

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.100
thing to do is to be curious and
ask questions and acknowledge

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.760
externally what I know
internally, which is I actually

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.770
don't have all the
answers, how do I

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.850
train myself to do
that in circumstances

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.650
when the cost of admitting
ignorance feels high?

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.240
Or the cost of taking
the time feels high?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.140
So if I kind of know
it's the right answer,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.560
are there things I can do with
the group or to train myself?

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.099
How do we help people push
through with that behavior

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:22.960
change, even when the conditions
feel difficult for that?

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.960
ED SCHEIN: I don't know this
is-- whether this is easy to do

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.570
or not, but two thoughts occur.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:39.530
One is to become more
personal, which is paradoxical.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:45.910
I think society trains us
to be mostly transactional,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.630
particularly in business.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.770
You're supposed to have
professional relationships.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.500
And professional
distance is good.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.520
The therapist is not supposed
to sleep with the patient.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.210
That's bad.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.960
But we then also apply
it to fraternization

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.950
in the military--
the officers are not

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.480
supposed to fraternize
with the troops.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.085
So we have this huge
managerial overlay

00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:15.080
that stayed transactional.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.310
And again, in a simple
world, that's probably OK.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.280
But the minute things get
complex and interpersonally

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.600
diffuse, transactions
no longer work.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.670
You have to somehow acknowledge
that this is now personal.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.320
Two or three of
us are competing.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.270
And this doesn't feel good.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.650
And I don't know
what to do about it.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.070
The first thing is to
acknowledge to yourself

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.350
that this is personal.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.680
And maybe the best
thing to do-- and that's

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.890
the other point-- is to go to
process rather than content.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.940
Rather than say,
OK, it's personal.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.570
I'm going to show
this other person

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.400
that I'm brighter and smarter.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.120
So I'm just going
to argue even more.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:12.900
Or I might say, God forbid,
why are we arguing about this?

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.820
Is there some
common element here?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.910
And that means, am I putting
my career in jeopardy

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.530
by not winning?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.010
I think we have to ask--
that's a tough question

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.900
in your environment--
is it better to win?

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.910
Or is it better to
personalize and build

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.780
relationships where,
collectively, we end up

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.720
with a better solution,
but God forbid,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.700
I might not get all the credit?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.660
I don't know the answer
to that question.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.100
That's embedded in your culture.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.684
But I'm suggesting you have the
choice of not content-competing

00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:57.100
and saying, you
know, let me prove

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.660
to you why my idea is better.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.410
Instead, say, wait a minute,
why are we competing here?

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.570
And maybe we should
look at the two answers

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.650
and how they combine.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.350
Or, are you as
uncomfortable as I am

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.250
about how we're arguing here?

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:19.820
Personalization means
exposing the process

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.896
of what's going on between us.

00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:27.170
And I would think, in
this kind of organization

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:33.340
that espouses teamwork, that's
a very natural direction for you

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:39.810
to go-- is to get more personal
rather than more argumentative,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.170
and to let competition go
in need interests of better

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:50.600
solutions and better answers and
hope that the people above you

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.720
recognize the value of that.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.310
But it's a personal decision.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:59.830
If you end up with a boss
who only likes winners,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.660
then you're stuck.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.040
And if you really believe
this alternative way might

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.750
be better, then
find another group

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.600
because I think the US
managerial culture is

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.250
hooked on winning
and competition.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.290
And it's all about
the individual.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.600
So I'm very aware-- as the
book "Humble Inquiry" must leak

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.180
out-- I'm very
critical of competition

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.170
and rampant individualism
brought inside an organization.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.910
That may be great for
capitalism writ in large.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.920
But I think it's a
disaster when you bring it

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.750
inside an organization and have
what this one executive once

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.460
said to his
subordinates-- this was

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:54.790
the CEO who said to his VPs--
Now, I want you all to be team.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.610
This is a team process.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.340
But don't forget for a
minute that you're all

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.070
competing for my job.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.279
And how are you supposed to--

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:05.028
KAREN MAY: Right, which
message is louder?

00:22:05.028 --> 00:22:06.560
ED SCHEIN: --make sense of that?

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.705
KAREN MAY: Yeah,
very interesting.

00:22:08.705 --> 00:22:10.930
Well, I want to go two
directions with what you said.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.940
So I'll go one and
then the other.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.530
And one is triggered by
some of the questions

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.210
that some of my colleagues--
I know we're interested in,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.820
which is, for those of us
who are women, some of what

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:29.090
you're suggesting
can feel even harder.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:33.740
And do you have any
particular advice for women

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:40.490
to be able to follow
that kind of inquiry path

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:47.120
without falling into a
process stereotype or a less

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.468
competitive stereotype?

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:53.160
ED SCHEIN: OK, I'm going to
pick you up on one word, Kathy.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.864
I don't-- what?

00:22:55.864 --> 00:22:57.106
AUDIENCE: Karen.

00:22:57.106 --> 00:22:59.500
KAREN MAY: It's all
right, Kathy, Karen.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.500
I'll answer to anything.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.541
ED SCHEIN: He's my coach.

00:23:01.541 --> 00:23:02.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:04.710
KAREN MAY: Kathy, I'll
take it as a compliment.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.810
ED SCHEIN: I don't give advice.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.090
KAREN MAY: Ah, man.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.080
OK.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.340
ED SCHEIN: But you've
triggered some thoughts.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.470
I think it is alleged-- and
you'll have to tell me whether

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.410
this is changing with
millennials and so on-- that

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.440
women really do learn to be
more relational from the outset,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.220
particularly if they become
mothers and find that you

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:38.240
cannot deal with children
in a transactional way.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.160
It gets acutely personal.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:48.560
And so the skills that women
bring that are relational

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.510
should, in principle, make
a woman-run organization

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.070
different.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.120
But I'm not sure
whether that happens.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.510
I think the
managerial culture is

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.090
a male-originated
dominant culture.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.500
And I think a lot of women
feel that, unless they give up

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.990
their feminine skills and adapt
to the masculine competitive

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.390
environment, they're
not going to make it.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.200
So I see it more as a dilemma.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.370
I do think women bring
something different.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.700
But whether they can actually
exercise it effectively

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.940
in a traditional organization
is a real question in my mind.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.535
And I've seen good
examples and bad examples.

00:24:42.535 --> 00:24:45.310
And that's why there's
no relevant advice

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.440
except be yourself.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.720
And figure out
what's better for you

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.520
if you're a woman-- to play the
male competitive game or just

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.140
say, I'm going to do
this thing differently.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.570
I'm going to relate differently
to people, to be more personal,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.200
and see whether
that works better.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.050
KAREN MAY: So the other
direction your earlier comments

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.340
about culture and
what's happening here

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.030
triggered for me was, again,
something that we spoke about

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.230
quite briefly, which
was the observations you

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:25.840
have on what happened to
Digital Equipment Corporation.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.080
And I wonder if you
could share with us

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.970
a couple of the lessons
that you would hope that we,

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.090
as an organization,
might learn from DEC,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.170
rather than having to
learn it ourselves.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.140
ED SCHEIN: That's a very
important part of my life.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.870
I somehow managed, because
I was an MIT professor,

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:55.470
to be accepted by Ken Olsen, the
founder and president of DEC,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.560
as a consultant because
he was a true engineer.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.130
But because of that,
he said, we probably

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.080
aren't so great at
communication in groups.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.990
So why don't you
come and sit in?

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.850
That led to 25
years of consulting,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.850
watching DEC grow and become
the number two computer

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:24.780
company in the world behind
IBM, and in the late '80s,

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:30.130
level off and decline, until
it got taken over by Compaq.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.900
So I ended up actually writing a
book, which I recommend to you,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.410
called "DEC is Dead,
Long Live DEC."

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:42.870
Because during its heyday,
during its successes,

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:47.430
DEC believed itself to be
the most creative, the most

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.870
fun, the most exciting
company in the world.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.330
And if you talk to ex-DEC
people, they will say,

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.300
those were the best
years of my life.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.230
It was fabulous.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.070
So how is it possible that
that could all go wrong?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.870
And the metaphor that
really struck me most

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.720
was that, when DEC
was young, it was

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.830
a bunch of creative engineers
creating a whole new industry.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.400
What could be more
exciting than that?

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.290
That sounds a little bit
familiar with early Google,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.190
doesn't it?

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.280
That's a wonderful time to be.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.990
And, at that point,
everyone is creative.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.910
Everyone is valued.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.910
Ideas are what it's all about.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.710
But you then produce
some products.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.330
And lo and behold,
they're successful-- wow.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.690
So now you get promoted.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.410
Now you have a
bigger organization

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.690
and, at the same time,
you yourself age.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.950
So 10 years in now,
we're very successful.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.110
And what I observe is, in
the initial conversations

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:08.120
in the top group of DEC,
people were rampantly

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.030
arguing with each other because
they were after the truth.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.510
What should our next product be?

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.480
They were betting the company.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.330
They were using their
intellectual tools to the full.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.500
It was a nasty environment
because people were really

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.130
fighting for their ideas.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:31.790
But it was a totally exciting
creative environment.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.200
Fast forward 10
years-- these same

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.820
people are now in their
30s and they've all

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:44.620
been promoted into being
engineering managers or product

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.470
line managers.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.340
And they've got organizations.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:54.200
Now I'm in the same group
of seven or eight people.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.670
And they're deciding the
next round of products.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:03.420
And the argument sounds
equally vehement and exciting.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.900
But I had this horrible
feeling that they're

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.430
now all arguing
as representatives

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.460
of their organizations.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.380
They suddenly are not the
individual creative engineer,

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.700
but they're the head of a group.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.420
And they're very conscious
that, if their product isn't

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.660
the one picked, maybe a
hundred or a thousand people

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.050
will be out of work.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.140
Now that transition from
being the individual creator

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.630
to being responsible for
a lot of other people

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.550
destroys a certain level of
creativity and innovation.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.320
And it's inevitable.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.500
You can't say, well, I'm just
as creative as I was in my 20s

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.350
when I was the lone creator.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.780
It's different.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.810
Now these groups get bigger,
and they become empires.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:08.800
And the shortest explanation
I have of how DEC failed

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.240
is the empires begin to
fight with each other.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:19.780
It was no longer just
individuals making a point.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.830
But there were, in fact,
three different products.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.000
There was the Alta
Vista search engine,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.680
there was a big
water-cooled computer

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.450
that was being produced, and
there was the Alpha chip.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.080
And the heads of those
organizations each

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.540
sincerely believed that they
were the DEC of the future.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.650
But complexity intervened.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.180
Each of those three were
no longer simple products.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.170
They were now very
complicated technologies,

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.800
required more resources.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.530
And the environment was
saying, you've got to focus.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.010
You can't do it all anymore
because each project

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.090
is too complex.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.000
And at that point,
those three [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.810
could not relate to each other.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.220
They fought.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.330
And they fought to the death.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.230
And that meant they
started to steal resources

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.730
from each other.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.640
They began to exaggerate
the market potential

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.880
of each of their products.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.010
And, as a result, all
three hit the market late.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.990
And all three of
those products failed.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.840
And that made DEC no
longer economically viable.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.020
So the notion that DEC
never saw the future or they

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.360
never understood the
strategy, nonsense.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.340
They saw it perfectly.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.240
But they could not
adapt by saying,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.600
well, we better bet on Alta
Vista or we better get on the--

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.860
and kill two big projects
and fire thousands of people.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:07.540
So the danger in size and age
is these other interpersonal

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.610
forces become very powerful.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.100
And I don't know how
companies get out of this.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.760
That's the problem of
the people at the top

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.530
of your organization.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.125
How do they keep this
from happening to you?

00:32:23.125 --> 00:32:25.554
Does that make sense?

00:32:25.554 --> 00:32:26.220
KAREN MAY: Yeah.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:30.012 --> 00:32:32.300
ED SCHEIN: And the reason
I'm touting the book

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.420
is the book not only
describes DEC's history,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.920
but has a whole big
chapter on what happens

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.900
with age and with growth.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.050
And you're right at that cusp.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.050
KAREN MAY: Well, and this
is a terrific group for you

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.220
to be sharing with because,
to the extent-- tying back

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.030
to your earlier
comments-- to the extent

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.480
that we're conscious and aware,
we increase the likelihood

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.770
that we can ask
questions that will help

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.040
raise some of those issues.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.840
So I think we all need
to read that book.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.280
I'm going to now share
the pleasure of asking you

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.341
questions with my
colleagues both in the room

00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:14.340
and outside of the room.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.034
And Kathy, why don't we start
with one on the Dory and then

00:33:18.034 --> 00:33:19.200
we'll go to one in the room?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.695
And we'll just alternate.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.915
KATHY: I don't know
if Stephanie is here.

00:33:26.915 --> 00:33:29.208
Do you want to
ask your question?

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:30.579
AUDIENCE: I forgot what it was.

00:33:30.579 --> 00:33:31.162
KATHY: Oh, OK.

00:33:31.162 --> 00:33:32.250
I will read your question.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.490
"Google, like many
other organizations"--

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.950
and this is kind of similar
to what you were just talking

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.920
about-- "Google, like
many other organizations,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.770
is experiencing the challenges
of being in an environment

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.380
characterized by--" in all
capital letters, "V-U-C-A."

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.730
KAREN MAY: Volatility,
uncertainty, complexity,

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.330
and ambiguity.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.830
KATHY: Got it.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.170
"What types of
interventions, aside

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.370
from trying to hone our
senior leaders, have you seen

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.210
has a significant impact on
the organization's ability

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.480
to adapt?"

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:07.560
ED SCHEIN: Well, I think
probably the most important

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.980
example of dealing
with-- do you use "VUCA"

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.929
or do you always spell it out?

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.300
KAREN MAY: Having defined
it, let's stay with "VUCA."

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.100
ED SCHEIN: I think, to
deal with complexity,

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.330
one of the great
systematic-- systems

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.250
theory notions is
the system has to be

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:39.130
as complex as the environment
within which it works.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.790
So as the product environment
and the political and economic

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.889
and other environments get
more and more interconnected

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.719
and complex themselves,
the organization

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:56.810
has to develop that same
level of complexity.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.560
What that probably means is
a lot more differentiation

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.370
into a lot more different units.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.520
It becomes harder and harder.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.270
As in the DEC case, Ken Olsen
could no longer centrally

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.970
grasp these three units.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:19.740
It might have been better,
with hindsight, for DEC

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.610
to break into three
divisions and let

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.340
them each forge for themselves.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.570
So if one had to think in
terms of organization design

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.320
in the systemic way, you've
got to differentiate the system

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.760
and give more units
more of the opportunity

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:46.160
to create their own fate,
to decentralize more.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.960
I don't think it's
possible to deal

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.287
centrally with this complex
a world as is developing out

00:35:54.287 --> 00:35:55.450
there.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.250
That makes integration
more difficult.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.650
So the leaders now
probably themselves

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.820
become a group, rather
than an individual,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.430
because they have to
be able to represent

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.240
the varieties of problems
that your different product

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.390
lines, your different
technologies,

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.890
your different subunits
are generating.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.600
So I don't know if that
answers that question.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.340
But I think it means systemic
complexity cannot be captured

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.114
by central single
ideas by definition.

00:36:35.114 --> 00:36:36.280
KAREN MAY: Very interesting.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.620
Thanks, Stephanie,
for a good question.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.398
Is there a live
question in the room?

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.150
Yes.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.600
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up on your last thought--

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.130
KAREN MAY: Do me a favor
and wait for the mic

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.820
just so that those who
are joining us virtually

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.870
can hear your question.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.320
AUDIENCE: To follow up
on your last comment,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.450
if you have to have--

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.470
ED SCHEIN: Move it
closer to your mouth.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.136
AUDIENCE: If you have
to have divisions,

00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:02.354
and divisions have
division leaders,

00:37:02.354 --> 00:37:04.270
and the division leaders
have to sit in a room

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.420
and make group decisions,
but all the division leaders

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:12.030
believe if they're going to be
fired if their division fails,

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.460
how do you have the relational
conversation in that room?

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.170
ED SCHEIN: Complexity covers
problem solving as well as

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.810
reality.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:31.970
I think the other company
that I was consulting

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.750
with at the same time as
DEC was Ciba-Geigy, which

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.590
was a big chemical
giant that had

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:44.230
to face the loss of the
chemical sector, basically.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:51.030
Chemistry had been
overproduced--

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.720
and gradually turned themselves
into a pharmaceutical company.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.350
And that became part of
what is today Novartis.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:03.820
So I saw them struggling
with how does one destroy

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.460
a whole sector of a business.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.010
And what they did was they
did it in as human a way

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.530
as possible.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.910
They knew that they had to
let thousands of people go.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.200
But they created a process
that made them still

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.930
feel we are a humane,
responsible company, by first

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:31.300
of all, slowing it down through
not replacing retirements,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:37.480
by having generous buyouts, by
giving people consulting jobs,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.880
by bringing in very good
counseling services.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:47.200
So that you don't avoid the
tough economic decision.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.470
But you handle what you have
to do in a way that still makes

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:59.010
you feel that you're not being
just a cruel, unthinking kind

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.120
of organization, but that you're
still the organization that you

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.220
always tried to be.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.510
One of the principles
of that, by the way,

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:15.790
was that you never let somebody
go through HR or personnel.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:21.210
The boss has to face the
individual and say, John,

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:25.660
or Mary, your job has gone away.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.780
And so we're going
to have to figure out

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.280
what you will have to do next.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.850
And here are some options.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:37.720
But we have to have that
face-to-face conversation.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.010
And they ended up having to
train some of their supervisors

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.220
how to do that.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:48.550
But the notion that personal
things work-- people

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.930
treat each other as adults
when they get personal,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.190
rather than as commodities.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:03.220
The movie "Up in the Air"
is the worst example of what

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.450
organizations are finding
themselves doing--

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:12.570
is to be fired by a hired
consultant, in effect, or even

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:17.060
worse, by a screen, as I recall.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:22.110
So personalization becomes
a very critical concept

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.250
in all my thinking.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.800
That even those seven or
eight people-- actually,

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.360
Ciba-Geigy was run
by a group of 11.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.850
And they had all these different
departments and functions.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.010
They got to be very
close personally.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:43.260
And one way they dealt
with the difficulty

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.800
is they had, over
the years, rotated

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.110
divisional responsibility
among themselves

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.236
so that there would
be real empathy.

00:40:51.236 --> 00:40:56.700
If I'm Product A and saying
Product B has got to go,

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.270
I've managed Product B and I
know what it is I'm saying.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.620
So you can get a
more personal process

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.450
at that level,
hopefully, rather than

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:11.170
a bureaucratic process that's
just driven by financials.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.730
That's the one way
I've seen it happen.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.810
They did a good
job of downsizing

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.700
the agricultural sector,
the chemical sector,

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.955
and beginning to lean
almost exclusively

00:41:22.955 --> 00:41:23.913
toward pharmaceuticals.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.200
It's useful to always
find cases rather than

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.600
look for generalizations.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.270
If you have a question,
"how do you do something?"

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.685
find someone who
has done it and see

00:41:38.685 --> 00:41:42.156
how they did it rather
than looking for a formula

00:41:42.156 --> 00:41:44.244
off the shelf.

00:41:44.244 --> 00:41:45.852
KAREN MAY: Interesting.

00:41:45.852 --> 00:41:48.110
Kathy, is there another
question on the Dory?

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.090
KATHY: --questions on the Dory.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:53.130
So Trista, who's in
our Seattle office,

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.780
asks, "Many people
in PeopleDev consult

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.120
with our business clients.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.460
And we also want to
evaluate our own work.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.630
How do we evaluate or
measure-- or how do you

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.080
evaluate or measure
your consulting work?

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.335
And do you have any guidance
on how we might evaluate

00:42:08.335 --> 00:42:09.640
our consulting engagements?

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:16.770
ED SCHEIN: One of the
traps of the US culture

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.000
is that somewhere
along the line,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.040
we bought into the science
model that everything

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.660
has to be numerical.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.390
So I believe in measurement.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.120
But I don't believe it has
to be quantitative, numerical

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.210
measurement.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.490
So what do I measure?

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.330
If I'm in a long
project with the client,

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:43.240
the first thing I would do
is to have a conversation

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.600
about how should we--
two-- collectively measure

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.400
whether we're getting
anywhere or not?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.840
You have a piece of that.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.170
I have a piece of that.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:59.020
Either one of us can say, this
isn't working, and bow out.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.450
Now, that may not be
economically the best

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.200
for the consultant.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.880
But that's one way
to measure-- is

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.910
to collectively build a unit.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:12.610
In my more rapid
kind of consulting,

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:16.740
which I've found myself
doing much more out here,

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.020
which often is just one
hour or a long lunch,

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.220
and I feel that something
has been accomplished,

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.990
I very much go by whether,
at the end of that lunch,

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:33.400
or the end of that hour, we're
both feeling good and both

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.700
think this has been helpful.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.810
And if the client
is just saying,

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.770
well, yes, "that's
been very helpful,"

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.480
I can tell by the tone of
voice that this has not worked.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.050
But if the person goes away
from that hour saying, "Gee,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.260
that was fun.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.840
That was good."

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.770
That's enough of a measurement
for me that this is working.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.950
So it goes back to
situational awareness.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:03.510
I think we evaluate
moment to moment.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.520
And in this next book,
"Humble Consulting,"

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.140
I'll talk a lot about
how these things have

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:17.920
to be measured from the
moment of initial contact.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.290
We don't scout and analyze
and diagnose and then

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.410
figure out what to do.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.780
The moment I'm with
a client, I'm doing.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.380
I'm in it.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.500
And I evaluate,
moment by moment,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.830
whether this is a
good conversation.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:40.000
I have to work that
way all the time.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.200
When we sat down for lunch,
I have to ask myself,

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.052
you know, is this lunch working?

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.770
Are we getting connected?

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:54.710
So I put the measurement
evaluation process

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.660
in the here and now
because it's quite possible

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.510
that we will work for a
couple of years on a project

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.030
and the numbers won't
reflect anything.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.910
Does that mean it's
been a failure?

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.910
People ask me,
well, you consulted

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.960
for Digital for 25 years
and they went under.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.248
So you must not have
done your job, right?

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.030
So my fellow consultants
and I-- and there

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.890
were many other
consultants at DEC--

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:29.290
figured out what the correct
answer is to that challenge.

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.700
The answer is, if we
hadn't been there,

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.792
they would have gone
under much sooner.

00:45:33.792 --> 00:45:35.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.090
KAREN MAY: That's great.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.090
Well, I actually, in
all truth, imagine

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.230
that the people you taught while
you were there-- whatever they

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.720
went on to do afterwards--
were richer and more aware

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.325
people than they would have
been had you not been there.

00:45:49.325 --> 00:45:50.550
That's my assumption.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:55.930
Is there another live
question in the room?

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:56.450
Yes.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.620
Great-- mic is on the way.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.230
AUDIENCE: So you've
given great advice

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.300
for larger organizations.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.860
Does your advice change at all
for the budding entrepreneur?

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.909
Because the valley is
full of, as well, folks

00:46:11.909 --> 00:46:13.950
that are thinking of going
out there and starting

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.740
their own thing.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.452
ED SCHEIN: OK, back to
I don't give advice.

00:46:19.452 --> 00:46:21.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:27.750
But I think I would take
that on a personal basis.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:31.550
I would want to know what
is that person trying to do,

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.950
and what's worrying
them, and not

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.690
to assume, again, that
there is a formula for what

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.310
young entrepreneurs should do.

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.650
One of the biggest
aspects of that

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.690
is the changing
technological scene.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:55.080
I gave talks to young
entrepreneurs in the '60s.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.380
And they were all
building stuff.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:03.190
They were making other kinds
of computers, and so on,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.490
and so on.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.560
And I noticed that
when the software

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.840
world began to
infiltrate and take over,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.320
those questions changed.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.680
It's no longer a
matter of a little shop

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.650
where you build something.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.530
It's now suddenly
a different kind

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.900
of intellectual enterprise.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:31.480
And you're now selling ideas or
something entirely different.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.770
So what does it even mean to
be an entrepreneur in today's

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:40.070
range of technologies?

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:44.850
What does it mean to develop
a new app for the iPhone?

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.310
This is a completely
different question

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:52.670
from how do I build a new
computer or a new car?

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:57.470
I guess you're now in both
kinds of businesses, right?

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:03.610
You're building products as well
as these very abstract things

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.040
that I don't even know how to
conceptualize and talk about.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.200
So I have to ask my son,
what is an app anyway?

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.790
What does it mean
to sit down and do

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.280
a better job of programming?

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.500
Those are not questions
that entrepreneurs

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.190
used to ask before we
invented all this stuff.

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.130
So it's very situational.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:35.120
But the thing I noticed
in my career studies--

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.200
I studied a lot of MIT
alums and other people.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.570
And there was
always a subset who

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.260
wanted to build their
own companies who

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.980
were entrepreneurial.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.550
And what I noticed
about them was

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.830
that they were driven people.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:59.520
They had often sold
magazines as high schoolers.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.190
They were not as academic.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.770
They were not A-plus students.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.410
They were the A-minus students.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:06.330
Why?

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.800
Because they were too busy
doing stuff to really worry

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.300
about getting the best grade.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.060
And they noticed that the
world didn't value pure grades

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:23.600
as much as the ability to get
things done, to be creative.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.450
So I guess if that's a general
characteristic of people

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:33.620
like this, you have to
honor your own drives,

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:37.640
and say, well, what is
it I'm prepared to suffer

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.630
for because these
ideas have grabbed me?

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:45.660
And by God-- I recently
watched an interview

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.340
that I recommend to
all of you that I

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:55.540
got on Netflix called "Steve
Jobs-- The Lost Interview."

00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:00.100
Apparently he was collared
for an hour and 10 minutes

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.090
by a very good interviewer
and really asked

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.880
a lot of very personal
questions about how

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.750
he thought about things.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.550
It's a gripping
interview to see how

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:16.770
he kept coming back to some
ideas he couldn't let go.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:22.230
No matter what else was going
on, something was always there.

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:27.370
And that, to me, is the
mark of an entrepreneur.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.460
Because if you don't have
that, the early failures

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.460
are going to kill you.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.110
You're gonna get discouraged.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.830
That something has to reemerge.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:39.870
And it's not necessarily
very articulate.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.150
But it's something
that drives you.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.660
That's one of the
things I learned

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.985
from studying entrepreneurs.

00:50:46.985 --> 00:50:48.700
KAREN MAY: Very interesting.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.200
Kathy--

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.701
KATHY: Do you have a follow-up
question, or do you--

00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:51.696
KAREN MAY: Go ahead.

00:50:51.696 --> 00:50:53.124
KATHY: Do you want to ask it?

00:50:59.788 --> 00:51:03.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, my question
was in relationship

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.220
to some internal research
that we've done lately

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.980
around the characteristics
of the highest performing

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.080
and most effective
teams here at Google.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.900
And so I was just curious, in
your career, some of the things

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.220
that you've come up
with, you've seen

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:23.390
exhibited by the most effective
teams that you've worked with.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.470
ED SCHEIN: There's a
lot of research on that.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:31.530
And I think a lot, again,
depends on what they're doing.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:36.160
One of the earliest
studies of leadership

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.190
was done way in the '50s
on basketball teams, where

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:46.000
you had a very clear criterion
of whether you win or not.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.720
And, at that point, one of
the interesting findings

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:56.300
was that the winning teams
had leaders who were clearer

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:00.130
about the difference between
"my best people" and "my worst

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.650
people" than less
effective teams

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:07.780
who had leaders that said, "my
people are more or less alike."

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:11.100
That's an interesting
bit of research

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.070
that may not apply
to research teams.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:18.030
But it does connect
with Steve Jobs,

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.480
who kept saying it's
all about the A players.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.710
And if you're not an A player,
I don't want you on the team.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:30.470
So this notion of
knowing who has

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.660
really the talents for
the particular tasks

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.950
may be one characteristic.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:41.190
But from my point of view,
an even more important

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:47.070
characteristic is the
ability to become a team.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.910
And there's a concept
that some of you

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:52.610
may have become familiar
with that Amy Edmondson calls

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:53.880
"teaming."

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.720
She's written a book
called "Teaming."

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.290
The notion there is that you
don't become a team by just

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.240
getting to know each other.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.310
You become a team
by joint learning

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:09.900
in a difficult situation.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.890
When a group of people who may
think of themselves as a team

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:18.490
suddenly have to face a new
challenge that none of them

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.550
have separately faced, and
they have to learn together,

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.410
that forces a level of
personalization that

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.830
may not have been there before.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.465
And that will be crucial
to better performance

00:53:32.465 --> 00:53:34.790
at a later time.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.560
So if I were managing
teams, I would probably

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.640
invent problems for them to
force them into joint learning.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.800
Because I couldn't assume
that just because they've

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.890
been together and they
say they like each other,

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:50.970
that's not enough.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:55.000
It has to be joint learning
that really creates a team.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.527
Those are the things
that surface for me.

00:53:58.527 --> 00:54:00.360
KAREN MAY: You would
be interested, I think,

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.500
to know the study
that Adam is referring

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:08.760
to found that the variable
that most indicates

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.585
the team will be effective
is psychological safety.

00:54:13.585 --> 00:54:18.400
And that felt-- as I was
reading "Humble Inquiry"--

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.030
certainly felt like a
precondition for inquiry

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.190
to exist.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.630
ED SCHEIN: Were you are
familiar with Amy Edmonson's

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:27.650
work on this?

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:33.660
Yeah, because she's made a huge
issue of psychological safety.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.560
And that goes back
to my earlier stuff

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.035
on psychological contract.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.080
The surface is that any time
we're in a work relationship--

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.530
and this could be applied
to team members-- what's

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:54.380
the contract you have
with your team members?

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.300
And does it include that
I can be totally me?

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.100
Or do I have to play a
certain kind of a role?

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.330
And certainly
psychological safety

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:08.680
would suggest that
you want to lean

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:14.106
toward making this personally
possible to be yourself.

00:55:14.106 --> 00:55:17.470
And if you're the
leader of the group,

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:22.870
to go heavily into creating
an environment where

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:25.250
people will feel safe.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:30.930
To me, that's one of the biggest
pathologies in the US system--

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:35.105
is that managers have the
notion that, if you're

00:55:35.105 --> 00:55:40.480
a responsible subordinate, you
will tell me what's going on,

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.790
instead of realizing that,
unless I deliberately

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:48.880
create psychological
safety for you,

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.790
there is no particular
incentive for you

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:54.590
to tell me what's
really going on.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.696
So as a boss, you have to
really create that environment.

00:55:58.696 --> 00:56:01.290
You can't assume it.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.990
KAREN MAY: Very interesting.

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:06.570
So many lessons here for
us as an organization.

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:10.140
And I can't help
but finding my mind

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.670
going also to what's
happening in the world.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:18.210
And these lessons feel so
relevant across the globe.

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:22.600
But we don't have time for
world peace or politics today,

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.870
I'm afraid-- time
to talk about it.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:27.860
Hopefully we have time
to help make that happen.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.220
I know I've seen a few
folks needing to gather

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.296
their things together and go.

00:56:32.296 --> 00:56:33.670
You say we have
two minutes left?

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:39.190
So we can-- let me give
you the last two minutes

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.980
and ask you, not in the spirit
of advice, but teaching,

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.530
perhaps, what would you
leave us with-- as we

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:52.530
try to do our best
work as folks who

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:57.500
attend to process in a fast
and intelligent and competitive

00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:59.130
organization-- what
would you leave us

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:03.630
with as we go out into our
days and weeks and years?

00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:07.735
ED SCHEIN: I'd come back to
mindfulness, Ellen Langer

00:57:07.735 --> 00:57:09.292
style.

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.778
If you haven't read
Ellen Langer's stuff,

00:57:11.778 --> 00:57:15.670
you really should do
that because she sort of

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:20.350
was the creator of the concept
along these psychological

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:21.890
lines.

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:26.060
And the question that she
asks that I would leave you

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:31.250
with is, whenever
you're in an experience,

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:36.038
stop and say to yourself,
what else is going on?

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.130
There's the thing
that captures you.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:43.520
But what else is going on?

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.060
What else is going on
in this room right now?

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:50.550
What else is going on
between the two of us?

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.400
There's so much of
experience that's available

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.080
that we gloss over or ignore.

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:03.390
And the real learning is often
in the "what else is going on?"

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.985
Thank you.

00:58:03.985 --> 00:58:04.860
KAREN MAY: Wonderful.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.460
ED SCHEIN: This is great.

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.668
KAREN MAY: Thank you so much.

00:58:06.668 --> 00:58:09.070
