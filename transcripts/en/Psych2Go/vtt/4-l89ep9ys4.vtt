00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.080
Sometimes timing isn't always on our side

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.759
We might meet people during significant transitions. We are about to make.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.469
Whether it means traveling overseas or having to stay in one place longer than we expected, life doesn't stop for anyone

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.619
All we can really do is take care of ourselves and get ready for the journey. We are about to begin

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.879
Here are five signs you might not be ready for a long-distance relationship

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.329
One you rely on physical intimacy alone to feel close to your partner

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.860
Does the idea of being far away from your partner scare you? Of course it does and it's okay to admit this.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.480
In fact it's better to ask yourself this question before deciding whether to go through the motions of holding on to a long-distance relationship

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.869
If you need to see your partner every day and rely on physical touch to feel close to them

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.899
Going long-distance may actually do you more harm than good

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.589
The idea of letting go might be scary but the emotional turbulence from being far away from your partner

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.899
Could be a lot more hurtful in the end

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.270
Two you're already facing communication problems with your lover

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.708
Communication is an important aspect that often makes or breaks relationships

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.160
But in long-distance relationships its relied on even more when two people can't communicate in person

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.640
If you're already facing problems in person going long-distance might make matters worse when misunderstandings are common and you rely on technology to communicate

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.799
Three you haven't had the difficult conversations yet

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.050
As lovers learn more about each other over time, their differences can sometimes tear them apart

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.810
Even if you're not ready to have some of the more serious conversations like marriage and children

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.329
You should be clear with each other while you are looking for in a relationship before you take it long distance

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
Four you get jealous easily

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.490
It's normal to have insecurities. Everyone does

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.549
But if you get jealous easily or often get paranoid that your partner will cheat on you with someone else

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.079
Those issues have to be sorted out before the two of you go long-distance

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.239
It's unrealistic to believe that your partner will not speak to or hang out with other people

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.260
While you are apart and you will need to trust that they are staying loyal

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.550
Relationships are built on the foundation of trust and there will only be less when you can't check in in person

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.920
Five you're already having second thoughts about who you're with

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.429
Have you ever dated someone only to find out later that the two of you just aren't as compatible as you thought

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.480
Breakups are hard but it's even harder to stay with someone

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.980
You know isn't right for you

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.569
If you're already hesitating and having a hard time imagining a future together

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.040
Perhaps it's time to sit down with your partner and let them know what's on your mind

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.260
It's okay to be scared, but don't let it hold you back from making an important decision

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.440
You are your first priority and you must surround yourself with whatever feels right for you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.209
