00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.570
In this lecture, we have
seen a particular application

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.230
of sentiment
analysis on Twitter.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.940
However, the area of sentiment
analysis is much broader.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.770
Over 7,000 research articles
have been written on the topic.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.570
Hundreds of start-ups are
developing sentiment analysis

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.610
solutions.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.630
Many websites perform
real-time analysis of tweets.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.870
For example,
"tweetfeel" shows trends

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.300
given any term, and
"The Stock Sonar"

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.820
shows sentiment
and stock prices.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.980
Let's talk about text
analytics a bit more generally.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.210
Sentiment analysis is a
particular application

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.420
of text analytics.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.750
In general, the critical
aspect of text analytics

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.960
is to select the
specific features that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.030
are relevant in a
particular application.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.660
In addition, it's important to
apply specific knowledge that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.360
often leads to better results.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.470
For example, using the meaning
of the symbols or include

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.390
features like the
number of words.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.870
Let's finally discuss
the analytics edge

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.640
that we have seen
in this lecture.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.170
Analytical sentiment
analysis we have seen

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.800
can replace more labor-intensive
methods like polling.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.150
Text analytics can also deal
with the massive amounts

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.789
of unstructured data being
generated on the internet.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.590
Computers are
becoming more and more

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.740
capable of interacting
with humans

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550
and performing human tasks.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.560
In the next lecture,
we'll discuss IBM Watson,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.789
an impressive feat in the
area of text analytics.
