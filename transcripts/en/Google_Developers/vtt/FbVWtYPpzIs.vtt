00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.400
Hi, I'm James Kelly, a product
manager on the Android team.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.550
And I'm here to talk
about Android Work.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.180
Android Work is a
complete solution

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.260
to make Android awesome at work
for employees and businesses.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.700
So let's start with apps.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.220
Android Work has a
unified interaction model

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.150
across both personal
and enterprise apps,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880
which will make it
easier for employees

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.000
to have a single device
for personal use and work.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.840
IT administrators will
be able to make apps

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.350
from Google Play available
to users and groups

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.740
within their organization.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.770
We've enhanced the
Android framework

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.950
so that Android for
work devices offer

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.330
a unified view of
notifications and recents

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.960
in a single launcher across
both personal and work apps.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920
In the launcher, apps will be
badged with the Android work

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.490
logo to indicate to
the app and its data

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.040
are separately and securely
administered by IT.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.400
Android Work has new features
to support organizations

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.850
that allow bring your
own device, or BYOD,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.849
and companies that issue
corporate owned devices

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.890
to employees.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.220
In BYOD, employees use their
Android device for work.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.920
To enable this, an
IT administrator

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.760
can create a secure work
profile on the device

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.140
to separate apps and
data required for work

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.510
from personal apps and data.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.860
We've made enhancements to
unify both personal and work

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.400
apps within the launcher and to
make notifications and recents

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.810
appear for either profile.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.480
This creates a unified
user experience

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.400
but preserves
appropriate separation

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
to enable a secure
environment for business data.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.940
For company owned
devices, IT administrators

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.370
can start with a new device.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.250
And through a simple
provisioning step,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.350
the enterprise is configured
to the devices owner.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.790
A device owner is a special type
of device admin they cannot be

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.010
deactivated.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.470
The company then has full
control of the entire device,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.320
including data and apps.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.390
The Android Work
device owner model

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.290
is designed specifically to
meet the highest requirements

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.910
for remote administration
and security

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.639
and builds on existing
Android concepts

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.550
of device administrator.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.510
For this release,
we've added new APIs

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.630
to accompany the unified user
experience, support Android

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.970
Work profiles, and more.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.630
A set of capabilities for
policy and app management

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.700
will be common across
all Android Work devices.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.640
Let's start with
manage user APIs.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.480
As part of activating
a device for BYOD,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.330
a device policy client app
creates an Android Work profile

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.800
to separate company apps and
data from the personal space.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.830
The Android Work profile is
created only after an employee

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.360
supplies a set of credentials
to their DPC approved by the IT

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.180
admin.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.440
A work profile is
owned by the DPC

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.280
but is associated with the
primary user in such a way

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.010
that notifications and the
recents list are share.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.790
Now moving on to
profile owner APIs.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.210
A profile owner is a special
case of a device administrator

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.010
that has additional
capabilities.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.070
As well as having access to
a number of additional API,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.140
the profile owner cannot be
modified by the primary user.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.300
Profile owners are scoped
to the Android Work profile,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.680
and can only be defined as
part of the Android Work

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.670
provisioning process
approved by the IT admin.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.890
Next, device owner.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.130
A device owner is
like a profile owner,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.780
but scoped to the whole device.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.070
Device owner is an
additional level of privilege

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.560
and is a super set of
profile owner privileges.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.160
Starting only from an
unprovisioned state,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
a device owner can
affect the whole device,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.760
including for
example Wi-Fi access.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.260
All profile owner APIs are
accessible to device owners.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.300
Android Work APIs
will primarily be

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.260
used by mobile device
management developers.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.650
Other types of apps don't
need to designate themselves

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.030
as profile or device owner.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.960
And that's an important point.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.550
To most app developers, Android
Work will be transparent.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.660
So going forward from
this Android release,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.600
you can focus simply on
addressing enterprise needs.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.860
Now, let's turn to Google Play.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.720
Android Work introduces new
ways to support large scale app

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.450
deployment within an
enterprise via Play

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.100
for the Android Work profile.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.060
An IT admin can select which
apps from the Play Store

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.160
are available for
their employees.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.880
And this works whether a
company uses just a few apps

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.260
or hundreds.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.780
Google Play will
offer enterprises

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.760
new options for licensing,
including bulk purchase.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.520
So apps can be purchase and
deployed across organizations

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.050
in a single easy transaction.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.590
As we touched on before,
enterprises normally

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.670
partner with specialist
mobility management companies

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.620
to manage their mixed fleets
of corporate owned and employee

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.226
owned devices.

00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:58.150
And so new APIs on Google
Play allow enterprise mobility

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.610
management, or EMM providers,
to integrate Android device

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.710
management into their
existing products

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.850
or to offer value
added features.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.580
Registered EMM providers can
offer secure authentication

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.690
to enterprise servers, control
access to enterprise apps,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.580
and can set policies
to restrict what

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.510
the user can do within
the work profile.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.610
On the device
itself, Google Play

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.170
will securely provision
apps within the Android work

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.860
profile.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.236
The IT admin has
fine grained controls

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.860
to make apps from
Google Play available

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.610
to individual employees,
groups, or to the whole company.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.440
IT admins can even deploy their
own internally hosted apps

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.080
direct to the work profile
via the Play Store app.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.860
Finally, enterprise
applications sometimes

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.840
have some functionality
which is intended

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.170
to be configured by the IT
admin rather than the end user.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.230
And so we've added
APIs for configuring

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.090
per applications policies.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.920
EMMs can configure per app
policies using the device

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.030
policy client via a new
method in device policy

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.220
manager in the
Android framework.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.650
I hope this was a useful
introduction to Android Work.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.330
We are really excited to work
with our device partners, app

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.760
developers, and business to
help bring the power of Android

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.800
to the office.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.650
For now, we have a
device admin code sample

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.140
and eight API documentation
available in the L Developer

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.460
Preview.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.660
And later this year,
we'll have updates for you

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.190
as the first Android work
devices are announced.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.220
It's been a real privilege
to introduce you to new ways

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.210
to securely work and play
on the devices you love.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.060
And now it's over to
you, so that together,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.920
we can make Android
Work for work.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.570
My name is James Kelly
and thanks for watching.
