00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.880
Five facts you need to know about ADHD. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.480
is a mental disorder that affects the individual's ability to focus.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.980
They may need to move around frequently and might have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.280
According to the American Psychiatric Association, it affects roughly 8% of children and 2% of adults.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.960
Unfortunately many misconceptions are attached to this disorder. For instance, many people believe with medication

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.009
ADHD can be immediately cured or grown out of. Some also commonly believed that it only affects boys,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.829
because they're perceived as rowdy and rambunctious.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.469
We want to educate the public with only the truth and we'd like to offer support to those of you who've been

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.399
diagnosed with it. Here are five facts you need to know about ADHD

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.210
One -

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.210
The symptoms and the signs of ADHD.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.519
First and foremost, we want you to know that it's never a good idea to self-diagnose.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.209
Please visit a health professional in order to receive reliable insight. Signs that doctors often look out for include:

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.970
disorganization, trouble planning ahead,

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.758
impatience, difficulty with following directions

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.290
and an inability to sit still in one place for an extended period of time.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.790
This is more than just a matter of not being disciplined enough; for being messy. An unmade bed or zoning out during a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.970
conversation are not enough to diagnose someone with ADHD.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.438
People with ADHD have trouble learning and often repeat their mistakes.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.500
Instead of losing our patience with them, it's best to approach them in ways that we can help them grow and feel understood

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100
Two - Causes of ADHD.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.620
To this day, researchers still do not know the direct cause of ADHD,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.250
but there has been evidence that shows a link between the disorder and genetics.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.110
Researchers also point out other factors, such as premature birth or the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.659
diagnosed patient's mother facing severe stress or using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.449
Three - Treatment options. Treatment options available for ADHD include

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.560
Medication, counseling, support groups and behavioral therapy. Before deciding which treatment to use, please talk to a health professional.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.320
Dr. Rachel Klein, a professor of psychiatry, notes that the long-term effects of medication for ADHD are still unknown. There is

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.160
also evidence that shows it can suppress the child's appetite which, can affect their physical development. While

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.580
medication has been shown to be most effective by research, children who take it are still at risk to its side-effects.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.940
It's good to be aware of them and know that there isn't just one right treatment option

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.760
We recommend that you explore all before making a commitment.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.500
Remember, you can stop anytime you don't feel comfortable.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.709
Four - What teachers can do. Teachers often complain about troublesome students who may have ADHD.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.129
Instead of punishing them for being disruptive, there are healthier alternative ways to help them learn.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.739
Allowing frequent breaks and promoting playtime is one way to help students with ADHD

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.959
get up and move as they wish. Other helpful tips include encouraging more class

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.419
participation and providing hands-on learning

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.199
opportunities. This can influence

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:28.239
students with ADHD to get excited about being involved in the lesson, whether it means being able to write their answers on the board or

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.260
conducting a science experiment.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.440
Five - What parents can do.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.189
Parents can find it challenging to discipline and teach children with ADHD.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.329
But know that you're not alone and there are support groups you can join. One strategy to use is providing a structured routine.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.019
Children with ADHD have a hard time organizing and completing

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.999
tasks on time. Set a time every day for them to do homework and a time they can play

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.680
Balance is key,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.349
but make sure the routine isn't rigid. Promote

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.750
productivity instead of adding pressure on them. Expect your child to be headstrong and break rules,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.500
but avoid using helicopter parenting. Instead of making decisions for them, give them the freedom to learn from their choices.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.219
