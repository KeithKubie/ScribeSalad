JEREMY STERN: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.440
I'm Jeremy Stern
with Google Fiber,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.400
and welcome to today's
Authors Talks at LAX.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.065
And thanks for
joining us here in LA.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.120
I also want to welcome our
Googlers who are joining us

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.850
via GVC from all
over the country--

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.080
New York City,
Irvine, Playa Vista,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.910
Chicago, Austin,
Kansas City, Sunnyvale,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.710
and even MTV, Mountain View.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.570
I'm super excited to introduce
our Author Talk today,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.550
for a number of reasons.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.480
First, Susan Packard is an
extraordinary leader and media

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.720
innovator.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.680
As co-founder of HGTV and
as COO of Scripps Networks

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.000
International, she
built HGTV into one

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.870
the most widely distributed
cable networks in the country,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.349
100 million households
plus, and turned it

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.740
into a multi-billion
dollar business.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.820
So as author of "New
Rules of the Game,"

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.430
she has a lot to
share with us today

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.790
about competing and
leading successfully

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.350
in today's workplace.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.480
It's also a pleasure,
a deep pleasure,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.190
for me to introduce Susan
as a dear friend of mine.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.400
I've known her for decades,
since the earliest,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
my earliest, days
in the industry.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.270
And I knew back then
she was special.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.510
The way she created
lasting partnerships

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.070
and win-win scenarios for
her distribution partners

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.980
was extraordinary.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.610
And though she
lives in Tennessee,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.440
a long ways from here-- I
don't see her frequently,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.500
but it's truly a blessing
that our friendship always

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370
picks up where it left off.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.210
So let me turn it over to Susan.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.320
And after the talk, we'll take
questions from the audience.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.710
And for those of you
in remote offices,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.340
if you'd like to ask Susan a
question, feel free to ping me,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.800
and I'll try to weave it in.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.220
So, Susan, welcome.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.440
SUSAN PACKARD: Thanks, Jeremy.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.940
Thank you.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.110
Hello, everyone, and
everyone remotely.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.670
I asked Jeremy when I walked in.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.960
He showed me around
a little bit.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.120
And I said, how's it feel to
be everybody's father here?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.730
And he said-- so I'm
thinking to myself,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.190
maybe if I just become
your favorite aunt,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.230
this will all work really well.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.890
But it's true.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.570
We've known each
other quite a while.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.260
I thought I'd start with a
little bit about my background

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.760
beyond what Jeremy
had said, because it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.430
gets into why I wrote the book.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.060
So I've been in the world
of media my whole career.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.000
I left the corporate world
of media four years ago.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.330
I'm a builder, an
entrepreneur, by nature,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.040
which I know you
can all relate to,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.600
and had been on the ground floor
of some formidable brands--

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.820
HBO, CNBC, MSNBC, and then
all the Scripps brands

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.120
that I helped to co-found.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.120
And I found myself at
Scripps for 16 years,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.060
which was amazing to me.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.470
It went by quickly.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.120
And I felt the need to
just start something new,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.010
so I left four years ago.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.210
And at the same time,
a friend of mine,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.230
who's written some
business books,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.830
said, you know,
Susan, you might want

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.270
to write about
your career story,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.520
because it's an interesting one.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.890
And that had me standing
back and thinking,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.340
what were all the factors that
helped to influence my getting

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.950
into top posts in companies?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.901
And that's what the
book's all about.

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.410
It works.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.880
"New Rules of the Game,"
this is not just my story,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.930
but I interviewed a dozen
CEOs, mostly women but some men

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.010
as well.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.460
And all of our stories
are woven into this book.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.230
And it all works
under this uber idea

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.620
that I call
gamesmanship, which is

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.540
a way of expressing
your competitive spirit

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.790
in a healthy way.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.120
And I'll get into that when
we get into the chapters.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.450
So I was a kid raised
in the Midwest.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.430
And I was born with this
enormous competitive drive.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.880
But God's sorry joke
on me, I did not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.550
have one athletic
bone in my body.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.130
So what to do?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.970
So what I ended up
doing is channeling

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.010
this competitive drive into
games, every kind of game--

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.910
board games, card games, video
games, jumping rope games,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.770
although that did test my
dexterity a little bit.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.160
But all of these games.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.930
And I realized that
there's a lot that we

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.040
can learn from playing games.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.600
But something happened
to me in middle school

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.220
and into high
school that happens

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.430
to a lot of little girls.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.310
We start getting
socialized to tamp down

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.780
our competitive spirit.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.590
And then in addition
to that, many of us

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.910
didn't grow up
playing team sports

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.610
with at least the intensity or
frequency of the little boys.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.060
And I'm going to put the
big disclaimer on right now.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.940
I've spoken to a lot
of mixed audiences,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.230
and I realize that I
am generalizing here.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.690
Lots of little boys didn't
grow up playing sports,

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.410
and lots of girls
made Olympic teams.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.680
But overall, when you take a
snapshot of the marketplace

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.730
today, this is what it is.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.502
So we didn't learn how to
play team sports growing up.

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:36.730
So what ends up
happening is that you

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.110
come into the workplace
as adults, men and women,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.550
and your points of view
on competing, and winning,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.520
and losing are very different.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.440
And so what the book does
is it bridges that gap so

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.070
that it can help the
reader to advance.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.800
And it's really interesting.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.100
All this being ladylike at
work, it plays itself out

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.510
in a lot of subtle ways,
and it plays itself out

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.530
around gender
roles specifically.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.440
So I thought it was intriguing
that a couple of weeks

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.050
ago, Michelle Obama-- she
gave a commencement speech.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.560
And she said in
talking about her work

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.830
as First Lady-- she was
reflecting on it, and she said,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.730
was I too loud and emasculating?

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.770
Was I too soft?

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.210
And so you have
the highest office

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.510
in the land, the most senior
woman in the world, arguably,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.740
and she's thinking about it.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.000
And I'm sure she's
thinking about it

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.400
as she's raising her daughters,
what this all looks like.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.690
And so it's a little bit of
a muddled mess, if you will.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.860
I remember when we
were starting out HGTV,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.790
and I was having drinks one
night with a girlfriend.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.820
And she was in
business, and we were

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.030
talking about this
whole new business

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.504
that I was on the
ground floor of,

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:07.920
and I was going
to help to create,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.230
and my career, and
all these things.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:17.090
And she stopped, and she
said, you know, Susan,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.100
you're really ambitious.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.670
And I had one of those
moments of, well, that's rude!

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.700
But then I thought to
myself, now wait a minute.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.270
I mean, even I'm
buying into some

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.170
of this double standard stuff.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.330
So it does befall us.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.550
And advancing, as we
move up, it becomes

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.720
trickier for women because
of all kinds of things.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.370
And we'll get into that.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.950
So I am not suggesting that
women act like men at work.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.450
That would be really
counterproductive.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.860
But what I am suggesting is
that you think like and act

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.620
like an athlete would.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.980
And I had to learn this,
because I wasn't one of those.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.200
But by that I mean
composed, confident,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.020
having mental
fortitude, thinking like

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.730
and acting like a winner.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.310
And you may have
heard the phrase,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.780
you fake it till you make it?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.460
I did a lot of faking
it along the way--

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.250
not feeling like a winner
but acting like a winner.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.220
Because I realized that,
especially for women,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.659
we're looked at and
scrutinized a little bit more

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.409
than the guys are in terms of
whether we can carry ourselves

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.490
as leaders.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.630
And trust me, I'm half
Greek and half Italian.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.250
None of this came
easily, but I learned it,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.950
so I know that the reader can.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.860
And hopefully you all
will be reading the book,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.500
and if it is an issue for you,
you'll be able to learn it too.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.840
So the 10 strategies
under gamesmanship.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.280
The first seven are skills and
behaviors, and the last three

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.230
deal with emotional maturity.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.710
And that takes us
from worker to leader.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.610
So I'll go through
each of these.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.970
Conditioning, just
like an athlete

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.930
needs to condition
their body for game day,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.900
so too do we need to have
conditioning skills if we want

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.640
a senior leadership position.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.260
And again, another
disclaimer-- not everyone

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.530
wants a senior
leadership position.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.460
I get it.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.300
But if you do, here
are the three skills

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:43.050
that I write about
in the book-- line

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.780
experience, financial knowledge,
and having a global view.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.320
So what's line experience?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.770
And I have to tell you, I've
done a lot of universities

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.250
with this talk.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.180
And this is the one that really
resonates for young adults,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.900
because it's not something
you necessarily think about.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.790
Line experience,
these are the jobs

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.650
that directly impact the
profitability of your company.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.670
Usually, there's a revenue
component attached,

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.990
but not always.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.670
So sales is the easiest one.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.730
It's clear.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.220
It's a line job.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.900
Marketing can be a line job.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.930
It's a little grayer.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.820
Products jobs, where you're
creating products and creating

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.690
services to push the
profitability of your company--

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.780
all of those are line jobs.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.710
And in my book, I've got a lot
of different examples of it.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.610
So if you want a
senior position,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.990
having this operating and line
experience is very important.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.830
So that's what that's about.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.590
Second, financial
knowledge-- I did not

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.210
have one finance class in
undergraduate or graduate

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.200
school.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.510
I learned it all on the job.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.760
But what happened to me is
in middle management, when

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.270
I was at CNBC, somebody handed
me an income statement, right?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.980
And I went uh-oh.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.530
I need to learn this.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.160
So I asked to be sent somewhere.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.600
So they sent me to UVA
Darden, and I was there

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.100
for a week or two,
taking some finance.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.780
And I learned enough to get by.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:16.430
And then once I was in my
job, I became more conversant

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.660
because I was speaking
to shareholders.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.040
And I needed to be
more conversant.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.940
So this is all stuff you can
learn, especially if you're

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.650
a publicly traded company.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.000
It's all there.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.990
And you don't need to understand
the SEC rules of reporting.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.640
Your accounting people do that.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.230
But what do you do
need to understand

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.210
is what's an income statement?

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.510
What's a balance sheet?

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.170
Because these are the
language of business.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.340
And the third one,
a global view--

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.380
I started the international
department at HGTV,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.710
and traveled the world, and
learned how important having

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.300
a global view is.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.030
This helped me to
appreciate diversity

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.840
beyond gender
diversity, diversity

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.460
that's cultural diversity
around the senior table

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.250
and how important that is.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.700
So this is another one
that, for all of you who

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.890
are thinking about
senior leadership roles,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.350
I mean, clearly
the world is where

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.090
we're going to be pushing
our top line growth.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.480
OK, so those are
conditioning skills.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:23.980
And see?

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.894
I'm going back.

00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:26.310
I thought I wouldn't
be caught up.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.380
OK, let me push forward here.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.680
Composure.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.710
Composure, and I talked a
little bit about this earlier.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.740
So composure is both
how we carry ourselves

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.350
and how we communicate.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.780
And in terms of how you
carry yourself, as a woman,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.680
there is more scrutiny
about whether you

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.546
can make-- it's all about
how we're so emotional.

00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:51.920
And because we're
so emotional we

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.680
can't make
well-reasoned decisions.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.260
And so how you carry
yourself is very important.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.800
And I had to learn this
one, as I said earlier.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.210
Deep breaths.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.770
In the book, I talk
about all kinds of ways.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.560
Sleep, getting enough sleep.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.210
These kinds of things
really impact whether or not

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.100
you're going to be
composed on the job.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.320
So that's carriage.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.090
And words, it's
kind of interesting,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.490
but McKinsey did a study.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:27.460
And they said that, on average,
women speak 20,000 words a day,

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.080
and men speak 7,000 words a day.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.150
And so you wonder why we
have this communication gap

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.190
sometimes.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.490
And what it is is
brevity, clarity.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.510
These kinds of things I learned.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.850
The easiest thing for me was
to just talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.530
But I was always with men.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.570
My whole career, I was side
by side with men, not women.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.930
And so I could tell
when I lost them.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.670
I mean, it didn't
take much for me

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.730
to get the guys to tune me out.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:05.150
So what I had to learn is how to
be crystal clear, and just very

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.050
less is more.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.850
Brevity is more.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.860
And I want to read-- one
of the women I interviewed,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.910
Pat Mitchell.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.910
She was the CEO of
PBS and a number

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.510
of other media companies.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.175
And she worked for Ted Turner.

00:14:20.175 --> 00:14:22.300
And I don't know if you've
all heard of Ted Turner,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.120
but he was Turner Broadcasting.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.910
He's kind of iconic.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.580
So she's describing
her first meeting

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.060
with Ted, her first
on the job experience.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.580
And she said, the first
meeting I had with Ted,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.480
he cut me off after
about three sentences.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.230
And I thought, wait a minute.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.380
I'm not through.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.550
I did all this work.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.700
I've got all this
presentation done.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.330
I'm ready to tell you more.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.770
And he said, I'm not
ready to hear it.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.500
Meeting over.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.930
I was so upset.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.950
I went back to my office and was
writing my resignation letter.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.650
Because I was thinking,
I'm 40-something years old.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.460
I've been in this
business 20 years,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.890
and I'm not going to have
somebody just say no.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.180
Then he called me on
the phone, and he said,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.310
I know you're upset.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.330
Why are you upset?

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.160
And she said, because nobody
since my father told me no

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.220
and they didn't
have to explain why.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.860
And he said, well, that's
just the way I operate.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.830
I'm going to be very decisive,
and you'll get a yes or no.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.150
It's just the way I operate.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.990
And she finishes the story
by saying the training

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.990
I got from him was invaluable.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.690
I learned how to present my
case very quickly and very

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.470
succinctly.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.980
And speed's our
enemy, and so that's

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:44.070
another reason why our ability
to be very clear and brief

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.980
is important.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.320
So that's what
composure is all about.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.820
OK.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.960
Rule three, offense.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.620
So playing offense,
if you're an athlete,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.280
is scoring points
for your team, right?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.580
So playing offense
for a company is

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.260
scoring points for your company,
making money for your company

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:15.530
through deals, new partnerships,
new products and services.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.890
All of these are
playing offense.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.880
So playing offense is showing
your company the money

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.720
you can make for them.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.970
Which always reminds me of
a clip from an old movie.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.820
Have any of you seen
"Jerry Maguire"?

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.140
OK, so I'm going to set
this up for you in case

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.430
you don't remember.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.940
Jerry Maguire's lost
all-- he's a sports agent.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.210
He's lost all of his clients
except one, Cuba Gooding, Jr.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.629
And Cuba Gooding, Jr. knows he's
got Jerry by the short hairs.

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:50.920
Showing your company the money.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.660
And that's what offense,
playing offense is all about.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.960
However, see, one
of the funny things

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.270
that can happen with
women is we have

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.910
to ask if we want
to be successful.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.109
We have to ask for resources,
for people, for technology--

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.920
all of these things
to do the best jobs

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.329
we can do for our companies.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.700
But how we ask-- see,
there's lots of B words

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.730
that can be assigned us, of
which boss is the nicest one.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.829
So how we ask
makes a difference.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.030
And in the book, I
talk about something

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.540
called artful assertiveness.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.359
So that's a way of asking that
doesn't break somebody's back.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.720
And this is how I
learned about this, OK.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.940
So it was sort of
fed back to me.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.730
A woman named Robin and I
had-- let me set this up.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:44.915
So I had to assign offices
and cubes for everyone

00:17:44.915 --> 00:17:48.810
at HGTV, which is a miserable
thing to have to do.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.120
There is no winning in
that kind of a thing.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.630
But anyway, I did that.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.077
So Robin knocks on my
door, and she says,

00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.910
Susan, I want to talk
to you about why I got

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.890
a cube rather than an office.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.110
And OK, go for it.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.220
And she proceeds to
tell me about her job.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.920
So she said, my job, one of
the things that I do is train.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.550
And training is going to be
noisy, because I'm in a cube.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.700
Another thing that
I am responsible for

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.130
is partnerships, which are
confidential conversations.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.680
I'll have to find some privacy.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.610
So she had four or five
reasons, all of which

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.040
were for the good
of the company.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.040
There wasn't one moment
where I heard whining.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.379
You know, Johnny got an office.

00:18:36.379 --> 00:18:36.920
Why didn't I?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.750
None of that.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.360
Nothing was personal.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.170
And so what I learned
from that experience

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.830
is what I call
artful assertiveness.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.250
So you have to ask,
but always frame it

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.250
like it's good for the company.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.440
And you can do that, because
if you're not asking something

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.350
that's not good for
the company, then

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.310
you're probably going
to get a no anyway.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.320
And that's just a really
much easier way for you

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.150
to play offense.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.960
OK.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.380
So brinksmanship strategies.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.700
This is the game
of negotiations.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.530
And I've always been chief
negotiator at every company

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.840
I've ever worked with.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.160
And it was so kind of Jeremy
to say that I was always

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.910
into win-wins.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.770
So here's the difference.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.470
I negotiated with
men my whole career.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.790
And my experience
with men was they're

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.730
into win-lose, no hard feelings.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:40.200
Women are into win-win, but
there usually is a lose.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.470
And when there is a lose,
there can be hard feelings.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.200
So how do you bridge that?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.580
And I want to show
you a piece of film

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.760
from a movie from
a couple of years

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.281
ago called "Arbitrage"
with Richard Gere.

00:19:52.281 --> 00:19:54.030
I don't know if any
of you saw that movie,

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.590
but he's trying to sell his
company to this gentleman.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.000
And he's not moving
fast enough, so he's

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.200
called this breakfast
meeting to see

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.330
if he can get some resolution.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.590
It may be a little extreme,
that piece of tape, but I mean,

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.599
I know if I was sitting
in that restaurant

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.140
and watching those
two, I would think

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.320
that they despised one another.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.570
And at the end of that,
they both shake hands

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.360
and say they made a good deal.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.320
So that is one thing I learned.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.970
It's that in
negotiations, there's

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.190
a lot of what I call theater.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.810
And it's too bad,
but it is what it is.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.200
And once you realize
that, then it

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.900
becomes much easier
for you to do deals.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:45.030
Now, I talk about four key moves
in negotiating-- the walk away,

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.940
the bluff, sizing up
the room, and the tell.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.770
And they're all
from playing cards.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.030
I mean, playing poker?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.660
I learned all of my
negotiating strategies

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.920
from playing cards and poker.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.500
But the walk away's the only one
I'm going to talk about today.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.420
The walk away is folding your
hand if you have a bad hand.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.490
We have to be able to walk
away in a negotiation.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.390
Otherwise, it's
not a negotiation.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.070
We're negotiating
against ourselves.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.420
So always ask yourself.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.590
If you are in a
position where you're

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:23.590
being empowered to negotiate for
your company, what's the floor?

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.290
If you know what the floor is,
it's really easy to walk away.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.760
And this is what
I would always do,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.810
is I would go to my
management, and I'd

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.440
say, OK, what's the floor?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.820
What's the range?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.160
And then once I knew that, I
walked away plenty of times

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.810
from deals.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.440
And somebody would call me
back, and we would reengage.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.870
But you have to be
willing to do it

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.890
And I'm going to read
one other excerpt

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.110
from the book, a woman named
Ronee Hagen I interviewed.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:57.650
She was CEO of Polymer, which
is an industrials company,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.880
multi-billion dollar company.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.100
And she told me this
story about walking away.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.350
"I was recruited to a
position, and the company

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.540
made me an offer that I thought
was below what I was worth.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.560
I told them they had
a wonderful company,

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.290
but I would not be interested in
the salary range they offered.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.630
I then offered to give them some
less experienced candidates who

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.310
might be interested
in the pay level.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.590
In less than two
hours, they came back

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.470
with a much richer offer.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.730
The biggest negotiating
leverage you ever have

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.160
is to be able to walk away."

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.510
And ladies, we're still
$0.72 on the dollar.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:44.170
So when you're negotiating
for salary and compensation,

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.480
you have to be
willing to walk away.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.200
And I realize that
we need jobs, right?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.850
We have to pay our bills.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.060
But this is just an
important principle

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.100
that I want to leave with you.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.600
The rest of these things you
can read about in the book.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.790
OK, fan clubs.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.450
This is the essence of it.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.340
if you don't remember anything
else, the importance of fan

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:15.750
clubs, and by that I mean
building a network beyond just

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.670
the four walls of
your department,

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.300
the importance of
building your network.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.540
And this is one that I think
men do a much better job

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.020
of than women do.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.520
And I learned to do
it by watching men.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.860
Your supervisor is really,
at the end of the day,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.960
not all that important
to your career.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.260
Which may sound crazy, but
they're only one person

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.030
in your company, right?

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.470
And it may be that they
review you and all that stuff,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.170
but what's important is
getting to know others

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:59.400
in your company who can
help you to advance--

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.910
building a network.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.600
Success and likeability are
positively correlated for men

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.230
and negatively
correlated for women.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.860
Stanford research, it just
keeps being validated.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.450
And I could stand
up here and tell you

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.550
all the reasons why that is.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.910
I don't think it's
important why it is.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.040
What's important is
what do you do about it?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.520
And what you do about it
is you build a network.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:30.660
And you do that by taking
somebody to lunch or coffee,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.430
asking for somebody's
help that's

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.550
not in your four walls
of your department

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.630
that can help you
with a project,

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.070
signing up for cross functional
teams and task forces.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.030
All of these things get
you outside the confines

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.010
of your job and help you
to build relationships.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:54.560
And those are all important
elements of advancement.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.600
Oh, I've got to talk
about that for a second.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.930
So this is the media, of which
I've been a part all my career.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.490
They're some of
the worst offenders

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.740
when it comes to women and
issues around women leaders.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.980
So this was the headline
when Marissa Mayer first got

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:18.050
into her job at Yahoo and had
her first earnings report.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:23.460
"Yahoo CEO's Pregnancy
Overshadows Flat Revenue."

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.630
When I saw that, I was
just flabbergasted.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.910
And that's the media.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.780
And I wrote a letter
to the editor, which

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.650
of course didn't get posted.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.290
But it made me crazy.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.970
OK.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.470
So build your network.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.630
Six, practice,
practice, practice.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.330
Some of you may have read
the Malcolm Gladwell book,

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.920
and he talks about 10,000
hours to be made an expert.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.230
That's a lot of hours, right?

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:58.240
I mean, your career is a
marathon, not a sprint.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.880
And when I work
with young adults--

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.590
and I have a 24-year-old, so I
know a little bit of what goes

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.780
on-- there's an impatience.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.530
And I get that, because
I'm sure that when

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.670
I was in my 20s and early
30s I was impatient too.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.620
And I wanted to keep
moving, and I wanted

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.870
to have a lot of career growth.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:29.880
But the fact is we want to
be X before we're prepared.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.700
We want to know why
before we've learned it.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.500
And it just takes time.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.680
And so I would ask all
of you to just-- I mean,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.460
you're at a wonderful
organization.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.200
Have fun.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.530
Enjoy every day instead
of always thinking about,

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.560
well, why aren't I this,
or why aren't I that?

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.300
Because your career
just takes time.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.900
I was 39.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.870
I was COO at 39, which
in traditional business

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.900
is pretty young.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.620
And I was too young.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.430
I had a lot of growing up to do.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.460
So these things take time.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.105
Cross training.

00:27:08.105 --> 00:27:09.040
Yeah.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.130
So one thing that I
advocate in the book

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.120
is called cross training.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.090
And by that I mean
lateral moves.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.310
There is no longer a
ladder up to the top.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.000
It's more like a jungle gym.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.280
And lateral moves
are broadening.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.480
I did a bunch of them.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.110
When I was in my
20s for HBO, I was

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.500
in four different offices
with the same job,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.580
just meeting different clients.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.010
And I did a bunch of them.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.160
And people within
SNI, the company

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.510
that I helped to co-found,
they do it all the time.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.500
And many are sitting around
the executive table now.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.070
Lateral moves, think about that.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.410
It's broadening.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.970
I have not met
one CEO who is not

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.340
a broad composite of skills.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.860
So something to think about.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.570
OK, suit up.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.320
This is a light chapter.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.470
It's about wardrobe.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.470
And I wrote it and thought
my editor would just toss it.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.570
But she not only
kept it in, what

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.500
I have found is
every interview I've

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.000
been on with this
book, even CNN asked

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.380
about this chapter on wardrobe.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.740
So I guess it's still
on people's minds.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.460
And there are a couple
of things that I

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.350
recommend in this chapter
for women in wardrobe.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.830
One is not to dress
provocatively.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.830
Now, I mean freedom of
expression and all of that.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:43.510
But I've had plenty of
conversations with women

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.610
about what they're wearing.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.950
And a lot of times, you
just don't even realize it.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.053
Not dress provocatively.

00:28:51.053 --> 00:28:52.802
There's no such thing
as provocative dress

00:28:52.802 --> 00:28:54.470
for men, ladies.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.710
If you walk into a
meeting and a man

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.890
has three buttons
unbuttoned on his shirt,

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.130
he's probably one
of my relatives.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.070
No one cares.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.850
But if it happens to you, it
could really spell disaster.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.870
And the other is-- and I'm not
going to get into this story.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.670
This is a very
embarrassing story.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.670
It's in the book-- about the
need for full length mirrors.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.700
So invest in full length
mirrors, and actually use them.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.500
Because they can come in handy.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.980
OK, so those are the seven,
a very abbreviated form

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.150
of the seven rules.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.940
And the last three are about--
it's part two of the book.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.000
It's about emotional maturity.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.710
And I could spend another
couple hours up here on that.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.710
In fact, tomorrow
I'm giving a TED talk

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.140
at UCLA on emotional maturity.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.750
There's a lot to say.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.540
I use three metaphors
in sports language.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.770
One, about good sportsmanship.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.260
And I talk about, I tell
stories about people,

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.380
including me, who
lost jobs to others.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.920
And by handling the
whole thing well,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.050
it ended up being wonderful
for our respective careers.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.660
So good sportsmanship.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.750
Grit, which is
essentially resilience,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.350
being able to push through
fears in tough life situations

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.540
to get to the other
side, and look

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.875
at what the learning could be.

00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:22.750
The worst thing is when
you're in the middle,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.050
and you're paralyzed by it.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.180
So pushing to the other side.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.740
And then team play,
in which I talk

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:34.980
about things like the importance
of girlfriends, which I forgot

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.310
as I was making my career rise.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.170
And the other things I
talk about in team play

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.980
is importance of culture.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.570
And Google has a very
pronounced culture.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.580
And you're either going to
love it working here or not.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.810
It was the same with
places I worked.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.530
There was one place I worked
I talk about in the book.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.020
The culture was terrible,
and I had to leave.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.520
But here's the great news.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.230
And I'm going to tell
it by way of this photo.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.580
So we're the founding
team of Home and Garden

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.040
Television and Scripps
Networks Interactive.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.930
We called a meeting before
we were even on the air.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.776
And it's probably the
most important meeting

00:31:16.776 --> 00:31:17.400
we've ever had.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.510
This picture, by the way,
was taken last August.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.570
We were celebrating 20
years of being on the air.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.860
And we wanted to define
the work community.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.380
We wanted to figure out
how we were going to engage

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.320
with each other successfully.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.100
And words like-- we ended
up with core values.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.440
Core values like work-life
balance, diversity,

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.130
shared responsibility,
compassion, support--

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:48.740
many of these that may sound as
if they skew gender female are

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.280
the core values of the company.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.360
And trust me, there was a
lot of debate about those.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.790
But what I learned
is that because I

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.860
had a seat of
authority at the table

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.640
I could help to influence
the creation of a culture

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.130
that today is very inclusive,
radically inclusive.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:17.170
In fact, I have a quote from
Richard Rohr, whose book

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.160
"Rising Upward," in it, in he
says, "Those who are not true

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.660
leaders will just affirm people
at their own immature level.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.620
And of course, immature people
will love them and elect them

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.650
for being equally immature.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.500
If you have grown
in maturity, you

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.760
are able to be patient,
radically inclusive,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.020
and understanding."

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:44.080
And today, the senior table at
the company I helped to create

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.580
doesn't look like that.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.180
It's about half
male, half female,

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.300
with two people of color.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.970
We're still working
on that part.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.750
So I know it can be done.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.792
You can create these
kinds of cultures.

00:32:56.792 --> 00:32:58.500
But you have to have
a seat at the table.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.940
So the book is about providing
some strategies, insights,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.840
hopefully a little inspiration
to help you realize whatever

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.330
your career dreams are.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.570
So that's it.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.159
And now I guess we'll go
to Q&amp;A if there is any Q&amp;A.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:15.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.741
Thank you for being here.

00:33:16.741 --> 00:33:18.370
That was really great.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.020
You had mentioned that when
you were 39, you became COO.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.850
And you said that was too early.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.335
Were there-- now that you
look back, are you like, god,

00:33:27.335 --> 00:33:29.124
I wish I'd just come
two years later,

00:33:29.124 --> 00:33:30.790
and I would have been
so ready for that?

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.020
Or are you happy that it
happened that way because it

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.037
just forced you to grow.

00:33:34.037 --> 00:33:34.870
SUSAN PACKARD: Yeah.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.170
It's a great question,
and it's timely.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.090
So these were the guys that were
surrounding me when I was COO.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.670
And many were a little
bit older and a lot wiser.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.360
So because I had this
incredible team around me,

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.080
I was OK in saying
yes to the job.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.250
I knew that I'd had the support
I needed to make it work.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.500
But that's something you
have to take into account.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.980
Who are your teammates?

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.250
Who can complement you?

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.470
And no one is everything.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.630
So you have to have people
help and complement you.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.090
AUDIENCE: Maybe a follow
up to that same question.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.929
Sorry.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.451
How do you know
that you don't know?

00:34:21.451 --> 00:34:23.034
How do you know that
you're not ready?

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.120
SUSAN PACKARD: Well,
for me, it was just

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.480
a question of when I would
go into an experience,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.540
a new experience, with
business, a meeting

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.090
or a strategy question.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.699
Not so much strategy questions,
but more life experience issues

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.810
and people issues.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.429
So for example, one of
the things we did early on

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:52.210
is we flew a lot of
people and their families

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.020
to relocate to Knoxville,
Tennessee, which

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.020
is where we're based.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.420
Small town.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.530
And some of these
didn't work out

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.910
So here we've relocated
an entire family.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:07.340
And it was really-- those were
some of the hardest things

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.930
that I ever had to deal with.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:12.030
And so I learned
from that experience,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.890
really the only way you can
know what you don't know

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.180
is to just try it.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.200
And yeah, upon reflection,
what did I do right

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.890
and how could I have
done that differently?

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.550
But you have to act.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.527
I mean, the most important
thing-- all of you

00:35:28.527 --> 00:35:29.360
are entrepreneurial.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.770
You're at Google.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.830
Always take action.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.240
Don't get stuck in the muck.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.880
You're welcome.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.650
It was great.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.810
I guess my question is
a lot of the rhetoric,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.550
as I understood it, was you
have to play the game in order

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.450
to get ahead.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.660
How can we change the game?

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.630
What are some steps
we can take to make it

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.355
so that I can have three
buttons on my shirt

00:35:56.355 --> 00:35:59.980
unbuttoned without people
judging me or judging

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.910
my ability?

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:01.800
SUSAN PACKARD: Right.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.670
I know you were being
facetious there,

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.230
but I'm not sure
that'll ever change

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.700
when you're working with men.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.180
But this is why I
ended with this story.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:16.620
So ways for you to get advanced
in companies like the book,

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.750
like cross training, like
more skill development,

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.000
once you get a
seat at the table,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.240
you can change the culture.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.220
But you have to get
a seat at the table.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.170
So that's what the
book's all about.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.300
You guys, it'll
be faster for you.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.480
You won't have to
be 39-years-old.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.950
But you might have to be
35-years-old or older than you

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.930
are right now to get
that seat at the table.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.020
And you're going to
change it that way.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.770
A lot of students, when I
go to different universities

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.170
to speak-- Stanford,
one of the students

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:01.460
said that he hopes that his
CEO will be 23-years-old.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.923
And I said, it's going to
be a pretty unusual CEO that

00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:07.970
can be 23 and do what
needs to be done.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.170
It just takes time to grow.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.020
So changing it from
underneath, you

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.010
have cultures that
are so hard to move.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.405
But you can create new cultures.

00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:20.030
You're welcome.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.040
Hello.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.610
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.690
There are so many ways
to approach this issue.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.880
And I like yours, because
it's digestible and something

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.240
we can do ourselves.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.580
And I was an athlete,
so I love this.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:42.670
But this has been a
hot topic for a while,

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.950
and recently I've seen
things coming out.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.290
They're more systemic solutions.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.680
Get the men involved.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.150
Change the whole culture.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.496
Change the work
policies, et cetera.

00:37:52.496 --> 00:37:53.870
And that seems a
little different

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.810
than your suggestions.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.305
So what do you think about
those systemic ideas?

00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:58.180
SUSAN PACKARD: Right.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.750
It is all of the above.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.460
Diversity Core, I read
about what you all

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.250
are doing with that.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.958
And that sounds like
a wonderful program.

00:38:03.958 --> 00:38:07.810
Programs inside the
organization are very important.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.050
What I was saying is just
from a pragmatic standpoint,

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.990
to be able to help
that change, I

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.330
believe you need to be seated
in a position of influence

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.530
in the company.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:25.650
And you can participate
in these systemic things,

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.470
but eventually, when you get
to even manager level, where

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.310
you have some people
that you're managing,

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.890
all of those ways of you to make
a difference in the company.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.220
So it's all of the above.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.070
It takes all of the above.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.830
One of the things
I did at SNI was

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.990
I created flex policies there.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.640
They didn't exist.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.900
But I was in a seat of
authority to do that.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.410
But it doesn't
mean today you all

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.080
can't tell your management
this isn't working.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.900
These flex policies or
whatever it is, job shares,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.220
telecommuting.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.280
Some of these things
can be difficult.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.160
You can talk to your
management about it,

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.650
but I guess what I'm saying
is the easiest way, believe it

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.900
or not, is to advance
yourself in your company

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.512
and to get in a
position of influence.

00:39:14.512 --> 00:39:15.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.470
SUSAN PACKARD: You're welcome.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.170
Everything you were
saying rings very true.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:31.560
And I've heard women
say time and time again,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.537
well, we can't win.

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.620
I'm just here to have fun.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.530
I'm not here to win.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:36.988
Well, of course
you're here to win.

00:39:36.988 --> 00:39:39.690
Why are you playing in the first
place, is my response back.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:46.420
But you lay things out very
simply with the 10 steps.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.050
And I was wondering
how you contrast

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.020
that to something like
Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In"

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.220
and the difference you see
there in what your philosophy is

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.980
versus what she had put forth.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.460
SUSAN PACKARD: Right.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.500
I thought her book was
great, and her book did

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.580
a lot of focusing on our
self-defeating behaviors

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.281
and how we can overcome them.

00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:09.030
And what I was trying
to do with this book

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.280
is to provide an offensive
strategy, if you will.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.230
Instead of focusing
so much on how

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.260
we're defeating
ourselves is to say here

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.550
are all the things we can
do to get into positions

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.780
of advancement in companies.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.950
And it's my take.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.050
I mean, there are other
books with other takes on it,

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.970
but this was my experience and
validated by the CEO interviews

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:32.900
I did.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.610
So I guess it's the
difference between a focus

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.520
on self-defeating.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.490
That's not all she
does, and we should.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.660
I mean, that's important.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.165
But also an offensive strategy.

00:40:48.165 --> 00:40:49.415
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:40:49.415 --> 00:40:50.665
SUSAN PACKARD: You're welcome.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.590
Yes, Jeremy?

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.170
JEREMY STERN: So you've been
on this whirlwind book tour

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.060
now since February?

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.090
SUSAN PACKARD: Mhm.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:08.290
JEREMY STERN: Been all over the
country to some amazing places.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.972
What's resonated?

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:12.180
What have you found has
resonated with your audiences

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.763
about the book and
about your message?

00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:19.730
SUSAN PACKARD: While I've
spoken to mixed groups,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.190
the majority of the groups
I've spoken to are all women.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.150
And when all women
are together, there's

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.480
a real let down your
hair kind of thing.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.670
In the book on the
chapter on grit,

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.850
for example, I talk about
some very difficult situations

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.160
I had in my 20s.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.690
One was being
assaulted in a hotel.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.340
These kinds of things
that getting together

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.840
and to talk about those things
from a practical standpoint?

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.550
I mean, who teaches you
how to travel on the job?

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.210
Nobody taught me.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.470
And so I was really naive.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:02.050
And when I've talked about
those things on the road,

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:05.270
and we've had open forums
to talk about them,

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:11.120
it's been remarkable how
quickly women have responded

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.830
with their own
thoughts about how

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:18.940
they need to have
safe kinds of systems

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.310
in place for when they
travel and hadn't thought

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.380
about it before.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.640
Line experience I
mentioned early.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.930
Not something that anyone
young in their career

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.220
had really thought about.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.870
So I think the things that
have resonated for me the most

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:36.280
is to be able to provide a
little bit of new insight

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.570
to the audiences.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:45.140
And I've been really pleased
with what I've heard back.
