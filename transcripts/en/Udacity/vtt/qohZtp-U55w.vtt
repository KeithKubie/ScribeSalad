00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.350
The answer to this would be about 85%. Now

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.420
the reason for this, is that you're about 70%

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.820
identical to a random person. You, with your IBS

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.480
score. So this is the background. You're 100% identical to

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.225
you. So there's a difference of 30% in here.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:19.320
Would you know that for any given parent, you're half

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.400
related to a parent. So in a sense, all

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.810
we have to do is take half of the difference

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.130
of this 30% and we get essentially, roughly

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.960
the IBS score between you and a parent.
