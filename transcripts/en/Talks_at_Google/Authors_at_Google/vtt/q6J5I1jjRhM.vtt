00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.982
SARAH: Kate Kerrigan is a New
York Times best-selling author

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:04.694
living and working in Ireland.

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:06.860
Her novels include international
bestseller "Recipes

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.910
for a Perfect Marriage," which
has been translated into 15

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.955
language, and the
"Irish-American Ellis Island

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:13.770
Trilogy."

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.590
Her latest novel "The Dress"
is published by Head of Zeus

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.350
this month.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.160
So Kate is actually the
pen name of Morag Prunty.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.882
Morag left school at 15,
worked in a hairdressing salon

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:31.210
for four years before entering
the world of women's magazines.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.810
Went on to become
the youngest ever

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.580
person to edit a
national magazine

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.895
and an award winning
editor of iconic titles

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.940
as "More" and "Just
Seventeen" during which time

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.651
you helped launch the
career of "Take That,"

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.658
which is very interesting.

00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:47.991
In 1991-- I'm sure we'll have
more questions about that,

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:50.610
but let's talk about the book.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.130
In 1991, you walked
out of a media career

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.340
to fulfill a personal
ambition to move to Ireland,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.130
where you became the
editor of "Irish Tattler."

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.015
During that tenure, Morag
began to write to fiction,

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.020
and then, in 2000, had
her first book published

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.600
under her own name,
"Dancing with Mules,"

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.907
which earned an unprecedented
advance from Pan

00:01:10.907 --> 00:01:14.070
Macmillan in the UK and
Harper-Collins in the US.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.292
In 2006, tired of
writing comedy,

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.125
Kate changed her style
of writing completely

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:22.490
to a more serious and emotional
tone and became Kate Kerrigan.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.780
So I'm really interested to
hear about that change as well.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.510
And in your new novel,
"The Dress, Kate

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.551
references her magazine
days with a dual timeline

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:32.430
story of a magnificent
[INAUDIBLE] gown

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.600
made in the 1950s
New York, which

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.710
is replicated by a young vintage
blogger in present day London.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.090
So Kate's here today to
talk about her career

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.560
journey, including,
I have "Take That"

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.968
wearing S&amp;M gear for
their first big gig,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:48.820
working in magazines
before computers

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.110
and what it takes these days
to become a published author.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.597
She will also hopefully
share some of her new novel

00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:55.430
"The Dress" with us.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.500
So thank you all.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.940
KATE KERRIGAN: Thanks.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.930
Thanks a million, Sarah.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.721
And I don't know what
I'm going to say now.

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.580
I think that's just
about said it all.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.170
Well, I was thinking
this morning, first, what

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.470
am I going to wear into Google?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.970
You know?

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.680
What am I going to-- And then
what could I possibly talk

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.940
about to people that work
in this fascinating industry

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.710
about myself that would
be of any interest?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.640
And so what I thought I'd do is
just run through my own career

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.460
and how I came to
become a writer.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.120
Because it's a strange job.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.940
When I tell people
that I'm a writer,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.780
people always are just very
interested in that fact alone.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.375
And the first thing they
usually say is, oh my god.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.750
Where do you get
your ideas from?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.110
How do you come up
with ideas for books?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.026
They usually say that.

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:49.240
Or quite often they
also say, oh, I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.970
would like to write a book,
but I just don't have the time.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.527
But I've got this
greaty great idea,

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:55.860
and if I give it you, then
maybe you'll write it for me.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.318
Which is just
surprising the number

00:02:57.318 --> 00:03:00.430
of people that say that to me.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.044
So I thought I'd just talk
a little bit about myself

00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:05.210
if you like, and about my
background and my history,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.480
if that's something
that's interesting.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.749
And then maybe you can
just ask me some questions.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.540
Then if we've got a
bit of time at the end,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.640
maybe I might read you
a bit from the book

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.510
and put you through that.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.050
Well just being here
in Google I suppose

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.110
is just making me think a
bit about my relationship

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.760
through my quite long
career with technology.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.010
As Sarah was saying
in the instruction,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.230
I left school at 15.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.040
I did very, very
poorly in school.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.020
I could not get on with--
no one seemed to be

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.600
able to teach me anything.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.100
Something about either
the school that I went

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.590
to or the way that
my brain is wired,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.710
I just quite simply cannot
take in information in any kind

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.640
of a conventional way, and I
went to a very conventional

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.140
school.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.790
So I left there at
15 under the cloud--

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.740
the threat of my parents,
who were both schoolteachers,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.090
saying to me if you don't
study hard in school,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.920
you'll end working
sweeping up hair

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.260
in Keith Fisher's hair salon
on Brent Street and Hendon.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.940
And that's exactly what I did.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.446
That's exactly where I ended up.

00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:20.320
And I actually started then four
quite jolly year hairdressing.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.180
I rather enjoyed my
time as a hairdresser,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.940
and still occasionally, if I'm
pushed, I can cut a mullet.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.980
I do a very mean mullet.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.350
Those were the
days they were in.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.160
And so I did that
for a few years,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.990
but I'd always had this
desire, if you like,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.280
to write and to tell stories.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.680
And it was something
that I'd always done.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.060
If you like, I was a
bit of a raconteur.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.060
And I remember I had this
flatmate at this time.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.990
And she said, you
know, you're always

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.410
having these funny stories
at parties and everything.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.020
Why don't you start
writing them down?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.690
And I did.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.280
She then introduced
me to a friend

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.100
of hers who was a
male journalist that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.920
worked on "Cosmopolitan,"
kind of a seedy man.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.970
And I suppose I was
19 at that time.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.440
So he certainly took
me under his wing.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.430
But he believed that I had
talent and encouraged me.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.230
And then just through a series
of coincidental events--

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.340
the '80s was almost a very
similar time in a way to now.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.870
There was an optimism
and an explosion

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.480
and an interest in
entrepreneurialism.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.739
If you like, it was what's
happening in the online world

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:34.530
now with all these
startups and everything.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.140
It was kind of
happening at that time

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.190
in the '80s under Thatcher.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.315
Of course she made such a
[INAUDIBLE] of everything

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:41.840
that we forget that
at the very beginning,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.870
it was quite an exciting time.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.570
And I managed to blag my
way into women's magazines.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.580
I remember the first time
I went into a magazine,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.480
it was "Just Seventee," and
I wasn't much more than 17

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.980
myself.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.590
I suppose I was about 19.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.470
And a bit like this
next morning, I woke up,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.520
and I thought oh my god.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.070
I've got an
appointment with a man

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.695
who was one of my
hairdressing client's husbands

00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:13.230
who was the features
editor on "Just Seventeen."

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.030
And I had this thing
that I had written

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.919
on my electric typewriter.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.960
And I was going into see
him, and I just thought,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.668
what do you wear?

00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:21.806
What do you wear when you
go into a news magazine?

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:22.520
It was the '80s.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.970
And so I put on-- in
the '80s, the fashion

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.852
was very much-- it
was like costumes.

00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:30.060
It was all very new romantic.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.560
And I remember i
put on-- I'll never

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.710
forget what I wore-- a
kind of a sailor dress.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.500
It was like a sailor dress, and
then these big button earrings.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.340
And I accessorized
it with gloves.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.936
And I remember I went
in to see this guy,

00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:49.200
and I was all done up with
lipstick, and the earrings,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.020
and the high shoes,
and everything,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.400
and this sailor dress.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.200
And everyone in the office was
wearing jeans and t-shirts.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.510
And this man who was probably
in his '30s at the time, which

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.480
was very middle-aged to me at
the time, he read my article,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.992
and he thought it was great.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.700
And he actually
commissioned on the spot,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.824
and that was the beginning.

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:12.370
And then as I was
leaving, he looked up

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.147
and he said, where
are you going?

00:07:16.147 --> 00:07:18.480
He obviously thought I was
going to Henley or something.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.063
The minute I'd walked
into the office,

00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:22.720
he'd obviously looked at me and
thought, what the hell has she

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.850
got on?

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.700
And I was too
embarrassed to say,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.840
I dressed like this
especially for you."

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.620
So that was the
start of it for me.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.860
And I started to get
my work published.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.060
And I was so thrilled, because
I had never ever dreamt

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.360
that I would ever be able
to get anything published,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.130
be a published writer
or be a published

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.940
journalist with no education, no
background, no English degree--

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.950
nothing, that this
had just happened,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.360
that I was able to write
things and that people willing

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.780
to publish them.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.900
And this seemed to
me to be miraculous.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.450
And it still does, actually,
to this day and 30 odd years

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.210
later.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.970
This seemed to me
very miraculous.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.700
And so driven by that kind of
feeling that, oh my goodness,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:16.420
anything can happen, I
became quite ambitious.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.490
But not ambitious, I
don't think, in the way

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.740
that we understand it, but
almost ambitious in a way of,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.800
goodness me.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.150
I wonder if someone
would actually

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.280
give me a full time job?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.860
So I applied for full time
jobs, and then someone did.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.010
And I thought, goodness me.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.357
What would happen if I actually
applied to be an editor?

00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:38.440
And so I did, and then
they did make me an editor.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.309
And so I went on like
this and ended up

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.890
becoming editor of a number of
very successful young women's

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.127
magazines.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.710
And I suppose I wanted to talk
a bit about technology as well.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.900
Because it was just--
one of the reasons

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.940
why I love technology
so much in my life today

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.060
is because that too seems
slightly miraculous to me,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.190
that when I started work
in women's magazines,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.279
I had an electric typewriter.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.820
My parents bought me an electric
typewriter in my late teens.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.090
Oh my god, that was just
like the most super duper

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.860
duped up Mac you could
possibly imagine at the time.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.350
You pressed a button,
and it went pop pop.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.933
And every time you
pressed it, it just

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:25.800
made this popping sound.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.590
It was just unbelievable.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.340
And then you'd be pop, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.210
And it had an
eraser ribbon on it,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.340
so that if you wanted to erase
something, there was a Tipp-ex.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.310
You had to buy these
Tipp-ex erasers.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.560
And you'd be nearly
making mistakes just

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.390
to see this happen.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.150
So we went on from that then
to these Amstrad computers.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.474
I wrote a book, actually.

00:09:51.474 --> 00:09:53.640
I was commissioned to write
a book for teenage girls

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.360
at that time, and I wrote
a book on the Amstrad.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.800
And the technology changed
so quickly at that time

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.990
that, actually, I couldn't
get the book off the Amstrad

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.517
onto a printer.

00:10:04.517 --> 00:10:06.600
Because by the time I'd
finished writing the book,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.180
the Amstrads were
so delete and Macs

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.820
had come in that I had
to ring around Europe

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.820
to find someone that
had a printer that

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.060
could get the stuff off
this old Amstrad for me.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.390
And then I think when
I was in the early '90s

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.900
then, I remember editing
"Just Seventeen" magazine.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.690
And then overnight, Apple
came in and just completely

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.380
transformed the
whole print industry.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.860
And we went from one
sticking text down

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.420
on bits of paper, which
just seems incredible.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.700
It seems incredible to me now
that when I started my career

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.680
we were literally--
we were typing stuff

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.855
up on electric typewriters.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.627
It was incredibly complicated.

00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:57.710
Publishing was an incredibly
complicated business,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.510
because there were so many
different departments.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.200
You had the sticking
down the words

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.760
on bits of paper department.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760
And then you had the
checking that the words

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.777
were correct department.

00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:09.110
And then you had the department
for making them all fit.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.193
And then you had the
department for scanning them.

00:11:11.193 --> 00:11:12.450
And it was just incredible.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:19.350
So I feel very lucky that I saw
that period of time happening.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:26.710
So all the time that I was
working in women's magazines,

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.900
there came a point where
I felt I was moving

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.340
further and further away.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.190
Even though I was
very successful,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.730
and I was winning awards,
and everyone thought

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.030
I was marvelous, and the
magazines were selling,

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.310
there came a point where I
just thought I'm not really,

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.020
really doing what I
really, really want to do

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.810
and what I really set out to
do, which was to write stuff

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.840
down and have people read it.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.220
And I was managing people,
and negotiating salaries,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.100
and coming up with
marketing ideas, and all

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.070
of this other stuff that just
didn't seem to have anything

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.130
to do with who I was anymore.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.080
And so I left all of that
behind and moved to Ireland.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.680
And everyone, all of
my contemporaries,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.270
were university horrified.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.960
It was like I was totally moving
to the deep south boondocks,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.530
which I was.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.530
I mean, literally, when
I moved over to Ireland,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.827
I went from working in the
equivalent company-- it

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:26.160
was called EMAP Metro, and
it was the equivalent company

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.650
of Google.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:27.775
Everyone wanted to work there.

00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:29.360
They published "Just
Seventeen," and "Smash

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.580
it Hits," and "Empire
Magazine."-- all very cool.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.480
I went from that to working in a
little dingy basement in Dublin

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.330
with two people and
literally no computers--

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.340
sticking things back down
onto bits of paper again.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.190
So I began a new
phase of my life,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.780
and it took me a
few years to settle,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:54.520
but what I had done was, I
suppose, made a decision,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.070
made a global decision, that
I wanted to commit myself

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.580
back into myself
as a writer, which

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.930
had been my original intention.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.840
And so over the next 10
years, that's what I did.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.750
I worked on women's
magazines in Ireland, which

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.525
was great, quite successful.

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:11.150
And I earned a living,
and it was fine.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.595
But it wasn't like London.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.610
And I continued to
write in my spare time.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.520
And for a long
time I wrote books,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.470
and I wrote short stories.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.330
And I sent them off
to competitions,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.910
and I got lots and lots and lots
and lots and lots of rejection.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:35.020
And eventually, after a long
time, I got a book deal.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.220
And the book deal that
I got was very good.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.960
And it was based on me writing
these high octane comedy novels

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.180
under the name Morag Prunty.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.110
And that was around the 2000.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.610
So I wrote four of those
books, and they were fine.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.190
They did very well
and everything.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.910
And then I just took one step
further away from civilization.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.610
I moved from Dublin.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.590
I had a son.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.290
And after he was born,
I moved from Dublin

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.050
down to the west coast of
Ireland, down to the country

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.610
and bought a house,
which I still live in,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.810
which is a nice old house.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.120
And it's on the sea.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.280
There's my house, my
front garden, the sea,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.760
which is great.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.420
And I started to write very
different types of books.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.470
I started to write books that
were more romantic, a bit more

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.870
serious, a little
bit less high octane.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.030
And that was it.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.120
My publishers changed my name,
because there was a turnaround.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.740
There was such a
dramatic change in style.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.820
They changed my name
from Morag Prunty

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.932
to Kate Kerrigan, which is
also my mother-in-law's name.

00:14:52.932 --> 00:14:55.140
So my married name and my
mother-in-law's first name.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.060
So she's very
pleased about that.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.680
And when and that's it.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.260
That's 25 minutes.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.176
Does anyone want to ask
me any questions or?

00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:10.120
AUDIENCE: What was is
it like changing your--

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.137
to me, that's such a
stark change in identity.

00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:12.970
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.382
AUDIENCE: You're
writing, and maybe it

00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:15.921
allowed you more
creative freedom

00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:19.192
to then take a different
approach in your writing.

00:15:19.192 --> 00:15:20.838
Was that something
that you embraced?

00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:22.879
Because it sounds like
they came to you and said,

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:23.560
we're changing your name.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.060
Oh, Ok.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.155
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:27.180
Well, it is.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.740
I think what I'm
always searching

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.590
for as a writer, always,
is the truth-- it's

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:37.176
the kernel and
the truth in life,

00:15:37.176 --> 00:15:38.550
and about what it
is to be human,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.840
and about what is to be a woman.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.490
So that's really what every
book that I write is about.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.190
That's what's at
the heart of it.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.624
And what happens is you
have the heart of a book,

00:15:48.624 --> 00:15:50.540
and then you come at it
from different angles.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.140
Like in this book,
I've come at it

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.520
from the angle of what
we wear and fashion,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.090
which always appears,
and has always

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.800
appeared to me the most--
I suppose because I worked

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.855
in fashion magazines as
well-- that we wear in fashion

00:16:01.855 --> 00:16:04.731
and everything seems to be, in
a sense, the least important

00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:05.230
thing.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.230
And I've always thought
of it as being the least

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.270
important thing.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.170
And with this book,
I've decided, well,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.937
actually maybe it's a
very important thing.

00:16:14.937 --> 00:16:17.020
What would it be if it was
a very important thing?

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.960
If what we wear
was very important?

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.870
If the clothes that we
wore carried something

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.160
of the essence of who we were?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.300
And so in a sense, it
doesn't matter to me

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.410
what the name of the person
is that's writing the book.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.010
What's important
to me is getting

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:44.370
to the truth of the story,
and also the story itself,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.530
the kernel of the book,
and the point of it.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.040
And as a writer, one of the
things that I am constantly

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.630
moving towards is separating
myself from the story as much

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.290
as I possibly can.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.290
Writing is a very
personal thing,

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.417
and you do put of
yourself in it.

00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:04.000
But one of the greatest mistakes
that you can make as a writer

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.980
is to be authorial,
which is to let a story

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.720
or let a character be affected
by who you are in a way,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.339
and what you think of them.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.839
I realized this a number of
years ago when I wrote a book.

00:17:25.234 --> 00:17:26.650
People were coming
back and saying

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.250
that my main protagonists
were quite bitchy.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:35.020
They were always quite
bitchy women with issues.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.770
And I realized that
what I was doing

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.120
is I was putting
too much of myself

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.200
into my central characters.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.130
And you're always much
harder on yourself

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.020
than you are on other people.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.420
So because my characters were
carrying so much of who I was,

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.280
I was making them a little
bit bitchy, and a little bit

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.510
snipey, and a little bit smart.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.890
And they weren't as likable.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.960
Because-- I don't
know, but I know

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.540
that, I think, as women, for me,
I have an essential insecurity

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.320
just from being a woman
that I carry around with me.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.250
And that was infecting the
characters in my books.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.760
So I wasn't able to be as
authentic with the characters.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.130
I was being more true
to myself than I was

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.630
to the characters in the book.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.250
So separating who I am
from the actual characters.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.250
And it's quite interesting,
because Morag Prunty

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.640
is my own name, and Kate
Kerrigan is my pen name.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.530
And Morag Prunty's
actually a great name,

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.190
and Kate Kerrigan is actually
a really boring name.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:42.451
But it actually doesn't have
any effect on me one way

00:18:42.451 --> 00:18:42.950
or another.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.658
Because as long as
the book gets written,

00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:49.637
and as long as many people as
possible buy it and read it,

00:18:49.637 --> 00:18:50.845
then that's all that matters.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.620
AUDIENCE: What I find
fascinating is that everyday I

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.036
meet so many people just trying
to discover what they want

00:18:59.036 --> 00:19:01.629
to do with their lives, and
even if they discover it,

00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:02.420
trying to get that.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.290
And when I see
you, I see someone

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.760
that is successful and also
doing with she likes to do.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.010
And after listening to
your story, [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.870
but what would you
say was the secret?

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.315
Just luck?

00:19:15.315 --> 00:19:17.284
Being in the right place?

00:19:17.284 --> 00:19:18.450
Being open to opportunities?

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.792
I mean, what would be
your-- especially also

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:21.750
because you're a woman.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.220
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.845
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think it's much

00:19:24.845 --> 00:19:26.840
more inspiring because of that.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.340
KATE KERRIGAN: One
interesting thing

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.400
actually that
somebody said to me,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.550
it was a quote form a writer,
which I thought was fantastic,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.160
is what is the single most
important thing that you need

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.420
to become a successful writer?

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.520
And I can't remember
who said it,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.330
but this person turned around
and said, low overheads.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.830
Do you know?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.820
And actually that's true.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.830
I think that if you want to--
I am doing what I really,

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.750
really want to do, but
you take risks with that.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.740
You have to take risks.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.200
And it's not the risk of I'm
going to step into the abyss

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.180
and I'm going to believe that
somebody is going to lift me up

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.330
and I'm going to
soar into the sky.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.892
You have to think, well, if
I step off into the abyss,

00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:12.600
do you know what?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.980
I might fall down for a bit,
and I might be hanging off

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.260
a cliff for awhile.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.260
Do you know what I mean?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.710
And maybe somebody
will come and save me.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.640
And maybe they won't.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.590
You have to be prepared
for it to work,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.420
but you also have to be
prepared for it not to work.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.450
And you have to be
prepared to be happy for it

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.480
not to work and be OK with that
just to do what you want to do.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.630
I moved to Ireland
in '91 or '92,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.060
and I left absolutely at the
height of a really amazing

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.320
career in publishing.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.060
It really was.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.690
It was like being
a star at Google.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.831
At that time, it
was the equivalent.

00:20:51.831 --> 00:20:53.580
And I went over to
Ireland, and I thought,

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.670
I'm going to write poems.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.669
And I was following-- I
had a boyfriend as well,

00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:57.790
and he was Irish.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.650
And I was going to
write, and I thought

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.691
everything would be good.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:03.540
And after about a year, I was
so miserable I thought, shit.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.830
What have I done?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.556
Do you know?

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.840
I've got no money.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.760
I'm working in a
smelly basement.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.640
These people don't even
know how to use a Mac.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.535
This is horrendous, and
I've got absolutely no time

00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.160
to do my writing or
anything like that.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.710
What have I done?

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.189
And I applied for
a job in the UK.

00:21:21.189 --> 00:21:23.105
I thought, right, well,
it's only been a year.

00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:24.930
I'm going to come back.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.310
And I applied for a job in
the UK, and I got blocked,

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.860
and I didn't get to interview.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.090
It was like a punishment
for having left or whatever.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.060
But that's when I
made a decision.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.800
I thought I'm here now.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.307
I came here for a reason.

00:21:39.307 --> 00:21:41.390
This is what I wanted to
do, and it will work out.

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:47.490
Being a writer has been a very
interesting journey for me,

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:52.480
because I had 10 years of
writing with no success.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.900
Then I got a huge book deal,
and this is, oh my god.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.930
This was the Celtic
Tiger years in Ireland

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.705
and a huge boom time
for publishing here.

00:22:01.705 --> 00:22:04.480
And I thought, this is it now.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.140
I've got this big deal.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.046
I have hit the big time.

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:10.420
But it didn't work
out like that.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.210
I went up.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.880
I went down.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.460
I went up.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.110
I went down.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:19.310
Every year you never know
how any book is going to do.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.310
You're always going to be
an international bestseller

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.360
until you're not.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.152
Do you know?

00:22:25.152 --> 00:22:27.900
So you have to be prepared
to go along with that.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.550
But all through that
with absolute focus--

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.240
I've just remained
absolutely focused

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.940
since making that decision.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.100
And because of that I
have a really nice life.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.940
I would say that I have
a nicer life than many

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.820
of my contemporaries that stayed
in London, and did very well,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.040
and earned a lot of money.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.100
I have a lovely house
in a beautiful place,

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.840
and I'm doing what I want to do,
and I have the time to do it.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.600
So I think that's
it, and I think

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.120
if there's one thing that
people have said about me,

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.568
it's that once I put my mind
to something I just focus.

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:11.002
Sorry.

00:23:11.002 --> 00:23:11.958
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:15.790
I actually grew up
collecting magazines.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.668
KATE KERRIGAN: Sorry?

00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:18.420
AUDIENCE: I grew up
collecting magazines.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.740
KATE KERRIGAN: Oh, did you?

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.517
Oh, you're much
younger than your--

00:23:22.517 --> 00:23:26.413
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE]
publishing industry.

00:23:26.413 --> 00:23:28.848
So how do you think
it's changed or hasn't?

00:23:28.848 --> 00:23:31.283
Magazine collecting or
magazines in general

00:23:31.283 --> 00:23:33.425
in terms of its sales
since obviously it's

00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:35.028
gone digital now?

00:23:35.028 --> 00:23:36.153
How do you feel [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.550
KATE KERRIGAN: No, I
don't think-- I mean,

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.091
I don't think I
would, but I do think

00:23:42.091 --> 00:23:44.160
it's a very interesting
time in publishing,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.530
and I do think that
what's happened

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.180
is "Just Seventeen"
has folded, "Ms."

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.529
All the only young women's
magazines now have folded.

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:52.070
They've gone.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.460
Everyone is getting
that information online.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.550
But what's become
very big is comics.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.890
And that's really the
boys collecting comics.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.150
So I think there is actually
room in the market for a girl

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.360
equivalent for that.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.120
Comics and graphic
novels are huge.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.810
It's almost the role of
magazines has played.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.910
Girls can get their
advice now, all the

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.870
stuff that they got
the magazines, which

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:24.226
was personal advice, agony
aunts, makeup, fashion--

00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:26.100
all of that, they can
get all of that online,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.580
and they'd be right to.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:34.240
But there's an
increase in book sales,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.586
interestingly,
among young people.

00:24:38.586 --> 00:24:40.460
One of the trends that
I've found interesting

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.020
is that young people
now in their teens

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.690
are not using Kindles as
much as our generation

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.020
for the very reason that
they can't collect magazines

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.260
anymore, because
magazines don't exist.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.500
They also can't collect
albums, records, CDs.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.875
All of those things
don't exists.

00:24:57.875 --> 00:25:00.981
So what they're doing is
they're buying books and comics.

00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:02.980
So I think if someone can
come up with something

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.320
that teenage girls
can collect again,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.780
that would be interesting.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.260
But I think my
generation of women,

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.120
of people, who worked in
magazines, one of the things

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.100
that I find interesting
is that if you go online

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.660
and you Google "Just Seventeen,"
nothing comes out-- nothing.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.470
It's like we never existed.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.350
And I think it's because
mine was that crossover

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.140
generation that literally
went from magazines

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.910
and then we just went, ugh, and
straight into new technology.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.560
And so there hasn't been
any preservation of them.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:45.950
Whereas if you look up magazines
from the 1950s and 1960s,

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.550
loads come up online.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.110
They've all been preserved.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.933
So if you have a "Just
Seventeen" collection--

00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:54.016
AUDIENCE: I actually got
rid of all my [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:56.339
"Just Seventeen" probably
about seven years ago.

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:57.130
KATE KERRIGAN: Aww.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.784
AUDIENCE: But I
kept the ones that

00:25:58.784 --> 00:26:02.228
had my favorite [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:02.228 --> 00:26:03.563
AUDIENCE: I've [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:03.563 --> 00:26:04.688
We went to school together.

00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:07.229
So I'm going to ask the question
that I know everybody really

00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:08.132
wants to know.

00:26:08.132 --> 00:26:10.610
And that is, did you
snog Robbie Williams?

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.990
KATE KERRIGAN: No, I didn't.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.050
AUDIENCE: Did you
snog any of them?

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.130
KATE KERRIGAN: No.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.650
But I did get asked out
continuously and quite

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.977
consistently by Jason, who--

00:26:21.977 --> 00:26:22.560
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.096
KATE KERRIGAN: Close your
ears son, who is, to my mind,

00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:27.970
still the best looking
member of "Take That."

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.761
But he had terrible
acne all down his back.

00:26:29.761 --> 00:26:31.100
AUDIENCE: How do you know that?

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.460
KATE KERRIGAN: Because I was
once photographed in bed--

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.680
I once did a-- when
they started out,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.720
they all wore-- they had this
horrible seedy little manager

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.350
who was trying to push them
towards the gay market,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.280
and he used to dress them
up in all this S&amp;M gear.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.250
You might remember that.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.810
I did "In Bed with Auntie
Morag" with "Take That"

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.940
at the time of Madonna.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.960
And I got into bed with them
in a Winceyette nightie,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.210
and they were all in the nip.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.660
But he did ask me out a few
times, but I never went.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.140
Because, actually, I thought
they were all years younger

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.940
than me, but then I
subsequently found out

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.200
that they weren't, that
they lied about their age.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.825
So I could have ended up-- I say
it to my husband all the time,

00:27:12.825 --> 00:27:13.984
don't I?

00:27:13.984 --> 00:27:16.150
I could have been married
to Jason from "Take That,"

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.130
but instead I'm married to you.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.824
Mhm?

00:27:19.824 --> 00:27:21.490
AUDIENCE: Just asking
about your family,

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.929
it seems that you have a
strong support network.

00:27:23.929 --> 00:27:25.470
And with those ups
and downs, I don't

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.995
know how I would be able to
cope with 10 years of putting

00:27:28.995 --> 00:27:33.650
my heart and soul into writing
and waiting for that big break.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:38.336
What advice, or how was it for
you having that kind of support

00:27:38.336 --> 00:27:40.710
to get you through that?

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.990
Or was it that you were
finding your way at that time?

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.823
KATE KERRIGAN: Well, I
had that, but I think

00:27:44.823 --> 00:27:46.140
it's just dogged determination.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.510
And also, because if
you're a creative person,

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:54.584
people have that thing that
I'm going to become a writer,

00:27:54.584 --> 00:27:55.750
and I'm going to sell books.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.880
It's not career choice.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.810
it's like a vocations.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.560
If you're an artist
or if you're a writer,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.000
it's like a vocation thing.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.390
So you have to do it because
you really love doing it.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.240
And so yeah, you
do get the support,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.740
but you just think, well,
what else and I going to do?

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.650
I'm not going to stop writing
because someone's rejected me.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.650
And maybe I am crap, but I'm
still going to keep doing it.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.454
And you always, always
try to get better.

00:28:19.454 --> 00:28:21.120
I've had a really
interesting experience

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.750
in the last couple of years.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.290
When I was writing this
book I got a new editor,

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.380
this woman called
Rosie De Courcy.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.530
And she's an older woman.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.730
I don't how old she is, but she
edited Maeve Binchy and Penny

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.030
Vincenzi, and she's edited
some really amazing writers.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.380
It was for the new
publishing house,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:47.550
and before I submitted this
book to them for publication,

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.110
it had been through
three complete rewrites

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:55.100
with a freelance editors.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.350
I suppose I'd worked on it
flatout for about 18 months

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.995
before she got it.

00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:01.120
And her publishing, the
CEO at the publishing house

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.250
was very excited.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.260
They bought the book.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.340
This is amazing.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.020
We love Kate.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.720
There was a big change,
new publishing house,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.490
and everything's just fantastic.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.730
And then I went out
for lunch with Rosie,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.930
who was going to be my
big point of contact.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.911
And I sat down,
and we had lunch.

00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:18.910
And everything was nice.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:24.350
And then we talked about-- and
she didn't mention the book,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.020
so I said what do you think?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.540
What do you think
of "The Dress?"

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.730
What's the story?

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.230
And she said, well, it's
certainly got potential.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.400
I can see that there's
something in there.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.270
And I thought, what?

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.500
I've had-- I don't know-- 12
books published at this stage.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.890
And so for the last
year, I've been

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.530
working with this woman, who
has just been tearing it up,

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.130
start again, tear
it up, start again.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:02.690
And of all of my years of being
rejected, rejected, rejected,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.190
have all brought
me to a place where

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.740
I can work with an editor
of that caliber who

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:17.460
is so determined to get
the book up to the point

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.860
where it can reach its
absolute full potential.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.400
And I think the thing about
being a successful writer

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.260
or a successful artist is having
enough self-belief and enough

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.940
detachment from what
other people think of you.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:42.540
And the desire to create
has to be much, much bigger

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.900
than the desire for what
that creation my end up with.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.370
Do you understand?

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.860
If you create
something wonderful,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.810
people will think you're great,
and they'll give you money.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:58.340
And loads of people will buy it
If you create something great.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.356
But all of that has two
mean absolutely nothing

00:31:02.356 --> 00:31:03.230
when you're doing it.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.600
You have to be completely
separate from it.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.390
And so the editing
process for this book

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.999
was unbelievably
arduous, but I was

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.665
able, because of those
early rejections,

00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:18.030
to just say, well,
look, this woman,

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.060
literally, all she's doing
is focusing on what can we

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.510
do to make this book better?

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.009
And I'm focusing on what can
we do to make this book better.

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:29.404
And at no point is she
thinking she can't do it.

00:31:29.404 --> 00:31:31.070
When you're creating
something, you just

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:34.700
keep going until it's right.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.870
And you do put your
heart and soul into it,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.196
but you're not tough--

00:31:41.196 --> 00:31:43.320
AUDIENCE: But are you happy
with the final product?

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.611
KATE KERRIGAN: Oh my god, yeah.

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.140
But I didn't think I would be.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.740
And at every point, it's
been incredible working

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.390
with this new editor.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.450
Because what she was
able to do is she

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.340
was able to take
what I had written,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.170
and hone it down so
that it's more the book

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.130
that I originally wanted
to write than the book

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.750
that I did originally write.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.350
She's so skilled that
she was able to--

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.630
Because you have the
kernel, the core of an idea.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.730
And then you start
dressing it up.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.374
And you bring in
different characters,

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:25.540
and then you think, well,
I need a modern storyline,

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.530
so I do this character.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.060
And then she needs a boyfriend,
so I'll bring him in.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.230
And you dress it up to
make the story work.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:38.150
But sometimes the dressing
that you put on it isn't right.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.990
And you have to trust the
people that you're working with,

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.280
and you have to trust
your own ability.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.930
Like, at the end of
this book, there's

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.490
two-- it's a dual storyline.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.210
So part of the book is set
in the 1950s in America.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:59.120
And that story really, the
characters and everything,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.660
they worked.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.725
And then there's a
modern storyline,

00:33:01.725 --> 00:33:04.900
which is a young fashion
blogger and her best

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.580
friend and her love interest.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.230
And the young fashion blogger
and her love interest,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.310
who are two key elements
in the book, both of them

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.806
were completely
different people when

00:33:15.806 --> 00:33:16.930
I started writing the book.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:20.680
And we just killed both of them
after having rewritten them

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.880
both about five times.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.460
But in the end, they
just got killed off.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.070
And people find
that unfathomable.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.160
How could you come
up with a character?

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.300
But there was one character
in the original book.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.020
I called him Liam.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.242
He had a history.

00:33:38.242 --> 00:33:39.146
He had a family.

00:33:43.327 --> 00:33:44.160
He was good looking.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.717
He had a whole thing
going on with him.

00:33:46.717 --> 00:33:48.550
I could have written a
whole book about him.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.900
I developed him so much.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.930
And then one day I
was talking to Rosie,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:56.264
and I just said, you know?

00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:57.180
I'm just gone off him.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.110
I don't like him anymore.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.068
And I just killed him
and invented someone new.

00:34:00.068 --> 00:34:03.780
And the new guy that I invented,
light just went-- like this.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.310
And he's just much better.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.020
But the book could
have gone out.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:10.420
It could have gone out
without all of those edits.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:16.739
They weren't-- but it's just
that now it's just much, much,

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.816
much, much better than it was.

00:34:19.816 --> 00:34:22.820
But even things
like, you sit down,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.909
and it's bits that-- even
after all these years,

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.170
I could spend a morning
writing a paragraph,

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.420
really honing it and
making it beautiful.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.590
And then Rosie would
just go-- superfluous.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.460
But it's the same
in everyone's job.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.420
That must happen to
you guys all the time.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.389
I've had this really,
really great idea.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:46.550
It's really fantastic.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.150
And then someone just
comes along and goes-- no.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.150
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a
bit about your writing?

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.607
Do you write every day?

00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:53.918
Are you--

00:34:53.918 --> 00:34:55.870
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.280
AUDIENCE: Strict with
yourself about writing?

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.840
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah, because
I mean, you can go for-- yeah.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.290
I have to be really,
really disciplined.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.350
So I have to write every day.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.540
But a part of that as
well is needs must.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.377
Because I have to
write a book a year.

00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:13.960
So if you write a book a year,
you've got to write a bit of it

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.650
every day.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.350
And I also have a
weekly newspaper column,

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.830
and at the moment, I'm doing
a lot of publicity stuff,

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.560
so I'm doing a lot of journalism
and that kind of stuff as well.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.080
So I do.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.371
I have to write every
single day, yeah.

00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:26.954
AUDIENCE: Is it
helpful-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.720
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.660
There is that.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.940
I think it's more theoretical.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:42.350
I mean, how I work the best
as a writer is locked away

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:46.600
completely on my own
in 24 hour stints.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.601
So on occasion I go off, and
I go to hermitages and places

00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:51.100
like that.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.830
And I might go
away for two weeks.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.705
That's the longest I've
done without speaking

00:35:54.705 --> 00:35:56.640
to another human being.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.020
And I absolutely love that.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.120
But I very rarely get to do it.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.570
I might get another two weeks
stint next year very rarely.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.290
But it's funny.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.410
I was talking to
a friend of mine,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.060
I'm very friendly with some of
the Irish writers like Cecilia

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:14.610
Ahern, you know Cecilia Ahern?

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.650
And we had lunch
a few weeks ago,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.900
and she was telling me that
she was watching something

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.460
on the television.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.150
And it was some movie.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.260
And there was this
person in a jail cell.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.010
They were locked in a jail
cell, and they were sitting over

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.097
at the window with a bucket
for peeing in the corner.

00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:35.680
And they were just sitting there
writing with a pen and paper.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.210
And she said she and her husband
were sitting watching that,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.150
and he just turned to her
and he went, you'd love that,

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.800
wouldn't you?

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.520
And she went, yeah.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.790
That's what we all want, really.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.290
That's it.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.500
That's all I want to do.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.381
And I don't get to do it.

00:36:50.381 --> 00:36:52.130
I mean, I couldn't
live my life like that,

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.088
because I'd go bonkers.

00:36:53.088 --> 00:36:54.240
But I do dream about it.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.420
I'm trying to keep myself
alive as long as I can

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.042
so that when I'm older
that's how I'll live,

00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:01.500
and that's what
I'll be able to do.

00:37:03.995 --> 00:37:04.495
It's great.

00:37:04.495 --> 00:37:05.271
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:09.039
Do you get distracted
by the internet though?

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:10.930
In terms of research, do you--

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.050
KATE KERRIGAN: I
am so addicted to--

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.790
AUDIENCE: If I was
locked away in a room,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.858
I would be like, I'll
just write a paragraph.

00:37:17.858 --> 00:37:19.610
And then oh, I'll just
check this article online.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.020
KATE KERRIGAN: Online, terrible.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.320
I use anti-social a lot.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.830
I'm absolutely and completely
addicted to social media.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.230
I've actually got RSI.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:34.790
I suffer from repetitive strain
injury and also arthritis.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:40.570
So in the last few months, I've
had to completely transform

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.530
my writing practice so that
I don't have the internet

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.590
on my phone anymore.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.180
I'm getting an old lady phone.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:54.920
I've had to cut myself off a lot
from social media on the phone.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.150
And I'm now using voice
recognition technology

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:03.050
to write, which is strange.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:08.670
But again, it's part
of the determination.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.600
Because not being able to write,
for me, in the last few months,

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.980
has been them
cripplingly painful,

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.950
emotionally for me,
to be losing touch

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.320
with the actual physical pop,
pop, pop of the keyboard.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.230
And every time I sat down at
the keyboard, I'd be in pain.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.010
It was just some kind of
horrible cosmic punishment.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.980
But I've had to master the
voice recognition, which

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.760
has been really awful.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.087
But you just have to do it.

00:38:42.087 --> 00:38:44.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] do you do
a lot of research at the front

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.550
once you've had an
idea, like the 1950s?

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.910
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.149
AUDIENCE: Or do you write
a bit and go think, oh, I

00:38:49.149 --> 00:38:51.492
should actually look at the
historical truth of this.

00:38:51.492 --> 00:38:52.950
KATE KERRIGAN:
Well, a bit of both.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.690
Yeah, and I find that actually
researching as I go along

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:56.940
is better.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.620
Because otherwise what happens
is-- the most important thing,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.730
for me, is emotional
resonance in a book.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.290
But when you research stuff
and you find it interesting,

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.025
that then becomes fascinating.

00:39:08.025 --> 00:39:10.150
And so what you want to do
is, like with this book,

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.920
you just want to keep reading
off lists and describing

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.030
dresses, and reading off
lists of interesting designers

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.950
that no one's heard
of of that time.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.590
And you become bogged
down in all of that stuff

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.160
and you lose the core of it.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.380
So I tend now to
do less research.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.740
And also, I did a huge
amount of research on a book

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:34.950
last year about organic
and city farming.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.920
And I did a huge
amount of research.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.150
I went to New York, and I
did real research on it.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.830
And my editor just went,
no, I don't like that.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.660
And so it's just gone.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.460
Poof.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.330
Finished.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.360
So I tend to do
it as I go along.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.670
Shall I read you just
a five minute passage?

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.170
Yeah?

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.247
I'll see if I can--
I'm just going

00:40:01.247 --> 00:40:02.830
to read the beginning
bit a bit, which

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:08.400
is the prologue, which has
no dresses in it whatsoever.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.330
Oh my god.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.040
I can't see anything.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.020
Thanks, but I was just
getting my glasses out.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.640
No, stop.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.817
You won't find them.

00:40:21.817 --> 00:40:22.400
SARAH: I have.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.650
KATE KERRIGAN: Oh, good woman.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:34.720
Ireland 1935-- the
schoolmaster have found the boy

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.050
collapsed against a stone
wall at the side of the road.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:41.090
His nose was smashed and
bloody, and his right eye so

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.340
swollen that he could
barely see out of it.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.190
Dear God, Francis,
what happened to you?

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.050
The boy looked at
him and shrugged.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.550
His eyes were defiant, angry.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.720
Your father?

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.840
John Conlon held out his
hand to help the child up,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.210
but Francis waved him go
away and forced himself

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.710
to stand alone.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.820
His legs were shaking.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.640
He had taken some
battering that morning.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.390
His father had
caught him unawares

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.160
and dragged him from the bed.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.860
To stop himself from crying,
Francis reminded myself

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.270
that he had fought
back and given

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.950
his father as good as he'd got.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.580
It was the first time he'd
stood up to his father,

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.980
and that was how Francis knew
it was time for him to leave.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.230
The last thing Francis wanted
was his teacher's pity.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.950
He was a man of 15.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.540
We could look after himself now.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.770
John held out a
handkerchief, and he took it.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.010
I'm leaving anyway, he
said, wincing slightly

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.490
as he put the cotton square
up to his nose to stem

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.900
the flow of fresh blood.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.770
I'm going to America.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.350
John Conlon leaned against
the wall with his pupil.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.220
He had taught
Fitzpatrick from when

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.970
he was five until last year.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.740
His mother had died, and
his younger brother Joe

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.435
had been put in with the nuns.

00:41:56.435 --> 00:41:59.640
So Francis was left alone in
the house with his brutal pig

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.540
of a father.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:06.290
The area they belonged
to was broad and remote,

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.420
a vast hinterland
of bog and mountain.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.880
It was a place where a man could
hide his wife and children away

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.710
from the eyes of
the world, but not

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.680
those of a prying
Irish schoolmaster.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.590
John Conlon made it
his business to know

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.740
every child in the
area, and managed

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.620
to persuade most of the
parents to leave them

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.210
in school until they
could read and write.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.380
Francis had been with
him until he was 13,

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.080
but had left then to stay at
home to nurse his sick mother.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.080
Now she was dead,
and the baby had

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.250
been taken away, so there was
nothing left for him at home.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.400
He was a bright young
man, and John believed

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.070
he could have a future.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:50.850
However, with a father like
that, he never stood a chance.

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.400
America, that's a long
way off, said John.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.040
Francis glowered at him.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.240
He could feel self
starting to crack.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.210
He'd no idea how he
was going to get there,

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.640
but his mother had a
brother in New York.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.050
And before she
died, she gave him

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.380
a letter saying he would
secure Francis a job

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.810
if he could get
himself to America.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.940
The only thing Francis knew for
certain was that he was never

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.104
going back home, not ever.

00:43:15.104 --> 00:43:16.520
I'm not going to
sit here and read

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.727
through the whole bloody book,
because you'd just-- shall

00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:20.810
I read another little bit?

00:43:24.514 --> 00:43:26.055
although we've only
got five minutes.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.154
Anyone else want
to ask me anything?

00:43:32.154 --> 00:43:34.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.819
KATE KERRIGAN: Read a bit more.

00:43:35.819 --> 00:43:38.777
AUDIENCE: I was
going to say, do you

00:43:38.777 --> 00:43:42.967
think your career before you
become a writer as you are now

00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:45.186
has helped with the writing?

00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:47.158
Or if you could go back
again, would you just

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:50.130
go straight into writing
without having that career?

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.090
KATE KERRIGAN: Oh no.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.640
I think in any
form of creativity

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.090
the best thing that you
can do is experience life.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:03.390
And in fact, when I have
young interns coming in to me,

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:07.160
I always say to them, don't
study literature in school.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.630
If you want to become a
writer, if you're very clever,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.730
go and study law.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.140
Because I think that's a--
law is all about language.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.640
But no.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.510
I think the only
way to-- I certainly

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.070
do not regret the years I
spent writing journalism

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.740
either, and working with words.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.700
Alan Sillitoe once said quantity
produces quality eventually.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.450
And it's true.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.110
I think you have to do it.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.390
And the years in hairdressing
were the best experience

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.890
I ever had.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.250
I mean, by the time most
of my contemporaries

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.710
were leaving university, I
was able to do things that-- I

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.330
had so many life skills.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.480
I was able to talk to people,
and communicate with people,

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.112
and blag my way into
jobs, and operate a till,

00:44:56.112 --> 00:44:58.070
and have all kinds of
useful skills from having

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.730
left school very young.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.630
I do regret not having had
an education insofar as there

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:09.950
are absolute gaps in my
basic knowledge, even

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.320
from primary school.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.980
I mean, when my husband and son
are sitting doing his homework,

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.434
things like geography.

00:45:16.434 --> 00:45:17.850
And they're going,
where's Russia?

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.370
And I'm going can you show me?

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.330
So there are gaps and
books that I haven't read.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:29.740
And I do feel
personally insecure.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.430
Mary will attest to the fact
that I don't have a third level

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.510
education.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.671
Personally, I do have issues
around that sometimes.

00:45:36.671 --> 00:45:37.170
But no.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.200
I think that I would never,
ever regret going back,

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.410
or want to go back
and change anything

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.320
that I did or didn't do.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.920
And I would encourage anyone,
if there's something that you

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:55.590
want to do, just go and do it.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:00.350
Because you can't-- God, the
times that are in it now,

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.831
I often look at my mother with
a her big school teacher pension

00:46:03.831 --> 00:46:05.580
and all that kind of
stuff, and think, oh,

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.430
you know I could have--

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:12.530
But as a writer, sometimes
I need to have a day job

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.680
and sometimes I don't.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.590
But I think it's always
important, whatever

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:22.440
your day job is, to push
into whatever you want to do.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.290
That's it then.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:23.970
Is that it?

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:25.303
Or was there?

00:46:25.303 --> 00:46:25.803
All right.

00:46:25.803 --> 00:46:26.636
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.667
AUDIENCE: We're all
listening intently.

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:33.000
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.190
AUDIENCE: What advice do
you have for new writers?

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.230
Obviously, I'm going to assume
when you were starting out,

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.850
it would be send
manuscripts man to agents.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.650
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.194
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], what kind
of tips do you have for anyone

00:46:48.194 --> 00:46:48.990
who's--

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.948
KATE KERRIGAN: I think
the most important thing

00:46:50.948 --> 00:46:56.770
is to write every
day and to not be--

00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:00.740
I think just to write every
day and to keep doing it.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.490
It's good to go the
conventional route,

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.840
find an agent-- all that kind of
stuff, a good publishing house,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.640
I think.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.320
But there are so many different
routes now for writers,

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.530
and self-publishing is
definitely one of them.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.570
There's a very, very
important synergy

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.320
between writing, and
technology, and marketing,

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.690
and what you guys do.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:34.000
I mean, the most important
person in my publishing house

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.655
right now is the girl that
does all of the online sales.

00:47:41.655 --> 00:47:42.530
And it's called what?

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.803
Was it called algorithms?

00:47:44.803 --> 00:47:45.886
What is that stuff called?

00:47:45.886 --> 00:47:47.965
Is it algorithms or?

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:48.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.100
KATE KERRIGAN: Meta-- metadata.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.237
I've no idea what it is,
but I know that it exists.

00:47:54.237 --> 00:47:55.570
So I'm very impressed at myself.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.370
But metadata.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.840
All of that managing metadata
and all that kind of stuff--

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.970
that's all become an incredibly
important part of publishing.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.330
And it's difficult for
writers, because you

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.600
write books, but really what
you want is you want them read.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.930
You want people to
actually read them.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.790
And getting people
to read the books,

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:16.020
I mean, now that's
just all becoming

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.470
increasingly important.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.070
They're the heroes of our time.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.982
AUDIENCE: So everyone, you
know what you need to do.

00:48:25.982 --> 00:48:27.449
Write a blog or
whatever, but also

00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:31.154
make sure you
address [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:31.154 --> 00:48:33.062
AUDIENCE: Yeah, a
question about blogging.

00:48:33.062 --> 00:48:35.866
Have you ever blogged, or do
you encourage blogging, or?

00:48:35.866 --> 00:48:37.490
KATE KERRIGAN: I do
encourage blogging.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:38.370
I think it's great.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.480
And I think one of the
great things about blogging

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.320
is that the level of
communication that there

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.840
is between bloggers, and
particularly book bloggers

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.497
and reviewers and
all that, of people

00:48:48.497 --> 00:48:50.330
that are passionate
about books, now there's

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.680
a fantastic blogging
community out there.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.670
I do think, again, finding
a market for blogging

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.720
is the difficult thing.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.280
But I definitely encourage
it, because otherwise you're

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.190
writing a diary into
a piece of paper.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:07.502
Blogging is the
new diary, really.

00:49:07.502 --> 00:49:12.412
AUDIENCE: Also vlogging
on YouTube [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:12.412 --> 00:49:15.849
would be like the YouTube
stars that now [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:18.304
as well as actual doing it,
as in your voice recognition

00:49:18.304 --> 00:49:21.627
thing, they're actually
vlogging as a form of diary.

00:49:21.627 --> 00:49:22.460
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.376
AUDIENCE: And that's
their version of writing.

00:49:24.376 --> 00:49:25.665
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah.

00:49:25.665 --> 00:49:27.040
Yeah, that's
interesting as well.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.600
I--

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:34.474
KATE KERRIGAN: Yeah, the YouTube
thing and the whole vlogging

00:49:34.474 --> 00:49:35.640
thing is really interesting.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.709
It's just so
difficult when you're

00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:41.750
coming in from the outside
to know where to begin

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.850
accessing the good vloggers.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.410
Do you know?

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:48.560
But yeah, it is all changing.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.347
And voice recognition
technology,

00:49:52.347 --> 00:49:54.680
I think that's going to come
through for a lot of people

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.180
as well.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:57.990
There's very, very
few writers using it.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.870
Terry Pratchett
used it, but I can't

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:07.530
find any professional writers
that do it, apart from me.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.510
But it has been very, very good.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.660
I think it's important
with vlogging

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.700
and with doing anything with
the voice to actually see

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.530
it written down afterwards.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.840
Because the work that I'm
doing at the moment, I think,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.210
is actually an improvement on
the first draft of my written

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:30.290
drafts, but only because
when you vlog something,

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.860
when you write something down
with the voice recognition

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.120
technology, you need
to go back and correct

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.660
it a couple of times.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.050
So I think it's
important that people

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:43.470
don't lose that relationship
with the actual written word.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:47.370
Because that's only way
to make writing thoughtful

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.034
is to go back and edit it.

00:50:50.034 --> 00:50:52.524
AUDIENCE: Do you worry these
days, like with texting, kids

00:50:52.524 --> 00:50:54.963
all write like that naturally.

00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:57.504
So you feel like we have to keep
hold of the English language

00:50:57.504 --> 00:51:02.601
somehow and keep [INAUDIBLE]
correct rather than this.

00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:04.600
And it's great to just
get your voice out there,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.809
but then you also
don't want to lose

00:51:06.809 --> 00:51:08.734
that proper English
language over time.

00:51:08.734 --> 00:51:10.150
KATE KERRIGAN: But
that's texting.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.780
It's a different thing as well.

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.177
Because it has got
that brevity to it.

00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:18.010
When you're writing
using voice recognition,

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.180
you put in all the
punctuation, and my punctuation

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.542
has actually improved.

00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:22.250
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.208
KATE KERRIGAN: Oh yeah.

00:51:23.208 --> 00:51:25.300
It's improved totally
overnight, because you

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.810
have to think about it.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.910
Because you use
the natural pauses,

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.650
and you use all the
natural, you know?

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:32.110
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:32.610
Thank you.

00:51:35.919 --> 00:51:37.710
KATE KERRIGAN: Now,
are we going to finish?

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:40.254
I could sit here all
afternoon, frankly!

00:51:40.254 --> 00:51:41.920
SARAH: Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.003
KATE KERRIGAN: Not at all.

00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:44.580
Thank you.
