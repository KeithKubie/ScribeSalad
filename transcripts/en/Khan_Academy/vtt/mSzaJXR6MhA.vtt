00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:01.410
- [Professor] So we've been talking about

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.807
Jacksonian democracy,

00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:05.556
and when we last left off,

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:08.995
Andrew Jackson had
defeated John Quincy Adams

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:10.995
in the election of 1828,

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.234
largely by claiming that

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:18.437
Quincy Adams had won the previous election

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:20.755
through a corrupt bargain.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:25.249
So Jackson played upon the
sympathies of the public

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.096
by claiming that he was the common man

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:30.972
or the representation of the common man.

00:00:30.972 --> 00:00:34.478
He took advantage of the growing number

00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:36.210
of white male voters

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.751
who could participate in elections.

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:43.087
And particularly the growing
numbers of frontier settlers,

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:46.465
who not only wanted to vote
for the first president

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:48.398
to be born in the west,

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:51.399
also supported Jackson because

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.371
he was known for his
anti-Native American sentiment

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.641
and his promise to remove Native Americans

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.940
from lands that whites wanted to settle

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.094
east of the Mississippi.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.056
So in the first video in this series,

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:08.576
I mentioned that most
scholars point to this moment

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:11.815
of Jackson's election in 1828

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:14.752
as the beginning of modern democracy.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.949
So let's investigate some of those claims

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:18.206
a little bit further.

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:22.314
So what was it about Jackson's
election and presidency

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:26.017
that began the modern
American political system?

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:29.238
Well, for one thing
Jackson was the very first

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:31.003
democratic president,

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:35.757
as in the first president
to be a modern-day democrat.

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:38.311
And this is the same democratic party

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.279
that we still have today.

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:42.905
And Jackson really
mobilized this sentiment

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.288
of the party of the common man.

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.455
And in his idea that meant

00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:52.801
the common white man,

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:57.343
that he was not one of these

00:01:57.343 --> 00:02:00.208
eastern elites, banking elites,

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:04.663
who made their fortunes by
nickel-and-diming other people.

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:07.330
He was a backwoods frontiersman,

00:02:09.013 --> 00:02:09.930
a war hero,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.183
someone who had pulled
himself up by his bootstrap.

00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:19.350
So he was, I guess, one of
the earliest self-made men.

00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:26.614
And it was clear from the
get-go that the age of Jackson

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:29.302
was going to be a completely different

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:32.804
kind of political culture
than had existed previously

00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:35.790
because at his inauguration

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.873
he had a giant inaugural celebration,

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.741
he opened up the White House to anybody.

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:48.587
The rabble came in and
they trashed the place,

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:52.754
and the older aristocratic
class of Washington politicians

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:55.619
thought that this was more or less

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.007
the end of the republic as they knew it.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.852
This was going to be the era of mob rule.

00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:04.778
But, you know, the wheels
didn't come off democracy.

00:03:04.778 --> 00:03:08.476
And one thing that Jackson really did was

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.726
he rewarded his supporters.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.778
He rewarded the people
who had voted Democrat,

00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:20.772
who saw themselves as part
of the Democratic Party

00:03:20.772 --> 00:03:23.681
with government positions.

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.094
And this is called the spoils system,

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:31.094
along the lines of to the
victor, go the spoils.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.026
So to reward the democratic machine

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:38.928
that had put him in office,

00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.748
he kicked out earlier office-holders

00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:45.567
and rewarded the Democrats with offices.

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:48.949
That was very common in this time period

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.945
for people to be,

00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:54.185
who are known as office seekers,

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:57.268
to kinda hang out in Washington, D.C.

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:01.854
trying to get the president to appoint you

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:05.017
postmaster of some random place

00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:07.175
so that you could draw
a government salary.

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:11.001
Now, earlier presidents would
have thought something like

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:15.167
rewarding an office seeker quite vulgar.

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.237
John Quincy Adams, for example,

00:04:17.237 --> 00:04:21.589
refused to replace anyone who
was actually doing a good job

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.174
in their government post

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:25.519
with someone who was
one of his supporters.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.163
So you can debate whether or not

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:29.075
this is actually a good thing,

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:31.028
to kick out people who
are good at their job

00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:33.032
in favor of people who have supported you

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:34.241
during the campaign.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:38.985
But what it does is it
keeps people in the party.

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.902
So it makes sure that
even if the party loses,

00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.883
they know that they
have put in their labor

00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:51.994
for the Democratic Party

00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:55.181
and later for the Whig
and Republican Party.

00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:58.424
And so they're going to keep working

00:04:58.424 --> 00:05:01.805
to put their candidate in office

00:05:01.805 --> 00:05:04.722
so that they can reap some rewards.

00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:09.527
So this is one way in which

00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.944
Jackson kind of solidifies party politics

00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:18.779
so that you stop just
being a Jackson partisan,

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:19.968
a Jefferson partisan,

00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:22.247
someone who follows a political candidate.

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:25.029
And remember that earlier
political candidates kind of

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.272
stood as men of virtue, right?

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:33.244
Now, the virtue is shifting
from the men themselves

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:36.500
to the party that they represent.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.000
And this party system was cemented by 1832

00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:44.480
when Jackson was reelected,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.666
when they held a national
nominating convention,

00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:51.879
it sounds very familiar to us today,

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.129
and put out an official party platform.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.534
So what else did Jackson do
that was really influential?

00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:04.103
Ironically, for someone
billing himself as a

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:05.505
man of the people,

00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:08.653
Jackson worked really
hard to expand the power

00:06:08.653 --> 00:06:10.653
of the Executive Branch.

00:06:13.382 --> 00:06:15.632
So he wanted the presidency

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:19.849
to be as powerful, if not more powerful,

00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:22.903
than the Judicial Branch

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:26.181
or the Legislative Branch
of the United States,

00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.793
more powerful than the
Supreme Court or Congress.

00:06:29.793 --> 00:06:31.904
And there were two major instances

00:06:31.904 --> 00:06:35.571
where he shows his interest in becoming

00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.487
the most powerful part of
the American government.

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:42.100
One of these was and what's
known as the Bank War

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.183
when Jackson attempted to

00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:47.415
kill the bank of the United States,

00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:48.682
and he succeeded,

00:06:48.682 --> 00:06:52.046
because he thought that the
national bank was corrupt,

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.471
that it benefited the elite,

00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:57.575
that it deserved more oversight
from the federal government,

00:06:57.575 --> 00:06:58.960
some of which was true.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.119
And when congress tried to
recharter the national bank,

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:03.952
he vetoed the charter.

00:07:06.357 --> 00:07:09.930
Basically saying that
he felt that his vote

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.152
was more important than
the vote of Congress.

00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:17.006
And for this, a group of
people who started to coalesce

00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:19.282
around their hatred for Jackson

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.835
started calling him King Andrew the First

00:07:21.835 --> 00:07:26.457
because Jackson used the power
of the veto all the time,

00:07:26.457 --> 00:07:28.762
because he was trying to, in some ways,

00:07:28.762 --> 00:07:31.516
reduce the power of
the federal government,

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:34.400
which was one of the key
tenants of the Democratic Party,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.844
but at the same time kind
of increase his own power

00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.512
because he used his veto in many cases

00:07:40.512 --> 00:07:42.353
to further his own agenda.

00:07:42.353 --> 00:07:43.527
And as much as the national bank

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:45.346
was not a great institution,

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:48.873
it did help to keep the
United States' economy

00:07:48.873 --> 00:07:50.927
more or less humming along.

00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:52.603
And once Jackson killed it,

00:07:52.603 --> 00:07:55.944
there was a major
economic depression called

00:07:55.944 --> 00:07:57.444
the Panic of 1837,

00:07:59.915 --> 00:08:03.369
which we can lay pretty much
squarely at Jackson's feet.

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:05.424
We can see this political
cartoon here has him

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.413
trampling on the constitution

00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:09.643
as he pushes his own agenda forward.

00:08:09.643 --> 00:08:12.340
And it's through their
hatred of Jackson that

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.300
a new group comes
together, the Whig Party,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.532
which will provide the second half

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:22.129
of the two-party system
that comes to the fore

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:23.796
in this time period.

00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:27.528
So this is Andrew Jackson arguing that

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:29.999
the president has more
power than Congress.

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:32.040
There's the second
example of Andrew Jackson

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.485
trying to argue that he had

00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:35.602
more power than the Supreme Court,

00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:38.935
which comes comes in the Trail of Tears.

00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:43.535
So Andrew Jackson
represented the interests

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.745
of white settlers

00:08:45.745 --> 00:08:48.578
who really saw Native Americans as

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:51.604
no more than an obstacle

00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:54.445
to their continuous push westward,

00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:56.778
the availability of land,

00:08:56.778 --> 00:08:59.111
which they saw really as the

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:02.714
cornerstone of American prosperity.

00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:07.009
And I can't do justice to the
entire Trail of Tears here.

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:08.688
We have an article about that

00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:10.457
and there'll be more
to come in the future.

00:09:10.457 --> 00:09:14.457
But suffice it to say
that the American Indians,

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:19.397
who were living in Georgia particularly

00:09:19.397 --> 00:09:23.314
and who were known as
the Five Civilized Tribes

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:29.107
because they had adopted many
of the ways of the Europeans

00:09:29.107 --> 00:09:32.338
including Christianity
and in some cases slavery,

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.575
the Supreme Court ruled

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:38.742
that they were entitled to be
treated as a sovereign nation.

00:09:42.809 --> 00:09:47.330
So when Georgia is trying
to remove Native Americans

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.663
from their lands in Georgia,

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:53.502
the chief justice of the Supreme Court,

00:09:53.502 --> 00:09:54.669
John Marshall,

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.329
rules in their favor.

00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:02.962
And Andrew Jackson was quoted as saying,

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:06.470
"John Marshall has made his decision.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.041
"Now let him enforce it."

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.458
So even though the Supreme Court defended

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:18.516
the status of the Native
Americans living in Georgia

00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:21.009
east of the Mississippi in general,

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:23.071
Andrew Jackson and the state of Georgia

00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:27.154
went ahead with forcing
the Five Civilized Tribes

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.676
to move westward to Oklahoma

00:10:30.676 --> 00:10:34.009
during which at least 3,000 people died.

00:10:34.999 --> 00:10:38.405
So Andrew Jackson serves a second term

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:41.738
and finishes out his presidency in 1836.

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.946
He considered running for a third term,

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:46.262
decided against it.

00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:50.055
Instead, his crony Martin Van Buren,

00:10:50.055 --> 00:10:52.763
who's basically Andrew Jackson Jr.,

00:10:52.763 --> 00:10:54.920
serves as president for one term.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.480
But due to the Panic of 1837,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.932
Martin Van Buren, like
poor Herbert Hoover later,

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:03.955
is forced to deal with
an economic depression.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.687
And you know that people are never happy

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:08.531
with the incumbent president

00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:10.295
when there's an economic decline.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.545
So in the election of 1840,

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:15.115
the Whigs,

00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:18.835
the opposition party to Andrew Jackson,

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:22.668
run William Henry Harrison
as their candidate.

00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:25.846
And he is mostly famous for

00:11:25.846 --> 00:11:29.873
being a fellow who died in
office after only 40 days.

00:11:29.873 --> 00:11:31.317
But what's interesting

00:11:31.317 --> 00:11:33.918
about William Henry Harrison's campaign

00:11:33.918 --> 00:11:37.972
is that the Whigs have
learned their lesson

00:11:37.972 --> 00:11:42.561
about the political climate
of the Jacksonian age.

00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.015
They marketed William Henry Harrison

00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:49.174
as having been born in a log cabin,

00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:50.091
a war hero,

00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.822
he was a man of the people,

00:11:52.822 --> 00:11:54.732
just a common guy who had

00:11:54.732 --> 00:11:57.178
pulled himself up by his bootstraps.

00:11:57.178 --> 00:11:58.390
Now, none of this was true.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.423
William Henry Harrison was from Virginia,

00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:03.159
he was from a very wealthy family,

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:05.118
he had been college educated.

00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:06.920
He was no more rough and tumble than

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.768
John Quincy Adams had been.

00:12:08.768 --> 00:12:11.322
But the Whigs had
learned a valuable lesson

00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:14.477
about what American
political culture was like

00:12:14.477 --> 00:12:17.518
in the age of mass democracy.

00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:19.979
And from this point forward,

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:23.262
it's clear that Americans
don't like their politicians

00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:24.705
too highfalutin

00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:28.692
and woe betide any candidate
who wasn't born in a log cabin,

00:12:28.692 --> 00:12:31.811
the modern American
political system had begun.
