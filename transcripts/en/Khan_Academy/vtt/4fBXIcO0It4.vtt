00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.660
If you flip three
fair coins, what

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.590
is the probability that
you'll get at least two tails?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.170
The tree diagram below shows
all the possible outcomes

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.840
of flipping three coins.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.270
At the top of the
tree, this shows

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.857
us the two outcomes
for the first coin,

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.440
and then given each
of those outcomes,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.350
it shows us what's possible
for the second coins.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.895
If we got a heads
on the first coin,

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.020
we could get a heads or a
tails on the second coin.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.170
Got a tails on the
first coin, well,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560
we could get a heads or a
tails on the second coin.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.060
And then for each
of those outcomes,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.020
it shows us the different
outcomes for the third coins.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.530
So let's just think
about where on this--

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.460
how do we represent
getting at least two tails?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.510
Or what are the total outcomes,
and which of those meet

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.300
our constraints of getting
at least two tails?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.590
So this node right
over here, this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.550
is getting a heads
on the third coin,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.620
a heads on the
second coin, we just

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.650
have to follow up the tree,
and a heads on the first coin.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.290
So this is getting three heads,
so this is definitely not

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.450
going to meet our constraint.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.300
This node right over
here, we have a head,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.780
head-- this is
often called a leaf

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.050
if we're talking
about a tree diagram--

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.380
a head, head, and a tail.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.440
So that's one tail.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.340
That doesn't meet our constraint
of at least two tails.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.470
What about this one here?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.600
Heads, tails, heads.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.270
Once again, only one tail,
so that doesn't meet it.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.750
Heads, tails, tails.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.210
This one does.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.210
So let me color this in.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.480
Let me color all the ones
that meet our constraints.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.146
This is getting a
tail on the third one,

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.570
a tail on the second one,
and a heads on the first.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930
So that's at least two tails.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.640
Here we have tails,
heads, heads.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.900
That doesn't meet it.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.510
Tails, heads, tails.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.710
That does.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.230
So let's color this one in.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.060
And then tails, tails.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.390
Well, if you got a tail on
the first and the second,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.724
then either of these are
going to meet the constraints,

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.140
because you already
got two tails.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780
So that one meets it.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.110
That you've got tails, tails,
heads, and tails, tails, tails.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.860
Both of them.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620
So, let's go back
to the question.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.310
What is the probability that
you'll get at least two tails?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.440
Well, how many equally
likely outcomes are there?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.020
We're assuming this
is a fair coin.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.077
We see that there are
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:06.080
8 equally likely outcomes.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.389
And how many of these
outcomes met our constraints?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.760
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.340
4 out of the 8.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.150
4/8, which could also be
viewed is equivalent to 1/2.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.999
The probability that I'll get
at least two tails is 1/2.
