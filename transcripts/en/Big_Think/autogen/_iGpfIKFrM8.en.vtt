Fusion is a frustrating technology
because we all know that it'll work the

problem with Fusion is we haven't been

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900
problem with Fusion is we haven't been
 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.249
problem with Fusion is we haven't been
able to sustain a fusion reaction long

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259
able to sustain a fusion reaction long

fusion is always 30 years away and that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400
fusion is always 30 years away and that
 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.520

that remains the case today by any

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530
that remains the case today by any
 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.760

foreseeable new developments but there

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770
foreseeable new developments but there
 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.829
foreseeable new developments but there
is research going on and one of these

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839
is research going on and one of these
 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.630
is research going on and one of these
days I would hope that somebody has a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640
days I would hope that somebody has a
 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.910
days I would hope that somebody has a
breakthrough and that would truly be a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920
breakthrough and that would truly be a
 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.770
breakthrough and that would truly be a
game changer because then we really

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780
game changer because then we really
 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.660
game changer because then we really
would very likely be able to have energy

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
would very likely be able to have energy
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.299
would very likely be able to have energy
so cheap that we wouldn't worry about

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309
so cheap that we wouldn't worry about
 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.669
so cheap that we wouldn't worry about
metering it but I don't think we can

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679
metering it but I don't think we can
 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.239
metering it but I don't think we can
count on that happening so then you look

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249
count on that happening so then you look
 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.069
count on that happening so then you look
at other alternatives like advanced

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079
