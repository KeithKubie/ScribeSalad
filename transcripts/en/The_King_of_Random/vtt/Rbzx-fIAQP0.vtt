Hey guys I'm Grant Thompson with www.thekingofrandom.com

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.160
I just saw this video from Destin with Smarter Every Day

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.180
about him punching a guy in the stomach at about

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.010
3200 frames a second which looked awesome,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
and I thought that would be a cool experiment to duplicate,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010
so ...

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.000
... I went and got this guy.  This is Darren Dyk with BeyondSlowMotion.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.070
And I went and got this guy ...

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.110
... This is my good friend Jeremy Hardie.  Make a muscle.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.170
So I think with a little bit of slow motion camera

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.130
and good friends, maybe we can duplicate that experience

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.000
"King of Random" style.  Let's check it out.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.800
3 .. 2 .. 1

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.400
Hiya

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.600
3 .. 2 .. 1

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.170
Hadouken

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.600
Yes!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.700
Hadouken

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.400
Yes!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.170
Well guys, I really hope you enjoyed that.  We had a  lot of fun doing it.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.040
Shout-out to Destin from Smarter Every Day for the idea,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.020
and what's really weird about this, is I just realized,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.900
I'm actually wearing the same shirt that Destin was wearing in the video.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.120
And that wasn't planned at all.  It's kind of crazy.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.400
So thanks to Darren Dyk from BeyondSlowMotion.  Make sure you check out his channel.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.080
He actually let me slap him in the face with a fist full of fire

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.800
so if you want to see that, make sure you check out the video right here.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.700
And thanks to my friend Jeremy Hardie.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.800
He dropped everything tonight just to stop by and make this all possible.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.070
If you want him for anything, and ladies he is single,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.300
contact me and I'll get you in touch.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.800
Hey, thanks for watching, we'll see you around.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.500
3 .. 2 .. 1

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.200
Hadouken

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.500
Dang it.  Missed
