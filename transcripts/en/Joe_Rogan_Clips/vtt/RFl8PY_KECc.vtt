1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.240
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.780
That was one of those just unbelievable moment.
And I love Kevin Kelly.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.310
He was great.
He was also at the top is speaks to that.

4
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:16.750
Gave him rd coat.
Kevin was there and saying young guy,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.680
he's still a young guy and he really should be fine.
One's 70,

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.370
honestly.
Yeah.
I mean he fought at one seven.
He just,

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.070
he likes to eat,
you know,
just help a lot.
A hell of a hard guy,
man.

8
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.530
Kevin,
if you listen to me,
man,
Kelvin's a beast.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.020
He's not even near his full potential yet.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.950
I don't think a style bender is either.
Oh No,

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.700
there's still a young guy stopped benders better now that he was in his first

12
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:47.360
fight in the UFC,
which is only about 16 months ago.
He's better now.

13
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.440
He's trouble for anybody,
man.
He's in his house then he,
that guy has,

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.550
he's probably the most technical striker that's ever fought in the UFC.

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.570
So tactical.
All right.
Um,
okay.
Let me ask you about this.

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.060
I heard a rumor of him in time Jones.
No,
no.

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.430
Each other.
Oh yeah.
Um,

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.430
John was talking shit about him and he was talking shit about John,
you know,

19
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
that maybe they'll fight.
John is way bigger.
John's a big man.

20
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.980
I know.
Yeah.
And it's bad motherfucker vendor man.

21
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.100
I mean maybe one day they could fight.
But John,

22
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.470
I think John's futures and heavyweight.
I really do.

23
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.770
I think John's going to clean out the light heavyweight division and then move

24
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:34.240
up and I think he's probably going to try to catch DC before DC steps out

25
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.550
because DC is going to fight against deep Emile chick.

26
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.690
They're going to have a rematch and then I think,
um,
DC versus John Jones.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.340
Yeah,
it heavy weight.

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.500
I think John Wants to go up there and take that heavyweight title,
you know,

29
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.130
but I think DC has a better chance against him at heavyweight.

30
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.770
I don't think DC liked cutting weight and I don't think it's good for his

31
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:54.700
performance or his durability or anything.
You know,
I think,

32
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.690
I mean,
judging by his fights with Derek Lewis,

33
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.130
who's a fucking huge guy and knocking out steep mule chick who's nobody's ever

34
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:05.830
been able to do it like that before,
the way DC did it.
I mean,

35
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.000
DC says at heavyweight,
he's just way more powerful or hits harder,

36
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.150
takes a punch better,
you know?
I mean,
he's not tall guy.

37
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.960
He's only like five 11 but he's is,
why does this fucking table,
yeah,

38
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.400
DC's a tank of a man.

39
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.190
His wrestling ability is just phenomenal.
Well,
that's why it's John.

40
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.310
So goddamn oppressive at John took him dad,

41
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.590
John of went right at them with wrestling.
It's like,
motherfucker,

42
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:33.730
I'm going to take you down and scare you.
There goes,
my favorite

43
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.820
food is if he's not the greatest of all time,
he's in a conversation.

44
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.060
Is that a conversation that's like me?
My,

45
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:43.650
my opinion is that mighty mouse Johnson is the greatest of all time,

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.390
but the caveat is that mighty mouse never really fought the Caribou caliber of

47
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.950
competition that Jon Jones did.

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.790
Jon Jones first fight in the UFC at for a title.

49
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.330
He's fighting Mauricio Shogun Hua.
Who is a legend.

50
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.700
That's John's first fight opens up with a flying knee.

51
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.490
The fly me into legend.
No.
Chopes Leo Machida,
completely unconscious,

52
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.500
chokes out rampage.
Choke sizes,
just smashed everybody.
John smashed everybody.

53
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.870
He's only lost one time.
That's a bullshit loss.
It was a bullshit lawsuit.

54
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.240
Disqualification and fight that he was dominated.
Yep.
He's a freak man.

55
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.370
He's a real free.
Most definitely is my afraid.

56
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.040
Especially since he told me he listens to my ass before I fight.

57
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:32.040
I always listen to your,
I am the one speak Ct.
Hell yes.

58
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.950
He's something special.
If they're from,
he really is.
He's something special.

59
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:39.990
And I think,
um,
you know,
he's had some troubles in his life and troubles,

60
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.320
but I think he's got that shit behind him.
I really do.
And I think he's,
you know,

61
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.210
I mean,
he hasn't had a near death experience,

62
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:51.211
but I think he's had so many like near career experiences that he appreciates it

63
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:56.650
now.
And I also think to be that good,
you gotta be fucking crazy.

64
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.980
And I think Jon Jones is fucking crazy and he's just getting his crazy online.

65
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.850
He's just getting his crazy in order,
like keep my crazy and under wraps.

66
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.510
Just keep my crazy together.
There's going to be that good.

67
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:10.570
You gotta be a wild mother fucker.
Oh,
you've got to be wild.
If that's,

68
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.030
that's what he is.
He's smart too though.

69
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.130
He's got like the perfect combination of things like smart and wild,
you know,

70
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.760
and physically talented like,
and then I met a long,

71
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.630
long as fuck for the weight class.
He's very strong told.
Yeah,

72
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:27.210
I seen a weight lifting man.

73
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:30.610
I trying to get time tones into the belly of the beast.

74
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.000
You can only go,
go,
he's fine.
I'm sure.
Maybe after the fight with Tiago Santos,

75
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.770
so have some time off.
But he uh,
it's interesting,

76
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:41.650
his coach thought that his power lifting was a bad idea for him,

77
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.600
apparently not coaches.

78
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.730
Well they think that he got really into that before the OSP fight.
Man,

79
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:52.150
we had a big stretch of time off and then the OSP fight,
he didn't look as good,

80
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.730
but I credit that to Osp.

81
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.300
I just think that OSP fought real hard fight and he's a real big,

82
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:03.301
strong guy in his fucking dangerous and I opens it improves the piece,

83
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:09.010
Matt.
Yeah.
I think that it's just one of those things where stylistically,

84
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.210
you know,
opens,
fought a really good fight and I mean,
opens had a broken arm for,

85
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.930
I think the last round that round with a fucking shattered arm.

86
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.230
Never let anybody know.
Didn't say a Goddamn word about his forearms snapped.

87
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.930
Yeah.
From some base to do that.
It's the hardest game in the world.
