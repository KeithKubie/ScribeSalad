00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:08.895
More than six thousand light years

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:10.335
from the surface of the earth,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.575
a rapidly spinning neutron star

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.765
called the Black Widow pulsar

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.665
blasts its companion brown dwarf 
star with radiation

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:22.855
as the two orbit each other 
every 9 hours.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.525
Standing on our own planet,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.995
you might think you’re just an observer
of this violent ballet.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.545
But in fact, both stars are pulling you 
towards them.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.165
And you’re pulling back,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.495
connected across trillions of kilometers

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:37.665
by gravity.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.075
Gravity is the attractive force 
between two objects with mass—

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.275
any two objects with mass.

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:49.505
Which means that every object in the
universe attracts every other object:

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:51.595
every star, black hole,

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:54.755
human being, smartphone, and atom

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.295
are all constantly pulling on each other.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.955
So why don’t we feel pulled in billions 
of different directions?

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:05.295
Two reasons: mass and distance.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:09.825
The original equation describing the 
gravitational force between two objects

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.995
was written by Isaac Newton in 1687.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:17.655
Scientists’ understanding of gravity has 
evolved since then,

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:20.355
but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:24.135
is still a good approximation 
in most situations.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:25.495
It goes like this:

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.215
the gravitational force between two 
objects

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.035
is equal to the mass of one

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.925
times the mass of the other,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.065
multiplied by a very small number

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.205
called the gravitational constant,

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:40.335
and divided by the distance between them, 
squared.

00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:42.695
If you doubled the mass of one of 
the objects,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.195
the force between them would double, too.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.075
If the distance between them doubled,

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.125
the force would be one-fourth as strong.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:55.126
The gravitational force between you and 
the Earth pulls you towards its center,

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:57.886
a force you experience as your weight.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:00.626
Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.436
when you’re standing at sea level.

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:04.336
If you traveled to the Dead Sea,

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:08.116
the force would increase by a tiny 
fraction of a percent.

00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:12.276
And if you climbed to the top of Mount 
Everest, the force would decrease—

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:15.603
but again, by a minuscule amount.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:19.338
Traveling higher would make a bigger dent 
in gravity’s influence,

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.438
but you won’t escape it.

00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:25.838
Gravity is generated by variations 
in the curvature of spacetime—

00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:28.388
the three dimensions of space plus time—

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:32.460
which bend around any object 
that has mass.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.710
Gravity from Earth reaches the 
International Space Station,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.200
400 kilometers above the earth,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.820
with almost its original intensity.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.390
If the space station was stationary 
on top of a giant column,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.450
you’d still experience ninety percent

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.360
of the gravitational force there 
that you do on the ground.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.900
Astronauts just experience weightlessness

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
because the space station is constantly 
falling towards earth.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.470
Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet 
fast enough that it never hits the ground.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.880
By the time you made it to 
the surface of the moon,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.750
around 400,000 kilometers away,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.690
Earth’s gravitational pull would be

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.520
less than 0.03 percent of 
what you feel on earth.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.667
The only gravity you’d be aware of 
would be the moon’s,

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:20.857
which is about one sixth as strong 
as the earth’s.

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:22.377
Travel farther still

00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:26.177
and Earth’s gravitational pull on you
will continue to decrease,

00:03:26.177 --> 00:03:28.757
but never drop to zero.

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:31.126
Even safely tethered to the Earth,

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:38.206
we’re subject to the faint tug of distant 
celestial bodies and nearby earthly ones.

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:41.681
The Sun exerts a force of about 
half a Newton on you.

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.911
If you’re a few meters away from a 
smartphone, you'll experience

00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:48.411
a mutual force of a few piconewtons.

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.971
That’s about the same as the 
gravitational pull

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.921
between you and the Andromeda Galaxy,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.781
which is 2.5 million light years away

00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:00.641
but about a trillion times as massive 
as the sun.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.791
But when it comes to escaping gravity,

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.011
there’s a loophole.

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:07.531
If all the mass around us is 
pulling on us all the time,

00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.491
how would Earth’s gravity change

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.961
if you tunneled deep below the surface,

00:04:11.961 --> 00:04:15.757
assuming you could do so without being 
cooked or crushed?

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:19.847
If you hollowed out the center 
of a perfectly spherical Earth—

00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:22.147
which it isn’t, but let’s just say it 
were—

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:25.977
you’d experience an identical pull from 
all sides.

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:28.307
And you’d be suspended, weightless,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:32.497
only encountering the tiny pulls 
from other celestial bodies.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.080
So you could escape the Earth’s gravity 
in such a thought experiment—

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.380
but only by heading straight into it.
