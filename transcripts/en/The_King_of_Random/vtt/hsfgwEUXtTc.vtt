00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.270
In part 1 of this project, we scavenged some
parts from household appliances, and modified

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.450
them so we could weld metal. In this project,
we'll be rigging up the electrical system,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.230
and adding some finishing touches so that
our homemade stick welder is ready for operation.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
I started this project with a scrap piece
of 3/4" plywood that I had left over from

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.039
the "router table" project. And since we have
a router table, let's profile the edges with

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.480
a beading bit, just because we can. Next,
let's cut a piece of 2x2, and screw it in

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.219
from the bottom so that it's secured in the
center, and about 1" from the edge. We'll

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.739
also need to drill a couple of pilot holes
in the top, because this is where we'll be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.030
attaching some copper lugs. To make these,
we simply take a piece of 1/2" copper tubing,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.890
and use a hacksaw to cut 2" from the end.
Half of the tube can be placed in the jaws

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.060
of a bench vise, and when the vise is closed
with a significant amount of force, you can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.670
see that we're left with a nice flat end.
Let's place that on another piece of scrap

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.840
wood, and drill a 5/32" hole so that it penetrates
through to the other side. I've done this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
with 4 different pieces, and to clean up the
rough metal barbs, I'm using a belt sander

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.659
to gently file away at the edges until it
looks a little more user friendly. This lug

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.479
here is gonna attach to a 5' length of
8 gauge cable. This was left over from when

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.340
we wound our coils. We'll just need to strip
about 2 inches of insulation from the ends

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.630
to expose the copper wire, then bend the wire
over with a pair of pliers to form a little

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.130
loop. The exposed copper loop can be slid
inside the casing, and to make this a permanent

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.380
connection, let's crimp it onto the cable
using the bench vise like we did before. This

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.140
connection isn't coming apart, and should
easily handle the high currents that we'll

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.840
be exposing it to. The other end of this cable
will be our ground clamp. I got this metal

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.620
clamp for $0.99 and with the rubber tips removed,
it'll conduct electricity. I crimped a pice

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.300
of copper tube to the end of the wire, and
secured it to the clamp with a screw. The

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.660
spring in the clamp is surprisingly powerful.
It bites down with a good amount of pressure,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.050
and that's what we need for making a firm
connection with our workpiece. Now a welding

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.400
rod could just be pinched to the cable with
a pair of pliers, but i went ahead and spent

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.300
$13 on a proper electrode holder. This makes
it look more like a real welder, and adds

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.530
a tremendous amount of convenience and control.
Ok, we've got our lugs crimped on the ends

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.610
of the secondary coils, so let's mount the
transformers on the base. You probably noticed

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.840
that I cut the cable in the middle, and crimped
them to a common lug in the center. This is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.890
because I wanted an option to center tap the
transformers to power other devices, like

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.600
an electrical arc furnace. Look for how to
make that in a different project. A few screws

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.820
can be used to hold the transformers in place,
and the grounding clip can be connected by

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.540
overlapping the respective lugs and pinning
them down with a screw. The electrode holder

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.650
gets attached in the same way, and here you
can see there is plenty of separation to prevent

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.410
the terminals from shorting out. Alright,
let's get ready to rig up the electrical system.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.690
This cord was saved from one of the microwaves
we tore apart, and after exposing the 3 wires

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.620
inside, I'm gonna cut off the green one
just to get it out of the way. It's not gonna

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.970
to be connected to anything. Now here is the
trick to powering the welder. 240 volts AC.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.350
I can't recommend this is the safest way to
do it, but here's how I did it with a couple

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.100
of plugs, a connector, and some 10 gauge wire.
Each outlet in my house provides around 120

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.890
volts AC and they're connected to a circuit
breaker bus bar. There are 2 breaker busses,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.680
and if a hot lead is taken from each of the
busses, we get 240 volts. Now rather than tapping

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.140
into the breaker box directly, I ran extension
cords to 2 different wall outlets that were

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.420
180ยบ out of phase. The extension cords connect
to this adaptor, which basically just connects

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.420
the 2 hot leads together. If connected properly,
the end result is 240 volts. Looking at the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.810
back of the transformers, you can see 4 terminals
that connect to the primary coils. I used

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.889
some salvaged cables and wire nuts to connect
a hot lead to one transformer, and a hot lead

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.189
to the other. Another wire was used to bridge
the two, connecting them in series. By the

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.550
way, the color of these wires doesn't mean
anything. They're all gonna be shock hazards.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.400
Ok, to finish up, let's fasten the power cable
to the base so it doesn't pull the connections

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.020
apart if the cable gets jerked around. It's
extremely important to remember this system

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.330
has no on or off switch, and can only be used
with a power controller, like the Scariac.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.250
You can see how to build this in another video.
If you remember back to when we inserted our

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.289
new secondary coils, I mentioned it didn't
really matter which way they went in, and

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.219
here's why. When the power is on, and our
welding electrodes are connected to a multimeter,

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.569
we should expect to see around 36 volts. But
here we're only getting 2.4. That means the

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.849
transformers are canceling each other out.
To fix this problem, let's just turn off the

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.780
power, and remove the connections to one of
the transformers. It shouldn't really matter

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.159
which one. Then we simply, switch the connections
around. That's it. This time when we turn

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.509
on the power and check the voltage, we've
got 37 volts. Now, rather than leaving all

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.340
the dangerous components exposed, I think
we can build a make-shift casing from this

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.969
plastic container. Here are the exact measurements
if you care to know. I choose to use the lid

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.719
as the base, and used a rotary tool with a
cutting wheel to make the surface flat. Our

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.289
entire welding assembly should fit right in
the center without any problems. I gave the

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.610
whole container a paint job, set the bin into
position, and locked it into place. Two holes

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.379
went in the front for our electrode cables,
and I also cut some ventilation holes on the

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.800
sides. There's a hole in the back for the
power cable, and now our welder is completely

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.210
finished and ready to test! Let's start by
directly shorting out the ground clip with

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.960
the electrode holder, because this will allow
the maximum amount of current to flow. We'll

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.360
use an amp meter to monitor the primary current,
turn on the Scariac, and power up. When the

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.719
power settles at around 15.5 amps on the primary,
you can see it produces about 100 amps on

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:28.229
the secondary. The amperage is adjustable,
so if we add more power, we can jump the welding

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.819
cables to over 200 amps. In any case, there's
certainly enough power available to strike

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:39.729
an arc, sustain it, and weld some metal. You
can see some of my first few experiences,

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.090
with the world of welding, in another video.
Well that's it for now. If you liked this

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.659
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
