obviously hinting him like seeing that
 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.750
obviously hinting him like seeing that
giant tree trunks monster and just

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760
giant tree trunks monster and just
 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.970
giant tree trunks monster and just
knowing what that's gonna become is

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980
knowing what that's gonna become is
 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.410
knowing what that's gonna become is
hugely funny um I do like that we learn

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420
hugely funny um I do like that we learn
 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.150
hugely funny um I do like that we learn
a bit more about the past like we

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160
a bit more about the past like we
 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
a bit more about the past like we
learned before about Simon and where

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170
learned before about Simon and where
 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.080
learned before about Simon and where
Simon came from but he found the crown

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090
Simon came from but he found the crown
 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.940
Simon came from but he found the crown
now we actually know where the crown

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950
now we actually know where the crown
 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.170
now we actually know where the crown
came from

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180
came from
 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.600
came from
so it's kind of like instead of like

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610
so it's kind of like instead of like
 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.890
so it's kind of like instead of like
some shows you learn everything all at

I think this is season six yeah we're
just learning where the crown comes from

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010
just learning where the crown comes from
 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.100
just learning where the crown comes from
is really cool I thought it's

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
is really cool I thought it's
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.020

science of Technology and magic as you

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530
science of Technology and magic as you
 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.990
science of Technology and magic as you
see inside the crown there's all these

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000
see inside the crown there's all these
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.850
see inside the crown there's all these
little gears and circuits and stuff like

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860
little gears and circuits and stuff like
 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.470
little gears and circuits and stuff like
that so I like that I didn't know they

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480
that so I like that I didn't know they
 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.330
