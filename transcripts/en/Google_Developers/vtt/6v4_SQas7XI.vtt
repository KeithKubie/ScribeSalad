PETE LEPAGE: Hey.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.210
Welcome, everybody, to
another exciting

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.960
Chrome Apps Office Hours.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.250
This week, we have a really
special show.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.370
Paul and I decided that rather
than go into some really crazy

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.950
kind of deep topic right before
the holidays, we wanted

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.870
to just show you a bunch
of really cool stuff.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.360
We wanted to just hang out with
you, answer some of your

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.240
questions, dive into some of
the things that you thought

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.500
might be interesting that we
thought have been interesting

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.680
in the last six months since
we launched Chrome Apps.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.860
So with that, I'll let Paul say
hi and introduce yourself.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.320
Paul, do you want
to say hi and--

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.480
PAUL KINLAN: Hi.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.730
I'm Paul.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.531
I'm based in London.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:53.866
Yeah, and you're in Mountain
View today.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.120
That's pretty cool.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.410
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.230
It's kind of neat.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.130
Normally we do this.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.330
I'm in New York.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.970
Paul's in London.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.980
This week, I'm in
Mountain View.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.190
We have the illustrious
Louis Gray helping us

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.150
produce this event.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.550
So kind of a fun way
to be doing things.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.950
So let's start.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.790
I want to show you a Chrome app
that I put together this

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.760
morning very special
for this week.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.960
Because I just was thinking, as
I was on my way into work

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.145
this morning, I'm like, huh,
what's going on this week?

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:25.720
Well, I'm in Mountain View.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.490
I've got to get a couple
of things done.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.910
And I was like, oh, right.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.410
There's this really cool event
happening this week.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.600
So I decided I was going to sit
down and pull together a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.080
real quick Chrome app.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.370
So let's go to my screen.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.810
I'm going to pull this guy up.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.950
And this is a little
Chrome app.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.400
You can pull this up in
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.040
I'll post a link to this
in our post afterwards.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.780
But just in case you were
curious how long it was until

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.810
the end of the world, until
December 21 at 11:11 UTC, we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.180
are now two days, 18 hours, six
minutes, and 56 seconds--

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.450
oh, 55 seconds-- oh, 50-- oh--

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.790
anyways, you get point.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.670
Until the end of the world.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.890
And I feel fine.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.350
PAUL KINLAN: Does it
do time zones?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.270
PETE LEPAGE: So yes, that takes
into account time zones.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.760
So same number of hours
left between us, Paul.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.160
So if I don't see you
next week, Paul--

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.690
well, actually, our Chrome Apps
Office Hours next week

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.350
would happen to fall
on Christmas Day.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.580
I don't plan on working.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.160
So I won't see you next
week this time.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.340
But I'll see you in the
new year as long as

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.160
this doesn't happen.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.173
How does that sound?

00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:35.920
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.150
Good.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.390
I think it sounds good.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.890
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.420
Well Paul, I know you had
a couple of apps that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.740
you wanted to show.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.340
I've got a couple more that
I want to talk about.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.820
And we'll take your questions.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.850
Louis, if we could put the
questions, the moderator link

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.810
up, so if people have questions
and they want to ask

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.820
questions, please post
your questions to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.950
our moderator link.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.120
And Paul and I will take
those as we go along

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.790
and take your questions.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.710
So with that, Paul, I'll
pass it over to you.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.590
And you can talk about a couple,
and then I'll come

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.700
back and do a couple more.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.090
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, cool.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.430
So today is all about showing
you some cool things that have

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.700
been built with Chrome Apps.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.160
Obviously, it's, not completely
public yet, in the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.090
sense that normal consumers
can't re-download these

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.510
applications and install
them into Chrome.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.130
But you can still do some
really cool stuff.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.730
All of these are available
in the Web Store.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.710
Most of these are already
available in the Web Store,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.080
which I think was two weeks ago,
I think, where basically,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.940
we just enabled it so that you
could actually upload these

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.500
and host them and get your
users to test the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.780
applications.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.725
And one of them which we can't
actually get installed just

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.730
yet is this news reader, which
we had actually built for

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.140
Google I/O. But there's
a lot of changes that

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.000
went on in the WebView.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.320
Well, it wasn't even called
WebView at the time.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.012
It was called the browser tag.

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:51.050
There were a lot of changes that
kind of were happening.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.560
And we didn't have this great
situation of where we could go

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.410
off and show this application.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.375
But in the past couple of weeks,
the WebView API has

00:03:58.375 --> 00:03:59.960
settled down quite a bit.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.650
And I want to show you
this application.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.306
It's pretty cool.

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:05.050
PETE LEPAGE: So Paul, before you
go there, I want to just

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.830
touch on two little things that
you commented on that I

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.010
think are really important.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.460
One, you can start uploading
your apps to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.560
the Chrome Web Store.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.060
So if you're building a Chrome
App today, you can upload it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.110
to the Chrome Web Store.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.209
But there are a couple of
restrictions on that, right?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.150
PAUL KINLAN: You can't upload
experimental APIs just yet,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.440
because-- well, you've
never been able to.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.870
But you can't do that.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.070
Identity doesn't work properly
and WebView doesn't work.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.840
But they'll come out of
experimental soon.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.400
And you'll be happy, and you'll
be able to upload.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.240
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.810
And then the other key thing is
that if I go search for one

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.480
of the apps that you've
uploaded, Paul--

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.170
actually, where--

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.570
Paul, are you on this
side of me or are--

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.640
you're on one side of me.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.420
So here--

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.230
Paul-- that way.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.960
If you upload it, users
can't find it.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.510
They have to actually
go and know the URL.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.440
And it's like Chrome Web
Store dot something,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.510
dot something, dot--

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.470
really big--

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.870
hang on.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.040
Let me make sure
I'm on screen--

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.980
really big long URL, slash
something, slash something.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.040
So the best thing to do
if you want to share

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.510
these with your friends--

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.030
upload them, use a link
shortener, and give the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.230
shortened link to
your friends.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.290
So that way they can easily
go in and grab it.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.150
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.860
That's it.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.045
Once we launch this fully,
you'll be able to search them,

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.470
and they'll be aggregated
properly inside the Web Store.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.990
But right now, it's still
experimental.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.010
We're still learning about how
to you, as developer, want to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.080
interact with the Web Store,
and how users will want to

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.930
download the applications as
well, which I think we can

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.330
show more stuff in a later
episode [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.070
PETE LEPAGE: The only other
thing I want to point out for

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.130
folks who are watching today--

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.020
there are still a couple of bugs
around what's required

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.720
and what's not.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.740
So it may say something's not
required when it actually is.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.630
I think that's the way
most of the bugs are.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.100
It'll tell you, oh,
it's not required.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.020
You go to hit Publish, and
it comes back and says

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.420
[BUZZER SOUND], you've got
to go put this in.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.360
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, the flow is
not that great at the moment.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.000
It will get better.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.120
PETE LEPAGE: And we're
working on that.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.715
So please make sure you tell us
about those kinds of things

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.870
if you do find them.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.710
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.750
So should I show you
this application?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.040
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.130
Let's have a look.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.230
PAUL KINLAN: So this
is really cool.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.530
I really like this application,
because you can

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.520
basically query Google News.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.332
All this data's coming from
Google News, the RSS feed and

00:06:18.332 --> 00:06:19.550
Atom feeds.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.770
It's completely unofficial.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.420
It's like an application
that you would

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.500
build as a normal developer.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.970
But it's really cool because--

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.460
let's have a look at something
that's not-- shouldn't

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.865
[INAUDIBLE] the dark ages.

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.330
You can open up an article.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.860
Then this opens up
the WebView.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.700
And when the WebView
works, which--

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.550
something has happened.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.080
It's not quite working
just yet.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.120
PETE LEPAGE: Uh oh.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.250
Damn it.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so what would
happen normally is that

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.360
the actual content would come
into this application here and

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.270
be displayed.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.120
And the really nice thing is if
you look on the left-hand

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.640
side, you'll see like a picture
of Nelson Mandela.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.210
It's kind of like slightly
grayed out and blurred.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.130
There we are.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.100
It's loaded up.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.700
It's pretty cool.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.760
I think it's probably our
network connection's a little

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.768
bit crazy at the moment.

00:06:56.768 --> 00:06:57.480
You can press Escape.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.360
And you get out.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.120
There's articles.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.690
It's pretty cool.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.040
Scroll down.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.640
There's a whole lot of
really nice stuff.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.370
And I'm going to tell you
about this image.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.460
And these are all
remote images.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.140
And I'll show you-- well,
I say I'll show you.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.780
I'll tell you about a little
framework that we've built

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.330
which enables you to download
images that are hosted on the

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.470
web and store them in the
local HTML5 file cache.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.520
PETE LEPAGE: Because you can't
just say, image with a source

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.977
equals something else or source

00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:21.990
equals some remote server.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.130
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.160
Exactly right.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.530
So you can't do that.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.580
But we've enabled it so you can,
in a way, a little bit.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.860
And we've got a library that's
on GitHub as well.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.800
And then you can do things like
filter by top stories,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.590
and they work as well.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.910
I really feel my network's
a little bit slow on this

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.500
machine at the moment.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.010
Wow.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.140
There we are.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.940
Let's go back to that one.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.060
So the good thing is, even if
I have not got an internet

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.710
connection and something's going
crazy, all the articles

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.710
and information is cached so
that it's all basically stored

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.550
in index db.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.020
You query the categories for the
list of articles that you

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.460
want inside a particular one.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.620
And then you can do nice things
like, for instance,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.130
flip between different
countries, as well.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.130
So if you're Spanish and you
want Spanish news, you'll go

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.440
off and query the Spanish
Google News sites.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.860
So, yeah.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.180
It's pretty cool.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:09.660
It's pretty nice.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.630
We've had it around since
Google I/O, at least.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.850
But until WebView can start to
stabilize a little bit, I've

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.790
not pushed it too much.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.100
But the source code is on our
GitHub project as well.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.210
So you can go out and check
out how we've done

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.556
everything, as well.

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:23.250
So it's pretty cool.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:29.800
PETE LEPAGE: And that's on the
GitHub Google Chrome slash

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.240
Chrome App Samples place?

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.539
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.659
Exactly right.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.909
So let me--

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.100
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.070
PAUL KINLAN: I'll go
get it in a minute.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.150
PETE LEPAGE: We can--

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.070
actually, Louis, if we can put
that lower third up on, there

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.740
should be the samples one.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.560
So you should be able
to see it somewhere.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.810
It should be, like, right
down about there.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.520
So you can go see that.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.540
PAUL KINLAN: So can I show
you guys something as

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.320
well about the code?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.470
So this is the actual commit
that I did the other day,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.700
which if I go full screen,
should make it a little bit

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.930
easier to read.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.670
So this is the commit I did
the other day to the news

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.240
reader app.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.360
And it's

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.430
googlechrome/newsreaderapp on GitHub.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.930
So basically, it doesn't look
like I've done much.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.850
But essentially, I've removed
a whole lot of code that we

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.820
normally use to actually go and
get the remote image from

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.260
the web, which is normally
a bit XML HTTP request.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.710
We store it in the file system
using the file, the .js.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.390
And there's actually quite a
lot of code just to do a

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.580
relatively small process.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.590
So we've removed all this.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.120
And there was a couple
of places it was in.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.190
It was code that was duplicated
all over the place.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.820
And we replaced it-- if we
get to the right place--

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.050
with this thing called RAL.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.600
And basically it's a Resource
Asset Loader, which is a

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.630
project that we've written.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.890
It's also on our
GitHub project.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.670
I've enabled debug because I
want more information at the

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.390
back of it.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.890
I do this thing called QStart.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.210
And now what happens is,
whenever you add something to

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.730
the resource asset loader,
essentially what will happen

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.540
is it will go to say, well,
I need to go and

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.470
download this asset.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.820
It will bring it in, cache it in
the local HTML file system,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.450
and then you'll be able
to consistently

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.360
access it as well.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.020
So--

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.360
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, interesting.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.430
So--

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.340
PAUL KINLAN: Every
time you ac--

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.660
PETE LEPAGE: Does it--

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.340
PAUL KINLAN: Every time you
access that image, it will go

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.250
and get it from the
file system.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.230
It's got a whole lot of other
nice things about caching.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.200
So there's cache headers that
say cache is only--

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.510
yeah.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.370
So if it says cache is only for
24 hours, it'll cache it

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.170
for 24 hours.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.170
But it will still use it
if you're offline.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.800
The actual asset loader, as
well, is pretty cool.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.840
And one of my colleagues,
Paul Lewis, did

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.140
all the work on this.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.170
It's pretty cool, because
it detects when

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.170
you're online and offline.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.450
And if you have requests for
images, like in the queue--

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.680
say, 100 requests--

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.250
and maybe something [INAUDIBLE]
to actually get to

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.320
a service to get the image.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.850
And you're actually offline,
what it does is it puts it

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.180
into a background process where
basically, when you go

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.010
back online, it'll then restart
it up and then go

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.920
fetch the articles [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.535
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, that's
brilliant.

00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:56.790
PAUL KINLAN: --that you need.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.720
So it's kind of like--

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.160
PETE LEPAGE: This is the one--

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.550
sorry.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.640
You said it was written
by Paul Lewis.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:00.800
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.130
Paul Lewis and our team wrote
this about three months ago.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.490
We've only just published
it this week.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.390
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.220
That's super cool.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.270
I know for a lot of folks who
are building news reader apps,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.930
who are building apps that
consume a large amount of data

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.410
that sits locally on the user's
computers or sits--

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.910
that you want to be able to pull
down, this is a really

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.780
important thing.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:27.550
Because otherwise, it's great
to just pull down JSON data.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.710
That's all awesome.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.850
But if you want to pull images,
you want to pull

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:37.040
video, you want to pull any
binary data, you can

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.230
base 64 encode it.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.450
But that adds, what, I think
it's like 30%, if I remember

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.300
right, to the download size.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.880
Plus storage size, plus it's
just a pain in the butt to

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.310
encode and decode.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.770
This means it works.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:55.160
And with all those caching
features, that's pretty slick.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.640
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.935
It's pretty cool.

00:11:56.935 --> 00:12:00.190
The other thing, as well, that
he does, he's got this idea

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.060
for a manifest.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.390
And you can host the manifest
on a server.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.620
And what will happen is if you
request that manifest, it will

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.140
go and get the manifest, get the
list of images and assets

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.420
that you need.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.860
And then you can use it so you
can proactively cache things

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.910
in a WebWork or in
the background.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.870
Or use an alarm to wake your
application up at 7:00 in the

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.680
morning, go get the manifest,
and then download all of the

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.690
stuff ready for it to be
consumed later on.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.880
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, perfect.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.640
PAUL KINLAN: There's actually a
whole lot more stuff in this

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.450
than we've got, actually, even
the time just tell you now.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.680
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we should
definitely cover this

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.215
come the new year.

00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:35.730
This is really powerful.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.880
PAUL KINLAN: We only launched it
last week, and we're still

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.660
doing a whole lot of stuff.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.810
There's a couple of bugs, a
couple of issues that we want

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.880
to try and solve.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.110
So let me just show you the
next two pieces of code.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.090
We have this one here,
which is data source,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.780
which is on the image.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.262
This is just basically a
data attribute where

00:12:50.262 --> 00:12:52.000
we encode the source.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.570
And then what happens
is the framework--

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.500
It doesn't do it just yet.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.630
But when it detects an image
inside the page that's got a

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.980
data source attribute, the idea
is it'll be able to say,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.540
you know what, I need to go
and queue that to go and

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.010
request it.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.940
It doesn't do that quite now.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.280
You have to programmatically
go and request the image.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.660
But it's only two or three
lines of code.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.490
It's not too much.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.780
But we want to get it so that
you can just drop an image

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.500
into the page, and all the
sudden, it starts to work.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.000
The really cool thing about this
as well, you can specify

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.190
placeholder images.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.900
So you might have--

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.090
say you were the "New York
Times" or someone like that.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.530
You might want to put your logo
inside a special image,

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.180
which is always displayed
until the actual

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.980
image asset comes in.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.720
So there's a couple of things
you can do around that.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.855
But if we look here, these,
like, four or five lines of

00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:42.360
code here, this is literally
all I need to actually make

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.230
the requests to the
remote service.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.640
So I basically detect
an image in the DOM.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.460
I say, go and get me a remote
image and add it to the queue.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.040
And autoStart, so it will
automatically get the image.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.970
And then the system will just
work out what to do, because I

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.360
passed an element object into
the remote image object.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.720
It will then basically go and
say, you know, once I've got

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.030
the image, I'll go and attach it
to the actual image itself

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.715
so it's displayed.

00:14:04.715 --> 00:14:06.795
If it's only cached in the file
system, it will just go

00:14:06.795 --> 00:14:08.720
and display that cached
version as well.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.650
So it's pretty cool.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.690
And we're going to try and get
it so you don't even have to

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.700
have these two lines of code.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.696
But if you really want to kind
of manage that yourself in

00:14:14.696 --> 00:14:17.370
your own process, then that
should be completely possible

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.190
for you to do as well.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:18.930
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.430
PAUL KINLAN: And that's
actually all the code.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.790
Most of the actual change in
the project was actually me

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.533
removing code.

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:26.630
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.190
So this saved a good chunk of
code then and made things

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.800
easier for you to use.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.560
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.060
And the actual app itself
right now uses it.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.380
So the Chrome News App
is using this.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.510
There is a bug here where if we
request this image twice,

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.330
it goes blank.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.930
So we can see a couple of the
images are white out.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.340
But we can fix that.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.155
That should be pretty cool.

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:48.300
But I encourage everyone to
go and check it out and

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:48.880
see what it's like.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.050
So it's pretty cool.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.590
PETE LEPAGE: I may actually
have to go

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.120
play with this myself.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.380
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.790
I added this in last week.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.470
So I thought it would
be good to show

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.890
you guys what's happening.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.660
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, definitely.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.410
PAUL KINLAN: Do you want to
go onto my next app, or--

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.810
PETE LEPAGE: Actually,
Louis, can we get the

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.290
questions link put up?

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.100
And I want to show one of the
apps that I did for some of

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.080
the GDL stuff.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.610
And then we'll pop
back over to you.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.780
So one of the things that with
all of these GDL sessions that

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.560
we have, is you'll notice
there's those lower thirds

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.960
that get created and put
on all the bottoms.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.780
And they're pretty
much consistent.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.170
They say the show name and the
link to the particular thing.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.560
And oh, look, there's
my name down there.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.690
Well in doing those kinds of
things, every time we did

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.130
that, we always has open up,
like, Photoshop, or you had to

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.080
open up some kind of
graphic editor.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.760
You had to go in, you'd make
a change, save that one.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.390
Make the change, save
the next one.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.040
Make the change, save
the next one.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.740
And it really got to be
a pain to go and do.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.140
So one of the things that I
wanted to do is try and make

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.060
that simpler for me and simpler
for all of the people

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.530
who are doing these
GDL things.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.220
I was like, well how
do I do that

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.500
using images and graphics?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.620
And as I was thinking
about it.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.870
I was like, well, I guess what I
could do is I could create a

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.130
bunch of divs and
do it that way.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.570
So that was one option.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.920
But then the other thing, I was
like, well, I've got this

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.560
stuff as transparent
PNGs to begin with.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.450
So I could use a canvas, go
place everything on, apply the

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:29.250
text that I want just using the
draw text in canvas, and

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.880
then save it as a PNG.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.520
So I went and wrote this app.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.580
So I'll bring my app up.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.560
And Louis, if we can bring
my app up on screen.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.830
You'll see that--

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.690
let me get rid of this so that
we don't have this guy up.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.400
And I guess we don't need my end
of the world app anymore.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.760
So we've got this GDL lower
third generator.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.960
So basically, what it lets me
do is, I can go and type in

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.090
name of the show I want.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.250
So hey, we're Chrome Apps.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.320
And I can put in my name,
so Pete LePage.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.170
If I want to center something,
I can put a

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:01.960
bunch of other names.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.920
So on this one I want Pete and
I want Paul, so I separate

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.220
them with semicolons.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.050
I can put in all of the links
to our moderator--

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.270
everything.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.010
I can choose what different
styles I want.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.000
And then what I did was,
it just uses--

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.710
I created a generator call that
goes in, generates each

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.180
individual PNG.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.870
And then it saves those PNGs
as transparent PNGs.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:36.820
And then I used really cool
zip JavaScript library, so

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.040
that when I go and hit Generate
here, it gives me

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.560
that ability to download.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.970
So I'll save it here
on my desktop.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.960
And here in a sec--

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.520
OK, well, it won't save it
to my desktop this time.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.270
Let's try that once more.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.470
Save, desktop, there we go.

00:17:58.529 --> 00:17:59.920
Is it hiding on my desktop
somewhere?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.100
All right.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.920
Here, I'll do it this way.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.610
Desktop.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.510
There it is.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.580
So sure enough, there's
the ZIP file.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.150
If I open that up, there's
all my downloads files.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:16.730
And now, I've suddenly got all
of my lower thirds generated

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.560
so that I don't have to go and
recreate every one every

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.350
single time.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.080
It's a quick, easy way for me
to be able to do these.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.310
So if you're looking at ways to
create graphics or create

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.870
images, this is another tool
where if you're just having to

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.700
consistently redo things over
and over again, this was a

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.850
really easy way to be
able to do this.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.210
I was talking to Louis
yesterday.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.990
I was showing him the app.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.340
He was like, that's awesome.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.610
But I need one that's just
a nice simple one--

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.430
and I didn't tell it to create
this, but like where it just

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.230
has the lower third
without any names.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.260
So I went in, added a
quick one of those.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.570
And now we have an easy way
that we can generate those

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.650
lower thirds without having
to do anything crazy.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.700
So Paul, I'll pass it
back over to you.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.490
And you can show you next one.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.970
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, cool.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.710
So this one is from--

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.520
well, let me get his
name, actually.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.730
Anyway, I'll get
it in a minute.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.920
But there's a third-party
developer, who has actually

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.810
done some really cool stuff.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.810
He's tried to make his
own application.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:13.960
And he's uploaded
it to the store.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.380
It's called Clean CSS.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.720
I think the best thing to
do is we'll try and get

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.620
the link later on.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:19.820
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.080
We can add the links.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.900
We'll do a post after today's
show, as well as I'll try and

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.230
add the comments to the YouTube
video, if you want to

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.580
check those out.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.940
PAUL KINLAN: It's pretty nice.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.020
You do this thing, and you
put this in, and--

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.040
MALE SPEAKER: Paul, before you
continue, is it easier that

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.680
you could bump that font up?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.540
I know it's going to be
hard for our viewers

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.470
to check that out.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.090
PAUL KINLAN: So this is actually
a problem we've got

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.540
inside-- generally inside Chrome
Apps, is that it's

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.650
actually hard to
bump the font.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.850
So the normal things that
we have don't work.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.520
PETE LEPAGE: That's a
really great point.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.840
I believe there's a
bug filed on that.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.090
If there's not a bug filed,
please go file one--

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.720
new.crbug.com--

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.790
and let us know so that
we can get it.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.372
And if it's not filed-- or if
it is filed, just make sure

00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:12.430
you go star it so that the
developers know that this is a

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.840
big thing we want fixed.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.000
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.370
But the general idea behind
this is that it takes some

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.460
relatively large CSS files and
then [INAUDIBLE] down into

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.050
something that's
a lot smaller.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.320
It's got some very
nice things.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.420
You've got Copy to Clipboard.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.640
And I don't know whether you'll
be able to see this

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.730
properly, but press
Copy to Clipboard.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.390
Makes everything smaller, blurs
it out, and then sends

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.130
it to the clipboard, which
if we then put it back

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.010
in, there we go.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.500
There, it's been minified in.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.450
So it's pretty cool, right?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.810
It's like taking some of your
[INAUDIBLE] data, minified it,

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.790
copied it to the clipboard.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.070
And these things you can't quite
do in the normal web

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.650
applications.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.260
That's pretty nice.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.760
I'll give you the guy's name
who actually wrote this,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.670
because I've actually
forgotten right now.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.210
PETE LEPAGE: Sorry about that.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.140
PAUL KINLAN: But I want to show
you a couple of other

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.910
applications as well, because
they're pretty cool.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.420
We talk about this one quite
a lot, but I use

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.010
this all the time.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:08.980
This is the IRC app
that we've got.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.150
That's also in the store.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.480
If you actually type
in [? "CIRC ?]

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.230
Chrome" to Google, you'll be to
find it, because it's been

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.910
indexed because people
have linked to it.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.580
But the source is available
on GitHub as well,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.040
and you can do it.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.260
And this is using normal
native sockets.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.260
So Does Liverpool is a place
that I work at in Liverpool.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.410
So let me just say "hello,
everyone." Oh wow, caps lock.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.510
"Hello, everyone." They
might reply with

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.620
something nice or not nice.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.050
I don't quite know.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.680
PETE LEPAGE: That's the
wonderful thing

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.150
of live to air broadcast.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.190
All right.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.930
Hopefully they'll be nice.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.870
PAUL KINLAN: But it's
pretty cool.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:49.197
If we go to the actual code, if
we get rid of this little

00:21:49.197 --> 00:21:52.960
bit to the side, it's
normal HTML.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.720
The source, as well--
you probably

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.700
can't see it very well.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.240
But this is just [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.590
that they chrome.socket.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.690
Let's have a look.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.940
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.540
That's all there is.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.300
It's pretty crazy.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.230
They've written the API.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.390
They just used a normal
socket interface.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.880
It's no more than just normal
basic JavaScript.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.800
It's pretty nice.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.980
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.570
PAUL KINLAN: So I have
another app.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.680
Should we show another app?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.710
PETE LEPAGE: So let's
show one more app.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.380
And then we have a couple
questions in our queue.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.620
So we'll take those questions.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.530
And we'll wrap up for the
day and go from there.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.730
PAUL KINLAN: So it's going
to be pretty cool.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.770
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.070
I like cool.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:39.460
PAUL KINLAN: So this is a
pretend service that I wrote.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.840
It's a Google shortener.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.530
So basically this was actually
for something that you were

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.790
doing with the links.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.540
You were manually going through
and shortening the

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.560
links and everything.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.170
It's that I wanted to integrate
with the actual--

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.100
what's it called?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.420
The API?

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.570
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, that thing,
that API thing, right.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.840
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I
wanted to integrate

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.190
with the API for Google.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.850
And I think last week, we talked
about the Identity API.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.130
And the Identity API, at the
time, was only third-party

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.430
services and not Google-based
services.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.330
And that's because we hadn't
exposed the actual admin

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.970
interface view inside
the API console.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.470
A-ha.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.860
Evening, Liverpool.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.130
Liverpool, at least.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.000
So anyway, we hadn't
exposed that.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.080
It's really--

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.510
brand new announcement, first to
hear it if you're watching

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.290
this right now, is that you
can actually go to your

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.530
Developer Console and choose or
create a brand new client

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.110
ID for all the Google
Services.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.120
So Google authentications should
work, [? as far as I ?]

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.616
know.

00:23:39.616 --> 00:23:40.520
I have yet to try it.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.330
Because even though this is a
Google service, I actually

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.700
just use normal third-party
authentication flow.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.750
So let me just prove
that this works.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.750
PETE LEPAGE: I just want to
say that again, because I

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.980
think that's a really cool
fact and feature.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.520
You just used the normal
third-party authentication

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.520
features to access Google
APIs, because the Google

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.880
authentication stuff wasn't
quite there and still may be a

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.520
little not quite ready
for prime time.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.380
But the third-party
auth stuff is.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.600
That's pretty sick.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.800
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.350
It's pretty cool.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.170
So I'll shortened the URL.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.730
And it should appear.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:17.150
There it is at the bottom.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.590
That's the short URL
we just created.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.270
And yeah, there's a whole
load more stuff.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.510
I only made this in
a couple hours.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.330
But a lot of it was me just
trying to make sure the Google

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.160
APIs were working with
authentication and the

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.320
Identity API.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.360
And just because it's built off
the back of OAuth 2, it

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.960
means it pretty much
works straightaway.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.300
I know that we do some extra
things with refresh tokens and

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.040
some other stuff.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.390
But I've just chosen to ignore
all that, because actually,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.860
what's happening behind the
scenes here is that even

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.560
though the authentication
didn't work, it tries to

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.720
authenticate every
single request.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.050
So I'm not storing
an access token.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.160
I'm getting a brand new
one every single time.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.980
So should we have a quick look
if I can get it up properly?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.580
PETE LEPAGE: I've got a couple
questions up on our moderator.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.390
So why don't I start with
those while you pull

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.250
some of them up.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.400
PAUL KINLAN: I'll get the
console up so I can show you.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.640
Can I just show you how
you actually go

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.060
about creating one?

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.120
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.450
PAUL KINLAN: You use the
normal Google APIs--

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.530
code.google.com/apis/console--

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:15.290
to create your project.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.710
And then you do something quite
simple, where if you go

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.880
to API Access, you create
an OAuth 2 client ID.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.652
Give it a name-- so
test x, maybe.

00:25:25.652 --> 00:25:27.170
That's a good name.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.820
And you normally have a list of
options-- web application,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.490
service account, and installed
application.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.500
Well, it turns out Chrome
applications are actually

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.600
installed applications and not
pure web applications that

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600
live on the web.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.650
So you press the installed
application, you select Chrome

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.470
Application.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.830
And you put your extension
ID in.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.110
So if you had your
extension ID--

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.360
I'm going to say it's that.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360
Hopefully this will work.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.120
It's just a random one.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.860
PETE LEPAGE: I always
love random.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.220
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.596
It didn't work.

00:25:53.596 --> 00:25:55.510
But you basically put in
your own extension ID.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.030
Let's do that one for now.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.695
So this should work.

00:25:59.695 --> 00:26:01.430
Create client ID.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.080
And then we've got the client
ID and application

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.370
secret that we need.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.810
And that's all you have
to do to start

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.030
accessing Google Services.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.350
And you can select the
list of services

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.520
that you want to access.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.290
I would normally select
Google Link Shortener.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:15.440
And I would be able to access it
straight away, and I'd use

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.280
the Google authentication.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.780
Now, I just want to say, the
interesting thing about the

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.600
Google authentication, why
it's different than third

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.820
party, is that when the user
installs the application, we

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.530
can prompt them to say, this
application wants to access

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.420
your Google Docs or your Google
Drive, and those types

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.850
of things, which we can't do
because we don't know how

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.080
every other third-party
API works.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.050
So through Google Services,
you can get that installed

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.920
properly, which is important,
which is why you need that

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.970
special ID.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.060
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:44.370
All right.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.880
Well, let's pop over
to our questions.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.070
We've got about three or four
minutes left before we need to

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.720
wrap up for today.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.550
So our first question about from
Adam in San Francisco.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.850
He wants to know, should
chrome.runtime.lastError be

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.150
checked on every call that
uses a call back?

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.070
How should Chrome runtime
last error be used?

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:08.460
I'm working on a library that
interfaces with a Chrome app

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.185
via Dart, and most of this
is wrapped in futures.

00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:14.306
Paul, what's your
take on this?

00:27:14.306 --> 00:27:14.710
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.120
You have to check last error.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.100
I mean, the last error is pretty
much always populated

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.900
from the last error
that happened.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.960
So if one of your API methods
failed when you called it,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.610
then you should check
last error.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.440
We don't have the onSuccess
and onFailure that you'd

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.180
expect from, say, a normal
purely web application.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.800
We don't have futures, either.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.520
That's not to say that we
couldn't wrap it up and have a

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.770
JavaScript API which makes it a
little bit easier, that kind

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.380
of knows when the last error did
occur and not to kind of

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.090
overwrite it.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.520
Because basically, the
last error stays

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.710
populated all the time.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.670
So if you make a request to
a Chrome-specific API.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.250
It could be three requests
down, later on, where you

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.120
actually go and check
last error.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.360
And oh, it's errored.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.170
Well, has it errored?

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.040
Was it that API?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.580
You don't quite know.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.580
So you do have to check.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.270
But it might be better if we
kind of come up with a better

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.750
interface in the library.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.420
And maybe we kind of test that
with the JavaScript shim to

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.030
start off with.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.530
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.750
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.020
PAUL KINLAN: Because honestly,
it's a little bit awkward

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.970
trying to interface with
index.db and then integrate

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.340
with the media gallery API.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.810
And these are two things which
are different APIs,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:23.110
essentially.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.965
And they've got different
semantics for

00:28:24.965 --> 00:28:26.650
errors and call backs.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.830
So we might have to write a
little JavaScript shim to make

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.000
that a little bit easier.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.930
But right now, you just
have to check.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.920
The simplest thing is
you have to check.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.720
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.060
So James from Ontario--

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.880
my hometown, or, I guess,
my home province--

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.910
wants to know, do Chrome apps
run agnostic to the operating

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.596
system, or are there
cross-platform issues that he

00:28:46.596 --> 00:28:47.700
needs to keep in mind?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.530
Should I bother testing on
Windows and Linux if he's

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.900
developing on Mac?

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.780
Can I safely assume that
my app will be

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.570
fabulous across the board?

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.840
And that's a really
great question.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.910
I would say in the 99% case,
your app is going to be

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.980
fabulous across the board.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.920
There's a couple places where I
think you do want to spend a

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.830
little bit of time testing.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.780
And that's going to
be things like

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.080
serial, USB, and Bluetooth.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.710
Those are the three that just
come to mind for me that I

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.550
just want to do a little bit of
extra testing, just because

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.150
the stacks in those particular
places are

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.790
a little bit different.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.040
Paul, are you--

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.400
go ahead.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.380
PAUL KINLAN: Sorry.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.330
No, I was going to say
the same thing.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.390
I agree with you completely
there, is that the actual

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.600
render and the basic things
that you'd expect to work

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.210
should just work.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:39.940
PETE LEPAGE: You're
running Chrome.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.820
PAUL KINLAN: You
should never--

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.980
yeah, you're running Chrome.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.275
That's never an excuse
not to test.

00:29:45.275 --> 00:29:47.420
But the assumption should be
that it's going to be a lot

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.730
easier and a lot easier to
kind of test across them.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.370
And like you said, the
differences are

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.650
the hardware APIs.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.685
So for instance, Bluetooth
might not work on Windows

00:29:56.685 --> 00:29:58.720
because we don't have access
to the stack, whereas we've

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.990
got better access to the
stack on Chrome OS.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.850
I know we've seen some bugs on
actual Chromium Apps, made a

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.820
list as well, where the serial
port didn't work because we

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.910
haven't got the regular
expression right to filter out

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.500
the actual com ports
for serial ports.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.160
We haven't got that right
for Windows, so it

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.840
didn't work at all.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.540
So those are the type
of things that

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.974
you'd have to check.

00:30:18.974 --> 00:30:19.930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.040
But the point will be, we want
to get it as close as possible

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.840
so that you don't have
to worry about that.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.850
So we have a little
bit of work to do.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.690
But we think you guys
should test as well.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.060
So I'll go for a question
from Belgium next.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.460
Linux, in the base plug-in for
playing games or video on

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.420
Facebook, is sometimes
it works--

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.890
you know, I'm actually going to
come back to the question.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.050
Because I'm not quite sure I
understand your question.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.400
PAUL KINLAN: I think there's
a plug-in that

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.540
doesn't work on Linux.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.610
PAUL KINLAN: The only think
I can say is, file a bug.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.020
He's using Chrome for
Linux 11 or 12?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.190
We're at 25.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.570
So file a bug.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.875
I'm not exactly sure whether it
will get fixed, because I

00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:05.590
don't believe we backport that
far to these places.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.090
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.610
We might go back a couple--

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.870
PAUL KINLAN: That's the whole
point of the auto update

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.720
system is that we love to
maintain [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.090
versions, at least.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.670
Should we get on to the
Airborne question?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.010
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, sure.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.670
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.450
So does the Identity API support
all the visions of

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.390
OAuth 1.0, 1.0a?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.810
It's a really good question.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.620
So the thing is that
the Google API

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.110
endpoint uses OAuth 2.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.540
And we've coded it to work
with just OAuth 2.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.480
The third-party format, or the
third-party authentication

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.280
launcher, essentially-
it's agnostic.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.070
So we don't actually care, in
theory, about the type of

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.000
authentication you're using.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.100
You could use some weird
authentication system which

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.760
returns a session ID in the
query parameter, which you can

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.490
then take out for your admin
panel to push into your app,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.310
and a whole load
of other stuff.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.770
You can do those type
of things as well.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.450
And the idea behind that was if
you have OAuth 1 and OAuth

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.710
1a applications is that
in theory, you should

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.550
be able to do it.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.366
I haven't tested it, because I
don't like OAuth 1, and I've

00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:13.330
wanted to stay away from
it [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.020
PETE LEPAGE: I think we might
have one person who likes it.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.840
And his or her name
would be Airborne.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.046
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:32:21.046 --> 00:32:24.580
But the interesting thing is
that normally what happens is

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:30.220
that the authentication APIs in
most third-party services,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.750
they can't redirect to anything
that's not HTTP and

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.460
HTTPS URLs.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.150
So every single app at the
moment has a Chrome hype and

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.430
extension scheme in the actual
URL, which you won't be able

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.800
to redirect to.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.120
And Instagram kind of
worked last week.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.070
But that was kind of a fortunate
coincidence.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.140
If you look at the Facebook--
sorry, if

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.560
you look at the friend--

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.620
Foursquare application--

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.325
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:54.325 --> 00:32:56.960
If you look at the Foursquare
application that we've got on

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.110
our sample repository as well,
that uses OAuth 2, but it's

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.830
using this redirect to a special
domain that we own.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.420
So basically what is, I think
it's your extension ID dot

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.150
Chromium app dot org.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.520
And that's going to redirect the
URL, and you can send the

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.970
third-party services that use
OAuth 1 or OAuth 1a back

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.370
towards inside your
application.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.300
PETE LEPAGE: And we'll
redirect it for you

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:20.850
automatically.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.400
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.680
We'll do the redirect
from there.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.750
It might not work very well.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.590
I would test it.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.230
And if you have any feedback
about these

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.120
things, let me know.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.690
I will kind of get it working.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.840
But the majority of people
are moving to OAuth 2.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.530
And OAuth 2 works very well.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.300
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.140
Well, Paul, I think that's all
the time we have for today.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.560
Thanks for joining
me from London.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.780
I hope you have a really
great holiday.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.770
PAUL KINLAN: Sorry, can
I just interrupt?

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:50.760
James Doyle, he did
the CSS Cleaner.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.533
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:33:51.533 --> 00:33:54.400
James Doyle from Ontario.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.430
That was his question.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.840
All right.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.820
Well, James, thank you.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.480
So I want to thank everybody
for joining us this week.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.210
We're going to be back
in the new year.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.330
We'll probably start back--

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.969
I want to say it'll be the
second week of January with

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.330
our Chrome Apps Office Hours.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.780
We've got some really exciting
stuff planned for 2013--

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.500
things like push messaging,
notifications.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.030
We've got great new
authentication stuff.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.960
We have a ton of stuff that
we're really excited about

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.480
that we think you're going to
be really excited about.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.190
So thanks for joining us.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.679
Paul, thank you.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:31.510
PAUL KINLAN: Thank
you, very much.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.320
PETE LEPAGE: And I can't
wait to see you

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.230
all in the new year.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.679
Thank you very much.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.929
PAUL KINLAN: Bye bye.
