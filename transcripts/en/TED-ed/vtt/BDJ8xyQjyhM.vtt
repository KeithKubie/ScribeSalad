00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:10.201
Your dog loves to curl up on the couch,
but so do you,

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.703
so you shoo him off
and settle in for a cozy evening.

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:15.918
After all, you're the human around here.

00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:19.481
You're an intelligent being,
not a simple creature of instinct.

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:22.591
You can plan and dream, and oh-

00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:25.814
Did your dog just outsmart you
and feel happy about it?

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:28.190
Or was he just following his instincts?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.858
Is there even a difference?

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:31.687
What is he thinking?

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:34.452
Well, it depends on 
what we mean by "thinking"

00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:37.603
and the criteria we use to evaluate it.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:42.165
Aristotle and Descartes both use 
the criteria of instinct and intelligence

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.889
to divide animals from humans.

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:47.714
Aristotle believed 
that humans possess reason,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:53.220
while animals could only follow brute
instincts for survival and reproduction.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.294
Almost 2000 years later,

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:59.565
Descartes suggested 
a more extreme version of that idea,

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:03.714
arguing that animals following instincts
were indistinguishable

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:09.098
from robots responding mechanically 
to stimuli in their environments.

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:13.058
But the consensus against animal 
intelligence began to unravel

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:15.852
with Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:20.827
Darwin hypothesized that intelligence
could evolve from simpler instincts.

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:25.875
He had observed earthworms making choices
about how to drag oddly shaped leaves

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.441
into their boroughs,

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:32.580
and was struck that a human might employ
similar means to solve a similar problem.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.139
And if, as he thought, humans 
are descended from simpler creatures,

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.869
then perhaps our minds lie
at the far end of a continuum,

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.647
differing from theirs in degree,
but not in kind.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:50.632
Recent experiments showing that many
species can solve complex problems

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:53.907
confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis.

00:01:53.907 --> 00:01:57.371
Elephants use objects to reach
inaccessible places.

00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:59.497
Crows make their own tools,

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:02.835
and can use water displacement 
to get a reward.

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:06.713
Octopuses can open jars 
after watching others do so,

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:10.022
and can even remember 
the process months later.

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:13.438
Such tasks involve considering 
aspects of a problem

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:18.822
separately from the immediate situation,
and retaining the strategy for later use.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:22.390
Still, while animals 
can solve complex problems,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.922
how do we know what, or even that, 
they are thinking?

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:29.649
Behaviorists, such as Pavlov
and Thorndike, argue

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.828
that animals that appear to think

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:35.528
are usually only responding 
to reward or punishment.

00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.254
This was the case with Clever Hans,

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:43.324
a horse with the amazing ability
to tap out answers to math problems.

00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:46.953
But it turns out Hans 
wasn't especially good at math,

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:51.991
but at reading his unwitting 
trainer's subtle nonverbal cues

00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:54.567
for when to stop tapping.

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.838
So Hans couldn't count,
but does that mean he wasn't thinking?

00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:02.109
After all, he could interpret 
nuanced social messages,

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.389
a quality he shared with many other
non-human animals.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.690
Elephants recognize each other
after years apart,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.674
and even seem to mourn their dead.

00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:15.759
Bees communicate 
using a special waggle dance

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:20.575
to indicate the location and quality 
of a food source to other bees.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:24.707
Chimpanzees engage 
in complex deception schemes,

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:29.689
suggesting not only do they think,
but they understand that others do, too.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.398
And then there is Alex the Grey Parrot,

00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:33.902
who could use human language

00:03:33.902 --> 00:03:37.491
to distinguish the colors 
and shapes of absent objects,

00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:42.672
and even understand abstract concepts,
like bigger and smaller.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:44.660
That sounds a lot like intelligence,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.649
and not just the work 
of mindless machines.

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:52.338
But while a non-human animal can solve
problems and even communicate,

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:56.252
for humans, thinking 
also involves consciousness,

00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:01.105
the ability to reflect on our actions,
not simply to perform them.

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:06.370
So far, none of our studies tell us
if having the intelligence to outsmart us

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.959
means that our dog 
can also feel good about doing so.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.596
What we really want to know is
what is it like to be a dog,

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:16.006
or an octopus,

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.519
or a crow?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.602
Philosophers of mind call this
The Hard Problem,

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:24.351
because while you and I can report
what it feels like to be a human,

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:26.316
nobody speaks horse.

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:28.496
Even a talking parrot, like Alex,

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:32.989
couldn't tell us how he feels 
about the colors he could name.

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:35.493
And what if consciousness 
comes in different forms?

00:04:35.493 --> 00:04:38.769
Would we even recognize 
the consciousness of bees?

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:43.530
For that matter, how can we know for sure
that other people have consciouness?

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.580
Perhaps they're just 
well-functioning zombies.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.231
Regardless, animal minds continue to test
the limits of our understanding

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:56.524
and how we frame them may reveal more
about our minds than theirs.
