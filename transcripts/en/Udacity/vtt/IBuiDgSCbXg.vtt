00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is no. I mean, of course you can do it, but it'll give you really bad data.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The reason is the data is paired.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These two guesses correspond to each other.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The same person guessed 78 over here and 80 over here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The same is true with the next two guesses.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If we just remove the lowest quartiles in the first list and the second list,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we'll remove different elements, and the surviving elements don't fit together,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we can't really run regression anymore.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have to keep that correspondence alive.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I removed all the data points where either of the two components

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
would guess a value under 50.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If it said 0 or 1 over here, I'd remove the entire data point in both lists.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The same is true for weights over 120.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I figure I really don't look like a 200 kg guy or like a 1,000 kg person.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I figured 120 is fine, but beyond 120 is really not a reasonable guess.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The reason why I use these brackets is I really have to remove data pairs together.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That was the easiest way for me to remove outliers.

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's look at the data again.
