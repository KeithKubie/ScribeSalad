[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.270
You might have seen the other
film, and you know that I'm

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.020
interested in tether dynamics.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.040
And part of that is flying kites
and doing experiments.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160
But in those experiments, I need
to know where the tether

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.390
is, and what it's
doing over time.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.900
And it's easy to see the
tether from here.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.310
It's nice and black and
fairly visible.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.930
But from way far away, so that
we can see the entire tether,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.630
it gets a bit difficult to see
what this line is doing.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.390
So we're going to need to do
something about that in terms

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.481
of image processing.

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:55.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.175
I think we could probably
get the whole kite.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.640
So we're going to set up the
cameras in two directions,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.890
because we want to record the
dynamics of what the kite

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.030
string is actually doing.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.110
And from the pictures, we're
going to try to find the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.690
tether in the sky.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.846
So it's quite cloudy, so it
will be quite difficult.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:27.800
But hopefully, with some clever
algorithms and image

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.030
processing, we can find out
where the tether is and what

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.200
it's doing over time.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
So on the video camera, you
might not actually be able to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.860
see the line, because it's
lower resolution.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.080
But hopefully on the skills,
we'll be able to work out sort

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.010
of where the line is just based
on averaging different

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.667
directions over time.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:02:05.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.280
I'm going to connect this
camera up with the other

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.310
camera with this wire.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.830
And they're both connected
to a trigger.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.220
And with the trigger, they'll
both shoot at the same time.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.170
So we'll get one picture
every second.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.530
And from that, hopefully, we
can work out some dynamics.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.210
There's a limit to the frequency
you can work out

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.480
with one picture per second, but
at this point, we're going

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.730
to give it a try.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.790
OK, so I can't take credit for
a lot of the hard work that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.920
went into this project.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.610
There's a master's student,
Richard Shaw, and he did a lot

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.910
of work for his master's
figuring out how you could

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.190
find a tether on a background of
clouds, or trees, or all of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.860
those kind of things.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.890
And he came up with a really
clever method, in terms of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.960
image processing, to
find this tether.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.280
And he runs around in
the rain a lot.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.060
It is really starting to rain.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.680
Like everything, you can't
really control the weather.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.795
So we're going to try to get
some really quick shots in

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:00.400
here, and then pack
everything up.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.780
So the kite's flying.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
Hopefully, we don't have any
lightning or thunder.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.910
Looks like the kite's
in the image.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.510
Starting to rain a lot.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180
Is it ready, is it
set up, Richard?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.030
Are we good to go?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.095
Richard, are we ready?

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.345
Yeah, we're ready.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.010
I can hear them in
the distance.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.930
So you can hear the camera
going about every second.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.890
Click, click, click.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.230
And it's nice and wet.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.360
OK, so I think that's enough
standing around in the rain.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.870
Hopefully we have
some good shots.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.570
We can go analyse them on the
laptop and see if we got

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.130
anything useful, and can see
where this tether is on this

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.820
very cloudy, rainy sky.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.750
Different problem.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.330
Why that and not that?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.760
So maybe we should increase
this, because then it'll, even

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.010
if it diverges incorrectly,
the angle that we'll look

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.156
within might find it again.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.480
No, that doesn't work.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.610
Try cropping the kite out.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.965
I think it's where it goes wrong
here, straightaway, and

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.084
then it just keeps going on.

00:04:08.084 --> 00:04:09.557
Yeah, that's probably true.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.630
We've come inside and taken
refuge from the rain.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.370
We're a little bit wet, but in
true Cambridge fashion, it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.720
now sunny outside.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.480
We've uploaded some of the
photos, and we're doing a

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.400
little bit of analysis.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.510
We're playing around with
different parameters to see if

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.160
we can, indeed, find the tether
in this image that

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.350
really just looks like
a bunch of clouds.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.210
So this is the original image.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.650
And here we have what we've
been able to find.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.740
So we've been able to find
the bottom of the tether.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.410
You can see the tether is
actually right there, but it

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.400
starts to diverge a little bit
right at the top, right where

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.770
the kite is.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.580
So that's not ideal.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.130
So we're going to try playing
around with a few more

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.836
parameters and see if we can,
indeed, find the whole tether.

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.210
Could you reduce the
number of points?

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.340
I mean, increase the
number of points.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.870
That it's averaging?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.542
Yeah.

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:01.040
Uh, no.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.320
Increase the number of points.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.360
Ah, that it's averaging.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.902
Control-Z that and increase
the angle, two, four, two.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:25.115
Hopefully it works, Oh.

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.108
Oh, no.

00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:28.660
No.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.110
Hmm, it just goes wrong
right there.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.480
This is the boring bit of
sitting in front of a computer

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.952
and looking at code.

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.202
That might help.

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:41.968
Disaster.

00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:43.910
It's not a disaster.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.880
75% of it is good.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.870
Four or two?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.846
Four.

00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:51.334
Four.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:54.750
Let's try four.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.680
Hey, there we go.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.930
Success.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.040
OK, so the bar's getting
a little busy now.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.210
We've been here for a while.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.860
But we have managed to get this
programme to work, and

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.050
we've found the tether.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.810
So this is our original image.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.190
You can see the kite in the
top right-hand corner.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.970
And it's really hard.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.160
If you don't know where
the tether is, you

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.030
can't really see it.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.440
But with the programme, if I
just run it quickly, it's

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.680
going to try to find
that image.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.515
So what the programme
is doing--

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.620
see, it's already found it.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.760
It was actually pretty quick.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.840
And you can see now it's
spotted that tether.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.050
So we found the tether in this
image, even though it's all

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.180
cloudy and there's
this background.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.220
So what the programme is doing
is it's sort of breaking it up

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.930
into horizontal chunks, and
then running a filter.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.060
And this philtre runs at a bunch
of different angles,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.430
because we know the tether
is going to lie in

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.630
one of those angles.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.480
So even if we can't see the
tether at one point, because

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.400
there's clouds in the
background, and different

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.740
tones, along one sort of line
there's going to be a peak, a

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.270
spike, in the intensity
of the pixels.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.050
So we do that for the entire
image, running it up and down

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.160
the entire thing in
these chunks.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.470
And then, where we have the
highest one, that's where we

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.560
actually start.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.970
So we pick that point,
and then from that

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.200
point, work up and down.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.320
And then we need only to look
within a certain distance and

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.200
a certain angle from the
spot that we found.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.850
So this programme will be really
useful in terms of

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.210
experimental validation.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.450
With two cameras looking at
this, we can find the tether

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.290
in 3D and work out
the dynamics.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.960
I don't need to attach
any sensors to the

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.360
actual cable itself.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.690
And I can get dynamic
response.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.850
So it's really useful.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.900
I'm pretty proud of this
entire programme.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.500
It's really exciting and it will
be really useful for my

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.100
Ph.D.
