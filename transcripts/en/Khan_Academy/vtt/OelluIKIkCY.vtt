00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm going to take the region
in between the two curves

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.570
here, between the yellow curve--
defined as a function of y

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.560
as x is equal to y minus 1
squared-- and this bluish-green

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.420
looking line-- where y
is equal to x minus 1.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.350
So I'm going to take this
region right over here,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.510
and I'm going to rotate
it around the line,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.890
y equals negative 2,
to get this shape that

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.520
looks like the front of a jet
engine or something like that.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.900
And we're going to want to
figure out what its volume is.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.316
And you can actually
approach this

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:36.741
with either the disk
method or the shell method.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.240
In the disk method,
you would create

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.770
disks that look like this.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.294
And you would be doing
integrating with respect to x.

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:48.460
You will have to break up
the problem appropriately,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.815
because you have a
different lower boundary.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.940
You would have to break
this up into two functions,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.010
an upper function
and a lower boundary

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.980
for this interval in x.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.980
And then a different one
for that interval in x.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.524
But you could use
the disk method.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:00.940
But instead of
that, we don't feel

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.780
like breaking up the functions
and doing all of that.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.614
So we're going to do
it in the shell method,

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.238
especially because we've already
expressed one of our functions

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:08.170
as a function of y.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.967
And this one won't
be too hard to do.

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:11.550
So what we're going
to do, once again,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.215
is imagine constructing
these little rectangles that

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.780
have height dy.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.300
And what we're going to do
is rotate those rectangles

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.140
around the line y
equals negative 2.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.910
So let me draw that same
rectangle over here.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.860
And when you do that,
you construct a shell.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.020
So let me do that.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.870
So, go between these two points.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.090
And then this is what it would
look like when it's down here.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.700
And then, let me make it
clear that this constructs

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.720
a shell of thickness
dy or of depth dy.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.900
So let me do it like that.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.930
So that's my shell, and it
has some thickness to it.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
And that thickness is dy.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.910
So that's the
thickness of my shell.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.320
And let me shade
it in a little bit.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.214
Make sure you can see the
3-dimensionality of my shell.

00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:10.130
So like we've done with
all of these problems,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.650
our goal is to really
just figure out

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.220
what the volume
of each shell is.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.520
And then we can enter it for
a specific y in our interval.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.110
And then we integrate along
all the y's of our interval.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.885
And we've done this
many times before.

00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:26.260
The first thing
we think about is

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.744
what's the radius
one of these shells?

00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:32.410
So what I'm doing
right here in magenta,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.120
what is the radius of
something like that?

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.850
Well, it's essentially
going to be

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.370
the distance between y
is equal to negative 2

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.270
and our y value for
that specific y.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.720
So this distance
right over here is y.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.340
And then we're going
to have another 2.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.604
So the whole distance
is going to be y plus 2.

00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:03.270
Another way of thinking
about it is this

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.460
is essentially y
minus negative 2

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.890
to get the distance, which
is going to be y plus 2.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.660
So the radius of one
of our little shells

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.900
is going to be y plus 2.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.960
If the radius is
y plus 2, then we

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.420
know that the circumference
of this circle right over here

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.790
is going to be 2
pi times y plus 2.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.550
And then the surface area,
the outside surface area,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.810
of the shell, the
stuff out here,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.290
is just going to be that
circumference times I guess

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.600
you could say the width
of this shell times

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.350
this distance right over here.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.830
Or we could say times this
distance right over here.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.070
And what is that distance?

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.770
Remember, we want everything
expressed as a function of y.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.520
Well, it's going to be the upper
function as a function of y

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.447
minus the lower function.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.030
And we think about
the upper function,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.446
it's the function
that's giving us

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:02.120
higher x values
in that interval.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.150
And so this blue function
is the upper function

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.980
when we think in terms of y.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.900
But we have to express
it as a function of y.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.560
So let me do that.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.100
So we can rewrite this
as add 1 to both sides,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.100
you get x is equal to y plus 1.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.370
So that is our upper function.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.870
And then this is
our lower function.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.622
If you were to tilt
your head to the right

00:04:21.622 --> 00:04:23.080
and look at it that
way, you'll see

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.880
that this will be
the upper function,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.700
and this will be
the lower function

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.750
for the same value of y.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.750
This gives a higher value
of x than this one does

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.380
for the same value of y.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.630
It gives the upper x values.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.890
So, the area is going
to be the circumference

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.550
times this dimension.

00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:44.810
Let me write this.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.760
The area of one of those shells
is going to be 2 pi times y

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.430
plus 2 times the distance
between the upper function.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.660
So the distance between the
upper function y plus 1,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.930
x is equal to y plus 1,
and the lower function, x

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.885
is equal to y minus 1 squared.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.280
I'll put the parentheses
in that same color.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.799
And then if we want the
volume of that shell,

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:21.340
so we've got the outside surface
area of the shell right now.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.480
We just multiply it by its
depth, which is just dy.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.670
So that sets up our integral.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.960
The volume of one shell--
I'll do it all in one color

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:40.620
now-- is 2 pi times y plus 2
times y plus 1 minus y minus 1

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.326
squared.

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:44.960
Then we multiply that times
the depth of each shell, dy.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.700
And then we integrate
over the interval.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.310
So the volume is
going to be this.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.317
And what's the interval?

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.650
You might be able to eyeball it.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.470
But we can actually
solve that explicitly.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.980
When do these two
things equal each other?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.560
Well, you could
just set y plus 1

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.910
to be equal to y minus 1
squared, so let's do that.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:07.150
So if we set y plus 1,
this, to be equal to that,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.347
it's going to be equal
to y minus 1 squared.

00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:11.430
So let me expand that out.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.762
That's going to be y
squared minus 2y plus 1.

00:06:15.762 --> 00:06:16.540
And let's see.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.240
I could subtract
y from both sides

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.550
and I could subtract
1 from both sides.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.950
Minus y, minus 1.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.790
And then I am left with,
on the left hand side, 0.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.832
And on the right hand side,
I have y squared minus 3 y.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.190
And that's it, plus 0.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.110
So 0 is equal to
y times y minus 3.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.790
So the zeros of
this, when these are

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.967
equal are when y is equal
to 0 or y is equal to 3.

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:49.300
And we see that right over here.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.480
When y is equal to 0, these
two functions intersect.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.520
And when y is equal to 3,
these two functions intersect.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.430
So our interval is going
to be from y is equal to 0

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.290
to y is equal to 3.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.080
So using the shell
method, we have

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.550
been able to set up
our definite integral.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.030
And now we can think about how
we can evaluate this thing.
