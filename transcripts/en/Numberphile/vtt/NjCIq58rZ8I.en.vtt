00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
He's known as one of the mathematicians with perhaps the most natural talent for maths

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.360
It's a man called Ramanujan. He was an Indian mathematician. He started with no formal training

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:19.140
in mathematics. But just by working alone, isolated, he was able to come up with all these mathematical facts,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.560
these theorems, all by himself. Some were rediscoveries of things that were already known

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.840
Some were new! And he sent these to Cambridge mathematicians and they recognized his talent

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.660
And he was invited to come to Cambridge and show off what he could do

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.920
When we're filming this - a film has just come out all about Ramanujan

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.860
this film just concentrated on one achievement. And it was something to do with partitions.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.660
So partitions is about the number of ways that we can break down a number.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.500
We take a number, an integer, and how many ways can we break it down into positive parts?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.980
And to prove that I'm a serious mathematician, I'm going to illustrate this by using a DUPLO here.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.480
Let's say we take the number four, and I've got four units of DUPLO there,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.180
how many ways can I break this down into positive parts? So I could start with this. It's a tower of four.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.220
Or, I could break it down, right? I could have a three and a one. Right? Or, I could have a two, a one, and a one.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.300
Or I could break it down again, I could have one, one, one, one, and there is one I've missed there if you noticed

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.020
I have missed out breaking it down into two and two. So in fact, there are five ways to break this down.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.820
So we draw this out. We could either draw it like this: one, two, three, four. We can do a three and a one.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.700
Like that. Two, two. We could have two, one, one. One, one, one, one, like that.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.760
So this is what mathematicians actually do, they do it this this way because by seeing it as a picture,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.100
you can actually make conclusions about partitions which are easier to see.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.760
The French do this slightly differently. The French draw them like this: you can have a row of four like that.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.220
And you can have a row of three with a row of one like that, so it's the other way around.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.140
Or you could it like this, above. And then the last one here: one, one, one, one. So it's a slightly different way of doing it.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.200
My favorite foot note from a textbook - do you have a favorite footnote from a textbook? - oh, I know I do.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.780
Favorite footnote from a textbook was by Ian MacDonald who said

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.920
"if you want to do the French notation, you should read this textbook while looking upside down and in a mirror"

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.860
So I get to say this for myself for the first time!

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.180
If you want to use the French notation, watch this video upside down and in a mirror.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.760
So let's look at the sequence of partitions. So the sequence is this:

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.040
one, two, three, five, seven, eleven, fifteen, twenty-two, thirty, forty-two, and so on like this.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.820
Ok, so when we were looking at partitions before, that's this one here, there were five partitions of four.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.800
So if that's breaking down the number four, there are five ways of doing it.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
If you wanted to break down the number five, there'd be seven ways of doing it, and so on.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.160
So, these numbers get larger and by the time we get to something like one hundred,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.880
how many ways can we break down the number one hundred. If we did that, it's going to be a large number.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.840
It's going to be one hundred and ninety million, five hundred and sixty-nine thousand, two hundred and ninty two.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.040
So these get really large. Now, it becomes very difficult to calculate these partitions by hand.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.360
Wouldn't it be nice to have a formula that helps us work out these partitions?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.560
So, then if I have a formula, you can give me a number, and I can tell you how many ways to break that down.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.200
Oh, fantastic! And this is the problem that Ramanujan decided to tackle.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.800
So there were some formulas before Ramanujan, which go back to Euler. Not particularly pretty formulas,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.600
but I can show you what they look like. Should I do that?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.320
Ok, so, I'm gonna draw out a polynomial using partitions as coefficients.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.940
It means it's gonna look like this: one plus, I'm gong to have, plus x plus,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.360
now I'm going to have x squared next and I'm going to use how many ways to break down two.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.140
There, which is two ways of doing that. So, if I have x cubed next,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.700
I want how many way to break down three and there are three ways of doing that.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.240
And I would keep going like this. If I had x four, we know how many ways to break that down, right?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.400
There are five ways of doing it. And then it's seven for x five and so on and so on.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.280
So this is a very mathsy looking thing. In other words, if you like this notation, it means "sum".

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:52.260
If I want to sum - these are called partitions of n and then it's times x to the power of n. And you do that all the way up to infinity.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:02.060
Now, what Euler saw was this was equal to, this is equal to - I'm going to use another symbol here: this symbol,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.440
which is a capital pi, it means product, it means you are multiplying these things together.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.700
(In background) Not three point one four

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.900
It's not three point one four, yeah, we're limited in how many letters we've got to use so we're using pi here for product.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.920
The product of one over one minus x to the k. Yeah, we've got this. It's from k equals 1 to infinity.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.060
So we've got something that we're multiplying together is equal to this polynomial. This is a way of working out partitions.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.200
And it's what you used to do classically. And so if you want to work out the partitions of one hundred,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.520
you could use a formula like this and actually do the calculation. But it's not particularly easy.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.180
But that is what they used to do if they had to do it by hand,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.520
and it's what your computer would do if it wants to work out partitions, it would use a formula like that

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.060
Ramanujan had an amazing intuition for numbers.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.520
Another Cambridge mathematician called John Littlewood said that all the positive integers were Ramanujan's personal friends.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.200
Which sounds like an utter nightmare to me, having infinitely many personal friends,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.160
imagine the Christmas card list, sounds terrible. So let's look at some of the things he noticed about partitions.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.360
I guess this is something that attracted him to the subject. Looking at partitions of, let's say,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:30.420
a number that looks like this: five k plus four. Okay, so if you have a number like that, it ends with a four or a nine.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.140
Four, nine, fourteen, nineteen, so these numbers. So you have a number like that, you notice something.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:47.440
You notice that the number of ways of breaking it down is divisible by five. So there's a fact that he noticed.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:56.600
The first example: if we took k equals zero, we're looking at - if it's zero - looking at partitions of four.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.780
Ok, we did that, alright, how many ways were there to do it? There were five ways of doing it.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.700
It's divisible by five. Great! What about partitians of nine? So if you have k equals one,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.180
this would be partitions of nine, that's the next step up. How many ways of doing that?  And if you work it out,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.820
I can tell you that there are thirty ways of doing that and, hey, again it works, it's divisible by five.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.460
It always appears to be the case. Ramanujan was able to show this,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.040
and he was able to show a couple of things that were similar to this as well.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:38.160
Like if you had partitions of a number that looked like this: seven k plus five, then that is divisible by seven.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:46.860
Or if you had partitions that look like this: eleven k plus six, then this is divisible by eleven.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:55.460
So he had these little facts. And if you see that pattern, it does seem to appear like the next one should be something like this

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:05.220
partitions of thirteen k plus seven is divisible by thirteen. And that is not right. That is incorrect.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.460
The pattern doesn't hold. Ramanujan found these three and he found no other formula like this, and he thought

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.240
"well that's it, those are the only formula's we've got. The next one doesn't hold,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.780
the others don't appear to hold." Eventually fifty years later, they did solve this. There is one that looks like this,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:31.560
it's not as simple as what they thought. Seventeen thousand, three-hundred and three k plus two three seven is divisible by thirteen.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:39.960
Which is nothing like what Ramanujan found before. And it seems crazy but now we know that we have a formula like this for every prime.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.280
But they're just not as nice as the first three that was found by Ramanujan.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.620
But it's still not the big formula they wanted to find. Let's have a look at the big formula, the main punchline.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:09:00.220
Ok. Number of partitions is one over four n square root of three multiplied by the exponential of pi.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:06.700
That's a traditional pi. That's three point one four.  Times the square root of two n over three.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.640
So that's a nice, closed formula for how many partitions there are. That twiddle sign, if you notice,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.640
means it's not equals. It means it's an approximation, but it's an approximation that gets better with larger values.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.700
So this is actually getting better and better as you go along the sequence. So if we did this with an example

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:34.040
Let's do one hundred, right? We know what the one hundred value was, and if we did this with one hundred, put one hundred in here, we would get

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.240
one hundered and ninety-nine million, two hundred and eighty thousand, eight hundred and ninety-three

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:49.520
Now this is in this right area for the true value. But it's about four point six percent off. Maybe it's not the best,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.620
but again this formula is getting better with larger values.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:02.400
But I can do better than that because this formula I gave you here is actually just the first term in a series.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.980
So this can actually become more accurate, in fact it becomes equals.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.580
So what Ramanjun was able to do was use his full formula

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:18.520
and you just needed the first five terms to work out the value for partitions of two hundred to the nearest integer.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.520
And you can actually do that using his own formula. So these are not particularly easy to calculate,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:31.680
but the largest value we've calculated so far is something around one hundred million million million,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.600
so it's twenty zeros, a massive number. And the number of partitions,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.140
so the number of ways of breaking that down is something that has eleven billion digits.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:51.660
So there are a huge number of ways of doing it. And the reason partitions are important: partitions are used in the mathematics of shuffling.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.760
Like shuffling a pack of cards! Alright, so think of a shuffle like that. But,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.840
there are lots of things in maths that are actually a shuffle. You can think of -

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.540
and even in Physics like shuffling energy. So you know energy isn't created or destroyed it just gets moved around, right?

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.600
It just gets shuffled; it gets conserved. And underneath that, the maths is the same:

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.620
it's the maths of shuffling and it's the maths of partitions.
