00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.150
Another thing you might want to do at
this point is try to predict which

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.460
students are likely to pass their first
project, and which students aren't.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.320
You could take a first pass of this
using some heuristics based on

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.060
your exploration.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.720
For example,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.510
you could predict that students who
spend more time in the classroom during

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.180
their first week are more likely to
eventually pass the first project.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.130
However, getting a really good
prediction this way could be difficult.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.950
For one thing, there are lots of
different pieces of information that we

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.710
probably should be looking at.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.780
You'd probably at least want to look
at the things I looked at earlier,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.110
lessons completed,
minutes spent, and days visited.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860
But there could be a lot more
pieces of information or

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.880
features that you'd like
to look at as well.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.830
This wouldn't be so bad except that all
of your different features can have

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.870
complex interactions with each other.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.770
For example, when you look at minutes
spent in the classroom on its own,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.960
it might look like a really
important feature.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.990
But then when you look
at lessons completed and

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.310
minutes spent together, you might see
that after you already know how many

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.490
lessons a student completed, knowing
how many minutes they spent doesn't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.680
give you any additional information.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640
In many situations like this one,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.350
you can use machine learning to make
pretty good predictions automatically,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.640
usually a lot better than
the predictions you could make by hand.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.900
Depending on the machine learning
algorithm you use, it might also give

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.910
you a ranked list of which features
were most important to the prediction,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.780
which can be very interesting.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.580
