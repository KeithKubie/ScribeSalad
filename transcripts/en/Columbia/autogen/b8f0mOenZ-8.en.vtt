we're going to start talking about

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790
we're going to start talking about
 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.490
we're going to start talking about
infection of organisms not just cells so

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
infection of organisms not just cells so
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.660
infection of organisms not just cells so
we're going to look at some of the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
we're going to look at some of the
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340
we're going to look at some of the
principles of pathogenesis the rest of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
principles of pathogenesis the rest of
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.310
principles of pathogenesis the rest of
the course we'll deal with this aspect

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
the course we'll deal with this aspect
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.759
the course we'll deal with this aspect
of how viruses infect you so we're going

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
of how viruses infect you so we're going
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349
of how viruses infect you so we're going
to talk about infections in the real

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
to talk about infections in the real
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.910
to talk about infections in the real
world not in a culture dish and this

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
world not in a culture dish and this
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.119
world not in a culture dish and this
actually refers to part three of the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
actually refers to part three of the
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.700
actually refers to part three of the
tripartite strategy which we talked

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
tripartite strategy which we talked
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619
tripartite strategy which we talked
about way in the beginning and that is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
about way in the beginning and that is
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.630
about way in the beginning and that is
all viral genomes are able to establish

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
all viral genomes are able to establish
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.410
all viral genomes are able to establish
themselves in a host population so that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
themselves in a host population so that
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600
themselves in a host population so that
the viruses can keep going on and on and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
the viruses can keep going on and on and
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.709
the viruses can keep going on and on and
on and I would suggest that you have a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
on and I would suggest that you have a
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.990
on and I would suggest that you have a
look at Appendix B in the textbook

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000
look at Appendix B in the textbook
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.180
look at Appendix B in the textbook
Appendix B is in the volume - it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
Appendix B is in the volume - it's
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.359
Appendix B is in the volume - it's
called pathogenicity snapshots and it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
called pathogenicity snapshots and it
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.149
called pathogenicity snapshots and it
gives you an overview of individual

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
gives you an overview of individual
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190
gives you an overview of individual
viral diseases I'll be mentioning

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
viral diseases I'll be mentioning
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289
viral diseases I'll be mentioning
various viral diseases from time to time

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
various viral diseases from time to time
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.410
various viral diseases from time to time
and it will help if you've got some

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
and it will help if you've got some
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420
and it will help if you've got some
familiarity with them it's mostly a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
familiarity with them it's mostly a
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.899
familiarity with them it's mostly a
visual appendix so I think that would be

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
visual appendix so I think that would be
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910
visual appendix so I think that would be
very useful as outlines of the viruses

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
very useful as outlines of the viruses
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130
very useful as outlines of the viruses
the epidemiology and the disease

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
the epidemiology and the disease
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219
the epidemiology and the disease
mechanisms so some basic facts every

plants insects that are hosts for

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
plants insects that are hosts for
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.100
plants insects that are hosts for
viruses has intrinsic defenses and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
viruses has intrinsic defenses and
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.460
viruses has intrinsic defenses and
immune defenses and we will talk about

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
immune defenses and we will talk about
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.240
immune defenses and we will talk about
how they differ later on that have

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
how they differ later on that have
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.300
how they differ later on that have
evolved to deal with infections viral

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
evolved to deal with infections viral
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210
evolved to deal with infections viral
infections bacterial fungal all sorts as

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
infections bacterial fungal all sorts as
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.190
infections bacterial fungal all sorts as
well as tumors

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.469
and every virus has to counter those

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
and every virus has to counter those
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120
and every virus has to counter those
defenses otherwise there wouldn't be any

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
defenses otherwise there wouldn't be any
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.800
defenses otherwise there wouldn't be any
viruses around we will talk a lot about

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
viruses around we will talk a lot about
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.219
viruses around we will talk a lot about
this modulation of host defenses this is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
this modulation of host defenses this is
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.609
this modulation of host defenses this is
the interface of virus host interaction

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
the interface of virus host interaction
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.550

it's a very interesting area of study

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
it's a very interesting area of study
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.640
it's a very interesting area of study
this is one of my favorite lines we live

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
this is one of my favorite lines we live
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.430
this is one of my favorite lines we live

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780
came to the US and in New York City
 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.230
came to the US and in New York City
summer of October 2004 about 1 million

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240
summer of October 2004 about 1 million
 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.760
summer of October 2004 about 1 million
people were infected we know this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770
people were infected we know this
 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.650
people were infected we know this
because they did Sara surveys for the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660
because they did Sara surveys for the
 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.440
because they did Sara surveys for the
presence of antibodies only 20% of the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450
presence of antibodies only 20% of the
 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.590
presence of antibodies only 20% of the
people had fever and only 1% of the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600
people had fever and only 1% of the
 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.720
people had fever and only 1% of the
people had neuro invasion which is good

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730
people had neuro invasion which is good
 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.730
people had neuro invasion which is good
because when you get neuro invasion it's

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
because when you get neuro invasion it's
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.390
because when you get neuro invasion it's
not good

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400
not good
 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.670
not good
many people were infected with no

because you give blood and you don't

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460
because you give blood and you don't
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.270
because you give blood and you don't
know you're infected if you give an

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
know you're infected if you give an
 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.610
know you're infected if you give an
organ you can give someone virus because

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620
organ you can give someone virus because
 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.500
organ you can give someone virus because
they don't check organs for every

not yet and this it makes it hard to
 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.270
not yet and this it makes it hard to
stop an epidemic because you can't

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
stop an epidemic because you can't
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.880
stop an epidemic because you can't
recognize it early enough because people

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890
recognize it early enough because people
 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.350
recognize it early enough because people
are shedding viruses and they don't have

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360
are shedding viruses and they don't have

symptoms if you have symptoms you take
 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.190
symptoms if you have symptoms you take
care of them but if you don't you

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200
care of them but if you don't you
 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.880

be clear by now we have lots of

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570
be clear by now we have lots of
 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.420
be clear by now we have lots of
infections and we are healthy because we

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
infections and we are healthy because we
 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.940
infections and we are healthy because we
can take care of them but some

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950
can take care of them but some
 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.950

infections aren't stopped when you get

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960
infections aren't stopped when you get
 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.850
infections aren't stopped when you get
sick and many die of viral infections so

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860
sick and many die of viral infections so
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.219
sick and many die of viral infections so
what happened to the defense system

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229

where did they go and how can a virus

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720
where did they go and how can a virus
 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.620
where did they go and how can a virus
with a couple of genes even for the

with a couple of genes even for the
 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.770
with a couple of genes even for the

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780
smallest virus how can a virus make us
 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.740
smallest virus how can a virus make us
sick and kill us so that's these are

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750
sick and kill us so that's these are
 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.750
sick and kill us so that's these are
some of the questions we'll try to

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760
some of the questions we'll try to
 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.140
some of the questions we'll try to
answer in the rest of this course and

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150
answer in the rest of this course and
 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.420
answer in the rest of this course and
we'll be talking about viral pathogen

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430
we'll be talking about viral pathogen
 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.360
we'll be talking about viral pathogen
is's which and pathogenesis is the

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370
is's which and pathogenesis is the
 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.719
is's which and pathogenesis is the
process of producing a disease we talk

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729
process of producing a disease we talk
 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.850
process of producing a disease we talk
about viral pathogen is's it is produced

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860
about viral pathogen is's it is produced
 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.010
about viral pathogen is's it is produced
by a virus but it could be bacterial or

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020
by a virus but it could be bacterial or
 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.370
by a virus but it could be bacterial or
fungal or protozoan as well and viral

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380
fungal or protozoan as well and viral
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.920
fungal or protozoan as well and viral
disease that is when you get sick with a

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930
disease that is when you get sick with a
 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.620
disease that is when you get sick with a
virus infection you have a viral disease

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630
virus infection you have a viral disease
 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.659
virus infection you have a viral disease
if you have symptoms it is a combination

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669
if you have symptoms it is a combination
 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.600
if you have symptoms it is a combination
of the effects of the virus replicating

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610
of the effects of the virus replicating
 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.260
of the effects of the virus replicating
in the host and the effects of the host

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270
in the host and the effects of the host
 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.110
in the host and the effects of the host
response on both the virus and yourself

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120
response on both the virus and yourself
 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.390
response on both the virus and yourself
so I want you to forget the idea that

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400
so I want you to forget the idea that
 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.339
so I want you to forget the idea that
the virus is doing everything to make

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349
the virus is doing everything to make
 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.740
the virus is doing everything to make
you sick you are contributing by immune

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750
you sick you are contributing by immune
 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.659
you sick you are contributing by immune
having an immune response against

years and years and different mechanisms
 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.570
years and years and different mechanisms
are at play and we'll talk about some of

years of our existence we didn't

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310
years of our existence we didn't
 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.959
years of our existence we didn't
understand about microbes as infectious

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:57.969
understand about microbes as infectious
 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:00.629

agents we thought when we got sick it

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639
agents we thought when we got sick it
 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.969
agents we thought when we got sick it
was because the air was poisoned and we

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:02.979
was because the air was poisoned and we
 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:04.920
was because the air was poisoned and we
breathed it in and it had toxins in it

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930
breathed it in and it had toxins in it
 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.200
breathed it in and it had toxins in it
and it made us sick and that's why they

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210
and it made us sick and that's why they
 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.749
and it made us sick and that's why they
were epidemics of contagious disease we

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759
were epidemics of contagious disease we
 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.459
were epidemics of contagious disease we
knew there were epidemics of disease and

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:11.469
knew there were epidemics of disease and
 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:12.899
knew there were epidemics of disease and
that people spread it but we didn't know

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:12.909
that people spread it but we didn't know
 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:15.779
that people spread it but we didn't know
anything about microbes that Association

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789
anything about microbes that Association
 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.929
anything about microbes that Association
didn't happen until the late 1800s when

Pasteur said these can cause disease and

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:26.439
Pasteur said these can cause disease and
 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.430
Pasteur said these can cause disease and
he formulated his Koch's postulates to

he formulated his Koch's postulates to
 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.070
he formulated his Koch's postulates to
identify the agent responsible for a

specific disease he coined the word a

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:33.849
specific disease he coined the word a
 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.420
specific disease he coined the word a
pathogen and said microbes can be

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430
pathogen and said microbes can be
 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.939
pathogen and said microbes can be
pathogen so it's really not a very long

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:38.949

pretty well protected the problem is we
 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.630
pretty well protected the problem is we
have these mucosal surfaces and we have

infections initiate and of course we

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:10.490
infections initiate and of course we
 

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.520

need to have mucosal surfaces because we

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:12.530
need to have mucosal surfaces because we
 

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.530

of cells we have antibodies if you have
 

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.690
of cells we have antibodies if you have
been previously infected so we do have

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:51.700
been previously infected so we do have
 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.060
been previously infected so we do have
some good protection and that is why we

papilloma virus may produce local

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.230
papilloma virus may produce local
 

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.250
papilloma virus may produce local
lesions when they infect there others

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260
lesions when they infect there others
 

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.680
lesions when they infect there others
can infect the urogenital tract and then

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:42.690
can infect the urogenital tract and then
 

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.860
can infect the urogenital tract and then
spread to other sites like HIV and

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:45.870
spread to other sites like HIV and
 

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.790
spread to other sites like HIV and
herpes simplex virus the eye is also a

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:49.800
herpes simplex virus the eye is also a
 

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.120
herpes simplex virus the eye is also a
route of entry this sclera and the

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.130
route of entry this sclera and the
 

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.600
route of entry this sclera and the
conjunctiva typically infected by

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:56.610
conjunctiva typically infected by
 

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.320
conjunctiva typically infected by
viruses you blink every few seconds and

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.330
viruses you blink every few seconds and
 

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.960
viruses you blink every few seconds and
as you do you wash away foreign

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:02.970
as you do you wash away foreign
 

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.140
as you do you wash away foreign
particles and that's a wonderful defense

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.150
particles and that's a wonderful defense
 

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.820
particles and that's a wonderful defense
because any virus that lands on your eye

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:07.830
because any virus that lands on your eye
 

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.259
because any virus that lands on your eye
is immediately washed away

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:10.269
is immediately washed away
 

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:12.359
is immediately washed away
and therefore has a little opportunity

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:12.369
and therefore has a little opportunity
 

00:24:12.369 --> 00:24:14.699
and therefore has a little opportunity
to infect but if you get some grit in

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:14.709
to infect but if you get some grit in
 

00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:16.529
to infect but if you get some grit in
your eye and you rub it then you get

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:16.539
your eye and you rub it then you get
 

00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:18.959
your eye and you rub it then you get
little micro abrasions on your eye

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:18.969
little micro abrasions on your eye
 

00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:21.119
little micro abrasions on your eye
surface then that will let virus

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:21.129
surface then that will let virus
 

00:24:21.129 --> 00:24:24.089
surface then that will let virus
particles in so typically infection

00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:24.099
particles in so typically infection
 

00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:26.810
particles in so typically infection
occurs after some kind of injury grit

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820
occurs after some kind of injury grit
 

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.430
occurs after some kind of injury grit

infections of the eye are not trivial so
here's a summary of all the different

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:30.249
here's a summary of all the different
 

00:25:30.249 --> 00:25:33.569
here's a summary of all the different
routes of virus entry and those you

00:25:33.569 --> 00:25:33.579
routes of virus entry and those you
 

00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:35.699
routes of virus entry and those you
should be familiar with just the general

00:25:35.699 --> 00:25:35.709
should be familiar with just the general
 

00:25:35.709 --> 00:25:38.009
should be familiar with just the general
ways that virus can get in all these

00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:38.019
ways that virus can get in all these
 

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:40.649
ways that virus can get in all these
pathways that I've talked about how a

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:40.659
pathways that I've talked about how a
 

00:25:40.659 --> 00:25:43.589
pathways that I've talked about how a
virus might enter the respiratory tract

00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:43.599
virus might enter the respiratory tract
 

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:46.499
virus might enter the respiratory tract
the alimentary tract for example and as

00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:46.509
the alimentary tract for example and as
 

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:48.209
the alimentary tract for example and as
we talked about these viruses you'll

00:25:48.209 --> 00:25:48.219
we talked about these viruses you'll
 

00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:51.810
we talked about these viruses you'll
remember that poliovirus and rotavirus

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:51.820
remember that poliovirus and rotavirus
 

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.289
remember that poliovirus and rotavirus
is in fact via the alimentary tract

00:25:55.289 --> 00:25:55.299
is in fact via the alimentary tract
 

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:57.839
is in fact via the alimentary tract
you'll remember that HIV can infect by

00:25:57.839 --> 00:25:57.849
you'll remember that HIV can infect by
 

00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:01.979
you'll remember that HIV can infect by
the urogenital tract as well okay so you

00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:01.989
the urogenital tract as well okay so you
 

00:26:01.989 --> 00:26:04.919
the urogenital tract as well okay so you
are infected by any of these routes the

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:04.929
are infected by any of these routes the
 

00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:07.680
are infected by any of these routes the
skin respiratory alimentary your genital

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:07.690
skin respiratory alimentary your genital
 

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.560
skin respiratory alimentary your genital
etcetera and we've talked about just how

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:10.570
etcetera and we've talked about just how
 

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.930
etcetera and we've talked about just how
they are open to virus infection let's

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:12.940
they are open to virus infection let's
 

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.560
they are open to virus infection let's
now talk about how viruses spread from

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:16.570
now talk about how viruses spread from
 

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.299
now talk about how viruses spread from
those initial sites all right now some

00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:21.309
those initial sites all right now some
 

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:23.159
those initial sites all right now some
viruses don't spread some of them

00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:23.169
viruses don't spread some of them
 

00:26:23.169 --> 00:26:24.060
viruses don't spread some of them
replicate where

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.070
replicate where
 

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.600
replicate where
they come in so here we have a gut

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:27.610
they come in so here we have a gut
 

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.330
they come in so here we have a gut
epithelium and a virus can infect these

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:30.340
epithelium and a virus can infect these
 

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.890
epithelium and a virus can infect these
enterocytes and just spread throughout

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:31.900
enterocytes and just spread throughout
 

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.780
enterocytes and just spread throughout
the NRO sites and never go underneath

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:33.790
the NRO sites and never go underneath
 

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.540
the NRO sites and never go underneath
and spread to the rest of the organism

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:36.550
and spread to the rest of the organism
 

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.910
and spread to the rest of the organism
so the virus spreads within the

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:38.920
so the virus spreads within the
 

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.250
so the virus spreads within the
epithelium but it is contained by the

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:41.260
epithelium but it is contained by the
 

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.320
epithelium but it is contained by the
tissue structure and the immune system

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.330
tissue structure and the immune system
 

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.730
tissue structure and the immune system
so what I mean by that the tissue

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:44.740
so what I mean by that the tissue
 

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.950
so what I mean by that the tissue
structure below these epithelial layers

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960
structure below these epithelial layers
 

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.440
structure below these epithelial layers
is what is called a basement membrane

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:49.450
is what is called a basement membrane
 

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.720
is what is called a basement membrane
this is not really a membrane but a

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:51.730
this is not really a membrane but a
 

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.090
this is not really a membrane but a
structure made up of a variety of

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.100
structure made up of a variety of
 

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.520
structure made up of a variety of
proteins and proteoglycans but it is a

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:56.530
proteins and proteoglycans but it is a
 

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.010
proteins and proteoglycans but it is a
barrier to routine penetration of the

00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.020
barrier to routine penetration of the
 

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.300
barrier to routine penetration of the
sub epithelial tissues by microorganisms

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:02.310
sub epithelial tissues by microorganisms
 

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.960
sub epithelial tissues by microorganisms
so down here below the epithelium is the

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:06.970
so down here below the epithelium is the
 

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.340
so down here below the epithelium is the
sub epithelial tissue and there are

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:08.350
sub epithelial tissue and there are
 

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.260
sub epithelial tissue and there are
blood vessels and lymph lymph vessels

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:10.270
blood vessels and lymph lymph vessels
 

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.270
blood vessels and lymph lymph vessels
there and so if you got there you could

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.280
there and so if you got there you could
 

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.160
there and so if you got there you could
pretty much go anywhere in the organism

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.170
pretty much go anywhere in the organism
 

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.140
pretty much go anywhere in the organism
so the structure of this is such to

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.150
so the structure of this is such to
 

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.870
so the structure of this is such to
prevent that so some viruses in fact are

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880
prevent that so some viruses in fact are
 

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.580
prevent that so some viruses in fact are
blocked by that there are also some

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:20.590
blocked by that there are also some
 

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.950
blocked by that there are also some
immune responses at the surface that

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960
immune responses at the surface that
 

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.530
immune responses at the surface that
will prevent further infection but other

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:25.540
will prevent further infection but other
 

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.410
will prevent further infection but other
viruses can spread beyond this primary

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:28.420
viruses can spread beyond this primary
 

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.150
viruses can spread beyond this primary
site again it could be a respiratory

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.160
site again it could be a respiratory
 

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.610
site again it could be a respiratory
epithelium Elementary tract it doesn't

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:32.620
epithelium Elementary tract it doesn't
 

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.190

and when many organs are infected we
 

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.730
and when many organs are infected we
call it a systemic infection so it's

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:44.740
call it a systemic infection so it's
 

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.500
call it a systemic infection so it's

and among animals usually spread by
 

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.369
and among animals usually spread by
vectors so it doesn't need to be spread

00:30:55.369 --> 00:30:55.379
vectors so it doesn't need to be spread
 

00:30:55.379 --> 00:30:59.649

example of how you can manipulate this
and change the pathogenesis sendai virus

00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299
and change the pathogenesis sendai virus
 

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:27.309
and change the pathogenesis sendai virus
is a negative stranded envelope virus

00:31:27.309 --> 00:31:27.319
is a negative stranded envelope virus
 

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:31.069
is a negative stranded envelope virus
you can infect mice with sendai virus

00:31:31.069 --> 00:31:31.079
you can infect mice with sendai virus
 

00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:32.869
you can infect mice with sendai virus
and the virus is released from the

00:31:32.869 --> 00:31:32.879
and the virus is released from the
 

00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:34.939
and the virus is released from the
apical domain of the respiratory tract

00:31:34.939 --> 00:31:34.949
apical domain of the respiratory tract
 

00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:38.839
apical domain of the respiratory tract
and if you infect mice with a wild type

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:38.849
and if you infect mice with a wild type
 

00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:41.299
and if you infect mice with a wild type
virus it's causes a respire Tori tract

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:41.309
virus it's causes a respire Tori tract
 

00:31:41.309 --> 00:31:43.579
virus it's causes a respire Tori tract
infection and it never spreads to any

00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:43.589
infection and it never spreads to any
 

00:31:43.589 --> 00:31:46.279

other tissues but you can make a mutant

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:46.289
other tissues but you can make a mutant
 

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:49.039
other tissues but you can make a mutant
of the virus by introducing a couple of

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:49.049
of the virus by introducing a couple of
 

00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:52.189
of the virus by introducing a couple of
amino acid changes in the virus and that

00:31:52.189 --> 00:31:52.199
amino acid changes in the virus and that
 

00:31:52.199 --> 00:31:54.019
amino acid changes in the virus and that
mutant is now released from both the

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:54.029
mutant is now released from both the
 

00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:56.599
mutant is now released from both the
apical and the basolateral domains of

00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:56.609
apical and the basolateral domains of
 

00:31:56.609 --> 00:31:58.489
apical and the basolateral domains of
the cell so what do you think happens

00:31:58.489 --> 00:31:58.499
the cell so what do you think happens
 

00:31:58.499 --> 00:32:00.319
the cell so what do you think happens
when you infect mice with that mutant

00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:00.329
when you infect mice with that mutant
 

00:32:00.329 --> 00:32:03.769
when you infect mice with that mutant
well the virus spreads systemically it

00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779
well the virus spreads systemically it
 

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:06.109
well the virus spreads systemically it
then infects multiple organs and is

00:32:06.109 --> 00:32:06.119
then infects multiple organs and is
 

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:09.099
then infects multiple organs and is
lethal to the mouse so the simple

00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:09.109
lethal to the mouse so the simple
 

00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:11.629
lethal to the mouse so the simple
attribute of being able to bud from the

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639
attribute of being able to bud from the
 

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:14.659
attribute of being able to bud from the
basolateral domain of a cell enables a

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:14.669
basolateral domain of a cell enables a
 

00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:16.759
basolateral domain of a cell enables a
virus to spread whereas otherwise if it

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:16.769
virus to spread whereas otherwise if it
 

00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:18.769
virus to spread whereas otherwise if it
were just coming off the tops of the

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:22.430
were just coming off the tops of the
cells wouldn't be able to do that now

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440
cells wouldn't be able to do that now
 

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.909
cells wouldn't be able to do that now
how do the virus is actually spread one

00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919
how do the virus is actually spread one
 

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:28.339
how do the virus is actually spread one
way is via the blood we call this

00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:28.349
way is via the blood we call this
 

00:32:28.349 --> 00:32:32.239
way is via the blood we call this
hematogenous spread and when a virus

00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:32.249
hematogenous spread and when a virus
 

00:32:32.249 --> 00:32:35.089
hematogenous spread and when a virus
makes a disseminated infection the

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:35.099
makes a disseminated infection the
 

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:37.129
makes a disseminated infection the
systemic infection infecting multiple

00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:37.139
systemic infection infecting multiple
 

00:32:37.139 --> 00:32:39.979
systemic infection infecting multiple
organs it may do so by entering the

00:32:39.979 --> 00:32:39.989
organs it may do so by entering the
 

00:32:39.989 --> 00:32:41.599
organs it may do so by entering the
blood obviously the blood can carry it

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:41.609
blood obviously the blood can carry it
 

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:43.579
blood obviously the blood can carry it
everywhere so it has opportunity to

00:32:43.579 --> 00:32:43.589
everywhere so it has opportunity to
 

00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:47.209
everywhere so it has opportunity to
infect many different organs the viruses

00:32:47.209 --> 00:32:47.219
infect many different organs the viruses
 

00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:50.299
infect many different organs the viruses
can enter the blood directly through

00:32:50.299 --> 00:32:50.309
can enter the blood directly through
 

00:32:50.309 --> 00:32:54.019
can enter the blood directly through
capillaries or so if a blood if a virus

00:32:54.019 --> 00:32:54.029
capillaries or so if a blood if a virus
 

00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:57.529
capillaries or so if a blood if a virus
gets beyond the basement membrane it's

00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539
gets beyond the basement membrane it's
 

00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:59.419
gets beyond the basement membrane it's
now in the subject a filial tissues it

00:32:59.419 --> 00:32:59.429
now in the subject a filial tissues it
 

00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:02.089
now in the subject a filial tissues it
can directly enter capillaries could be

00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:02.099
can directly enter capillaries could be
 

00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:03.979
can directly enter capillaries could be
introduced then into them by vector

00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:03.989
introduced then into them by vector
 

00:33:03.989 --> 00:33:04.610
introduced then into them by vector
bites of

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620
bites of
 

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.620
bites of
and then can get in the blood and spread

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:06.630
and then can get in the blood and spread
 

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.200
and then can get in the blood and spread
everywhere but also virus in these sub

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.210
everywhere but also virus in these sub
 

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.299
everywhere but also virus in these sub
epithelial tissues can be taken up by

00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:11.309
epithelial tissues can be taken up by
 

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:14.180
epithelial tissues can be taken up by
lymphatic capillaries and that brings

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.190
lymphatic capillaries and that brings
 

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.040
lymphatic capillaries and that brings
them to lymph nodes and eventually of

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.050
them to lymph nodes and eventually of
 

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.510
them to lymph nodes and eventually of
course the lymph system joins with the

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:17.520
course the lymph system joins with the
 

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.520
course the lymph system joins with the
blood and so the virus will eventually

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:19.530
blood and so the virus will eventually
 

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.260
blood and so the virus will eventually
reach the blood by this route lymph

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:21.270
reach the blood by this route lymph
 

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.820
reach the blood by this route lymph
capillaries tend to be more permeable

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:22.830
capillaries tend to be more permeable
 

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.180
capillaries tend to be more permeable
than circulatory circulatory capillaries

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:26.190
than circulatory circulatory capillaries
 

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.310
than circulatory circulatory capillaries
so it's a very good way for viruses to

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320
so it's a very good way for viruses to
 

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.080
so it's a very good way for viruses to
get into the circulation from the sub

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.090
get into the circulation from the sub
 

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.850
get into the circulation from the sub
epithelial tissues so that's

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860
epithelial tissues so that's
 

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.090
epithelial tissues so that's
hematogenous spread when you have virus

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100
hematogenous spread when you have virus
 

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.280
hematogenous spread when you have virus
in the blood it is called very Mia and

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.290
in the blood it is called very Mia and
 

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.270
in the blood it is called very Mia and
this is a graph showing a couple of

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:44.280
this is a graph showing a couple of
 

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.520
this is a graph showing a couple of
different kinds of viremia here we have

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:46.530
different kinds of viremia here we have
 

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.880
different kinds of viremia here we have
infected an animal with a virus and at

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:49.890
infected an animal with a virus and at
 

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.730
infected an animal with a virus and at
different times after infection we are

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740
different times after infection we are
 

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.480
different times after infection we are
measuring the virus in the blood so you

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:56.490
measuring the virus in the blood so you
 

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.590
measuring the virus in the blood so you
could just take the blood and do a

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600
could just take the blood and do a
 

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.540
could just take the blood and do a
plaque assay for if the virus forms

00:33:59.540 --> 00:33:59.550
plaque assay for if the virus forms
 

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.060
plaque assay for if the virus forms
black or do something else so here after

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.070
black or do something else so here after
 

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.370
black or do something else so here after
you inoculate the animal you see there's

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380
you inoculate the animal you see there's
 

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.230
you inoculate the animal you see there's
a lot of virus in the blood right away

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240
a lot of virus in the blood right away
 

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.330
a lot of virus in the blood right away
that's what you put in that's what

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:08.340
that's what you put in that's what
 

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.129
that's what you put in that's what
that's the virus you inject it into the

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139
that's the virus you inject it into the
 

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.740
that's the virus you inject it into the
animal we call that a passive viremia

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:12.750
animal we call that a passive viremia
 

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.470
animal we call that a passive viremia
because you get it by injecting virus

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480
because you get it by injecting virus
 

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.530
because you get it by injecting virus
into the animal those titers then go

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540
into the animal those titers then go
 

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.690
into the animal those titers then go
down and after a couple of days you get

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700
down and after a couple of days you get
 

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.970
down and after a couple of days you get
another rise in virus titer and this is

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980
another rise in virus titer and this is
 

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.639
another rise in virus titer and this is
from virus replication somewhere in the

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:25.649
from virus replication somewhere in the
 

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:27.169
from virus replication somewhere in the
animal we don't know where in this

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179
animal we don't know where in this
 

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.850
animal we don't know where in this
particular experiment we call it a

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:28.860
particular experiment we call it a
 

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.190
particular experiment we call it a
primary very Mia because it is the

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200
primary very Mia because it is the
 

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.649
primary very Mia because it is the
result of multiplication of the inoculum

00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659
result of multiplication of the inoculum
 

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:36.230
result of multiplication of the inoculum
somewhere and this is a very typical

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240
somewhere and this is a very typical
 

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.540
somewhere and this is a very typical
pattern of virus infections that are

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:38.550
pattern of virus infections that are
 

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.550
pattern of virus infections that are
spread by the blood you then have a

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560
spread by the blood you then have a
 

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.560
spread by the blood you then have a
secondary viremia so the virus is

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:42.570
secondary viremia so the virus is
 

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.860
secondary viremia so the virus is
produced initially by this primary

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:44.870
produced initially by this primary
 

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.669
produced initially by this primary
multiplication they spread to other

00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679
multiplication they spread to other
 

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.669
multiplication they spread to other
tissues and then they molt they seed

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679
tissues and then they molt they seed
 

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.500
tissues and then they molt they seed
those tissues and multiply again in

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:51.510
those tissues and multiply again in
 

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.450
those tissues and multiply again in
those and then you have a larger burst

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460
those and then you have a larger burst
 

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.149
those and then you have a larger burst
of secondary viremia

00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159
of secondary viremia
 

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.770
of secondary viremia
very typical pattern measles virus for

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780
very typical pattern measles virus for
 

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.660
very typical pattern measles virus for
example does this and many other viruses

00:34:59.660 --> 00:34:59.670
example does this and many other viruses
 

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.600
example does this and many other viruses
as well so primary is the virus released

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:02.610
as well so primary is the virus released
 

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.920
as well so primary is the virus released
into the blood after the initial

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:03.930
into the blood after the initial
 

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.080
into the blood after the initial
replication at the site of entry the

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.090
replication at the site of entry the
 

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.090
replication at the site of entry the
secondary is produced by disseminated

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:08.100
secondary is produced by disseminated
 

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.970
secondary is produced by disseminated
infections we diagnose virus infections

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980
infections we diagnose virus infections
 

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.370
infections we diagnose virus infections
many virus infections by the presence of

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380
many virus infections by the presence of
 

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.240
many virus infections by the presence of
virus in the blood

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:14.250
virus in the blood
 

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.610
virus in the blood
we don't usually measure virus anymore

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:17.620
we don't usually measure virus anymore
 

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.510
we don't usually measure virus anymore
we either do antigen tests or PCR type

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520
we either do antigen tests or PCR type
 

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.730
we either do antigen tests or PCR type
assays but we're looking for virus in

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:23.740
assays but we're looking for virus in
 

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.310
assays but we're looking for virus in
the blood and of course this has a

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320
the blood and of course this has a
 

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.580
the blood and of course this has a
practical consequence that if our blood

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:29.590
practical consequence that if our blood
 

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.920
practical consequence that if our blood
supply of course is donated blood we

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:31.930
supply of course is donated blood we
 

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.510
supply of course is donated blood we
haven't figured out yet how to make

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520
haven't figured out yet how to make
 

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.970
haven't figured out yet how to make
synthetic blood so we have to get people

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:35.980
synthetic blood so we have to get people
 

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.530
synthetic blood so we have to get people
to donate blood and they could have a

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:37.540
to donate blood and they could have a
 

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.600
to donate blood and they could have a
virus infection of some sort so we do

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:39.610
virus infection of some sort so we do
 

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.840
virus infection of some sort so we do
screen for a number of viruses in the

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:42.850
screen for a number of viruses in the
 

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.270
screen for a number of viruses in the
blood supply including HIV of course and

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280
blood supply including HIV of course and
 

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.600
blood supply including HIV of course and
htlv and the old of hepatitis virus is a

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:48.610
htlv and the old of hepatitis virus is a
 

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:55.140
htlv and the old of hepatitis virus is a

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.150
b c d e and probably G but I'm not sure
 

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.750
b c d e and probably G but I'm not sure
okay so we have to get rid of these

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760
okay so we have to get rid of these
 

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.330
okay so we have to get rid of these
viruses otherwise people would get sick

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:00.340
viruses otherwise people would get sick
 

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.770
viruses otherwise people would get sick
but we don't screen the blood for all

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:01.780
but we don't screen the blood for all
 

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.930
but we don't screen the blood for all
viruses there are viruses in the blood

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:03.940
viruses there are viruses in the blood
 

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.380
viruses there are viruses in the blood
that we don't pay attention to because

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.390
that we don't pay attention to because
 

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.790
that we don't pay attention to because
we're not sure they're a problem and

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800
we're not sure they're a problem and
 

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.180
we're not sure they're a problem and
rather than get everyone annoyed or

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:12.190
rather than get everyone annoyed or
 

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.370
rather than get everyone annoyed or

there now here's the pathogenesis of a

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280
there now here's the pathogenesis of a
 

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.550
there now here's the pathogenesis of a
mouse infection which was done by Frank

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560
mouse infection which was done by Frank
 

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.070
mouse infection which was done by Frank
Fenner who just died a couple of months

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.080
Fenner who just died a couple of months
 

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.000
Fenner who just died a couple of months
ago and he was the first to show how

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.010
ago and he was the first to show how
 

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.070

these disseminated viral infections

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:29.080
these disseminated viral infections
 

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.680
these disseminated viral infections
developed and he used a mouse model of

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:31.690
developed and he used a mouse model of
 

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.380
developed and he used a mouse model of
smallpox called Mouse pox and he showed

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.390
smallpox called Mouse pox and he showed
 

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.110
smallpox called Mouse pox and he showed
you inoculate a virus locally and it

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:37.120
you inoculate a virus locally and it
 

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120
you inoculate a virus locally and it
does a primary and a secondary viremia

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.130
does a primary and a secondary viremia
 

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.480
does a primary and a secondary viremia
and you get seeding of target organs so

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:42.490
and you get seeding of target organs so
 

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.430
and you get seeding of target organs so
here you inoculate the mouse in the foot

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440
here you inoculate the mouse in the foot
 

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.570
here you inoculate the mouse in the foot
pad initially here's the virus going and

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:48.580
pad initially here's the virus going and
 

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.050
pad initially here's the virus going and
the foot pad initially multiplies in the

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060
the foot pad initially multiplies in the
 

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.700
the foot pad initially multiplies in the
epithelial cells just below where you

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:53.710
epithelial cells just below where you
 

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.400
epithelial cells just below where you
have inoculated it gets below the

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.410
have inoculated it gets below the
 

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.900
have inoculated it gets below the
basement membrane look and it's

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:57.910
basement membrane look and it's
 

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.280
basement membrane look and it's
spreading through the regional lymph

00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.290
spreading through the regional lymph
 

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.020
spreading through the regional lymph
nodes into the blood so all those things

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.030
nodes into the blood so all those things
 

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.320
nodes into the blood so all those things
we talked about Fred Frank Fenner was

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:03.330
we talked about Fred Frank Fenner was
 

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.700
we talked about Fred Frank Fenner was
essential for us understanding all of

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:05.710
essential for us understanding all of
 

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.700
essential for us understanding all of
those steps so the mouse box is gone by

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:08.710
those steps so the mouse box is gone by
 

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.760
those steps so the mouse box is gone by
day 2 into the blood and that brings it

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:11.770
day 2 into the blood and that brings it
 

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.370
day 2 into the blood and that brings it
to the spleen and to the liver and the

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:14.380
to the spleen and to the liver and the
 

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.100
to the spleen and to the liver and the
virus multiplies there of course the

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.110
virus multiplies there of course the
 

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.830
virus multiplies there of course the
blood stream virus that I'm showing here

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:19.840
blood stream virus that I'm showing here
 

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.420
blood stream virus that I'm showing here
is the primary very Mia because it's

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:21.430
is the primary very Mia because it's
 

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.760
is the primary very Mia because it's
multiplied in the skin initially then it

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:23.770
multiplied in the skin initially then it
 

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.830
multiplied in the skin initially then it
multiplies in the spleen and liver and

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:25.840
multiplies in the spleen and liver and
 

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.690
multiplies in the spleen and liver and
you get a secondary viremia as virus

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:27.700
you get a secondary viremia as virus
 

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.600
you get a secondary viremia as virus
comes out of those organs and then the

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:30.610
comes out of those organs and then the
 

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.500
comes out of those organs and then the
virus goes

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:31.510
virus goes
 

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.960
virus goes
to the skin so from a footpad

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:33.970
to the skin so from a footpad
 

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.480
to the skin so from a footpad
inoculation it is gone very meek to the

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.490
inoculation it is gone very meek to the
 

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.910
inoculation it is gone very meek to the
spleen and liver causing problems there

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920
spleen and liver causing problems there
 

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.770
spleen and liver causing problems there
it's killing it's causing necrosis of

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:40.780
it's killing it's causing necrosis of
 

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.720
it's killing it's causing necrosis of
those organs and then it gets to the

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:42.730
those organs and then it gets to the
 

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.830
those organs and then it gets to the
skin and that gives you these rash we

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:46.840
skin and that gives you these rash we
 

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.680
skin and that gives you these rash we
early rashes and late severe rashes

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:49.690
early rashes and late severe rashes
 

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.260
early rashes and late severe rashes
which are typical of Mouse pox so that

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:52.270
which are typical of Mouse pox so that
 

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.020
which are typical of Mouse pox so that
that virus spread from the foot pad to

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.030
that virus spread from the foot pad to
 

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.720
that virus spread from the foot pad to
the skin via these roots so a typical

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:57.730
the skin via these roots so a typical
 

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:00.540
the skin via these roots so a typical
course of infection measles is very

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:00.550
course of infection measles is very
 

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.340
course of infection measles is very
similar you inhale measles its

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:02.350
similar you inhale measles its
 

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.770
similar you inhale measles its
respiratory transmitted gets into your

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:04.780
respiratory transmitted gets into your
 

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.600
respiratory transmitted gets into your
bloodstream from the respiratory tract

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:06.610
bloodstream from the respiratory tract
 

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:10.320
bloodstream from the respiratory tract
and spreads by a via primary and

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:10.330
and spreads by a via primary and
 

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.150
and spreads by a via primary and
secondary viremia and eventually you get

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160
secondary viremia and eventually you get
 

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.270
secondary viremia and eventually you get
a rash all from inhaling this virus so

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280
a rash all from inhaling this virus so
 

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.950
a rash all from inhaling this virus so
these are some viruses that cause rashes

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960
these are some viruses that cause rashes
 

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.600
these are some viruses that cause rashes
in people of course smallpox was the big

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:21.610
in people of course smallpox was the big
 

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.790
in people of course smallpox was the big
rash virus infection but we don't have

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800
rash virus infection but we don't have
 

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.010
rash virus infection but we don't have
smallpox anymore we have eradicated it

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.020
smallpox anymore we have eradicated it
 

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.320
smallpox anymore we have eradicated it
the only virus infection that we've ever

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:28.330
the only virus infection that we've ever
 

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.630
the only virus infection that we've ever
eradicated but we still have Coxsackie

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640
eradicated but we still have Coxsackie
 

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.630

neuro invasiveness so it's not easy to

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:19.850
neuro invasiveness so it's not easy to
 

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.360
neuro invasiveness so it's not easy to
get in from peripheral sites but once

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:22.370
get in from peripheral sites but once
 

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.450

very--it's of low newer virulence so the

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.170
very--it's of low newer virulence so the
 

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.570

at all quite interesting and finally we

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160
at all quite interesting and finally we
 

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.559
at all quite interesting and finally we
have rabies which is the worst calm

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:11.569
have rabies which is the worst calm
 

00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:14.109
have rabies which is the worst calm
in highly neuro invasive and highly

00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119
in highly neuro invasive and highly
 

00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:16.509
in highly neuro invasive and highly

00:44:24.469 --> 00:44:25.900
100% of the time and you're dead there
is no there are very few people who have

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:25.910
is no there are very few people who have
 

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.959
is no there are very few people who have
survived rabies infection without being

00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:28.969

so we are spreading by the blood we are

00:44:35.049 --> 00:44:35.059
so we are spreading by the blood we are
 

00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:36.880
so we are spreading by the blood we are
spreading by nerves now we have to get

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:36.890
spreading by nerves now we have to get
 

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.729
spreading by nerves now we have to get
into tissues to cause infection of

00:44:39.729 --> 00:44:39.739
into tissues to cause infection of
 

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:42.430
into tissues to cause infection of
tissues for example mouse pox in fact

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440
tissues for example mouse pox in fact
 

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.309

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:46.839
the deliver and the spleen polio
infecting other tissues how does the

00:44:46.839 --> 00:44:46.849
infecting other tissues how does the
 

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:49.390
infecting other tissues how does the
virus get from the blood or from the

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400
virus get from the blood or from the
 

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.819
virus get from the blood or from the
nerves into a tissue in order to

00:44:51.819 --> 00:44:51.829
nerves into a tissue in order to
 

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:54.430
nerves into a tissue in order to
multiply so here we're talking about

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440
multiply so here we're talking about
 

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.529
multiply so here we're talking about
tissue innovation and this is large in

00:44:56.529 --> 00:44:56.539
tissue innovation and this is large in
 

00:44:56.539 --> 00:44:59.380
tissue innovation and this is large in
largely determined by the structure of

00:44:59.380 --> 00:44:59.390
largely determined by the structure of
 

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.719
largely determined by the structure of
the blood vessels that are carrying the

00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:01.729
the blood vessels that are carrying the
 

00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:03.279
the blood vessels that are carrying the
virus so here we have three different

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:03.289
virus so here we have three different
 

00:45:03.289 --> 00:45:07.239
virus so here we have three different
configurations of these structures here

00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:07.249
configurations of these structures here
 

00:45:07.249 --> 00:45:10.660
configurations of these structures here
we have an example where we have the

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:10.670
we have an example where we have the
 

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.069
we have an example where we have the
blood vessel shown here

00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079
blood vessel shown here
 

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:14.549
blood vessel shown here
you know capillaries are formed by

00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559
you know capillaries are formed by
 

00:45:14.559 --> 00:45:16.449
you know capillaries are formed by
endothelial cells and if they're very

00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:16.459
endothelial cells and if they're very
 

00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:19.120
endothelial cells and if they're very
tightly joined things can't get through

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:19.130
tightly joined things can't get through
 

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.829
tightly joined things can't get through
them very easily so here's the nucleus

00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839
them very easily so here's the nucleus
 

00:45:20.839 --> 00:45:23.079
them very easily so here's the nucleus
of this endothelial cell so it's very

00:45:23.079 --> 00:45:23.089
of this endothelial cell so it's very
 

00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:24.519
of this endothelial cell so it's very
tightly joined plus there's a basement

00:45:24.519 --> 00:45:24.529
tightly joined plus there's a basement
 

00:45:24.529 --> 00:45:28.150
tightly joined plus there's a basement
membrane around it so here the virus has

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160
membrane around it so here the virus has
 

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.009
membrane around it so here the virus has
a lot of trouble getting across and this

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:30.019
a lot of trouble getting across and this
 

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:32.380
a lot of trouble getting across and this
is typical in the CNS connective tissue

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:32.390
is typical in the CNS connective tissue
 

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.079
is typical in the CNS connective tissue
skeletal and cardiac muscle very

00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:35.089
skeletal and cardiac muscle very
 

00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:36.910
skeletal and cardiac muscle very
difficult for viruses to cross the

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920
difficult for viruses to cross the
 

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.459
difficult for viruses to cross the
capillaries in those tissue we have

00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:39.469
capillaries in those tissue we have
 

00:45:39.469 --> 00:45:41.859
capillaries in those tissue we have
another configuration here where there

00:45:41.859 --> 00:45:41.869
another configuration here where there
 

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:44.650
another configuration here where there
are pores between the endothelial cells

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:44.660
are pores between the endothelial cells
 

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.449
are pores between the endothelial cells
so that lets virus through there is

00:45:46.449 --> 00:45:46.459
so that lets virus through there is
 

00:45:46.459 --> 00:45:48.339
so that lets virus through there is
still a basement membrane but this is a

00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:48.349
still a basement membrane but this is a
 

00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:49.989
still a basement membrane but this is a
little more permeable you find this in

00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:49.999
little more permeable you find this in
 

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:52.779
little more permeable you find this in
the kidney pancreas ileum and the colon

00:45:52.779 --> 00:45:52.789
the kidney pancreas ileum and the colon
 

00:45:52.789 --> 00:45:55.779
the kidney pancreas ileum and the colon
and then in some tissues the blood

00:45:55.779 --> 00:45:55.789
and then in some tissues the blood
 

00:45:55.789 --> 00:45:57.999
and then in some tissues the blood
vessel is not really a blood vessel it's

00:45:57.999 --> 00:45:58.009
vessel is not really a blood vessel it's
 

00:45:58.009 --> 00:46:00.249
vessel is not really a blood vessel it's
just a couple of cells sitting on the

00:46:00.249 --> 00:46:00.259
just a couple of cells sitting on the
 

00:46:00.259 --> 00:46:02.170
just a couple of cells sitting on the
walls of the tissue making what we call

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.180
walls of the tissue making what we call
 

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.269
walls of the tissue making what we call
a sinusoidal and this is there's no

00:46:04.269 --> 00:46:04.279
a sinusoidal and this is there's no
 

00:46:04.279 --> 00:46:07.390
a sinusoidal and this is there's no
basement membrane the endothelial cells

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400
basement membrane the endothelial cells
 

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.920
basement membrane the endothelial cells
are not even joined so it's very easy

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:08.930
are not even joined so it's very easy
 

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.229
are not even joined so it's very easy
for viruses to get through so that's

00:46:11.229 --> 00:46:11.239
for viruses to get through so that's
 

00:46:11.239 --> 00:46:13.120
for viruses to get through so that's
typical of liver that's why it's very

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:13.130
typical of liver that's why it's very
 

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.849
typical of liver that's why it's very
easy for viruses to get into your liver

00:46:15.849 --> 00:46:15.859
easy for viruses to get into your liver
 

00:46:15.859 --> 00:46:19.539
easy for viruses to get into your liver
so this is a very important determinant

00:46:19.539 --> 00:46:19.549
so this is a very important determinant
 

00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:23.439
so this is a very important determinant
of how viruses can get into various

00:46:23.439 --> 00:46:23.449
of how viruses can get into various
 

00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:25.300
of how viruses can get into various
tissues in order to multiply here

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.310
tissues in order to multiply here
 

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.630
tissues in order to multiply here
just an illustration of the liver here's

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640
just an illustration of the liver here's
 

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.210
just an illustration of the liver here's
a sinusoid it's really just a passage

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:31.220
a sinusoid it's really just a passage
 

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.870
a sinusoid it's really just a passage
through the liver so the the cells

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880
through the liver so the the cells
 

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.090
through the liver so the the cells
hepatocyte s-- form this passage and

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:37.100
hepatocyte s-- form this passage and
 

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.640
hepatocyte s-- form this passage and
then there may be cells like here we're

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:39.650
then there may be cells like here we're
 

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.860
then there may be cells like here we're
showing cup for cells lining this

showing cup for cells lining this
 

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:43.720
showing cup for cells lining this
passage so viruses that pass through

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:43.730
passage so viruses that pass through
 

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:45.820

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:52.420
sites where they can multiply and spread
now not every virus multiplies in the

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:52.430
now not every virus multiplies in the
 

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.030
now not every virus multiplies in the
liver fortunately only a few can do that

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040
liver fortunately only a few can do that
 

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.680

it's very easy to get into this organ

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:58.690
it's very easy to get into this organ
 

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.810
it's very easy to get into this organ
the brain is a tough site to get into

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:01.820
the brain is a tough site to get into
 

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.880
the brain is a tough site to get into
because it has those very tight

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:03.890
because it has those very tight
 

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:05.770
because it has those very tight
endothelial cells and has the basement

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:05.780
endothelial cells and has the basement
 

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.920

so there is a functionally described

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:11.740
so there is a functionally described
 

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.190
so there is a functionally described
so-called blood-brain barrier and this

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200
so-called blood-brain barrier and this
 

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.960
so-called blood-brain barrier and this
is what makes it difficult for certain

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:16.970
is what makes it difficult for certain
 

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.000
is what makes it difficult for certain
drugs to get from the blood into the

brain because of these tight junctions
 

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.830
brain because of these tight junctions
also makes it difficult for viruses to

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:23.840
also makes it difficult for viruses to
 

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.680
also makes it difficult for viruses to
get through but some viruses can do it

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:26.690
get through but some viruses can do it
 

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.110
get through but some viruses can do it
not a lot of viruses can get into the

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.120
not a lot of viruses can get into the
 

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.870
not a lot of viruses can get into the
brain or the CNS but there are a few

that do and those those routes of entry

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:34.790
that do and those those routes of entry
 

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:39.460
that do and those those routes of entry
are illustrated here you can have so

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:39.470
are illustrated here you can have so
 

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.440
are illustrated here you can have so
here is a capillary lumen so the virus

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.450
here is a capillary lumen so the virus
 

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.480
here is a capillary lumen so the virus
is trying to get from the lumen into the

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:43.490
is trying to get from the lumen into the
 

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.660

virus is actually replicated in the
 

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.830
virus is actually replicated in the
endothelial cells but that they both

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:50.840
endothelial cells but that they both
 

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.020

they bind to receptors multiply and get

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.030
they bind to receptors multiply and get
 

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.780
they bind to receptors multiply and get
through that way some can be taken up by

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:55.790
through that way some can be taken up by
 

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.360
through that way some can be taken up by
trans cytosis without multiplying so

00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:58.370
trans cytosis without multiplying so
 

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.250
trans cytosis without multiplying so
they're taking up into the and acidic

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:00.260
they're taking up into the and acidic
 

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.990
they're taking up into the and acidic
system from one side and put on the

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000
system from one side and put on the
 

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.080
system from one side and put on the
other and sometimes if these viruses are

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.090
other and sometimes if these viruses are
 

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.330
other and sometimes if these viruses are
present in lymphocytes or monocytes

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:07.340
present in lymphocytes or monocytes
 

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.950

these cells are very good at squeezing

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960
these cells are very good at squeezing
 

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.880
these cells are very good at squeezing
through the capillary endothelial cells

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:12.890
through the capillary endothelial cells
 

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.450
through the capillary endothelial cells
and so they bring the viruses with them

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:15.460
and so they bring the viruses with them
 

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.040
and so they bring the viruses with them
so those cells have adapted to squeeze

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.050
so those cells have adapted to squeeze
 

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.320
so those cells have adapted to squeeze
through here and so they are like Trojan

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:20.330
through here and so they are like Trojan
 

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:24.100

picture which summarizes all the ways

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:29.120
picture which summarizes all the ways
 

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:33.220
picture which summarizes all the ways
that viruses can get into the CNS so we

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:33.230
that viruses can get into the CNS so we
 

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.610
that viruses can get into the CNS so we
have nerve neural spread right which can

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:36.620
have nerve neural spread right which can
 

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.440
have nerve neural spread right which can
come from peripheral nerves

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:38.450
come from peripheral nerves
 

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.660
come from peripheral nerves
from the spinal cord from peripheral

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:40.670
from the spinal cord from peripheral
 

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.630
from the spinal cord from peripheral
muscles so there are a variety of neural

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640
muscles so there are a variety of neural
 

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.030
muscles so there are a variety of neural
roots of spread of virus into the CNS

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040
roots of spread of virus into the CNS
 

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.500
roots of spread of virus into the CNS
and of course once the virus comes in

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:47.510
and of course once the virus comes in
 

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:49.210
and of course once the virus comes in
that way it's already in the tissue so

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:49.220
that way it's already in the tissue so
 

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.720
that way it's already in the tissue so
it's real it's there into the paren coma

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:52.730
it's real it's there into the paren coma
 

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.150
it's real it's there into the paren coma
and here are some examples of various

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160
and here are some examples of various
 

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.849
and here are some examples of various
entry routes from blood vessels so there

00:48:57.849 --> 00:48:57.859
entry routes from blood vessels so there
 

00:48:57.859 --> 00:48:59.740
entry routes from blood vessels so there
are many ngo blood vessels of course

00:48:59.740 --> 00:48:59.750
are many ngo blood vessels of course
 

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.160
are many ngo blood vessels of course
so viruses can cross those blood vessels

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.170
so viruses can cross those blood vessels
 

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.870
so viruses can cross those blood vessels
by the mechanisms we just talked about

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880
by the mechanisms we just talked about
 

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.089
by the mechanisms we just talked about
and once they're there they're in the

00:49:07.089 --> 00:49:07.099
and once they're there they're in the
 

00:49:07.099 --> 00:49:10.349
and once they're there they're in the
CSF they can spread to many other places

00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359
CSF they can spread to many other places
 

00:49:10.359 --> 00:49:15.220
CSF they can spread to many other places
viruses can also enter the CSF and the

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:15.230
viruses can also enter the CSF and the
 

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.650
viruses can also enter the CSF and the
choroid plexus so that is an organ here

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:17.660
choroid plexus so that is an organ here
 

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.079
choroid plexus so that is an organ here
that is responsible for producing the

00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:20.089
that is responsible for producing the
 

00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:23.200
that is responsible for producing the
cerebrospinal fluid the choroid plexus

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.210
cerebrospinal fluid the choroid plexus
 

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.200
cerebrospinal fluid the choroid plexus
is lined with what are called ependymal

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:26.210
is lined with what are called ependymal
 

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.960
is lined with what are called ependymal
cells envira some viruses replicate in

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:28.970
cells envira some viruses replicate in
 

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.880
cells envira some viruses replicate in
these ependymal cells and pass through

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:30.890
these ependymal cells and pass through
 

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.069
these ependymal cells and pass through
into the CSF and again once you're there

00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079
into the CSF and again once you're there
 

00:49:33.079 --> 00:49:35.620
into the CSF and again once you're there
you can spread everywhere and finally

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:35.630
you can spread everywhere and finally
 

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.289
you can spread everywhere and finally
there are cerebral blood vessels through

00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:38.299
there are cerebral blood vessels through
 

00:49:38.299 --> 00:49:40.480
there are cerebral blood vessels through
which virus can pass and enter the brain

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:40.490
which virus can pass and enter the brain
 

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:43.930
which virus can pass and enter the brain
parenchyma and so for example the virus

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:43.940
parenchyma and so for example the virus
 

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.940
parenchyma and so for example the virus
could then replicate in a neuron or an

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:45.950
could then replicate in a neuron or an
 

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.940
could then replicate in a neuron or an
astrocyte or glial cell so this is a

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:48.950
astrocyte or glial cell so this is a
 

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.599
astrocyte or glial cell so this is a
rare event virus entering the CNS but it

00:49:52.599 --> 00:49:52.609
rare event virus entering the CNS but it
 

00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:54.579
rare event virus entering the CNS but it
can be done and then once the viruses

00:49:54.579 --> 00:49:54.589
can be done and then once the viruses
 

00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:55.960
can be done and then once the viruses
are in there it's big problems because

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:55.970
are in there it's big problems because
 

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.970
are in there it's big problems because
the CNS isn't particularly good at

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:57.980
the CNS isn't particularly good at
 

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.520
the CNS isn't particularly good at
having a strong immune response to

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:00.530
having a strong immune response to
 

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.770
having a strong immune response to
prevent infection it's almost as if it

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:02.780
prevent infection it's almost as if it
 

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.460
prevent infection it's almost as if it
hasn't evolved to prevent infection very

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:06.470
hasn't evolved to prevent infection very
 

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.200
hasn't evolved to prevent infection very
well because it assumes that has put up

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:08.210
well because it assumes that has put up
 

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.069
well because it assumes that has put up
a physical barrier that would prevent it

00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079
a physical barrier that would prevent it
 

00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:14.710
a physical barrier that would prevent it
now an important concept in pathogenesis

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720
now an important concept in pathogenesis
 

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.220
now an important concept in pathogenesis
is tissue tropism and this simply means

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:18.230
is tissue tropism and this simply means
 

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:21.010
is tissue tropism and this simply means
the the spectrum of tissues that are

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:21.020
the the spectrum of tissues that are
 

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.549
the the spectrum of tissues that are
infected by a given virus so we talked

00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559
infected by a given virus so we talked
 

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:27.730
infected by a given virus so we talked
about enteric viruses enter atrophic

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:27.740
about enteric viruses enter atrophic
 

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.890
about enteric viruses enter atrophic
viruses we talked about neurotropic

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:29.900
viruses we talked about neurotropic
 

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.140
viruses we talked about neurotropic
viruses replicating in the nervous

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:32.150
viruses replicating in the nervous
 

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.720
viruses replicating in the nervous
system and not elsewhere have Patou

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:34.730
system and not elsewhere have Patou
 

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.180
system and not elsewhere have Patou
tropic viruses for example these viruses

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:37.190
tropic viruses for example these viruses
 

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.520
tropic viruses for example these viruses
have a particular pattern of replication

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:39.530
have a particular pattern of replication
 

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.740
have a particular pattern of replication
and that's what we call tropism so not

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:41.750
and that's what we call tropism so not
 

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.079
and that's what we call tropism so not
every virus replicates in every tissue

00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:44.089
every virus replicates in every tissue
 

00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:46.839
every virus replicates in every tissue
there's always a subset and we call that

00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:46.849
there's always a subset and we call that
 

00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:50.289
there's always a subset and we call that
the tropism of the virus so some viruses

00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:50.299
the tropism of the virus so some viruses
 

00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:52.210
the tropism of the virus so some viruses
have a limited tropism

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:52.220
have a limited tropism
 

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.970
have a limited tropism
and others are what we call pan tropic

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:54.980
and others are what we call pan tropic
 

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.099
and others are what we call pan tropic
they've IRA they replicate in many

00:50:57.099 --> 00:50:57.109
they've IRA they replicate in many
 

00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:59.980
they've IRA they replicate in many
organs and we would like to know what

00:50:59.980 --> 00:50:59.990
organs and we would like to know what
 

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.960
organs and we would like to know what
controls this what makes a virus

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:01.970
controls this what makes a virus
 

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.330
controls this what makes a virus
replicate in just one tissue and what

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:04.340
replicate in just one tissue and what
 

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.640

allows it to replicate in many because

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:06.650
allows it to replicate in many because
 

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:08.950
allows it to replicate in many because
if we can understand that maybe we can

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960
if we can understand that maybe we can
 

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.190
if we can understand that maybe we can
control the replication in various ways

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200
control the replication in various ways
 

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.339
control the replication in various ways
by intervening so what are the

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:15.349
by intervening so what are the
 

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:19.060
by intervening so what are the
determinants of tissue tropism well one

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:19.070
determinants of tissue tropism well one
 

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.460
determinants of tissue tropism well one
is susceptibility right the presence of

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:21.470
is susceptibility right the presence of
 

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.920
is susceptibility right the presence of
receptors if a tissue doesn't have a

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:23.930
receptors if a tissue doesn't have a
 

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.839
receptors if a tissue doesn't have a
receptor it's not going to be infected

00:51:25.839 --> 00:51:25.849
receptor it's not going to be infected
 

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.240
receptor it's not going to be infected
so that's a pretty simple one then

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:28.250
so that's a pretty simple one then
 

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.550
so that's a pretty simple one then
there's permittivity that is what

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:30.560
there's permittivity that is what
 

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.859
there's permittivity that is what
happens in the cell beyond the entry

00:51:32.859 --> 00:51:32.869
happens in the cell beyond the entry
 

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:34.780
happens in the cell beyond the entry
step well the proteins that the virus

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:34.790
step well the proteins that the virus
 

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.210
step well the proteins that the virus
needs to replicate intracellular gene

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:37.220
needs to replicate intracellular gene
 

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.400
needs to replicate intracellular gene
products if they're not present the cell

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:39.410

accessibility is also important the

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:43.970
accessibility is also important the
 

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.240
accessibility is also important the
virus has to be able to reach the cells

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:46.250
virus has to be able to reach the cells
 

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.370
virus has to be able to reach the cells
that are both permissive and susceptible

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:48.380
that are both permissive and susceptible
 

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.830
that are both permissive and susceptible
it made contact cells that are not and

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:50.840
it made contact cells that are not and
 

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:54.280
it made contact cells that are not and
that doesn't do it any good and the host

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:54.290
that doesn't do it any good and the host
 

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.579
that doesn't do it any good and the host
defenses so these all combined to

defenses so these all combined to
 

00:51:57.589 --> 00:52:00.190
defenses so these all combined to
determine tropism so physical and innate

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200
determine tropism so physical and innate
 

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.859

defenses at the site of infection will

00:52:02.859 --> 00:52:02.869
defenses at the site of infection will
 

00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:04.660
defenses at the site of infection will
determine whether the virus is able to

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:04.670
determine whether the virus is able to
 

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.060
determine whether the virus is able to
replicate there or not so even if you

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:07.070

have cells with receptors that are

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:08.690
have cells with receptors that are
 

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:10.570
have cells with receptors that are
permissive and can be accessed by the

H a is essential for attaching to host
 

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:25.290
H a is essential for attaching to host
cell receptors and then it has to

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:25.300
cell receptors and then it has to
 

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.910

catalyzed fusion if it's not cleave that
 

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.180
catalyzed fusion if it's not cleave that
won't do that because the n-terminal

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.190
won't do that because the n-terminal
 

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.329
won't do that because the n-terminal
fusion peptide will not be exposed

00:53:45.329 --> 00:53:45.339
fusion peptide will not be exposed
 

00:53:45.339 --> 00:53:47.799
fusion peptide will not be exposed
cleavage is an essential determinant of

00:53:47.799 --> 00:53:47.809
cleavage is an essential determinant of
 

00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:51.420
cleavage is an essential determinant of
flu tropism so here is a respiratory

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:51.430
flu tropism so here is a respiratory
 

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.760
flu tropism so here is a respiratory
epithelium which is producing influenza

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:54.770
epithelium which is producing influenza
 

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:58.000
epithelium which is producing influenza
virus and there is a cell in the

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:58.010
virus and there is a cell in the
 

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.390
virus and there is a cell in the
epithelium called a Klara cell that

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400
epithelium called a Klara cell that
 

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.510
epithelium called a Klara cell that
produces a protease which Cleaves the

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520
produces a protease which Cleaves the
 

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.880
produces a protease which Cleaves the
hemagglutinin of influenza virus this

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:06.890
hemagglutinin of influenza virus this
 

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:08.890
hemagglutinin of influenza virus this
protease is only made in the respiratory

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:08.900
protease is only made in the respiratory
 

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:12.160
protease is only made in the respiratory
tract so this virus that's produced is

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:12.170
tract so this virus that's produced is
 

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.559
tract so this virus that's produced is
cleave than it can infect other cells in

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:14.569
cleave than it can infect other cells in
 

00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:17.620
cleave than it can infect other cells in
the respiratory tract now let's say some

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:17.630
the respiratory tract now let's say some
 

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.539
the respiratory tract now let's say some
of these influenza viruses somehow get

00:54:19.539 --> 00:54:19.549
of these influenza viruses somehow get
 

00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:20.230
of these influenza viruses somehow get
to your liver

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240
to your liver
 

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.920
to your liver
there's no protease klara in your liver

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:23.930
there's no protease klara in your liver
 

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:26.109
there's no protease klara in your liver
so those viruses will infect the liver

00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119
so those viruses will infect the liver
 

00:54:26.119 --> 00:54:29.589
so those viruses will infect the liver
cell but then the virus is produced by

00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599
cell but then the virus is produced by
 

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:31.780
cell but then the virus is produced by
the liver cell won't have cleave DHA so

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:31.790
the liver cell won't have cleave DHA so
 

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.970
the liver cell won't have cleave DHA so
they can't infect any other liver cells

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:33.980
they can't infect any other liver cells
 

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.299
they can't infect any other liver cells
so that's why influenza is not a Patou

00:54:37.299 --> 00:54:37.309
so that's why influenza is not a Patou
 

00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:39.760
so that's why influenza is not a Patou
tropic because there's no protease this

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:39.770
tropic because there's no protease this
 

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.950
tropic because there's no protease this
is why the virus is restricted to the

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960
is why the virus is restricted to the
 

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.599
is why the virus is restricted to the
respiratory tract because there the

00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:43.609
respiratory tract because there the
 

00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:45.789
respiratory tract because there the
protease is produced so that's one

00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799
protease is produced so that's one
 

00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:48.579
protease is produced so that's one
example of how a protease can determine

00:54:48.579 --> 00:54:48.589
example of how a protease can determine
 

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:53.530
example of how a protease can determine
tropism now this is an even broader

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:53.540
tropism now this is an even broader
 

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.020
tropism now this is an even broader
application for influenza virus this

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:56.030
application for influenza virus this
 

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:59.710
application for influenza virus this

avian strains of influenza have a
sequence of multiple basic amino acids

00:55:07.089 --> 00:55:07.099

these in part are particularly virulent

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:46.849
these in part are particularly virulent
 

00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:50.739
these in part are particularly virulent
so the viruses can infect multiple

00:55:50.739 --> 00:55:50.749
so the viruses can infect multiple
 

00:55:50.749 --> 00:55:58.630
so the viruses can infect multiple

had been infected with a h5n1 avian
influenza virus so it was a little scary

00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359
influenza virus so it was a little scary
 

00:56:14.359 --> 00:56:16.450
influenza virus so it was a little scary
and these viruses were isolated in

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:16.460
and these viruses were isolated in
 

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.249
and these viruses were isolated in
sequenced and they they were found to

00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:18.259
sequenced and they they were found to
 

00:56:18.259 --> 00:56:21.220
sequenced and they they were found to
have this basic amino acid insertion at

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:21.230
have this basic amino acid insertion at
 

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:23.499
have this basic amino acid insertion at
the H a cleavage site these were very

00:56:23.499 --> 00:56:23.509
the H a cleavage site these were very
 

00:56:23.509 --> 00:56:25.420
the H a cleavage site these were very
sick people and the evidence was that

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:25.430
sick people and the evidence was that
 

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.249
sick people and the evidence was that
the virus had multiplied in multiple

00:56:27.249 --> 00:56:27.259
the virus had multiplied in multiple
 

00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:29.940
the virus had multiplied in multiple
organs so we think that was because this

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:29.950
organs so we think that was because this
 

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.979
organs so we think that was because this
cleavage site now could be activated in

00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:32.989
cleavage site now could be activated in
 

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:36.910
cleavage site now could be activated in
multiple organs as well interestingly

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920
multiple organs as well interestingly
 

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.009
multiple organs as well interestingly
the 1918 strain which killed millions

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.329
and millions of people does not have
these changes so this is not a pan

00:56:43.329 --> 00:56:43.339
these changes so this is not a pan
 

00:56:43.339 --> 00:56:45.729
these changes so this is not a pan
tropic strain this is just a highly

we'll come back to this later when we

00:56:49.809 --> 00:56:49.819
we'll come back to this later when we
 

00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:52.660
we'll come back to this later when we
talk more about influenza virus now

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:52.670
talk more about influenza virus now
 

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.430
talk more about influenza virus now
shedding of the virus is important

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440
shedding of the virus is important
 

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.380
shedding of the virus is important
because you can only transmit an

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:56.390
because you can only transmit an
 

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:57.489
because you can only transmit an
infection and maintain it in a

00:56:57.489 --> 00:56:57.499
infection and maintain it in a
 

00:56:57.499 --> 00:57:00.190
infection and maintain it in a
population if you effectively shed the

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200
population if you effectively shed the
 

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.069
population if you effectively shed the
virus and it can affect other people so

00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079
virus and it can affect other people so
 

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:04.779
virus and it can affect other people so
the virus has to be released from you

00:57:04.779 --> 00:57:04.789
the virus has to be released from you
 

00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:08.380
the virus has to be released from you
from the infected individual and that is

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:08.390
from the infected individual and that is
 

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:10.809
from the infected individual and that is
typically required for spread of the

00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:10.819
typically required for spread of the
 

00:57:10.819 --> 00:57:13.120
typically required for spread of the
virus in a population the exceptions of

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:13.130
virus in a population the exceptions of
 

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.950
virus in a population the exceptions of
course or viruses that spread in the

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960
course or viruses that spread in the
 

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.289
course or viruses that spread in the
germ line so endogenous retroviruses

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:17.299
germ line so endogenous retroviruses
 

00:57:17.299 --> 00:57:19.089
germ line so endogenous retroviruses
don't have an extracellular phase or

00:57:19.089 --> 00:57:19.099
don't have an extracellular phase or
 

00:57:19.099 --> 00:57:20.259
don't have an extracellular phase or
they don't have to because they're

00:57:20.259 --> 00:57:20.269
they don't have to because they're
 

00:57:20.269 --> 00:57:22.479
they don't have to because they're
passed from mother to offspring

00:57:22.479 --> 00:57:22.489
passed from mother to offspring
 

00:57:22.489 --> 00:57:25.690
passed from mother to offspring
parent to offspring via the germline so

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:25.700
parent to offspring via the germline so
 

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.180
parent to offspring via the germline so
there's no transmission virus is spread

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:28.190
there's no transmission virus is spread
 

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:29.680
there's no transmission virus is spread
in the blood supply same thing they're

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:29.690
in the blood supply same thing they're
 

00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.569
in the blood supply same thing they're
just injected into you so there's no

00:57:31.569 --> 00:57:31.579
just injected into you so there's no
 

00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:34.089
just injected into you so there's no
extra so there's no extra host phase if

00:57:34.089 --> 00:57:34.099
extra so there's no extra host phase if
 

00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:36.339
extra so there's no extra host phase if
but all other viruses have to spread and

00:57:36.339 --> 00:57:36.349
but all other viruses have to spread and
 

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:39.430
but all other viruses have to spread and
this shedding can be at the primary site

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440
this shedding can be at the primary site
 

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.259
this shedding can be at the primary site
of replication where the virus say first

00:57:41.259 --> 00:57:41.269
of replication where the virus say first
 

00:57:41.269 --> 00:57:43.569
of replication where the virus say first
goes into your lungs or it can be at

00:57:43.569 --> 00:57:43.579
goes into your lungs or it can be at
 

00:57:43.579 --> 00:57:45.460
goes into your lungs or it can be at
distal sites if you have lesions on your

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:45.470
distal sites if you have lesions on your
 

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:48.249
distal sites if you have lesions on your
skin which result after spread of the

00:57:48.249 --> 00:57:48.259
skin which result after spread of the
 

00:57:48.259 --> 00:57:50.859
skin which result after spread of the
virus from a respiratory infection that

00:57:50.859 --> 00:57:50.869
virus from a respiratory infection that
 

00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:54.309
virus from a respiratory infection that
can spread the infection as well and the

00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319
can spread the infection as well and the
 

00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:56.229
can spread the infection as well and the
number of particles of course is crucial

00:57:56.229 --> 00:57:56.239
number of particles of course is crucial
 

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:57.670
number of particles of course is crucial
for transmission you have to make a lot

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680
for transmission you have to make a lot
 

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:02.410
for transmission you have to make a lot
to transmit effectively respiratory

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:02.420
to transmit effectively respiratory

have said sneezing makes 20,000 droplets

00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:10.789
have said sneezing makes 20,000 droplets
 

00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:13.089
have said sneezing makes 20,000 droplets
so if you're making influenza virus each

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:13.099
so if you're making influenza virus each
 

00:58:13.099 --> 00:58:15.670
so if you're making influenza virus each
of those droplets is full of influenza

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680
of those droplets is full of influenza
 

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.219
of those droplets is full of influenza
virus and the big drop so people have

00:58:18.219 --> 00:58:18.229
virus and the big drop so people have
 

00:58:18.229 --> 00:58:20.319
virus and the big drop so people have
studied these droplets very seriously

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:20.329
studied these droplets very seriously
 

00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:22.539
studied these droplets very seriously
they measure their sizes of you when you

00:58:22.539 --> 00:58:22.549
they measure their sizes of you when you

go all the way down into your alveoli
and infect the lower tract and of course

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:47.690
and infect the lower tract and of course
 

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.839
and infect the lower tract and of course
also you can spread with respiratory

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:49.849
also you can spread with respiratory
 

00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:53.469
also you can spread with respiratory

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.140
retroviruses so these are all the ways
of transmission that we know about

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.150
of transmission that we know about
 

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:15.170
of transmission that we know about
typically the where you produce viruses

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180
typically the where you produce viruses
 

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.759
typically the where you produce viruses
of course and their stability is going

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:16.769
of course and their stability is going
 

01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:17.989
of course and their stability is going
to determine the route of transmission

01:03:17.989 --> 01:03:17.999
to determine the route of transmission
 

01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:20.299
to determine the route of transmission
so an interrogate replicates in the gut

01:03:20.299 --> 01:03:20.309
so an interrogate replicates in the gut
 

01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:22.519
so an interrogate replicates in the gut
obviously is going to be spread by fecal

01:03:22.519 --> 01:03:22.529
obviously is going to be spread by fecal
 

01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:25.609
obviously is going to be spread by fecal
oral contamination envelope viruses tend

01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619
oral contamination envelope viruses tend
 

01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:26.630
oral contamination envelope viruses tend
to be fragile

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640
to be fragile
 

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.809
to be fragile
so they are largely transmitted either

01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819
so they are largely transmitted either
 

01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:34.160
so they are largely transmitted either
by aerosols or by injection or organ

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:34.170
by aerosols or by injection or organ
 

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.359
by aerosols or by injection or organ
transplantation non-enveloped viruses

01:03:38.359 --> 01:03:38.369
transplantation non-enveloped viruses
 

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:40.819
transplantation non-enveloped viruses
are a lot more Hardy they can withstand

01:03:40.819 --> 01:03:40.829
are a lot more Hardy they can withstand
 

01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:42.829
are a lot more Hardy they can withstand
the alimentary tract high temperatures

01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839
the alimentary tract high temperatures
 

01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:46.220
the alimentary tract high temperatures
and these are often transmitted by also

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:46.230
and these are often transmitted by also
 

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.079
and these are often transmitted by also
respiratory routes fecal-oral routes

01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:48.089
respiratory routes fecal-oral routes
 

01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:50.059
respiratory routes fecal-oral routes
where the envelope viruses in general

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:50.069
where the envelope viruses in general
 

01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:54.170
where the envelope viruses in general
fail or fomites contaminated material so

01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180
fail or fomites contaminated material so
 

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.450
fail or fomites contaminated material so
the contaminated doorknob would be a Pho

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460
the contaminated doorknob would be a Pho
 

01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:01.009
the contaminated doorknob would be a Pho
mite and we also have some interesting

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:01.019
mite and we also have some interesting
 

01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:03.769
mite and we also have some interesting
terms when we talk about transmission of

01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:03.779
terms when we talk about transmission of
 

01:04:03.779 --> 01:04:06.019
terms when we talk about transmission of
virus infections actually all infections

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:06.029
virus infections actually all infections
 

01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:08.989
virus infections actually all infections
ATRA genic where the activity of a

01:04:08.989 --> 01:04:08.999
ATRA genic where the activity of a
 

01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:11.420
ATRA genic where the activity of a
healthcare worker leads to infection of

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:11.430
healthcare worker leads to infection of
 

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:15.140
healthcare worker leads to infection of
the patient and included in that is no

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:15.150
the patient and included in that is no
 

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.430
the patient and included in that is no
so

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440
so
 

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.800
so
kamil infection where and individuals

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:17.810
kamil infection where and individuals
 

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:20.170
kamil infection where and individuals
infected when you are in a hospital or a

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:20.180
infected when you are in a hospital or a
 

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.890

transmission is from parent to offspring

01:04:26.319 --> 01:04:26.329
transmission is from parent to offspring
 

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:29.640
transmission is from parent to offspring
so the transmission of viruses from

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:29.650
so the transmission of viruses from
 

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:32.680
so the transmission of viruses from
mother to offspring via the germline is

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:32.690
mother to offspring via the germline is
 

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:35.829
mother to offspring via the germline is
included in that and other for all other

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839
included in that and other for all other
 

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:38.290
included in that and other for all other
forms are horizontal transmission so if

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:38.300
forms are horizontal transmission so if
 

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.300
forms are horizontal transmission so if
you are bitten by a mosquito or you are

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:40.310
you are bitten by a mosquito or you are
 

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.970
you are bitten by a mosquito or you are
you pick up a virus from a doorknob this

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:42.980
you pick up a virus from a doorknob this
 

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.790
you pick up a virus from a doorknob this
is horizontal transmission vertical is

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:45.800
is horizontal transmission vertical is
 

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.700
is horizontal transmission vertical is
from parent to offspring

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:47.710
from parent to offspring
 

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:50.970
from parent to offspring
and finally as part of the germ line

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:50.980
and finally as part of the germ line
 

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.930
and finally as part of the germ line
such as pro viral DNA interestingly

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:54.940
such as pro viral DNA interestingly
 

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.900
such as pro viral DNA interestingly
geography and season off also have a

01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:58.910
geography and season off also have a
 

01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:02.410
geography and season off also have a
large role in regulating patterns of

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:02.420
large role in regulating patterns of
 

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.839
large role in regulating patterns of
infection and this is so often because

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:04.849
infection and this is so often because
 

01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:07.630
infection and this is so often because
the vector or the animal reservoir is

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640
the vector or the animal reservoir is
 

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.260
the vector or the animal reservoir is
geographically restricted in some way

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:10.270
geographically restricted in some way
 

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:14.890
geographically restricted in some way
and global travel has really made a big

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:14.900
and global travel has really made a big
 

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.740
and global travel has really made a big
impact on this before we had extensive

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:17.750
impact on this before we had extensive
 

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.920
impact on this before we had extensive
global travel the spread of viruses was

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:20.930
global travel the spread of viruses was
 

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:23.109
global travel the spread of viruses was
or the distribution I should say was far

01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119
or the distribution I should say was far
 

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.480
or the distribution I should say was far
more restricted than it is today with

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:25.490
more restricted than it is today with
 

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.579
more restricted than it is today with
airplane travel being incredibly

01:05:27.579 --> 01:05:27.589
airplane travel being incredibly
 

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:31.030
airplane travel being incredibly
accessible the spread of viruses has has

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:31.040
accessible the spread of viruses has has
 

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.500
accessible the spread of viruses has has
increased enormously we'll talk about

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:32.510
increased enormously we'll talk about
 

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:37.960
increased enormously we'll talk about
that in emerging virus infections and an

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:37.970
that in emerging virus infections and an
 

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:41.220
that in emerging virus infections and an
example of the effect of geography and

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:41.230
example of the effect of geography and
 

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:43.780
example of the effect of geography and
vector and its effect on the vector is

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:43.790
vector and its effect on the vector is
 

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:45.880
vector and its effect on the vector is
chikungunya virus how a vector can

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:45.890
chikungunya virus how a vector can
 

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:48.819
chikungunya virus how a vector can
affect the localization of viral

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:48.829
affect the localization of viral
 

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:52.150
affect the localization of viral
infection so chikungunya is a member of

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160
infection so chikungunya is a member of
 

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.809
infection so chikungunya is a member of
the toga virus family it is spread by a

01:05:55.809 --> 01:05:55.819
the toga virus family it is spread by a
 

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:58.809
the toga virus family it is spread by a
mosquito Aedes aegypti and when you are

01:05:58.809 --> 01:05:58.819
mosquito Aedes aegypti and when you are
 

01:05:58.819 --> 01:06:01.630
mosquito Aedes aegypti and when you are
infected with with this virus

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640
infected with with this virus
 

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.160
infected with with this virus
you get typically a rash and joint pains

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.170
you get typically a rash and joint pains
 

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.200
you get typically a rash and joint pains
it's prevalent it was originally

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:08.210
it's prevalent it was originally
 

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:10.210
it's prevalent it was originally
prevalent for many years in Asia and

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:10.220
prevalent for many years in Asia and
 

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.000
prevalent for many years in Asia and
Africa never found in Europe or the

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.010
Africa never found in Europe or the
 

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:16.480
Africa never found in Europe or the
United States until 2004 a series of

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:16.490
United States until 2004 a series of
 

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:19.990
United States until 2004 a series of
outbreaks spread from Kenya to India and

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000
outbreaks spread from Kenya to India and
 

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.630
outbreaks spread from Kenya to India and
then a few years later yeah there was an

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640
then a few years later yeah there was an
 

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.000
then a few years later yeah there was an
outbreak in Italy the first in Europe

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.010
outbreak in Italy the first in Europe
 

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:31.180
outbreak in Italy the first in Europe
the vector one that one of the vectors

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:31.190
the vector one that one of the vectors
 

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:34.599
the vector one that one of the vectors
for chikungunya is now another mosquito

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:34.609
for chikungunya is now another mosquito
 

01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:36.940
for chikungunya is now another mosquito
the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:36.950
the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes
 

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:41.049
the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes
albopictus so this is the distribution

01:06:41.049 --> 01:06:41.059
albopictus so this is the distribution
 

01:06:41.059 --> 01:06:43.930
albopictus so this is the distribution
of of this mosquito in the u.s. in the

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:43.940
of of this mosquito in the u.s. in the
 

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.660
of of this mosquito in the u.s. in the
year 2000 so it's continuing to spread

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:46.670
year 2000 so it's continuing to spread
 

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.120
year 2000 so it's continuing to spread
westward we as it we still don't have

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.130
westward we as it we still don't have
 

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.460
westward we as it we still don't have
chikungunya virus in the US but the

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:51.470
chikungunya virus in the US but the
 

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.370
chikungunya virus in the US but the
virus has adopted to be able to grow in

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:54.380
virus has adopted to be able to grow in
 

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.529
virus has adopted to be able to grow in
this mosquito in other places so

01:06:56.529 --> 01:06:56.539
this mosquito in other places so
 

01:06:56.539 --> 01:06:58.779
this mosquito in other places so
previously this virus only was vectored

01:06:58.779 --> 01:06:58.789
previously this virus only was vectored
 

01:06:58.789 --> 01:07:04.680
previously this virus only was vectored
by 80s at gypped I as it spread from

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:04.690
 

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:09.370
Africa to India in Europe the the virus

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:09.380
Africa to India in Europe the the virus
 

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.430
Africa to India in Europe the the virus
underwent a single mutation in the one

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440
underwent a single mutation in the one
 

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.079
underwent a single mutation in the one
of the glycoproteins which allowed it to

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:14.089
of the glycoproteins which allowed it to
 

01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:17.260
of the glycoproteins which allowed it to
now be vectored by ATS albopictus so in

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:17.270
now be vectored by ATS albopictus so in
 

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.029
now be vectored by ATS albopictus so in
Europe it is often vectored by that

01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039
Europe it is often vectored by that
 

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:21.339
Europe it is often vectored by that
mosquito so eventually it might reach

01:07:21.339 --> 01:07:21.349
mosquito so eventually it might reach
 

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:23.620
mosquito so eventually it might reach
the u.s. an example of how the initial

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:23.630
the u.s. an example of how the initial
 

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:26.230
the u.s. an example of how the initial
distribution of the virus was restricted

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240
distribution of the virus was restricted
 

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.470
distribution of the virus was restricted
by the vector Aedes aegypti and now with

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480
by the vector Aedes aegypti and now with
 

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.480
by the vector Aedes aegypti and now with
its expansion into a new vector the

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:31.490
its expansion into a new vector the
 

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:37.240
its expansion into a new vector the
range of the virus is increasing season

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:37.250
range of the virus is increasing season
 

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:41.769
range of the virus is increasing season

part don't know how virus infections are

01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319
part don't know how virus infections are
 

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:25.150
part don't know how virus infections are
regulated by the season but there are

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:25.160
regulated by the season but there are
 

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.590
regulated by the season but there are
some interesting data for influenza

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600
some interesting data for influenza
 

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.229
some interesting data for influenza
virus which I'd like to tell you about

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239
virus which I'd like to tell you about
 

01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:31.660
virus which I'd like to tell you about
and these data were acquired using a

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:31.670
and these data were acquired using a
 

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:35.019
and these data were acquired using a
guinea-pig model of transmission which

01:08:35.019 --> 01:08:35.029
guinea-pig model of transmission which
 

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:36.430
guinea-pig model of transmission which
was actually developed here in New York

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440
was actually developed here in New York
 

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.829
was actually developed here in New York
at Mount Sinai and what you do is you

01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839
at Mount Sinai and what you do is you
 

01:08:38.839 --> 01:08:39.760
at Mount Sinai and what you do is you
put guinea pigs in

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:39.770
put guinea pigs in
 

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.880
put guinea pigs in
racks so you have one rack here you have

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:42.890
racks so you have one rack here you have
 

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.010
racks so you have one rack here you have
another rack next to it and you have a

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.020
another rack next to it and you have a
 

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.500
another rack next to it and you have a
fan blowing air across the racks right

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:47.510
fan blowing air across the racks right
 

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.390
fan blowing air across the racks right
and you infect the guinea pigs in this

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400
and you infect the guinea pigs in this
 

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.920
and you infect the guinea pigs in this
rack and then you look at the

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:50.930
rack and then you look at the
 

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.140
rack and then you look at the
transmission to the second rack and then

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:53.150
transmission to the second rack and then
 

01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:55.720
transmission to the second rack and then
the transmits very effectively and what

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:55.730
the transmits very effectively and what
 

01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:57.010
the transmits very effectively and what
they did in these experiments was to

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:57.020
they did in these experiments was to
 

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.240
they did in these experiments was to
regulate the temperature and the

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:58.250
regulate the temperature and the
 

01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:59.950
regulate the temperature and the
humidity which of course may be part of

01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960
humidity which of course may be part of
 

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960
humidity which of course may be part of
the seasonality of infections the

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:01.970
the seasonality of infections the
 

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.220
the seasonality of infections the
differences in temperature and humidity

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:03.230
differences in temperature and humidity
 

01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:05.800
differences in temperature and humidity
and what they found was that low

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:05.810
and what they found was that low
 

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.150
and what they found was that low
relative humidities were the most

01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:07.160
relative humidities were the most
 

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.640
relative humidities were the most
efficient for the most favorable for

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:09.650
efficient for the most favorable for
 

01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:12.160
efficient for the most favorable for
transmission of influenza viruses among

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:12.170
transmission of influenza viruses among
 

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:15.430
transmission of influenza viruses among
these guinea pigs if you go up to 80%

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440
these guinea pigs if you go up to 80%
 

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.890
these guinea pigs if you go up to 80%
humidity you don't get transmission

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:17.900
humidity you don't get transmission
 

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.019
humidity you don't get transmission
among the guinea pigs so here in the

01:09:20.019 --> 01:09:20.029
among the guinea pigs so here in the
 

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.900
among the guinea pigs so here in the
winter when flu is most prevalent we

01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:22.910
winter when flu is most prevalent we
 

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:26.140
winter when flu is most prevalent we
have low humidity it's dry and you never

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.150
have low humidity it's dry and you never
 

01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.450
have low humidity it's dry and you never
reach 80% humidity here so this could in

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:28.460
reach 80% humidity here so this could in
 

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:31.150
reach 80% humidity here so this could in
fact explain why in temperate climates

01:09:31.150 --> 01:09:31.160
fact explain why in temperate climates
 

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.329
fact explain why in temperate climates
like ours there is a prevalence for flu

01:09:34.329 --> 01:09:34.339
like ours there is a prevalence for flu
 

01:09:34.339 --> 01:09:36.490
like ours there is a prevalence for flu
in the wintertime I also found that

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:36.500
in the wintertime I also found that
 

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.019
in the wintertime I also found that
transmission in this model was more

01:09:38.019 --> 01:09:38.029
transmission in this model was more
 

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:39.820
transmission in this model was more
frequent at lower temperatures five

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:39.830
frequent at lower temperatures five
 

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.620
frequent at lower temperatures five
degrees rather than twenty and of course

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:41.630
degrees rather than twenty and of course
 

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.140
degrees rather than twenty and of course
it's cold and dry here in the humid and

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:44.150
it's cold and dry here in the humid and
 

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.930
it's cold and dry here in the humid and
at 30 degrees which is quite warm this

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:46.940
at 30 degrees which is quite warm this
 

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.700
at 30 degrees which is quite warm this
is their centigrade there's no

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:48.710
is their centigrade there's no
 

01:09:48.710 --> 01:10:04.900
is their centigrade there's no
transmission at all yeah

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:04.910
 

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:08.030
well here it's probably because the

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040
well here it's probably because the
 

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.400
well here it's probably because the
virus as it's going through the air it's

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:10.410
virus as it's going through the air it's
 

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.290
virus as it's going through the air it's
being desiccated at the high temperature

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300
being desiccated at the high temperature
 

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.690
being desiccated at the high temperature
whereas in the animal even though it's a

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:14.700
whereas in the animal even though it's a
 

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:20.390
whereas in the animal even though it's a
higher temperatures kept hydrated okay

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400
higher temperatures kept hydrated okay
 

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.000
higher temperatures kept hydrated okay
so that's a good hypothesis but there

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:23.010
so that's a good hypothesis but there
 

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.680
so that's a good hypothesis but there
are some confounding factors that I want

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:24.690
are some confounding factors that I want
 

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:26.350
are some confounding factors that I want
to leave you with just to show you that

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360
to leave you with just to show you that
 

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.729
to leave you with just to show you that
just because the study tells you one

01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739
just because the study tells you one
 

01:10:28.739 --> 01:10:30.050
just because the study tells you one
thing in guinea pigs it doesn't

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:30.060

be seasonal if low humidity and low
 

01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.979
be seasonal if low humidity and low
temperature control the seasonality that

it looks like low temperature and
 

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:21.130
it looks like low temperature and
humidity might explain some of the

not all of it for sure
